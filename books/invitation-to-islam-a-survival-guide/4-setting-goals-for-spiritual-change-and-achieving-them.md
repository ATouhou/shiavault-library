Setting Goals for Spiritual Change and Achieving Them
=====================================================

***“Mankind was one single nation, and Allah sent Messengers with glad
tidings and warnings; and with them He sent the Book in truth, to judge
between people in matters wherein they differed; but the People of the
Book after the clear Signs came to them, did not differ among
themselves, except through selfish contumacy. Allah by His Grace guided
the Believers to the Truth, concerning that wherein they differed. For
Allah guides whom He will to a path that is straight.”*** **The Qur’an,
Al Baqara 2:213.**

Once we have established the spiritual profile, we are ready to set a
goal and form a strategy for attaining it. Each person will have to
decide for him or herself what the proper goal is. It is perhaps not
enough to decide that the goal is Islam. Islam ought to be clearly
defined. I shall offer one such brief description here, but it is
possible to take another from someone with better qualifications for
defining Islam. I define Islam as follows: Islam is that body of belief
and practice which logically follows the act of reason which takes place
upon hearing the proclamation that there is no god but God. There are
several implications of this definition.

First of all, it emphasizes that Islam is fundamentally a reasoned
response, rather than an emotional one. Secondly, it presumes that all
of Islam can be reasonably deduced from one basic proclamation: There is
no god but God. Thirdly, seeing the matter from the negative view, any
other approach than a logical and reasonable one is by definition not
Islamic, and any source of belief or practice other than the
proclamation that there is no god but God is also by definition not
Islamic. In sum, the final answer for any question of why this or that
belief or practice should be believed or practiced is the unicity of
God. Any other reason for believing or practicing such things is
non-Islamic.

These premises will exclude a good many missionary practices found among
Christians and Muslims. This matter should be understood clearly,
because such practices have been widely used without thinking about
their foundations. Let us take two examples, a Christian one and a
so-called Muslim one. A feature of Christian missionary work is to
invite people to meetings where nearly all of the activities appeal to
the emotions. There is emotional, indeed, sensual music to begin with.
This creates a frame of mind open to accepting matters for their
emotional appeal rather than their cognitive content. Then there are
sermons which appeal to emotions. In older, traditional approaches there
is an emotional appeal to guilt, a feeling of having sinned. In modern
approaches there is always an appeal to love, often with the additional
note that God loves us even though we do not deserve it.

Finally, there is the emotional appeal that Jesus suffered a cruel death
on the cross for me and you personally, because he loved us so much.
This act is supposed to make everything right, and to accept this is
faith. There is rarely a reasoned explanation of why such a death is
supposed to be necessary or how such a death can set things right, but
even when there is such an explanation, the reasons put forth are nearly
always allegorical rather than logical. Muslims who become Christians
are always caught by emotions.

The second example is that of a modern Muslim approach. It is to make
use of science in a special way. In brief, passages from the Bible are
taken to show that the Bible is inconsistent with scientific fact, while
other passages from the Qur’an are taken to show that the Qur’an
expresses scientific truths that were unknown at the time of its
writing. The conclusion to be drawn is that the Qur’an is superior to
the Bible, and therefore Islam is superior to Christianity and shows
evidence of divine origin. It must therefore be accepted. What is good
about this approach is that it uses reason. What is bad about it is that
the reasoning is false.

First of all, Christians do the same thing to show that the Bible is
true and the Qur’an is false. Secondly, the fact that scientific truths
are expressed in the Qur’an, even though they were unknown at the time
of writing, only implies supernatural intervention. The evangelical
Christian will take this as evidence that the Qur’an was inspired by
Satan (istaghfiru Allah). Thirdly, the appeal assumes that scientific
truth is a criterion for judging the validity of the Qur’an. This is the
area of false reasoning. First of all, scientific truth is not absolute,
but is constantly under review. What is true today is shown tomorrow to
be false. The result of this type of Qur’anic interpretation will
inevitably be the need to revise.

This whole process has been taken over from a Western point of view, and
is the very reason why Christianity got into trouble with science in the
first place. By accepting the Copernican theory of the universe to be
reflected in the Bible, the Church was forced to deny scientific
evidence for a later revision. This caused a conflict between religion
and science which has not been completely healed to the present day.
Islam has generally been associated with an enlightened, scientific
approach, and thus has not naturally fallen into this trap. But
well-meaning people who wish to appear to young people who have been
trained in universities teaching Western-developed science have engaged
in this dangerous exercise.

The result may be a temporary attraction to Islam, but the results in
the long run can only do to Islam what was done to the detriment of
Christianity in the Middle Ages. Scientific evidence is not a criterion
for judging the validity of the Qur’an. There can be no firm basis for
Islamic faith but the one already given: there is no god but God. Any
other basis, even a seemingly thoroughly scientific one, is false to
Islam.

It is my opinion that the basic goal must be to establish tawheed, the
unicity of God, on the basis of reason. Notice that the proclamation
does not state that God exists. It states that there is no other god but
God. The existence of God is an unending philosophical problem. The
shahadat by-passes this difficulty. It presents a binary equation, a
negative and a positive, a working hypothesis. Rather than asking
whether God exists, we begin by stating All and Nothingness. The logical
implication is what we can call reality as an exclusive unicity. This is
philosophically much easier to maintain than the existence of God.

The next step in logic is to note that an exclusive, unified reality
cannot be defined in parts. First of all, parts imply limitations or
borders. But the reality of our working hypothesis is limited only by
Nothingness. Secondly, parts imply internal limitations, which again is
inconsistent with a unicity. There are no parts.

The next implication of this exclusive unicity is sovereignty.
Considering that no parts can be defined, this sovereignty must be
impartial rather than partial. Therefore, it is perfectly just, rather
than arbitrary. Notice how an emotional response to the concept of
sovereignty will lead us to conclude arbitrariness as evidence of
sovereignty itself. As we relate emotionally to the events around us, we
will be drawn to classify them as pleasurable or painful, and from this
draw the inference that some events are good and others bad. Beginning
with the idea that God is sovereign, we will conclude that since He is
sovereign over both good and bad, He is therefore arbitrary. We shall
see this as a crowning evidence of sovereignty, and being blinded by our
emotions, fail to realize that the argument is inconsistent with the
fact that there are no parts and there is therefore no impartiality.

Having established that unicity inevitably implies justice, we are faced
with the question of whether or not human beings can know justice. It
would be not only illogical but an insanity to claim that human capacity
can attain justice. No matter how much knowledge we have as humans, we
can never come to the point that we are absolutely certain that we
possess all knowledge relevant to a particular matter. A reasoned
evaluation of human experience can come to only one conclusion: human
beings are incapable of coming to a knowledge of what is right and
wrong.

We are capable of coming to the conclusion of reality as a unicity and
the implication of impartiality or justice, but we do not have the
capacity, if only because of the possible limitations on knowledge, of
determining what is right and what is wrong. Why then do we propose to
know what is right and wrong, even though it is clear that this is a
human impossibility? There are many reasons, all arising from our
psychological, social, and physical conditions. We experience the need
to know what is right and wrong and at the same time the incapacity of
doing so.

There are various ways of reacting to this situation. Having despaired
of a coherent understanding of reality, some come to the conclusion that
there is no right nor wrong. The best possible society in that case is
the society in which the greatest number of people can experience the
greatest amount of pleasure at the least possible expense of pain to
others. The individual process involves the egotistical approach to get
all pleasure for oneself at the expense of all others, that is, to
become a despot over the rest of oppressed humanity.

As many individuals strive toward that goal, they compress into a
conformist, honey-comb society, forming an elite. To the extent
necessary to preserve their position, they will alleviate the pain of
those who are excluded from the elite. This is basically what we see
around us. All of the liberal views of human rights, sharing of
resources, and environmental concerns are fundamentally the products of
this viewpoint, that there is no coherent reality and consequently no
right nor wrong. It goes without saying that economic, political and
social competitiveness are the result of the same outlook.

Taken from a logical perspective, the implication of justice in reality
must come to the conclusion that human beings may, despite their
inherent incapacity to determine right and wrong, still come to know
right from wrong. The process of coming to know right from wrong in this
view is what we call revelation. It is logically deduced in principle
from justice and consequently from unicity. We find the process of
revelation in two categories, which are not necessarily mutually
exclusive. The first is revelation through verbally expressible means,
which we call prophecy. The second is application of that verbal
revelation by extra-verbal means in particular situations, which we call
divine guidance. The final step of logic is that knowing through
revelation what is right and wrong, human beings are accountable for
what they do, whether right or wrong. We call this the day of judgment.

We noted in the last lecture that “the establishment of a spiritual
profile is a dynamic process involving the individual in several types
of influencing circumstances. Religious authorities, social and
religious peers, and individual characteristics integrate in an
individual’s experience to produce and reinforce a religious identity, a
belief system, and a pattern of behavior.” This is also true of the
changing or re-establishment of a spiritual profile.

Despite the logical sequence that we have just established, the true
factors which come into play are other ones. They are not necessarily
logical, and yet they generally play the most important roles in the
lives of all of us. The particular challenge in both one’s own life and
in relationship to others is how to relate the rational necessity of
Islam with the sociological and psychological realities with which we
live. How can we escape the unnoticed determinants and function in terms
of that rational necessity?

This question is a practical one as much as a philosophical one. This is
where rational thought and practical existence intersect. The answer
implicit in this study at this point in that one should make a conscious
decision to believe and practice only what can be seen to derive from
tawheed, or the unicity of God. This answer lies as the end of a
philosophical treatment of the matter and at the head of a practical
one.

The facile response is that Islamic practice reinforces the experiential
awareness of tawheed. As such it in practice and reality does replace
the determining influences about us, both the positive ones and the
negative ones. It reinforces right-mindedness by going over the positive
influences, such as the verdicts of a mujtaheed or Islamic scholar, the
opinions of Muslim peers, the pressures of Muslim family members, and
the weight of a personal psychology already formed to conform to Islamic
life. It counteracts negative influences, such as the contact with
people of other faiths or non-faiths who express non-Islamic ideas and
behave in non-Islamic ways.

This being true, it is possible to suggest that Islamic acts are in
themselves rich tools for propagation. Contact with a non-Muslim may
give the opportunity of introducing him or her into specifically Islamic
acts. While forming a close relationship with such a person, it is
possible to invite such a one to share in an Islamic meal (at which time
the concept of halal can be introduced, the avoidance of alcoholic
beverages, etc.), to share in the experience of fasting during Ramadhan,
and eventually to share in the experience of prayer in prostration.
Christian propagation often works through friendship, and this can be
turned in favor of Islam. Christians are advised to penetrate Muslim
societies in order to bring their faith to Muslims, but in so doing,
they become susceptible to Islamic spirituality.

The same method can be turned on secularized people as well, or on those
of other religious traditions. The primary vehicle of propagation at
this point is the Islamic act itself rather than discussion and
argumentation. In many cases the first difficulty to be overcome is fear
of Islam, and the proximity of an Islamic act can raise the heart-rate
and the galvanic skin response of a non-Muslim. Exposure to Islamic acts
in contexts of no violence is the best form of da’wa or invitation to
Islam. This can be enhanced by participating in neutral activities in
such a way that with growing familiarity the fear of Islam will decline
and the influence of the Islamic actions will grow.

If at all possible, it is better to get people to read literature than
to engage in arguments. The problem is that most Islamic literature, for
various reasons, does not appeal to a Western audience. Part of the
reason for this is that Islam generally appeals to reason, whereas
Westerners relate best to advertizement, especially advertizement which
leaves them unaware of the fact that they are making decisions. But part
of the reason is also failure to evaluate the spiritual type of one’s
audience and take this into account in writing.

Perhaps one of the best ways of reaching some people is through a
challenge to read a translation of the Qur’an from beginning to end. It
is my experience that those who oppose the Qur’an have never actually
read it. They have only searched through portions of it, looking for
specific things. An actual reading of the Qur’an from beginning to end
is an impressive experience. This is not limited to the cultivated and
educated. There are uneducated people who have embraced Islam after
reading even poor and biased translations of the Qur’an.

In the way of literature, the Bible is a largely untapped source.
Without denying the allegations of scholars that the Bible is corrupted
in a number of ways, it can still be used effectively in support of
Islam. It supports Islam far better than it supports any of the various
forms of Christianity, and Christians are forced to use it in support of
their own faith. Muslims are in a far better position. The Bible is
effective with people of all kinds. Nearly everyone believes that the
Bible supports Christianity. Those who have left the practice of
Christianity are often stimulated to a reawakened interest in the Bible
when they realize that the Bible actually supports Islam instead.
According to the Qur’an, one of the major uses of the Bible is in
witness to the validity of the Qur’an. A Muslim must only take care not
to give the impression that Islamic law is based on the Bible text,
since no school of Islamic jurisprudence uses the Bible in that way.

Many people are more susceptible to brief articles than to books. It is
therefore necessary to provide answers to their questions with these,
despite the fact that many of them are deficient.

The more rational Islamic approach often causes difficulty in discussing
issues with others. The normal situation is that a Muslim will bring
forward a matter armed with a reason. The response will be an irrational
denial or a sentence that turns on a completely different issue. The
best way of dealing with this is to repeat the rational argument, and
then leave the matter. One can always let the other have the last word.
For some time the Christian will feel that he or she is getting the best
of the argument in that way, and this will result in a situation in
which he or she might be drawn into accepting rational thinking. For the
most part Christians rely on repetition of a statement rather that
rational argument. Constant repetition of a false statement wears down
the hearer to the point that eventually he will accept it, even without
supporting rational arguments. This is the major Christian means of
communication. The same weapon can be turned on the Christian, and in a
Muslim’s mouth may be even more effective, since it has reason to
reinforce it.

In dealing with non-Muslims, Christian or otherwise, one has to be aware
of their use of illicit devices. Attempts at mental manipulation are
almost universal. Christian music often contains subliminal messages
which by-pass the conscious mental processes and influence
decision-making. This is in addition to the highly charged emotionalism
and even sensualism in their music. In recent years Christians have
begun dealing in neuro-linguistic programming, which is a form of
hypnosis by which people attempt to control others. This can be
identified generally by the practice of imitating gestures of the person
they are trying to control, by their repetition of phrases taken from
the person’s speech, and by their introduction into the conversation of
irrational, unrelated topics and stories without a point.

It is good to begin a contact by showing an interest in the beliefs of
the person in question. People are generally more interested in
answering questions about their own beliefs than they are in hearing
about yours. Of course it is not always possible to ask such questions,
and many people, especially those largely disconnected from the
traditional religions, consider their spiritual life to be a private
matter. That possibility must always be taken into consideration. But
showing at least an openness to such matters is often a good way to
start, and it is actually necessary in order to make an evaluation of
that person’s spiritual type.

Most people in Europe have a Christian background, with the exception of
certain parts of some large cities, where other traditions are better
represented. But among all of these, only a small percentage practice
traditional religions. All of them, however, are interested in some form
of spirituality, although they may not call it by that name. Once that
interest is identified, it provides a point of contact at which the
Islamic message can penetrate.

At this point, we can make a summary of goals and means of achieving
them. The goal is to change the spirituality of an individual toward
Islam, which is defined as a system of belief and practice derived from
a rational understanding of tawheed, or the unicity of God. The means of
doing so is first of all to use reason in the form of literature and
discussion to over-ride the negative social and religious influences to
which the person may be susceptible. The second means of doing so is to
make Islamic acts prominent and to get non-Muslims to be as closely as
possible associated with them to the point first of losing their fear,
and then through familiarity to find in them the source of an awareness
of the unicity of God.

These two approaches correspond in type to the two forms of revelation,
prophecy (or verbal revelation) and divine guidance (active
application). What we are actually suggesting here as a form of da’wa or
invitation to Islam is that the Muslim take on in a small sense the role
of prophet and divine guide toward those to whom da’wa is being
extended. The purpose of da’wa is to get the message of revelation
across. God Himself chose for that prophecy and divine guidance. We can
do no better than to apply the same principles.

Task Checklist of Goals
-----------------------

The following checklist should be filled out for each person. On the
left side there is a list of basic Islamic beliefs and practices. There
is room for additional ones at the bottom. Each practice should be
evaluated for the beginning level of acceptance (1=rejects completely;
2=doubts; 3=does not consider important; 4=considers valid for some
people; 5=believes but does not practice; 6=believes and practices).
Work should be done for each point separately, giving the date when you
began to present the matter and the date when each point was accepted.
In the column of notes on progress, reevaluation can be made
periodically using the scale of 1-6, to document change.
