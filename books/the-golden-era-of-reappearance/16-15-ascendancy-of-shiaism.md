15.  Ascendancy of Shiaism
==========================

• During the reign of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.), the truth and reality of
Shiaism will be manifested for everybody. Therefore, the practice of
dissimulation (taqayyah) will come to an end.[^1]

• Imam az-Zamaan (a.t.f.s.) will invite all the people towards the Holy
Quran, the Sunnah the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.), the mastership of
Ali Ibn Abi Taalib (a.s.) and hatred against his enemies.[^2]

• After the reappearance of Imam az-Zamaan (a.t.f.s.), Shiaism will
gradually pervade the entire universe and the legal and official
religion of the universal government will be Shiaism.[^3]

• During the government of the Ahlul Bayt (a.s.), all the people will
pay allegiance for the love of the Ahlul Bayt (a.s.).[^4]
