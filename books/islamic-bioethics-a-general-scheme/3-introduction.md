Introduction
============

In Islam, life is sacred and one of the greatest gifts and blessings of
God. Every moment of life has great value and is irreversible.
Therefore, it must be appreciated and protected; even if it has a poor
quality. The guiding principle in the Islamic bioethics is:

***"Whoever slays a soul, unless it is for manslaughter or for mischief
in the land, it is as though he slew all men; and whoever keeps it
alive, it is as though he kept alive all men "*** [^1]

According to this verse, saving life is an obligation and the
unwarranted taking of life is a major crime. In what follows, we will
try to explore more the value of life in Islam and then see how life is
safeguarded in the Islamic law and ethics.

[^1]: Quâ€™ran: 5: 32
