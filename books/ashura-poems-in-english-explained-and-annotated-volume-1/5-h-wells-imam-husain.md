H. Wells : Imam Husain
======================

Pitched upon the scorching desert,
The tent of Husain lay,
Encompassed round with Satan's hounds
Upon that black sad day.
They numbered less than eighty strong,
Women and children too,
While Yazid's thousands stood around,
Awaiting the fiend's might.
Driven away from the cooling stream,
His children waiting for water.
Awaiting with patience extremely sublime
Like sheep for the butcher's slaughter.
Oh! How valiantly fought that pitiful few,
Against Yazid's wild murderers,
Fought with a courage unequalled in Time
Fought with a fierceness that was surely Divine.
The earth quaked and trembled as noon drew near.
But still the survivors knew no fear
But fewer grew that pitiful band,
For Islam, God, and Husain they stand.
At last, all were dead, the devil had won,
Blood red sank down the merciless sun,
Trampled and torn lay the gallant Husain,


For Islam, God, and the faithful were slain.\*

**Tabish Khair : Poem from Outside a Muharram Procession**


The clash of arms, the clasp of armour
(Ya Hassan, Ya Hussain):
This is not sorrow, this is something else.
This is defeat
That's more than victory, this is
The past that's passed by father to son
As a trinket heirloom without price,
This is the inheritance of pain.
There they whirl, bleeding, bleeding
(Ya Hassan, Ya Hussain)
From wounds inflicted on other bodies
And in another century.
This is not war, this is women wailing
After the battle is over, after
The head is severed, mitred on a lance.
This is the knowledge of death
Passed on from mother to daughter
(Ya Hassan, Ya Hussain).
This is not religion, this
Is the exchange of unwrapped


Presents. This is a young boy feeling
With his father's heart, this is
A pony-tailed girl speaking
With the voice of her mother.
This is not anger, not even passion:
(Ya Hassan, Ya Hussain)
This is dancing with the wound of time.
This is my studied failure to feel.\*

\* Khair, Where Parallel Lines Meet, pp. 9-10.
L. 2. ?Ya", an Arabic vocative or attention-getter, almost
equivalent to English O, Oh, or Lo. Imam al- Hassan, here
mentioned as Hassan, was Imam al- Hussain's elder brother.

**Anonymous : On the Morn of Muharram**


Wake up my friends; for the morn of
Qiama has arrived
It is the month of Muharram
The crescent of grief has appeared
The month of mourning has arrived
Muharram is the month of tears
Muharram is the month of blood
Bodies are shredded
And the desert is a garden of blood
The crescent of grief has appeared
The month of mourning has arrived
The creation is sad and in mourning
It is the month:
When Husain was martyred
When the eyes of 'Ali shed blood
The crescent of grief has appeared
The month of mourning has arrived
Husain sacrificed for thee path of Islam
His head is on the spear
His body is on the ground
The crescent of grief has appeared
The month of mourning has arrived
The arms of 'Abbas were cut in this month
The three-edged arrow settled in the
parched throat of little Asghar


The crescent of grief has appeared
The month of mourning has arrived
Zainab will hug the dust of thee dungeon
in this month
Thee innocent face of Sakina will be
Bruised in this month
The crescent of grief has appeared
The month of mourning has arrived.\*

**Farah Yeganeh : A Shaped Elegy for Karbala**


Where do you reside now?
Where you reside?
Where you?
Where?
Where have the rainbows perished to?5
Where rainbows perished?
Where rainbows?
Where?
Why does the city look so dark?
Why city dark?10
Why dark?
Why?
I've lost the orange and the violet of the rainbow.
Orange and violet of rainbow.
Lost rainbow.
Lost. What should be done with the silent confusion?
What with silent confusion?
With silent confusion?
What?20
I used to stand under the big tall tree.
Stand under big tall tree.
Stand under tree.
Stand.
And wonder at the magic of the colors.25
Wonder at magic of colors.
Magic of colors.
46

Magic.
What have they done to the echoes?
What done to echoes?30
What to echoes?
What?
Have they eventually dissolved in nothingness? Eventually
dissolved in nothingness?
Dissolved in nothingness?35
Nothingness?\*
