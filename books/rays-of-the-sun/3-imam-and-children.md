I want to kiss your forehead
----------------------------

* *  
 During the days when Imam would go to the Madressa Alavi, people would
come to meet him in groups (men in the morning and women in the
afternoon).  There would often be a lot of crowding and usually a number
of people would become unwell and would need to be taken to the hospital
by ambulance.  
    
 Once, I was in the presence of Imam in the midst of this crowding.  
Imam’s eyes fell on a boy of 10 years who appeared to be in danger.  He
was also crying and struggling to move forward.  
    
 In that very situation, Imam indicated for the child to be brought
forward.  The child was brought to the Imam. He was drenched in sweat
and was crying out of delight.  When Imam showed him love, he said to
the Imam: “I want to kiss your face.”  Imam brought his face down and he
kissed a cheek.  He then said: “I want to kiss that side too.”  Imam
gave him permission.  He lastly requested: “I also want to kiss your
forehead.”  Imam again humbly bent forward and he kissed the blessed
forehead of the Imam.[^1]

Utmost respect for children
---------------------------

* *  
 Imam really liked young children.  He had such an attachment to them
that he said:  
    
 “In Najaf, when we would return from the shrine, I used to like the
children very much despite their rough appearance.”  The children would
follow the Imam until he reached home.   
    
 Imam used to tell my daughter who used to complain about the
mischievousness of her child: “I am ready to exchange the reward that
you get by bearing the mischievousness of Husayn, with the reward of my
worship.”  He believed that children should be free until they became
older, and then limits should be set for them.  
    
 On the subject of raising children, he used to say:  “Be truthful with
your children so that they too are truthful.  The role-models of
children are their fathers and mothers. If you behave correctly with
your children, they will be brought up correctly.  Whatever you tell
your children, act on that.”[^2]
