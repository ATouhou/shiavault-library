Serving the Imam of the Age
===========================

Imam Sadiq (a.s.) was asked: ‘Has the Qaem been born?’ Imam (a.s.)
replied:

*“No. If I were to meet him I would serve him all my life.*”[^1]

Ayatullah Sayyed Muhammad Taqi Musawi Esfahani says: This tradition
signifies that serving the Imam (a.t.f.s.) is the highest form of
worship and the most beloved form of obedience. This is because Imam
Sadiq (a.s.) who has spent his noble life only on the path of divine
worship and obedience says that if he met the Qaem, he would serve him
all his life. Thus, it becomes clear that striving to serve the Qaem is
the highest form of obedience and the noblest way of gaining proximity
to Allah as Imam Sadiq (a.s.) has preferred this to all other forms of
worships and obedience.[^2]
