Fatima’s groan:
===============

The history has recorded her name as one of the fives who cried a lot:
Adam, Noah, Jacob, Yahya (John) and Fatima (peace be upon her). But the
mystery of Fatima’s crying has been less asked, and it has been less
analyzed that why she cried so much despite her soul grandeur?

Was Fatima’s crying for poverty or usurpation of her property, having no
luxury and no beautiful or expensive dress? Certainly not?

She cried due to the fact that Ali’s right and as a result, the Islamic
right had been neglected. Also, she was dissatisfied with the past, i.e.
ignorance era, and did not want it to be repeated. She cried because she
saw the humanity going towards diversion, found the oppressed in pains,
and the oppressors in comfort and superiority….

But why she applied the weapon of crying was because crying aroused
emotions, attracted the minds and thoughts toward itself, forced some
people to search about why she cried, and found out the truth through
this way.

It is believed that if Fatima (peace be upon her) lived in the world
today, she would cry of all these colors, and aimlessness and shed tears
over all these hypocrisy, insincerity, as well as the strangeness
(loneliness) of Islam. Besides, she will be sorrowful if she perceives
that some of the so-called Muslims follow the wrong models.
