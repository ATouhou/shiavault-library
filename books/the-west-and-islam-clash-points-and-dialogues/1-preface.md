[Preface]
=========

Some people tend to view Islam as if it were a monolithic or
one-dimensional entity. Islam is undoubtedly the faith of transcendental
monotheism, the belief in Allah, (the one and only God), who transcends
both man and nature. But monotheism does not lead to monism; on the
contrary, it leads to plurality and diversity. For from a strictly
Islamic point of view, except for God, everything else exists in
variety. Therefore, there is not one single Islamic discourse, but
rather a variety of discourses that manifest the various endeavors
(*ijtihad* ) of the Muslims, within a specific time and place, to
understand the world around them and to interpret the Quran.
