38. The view of Narrators about the issue of the Imamâ€™s disappearance
=====================================================================

The writer says that the first time the term Ghaybat (absence or
disappearance) was introduced, it was in the book by the name of
Kamaluddin. He says that it is likely that Kulaini too might have
explained such a thing earlier.

First fact is regularly being ignored time and again, forgotten by the
writer that the sense and the meaning of Ghaybat was already a known
fact, as it was in the traditions and the narration that have hailed
immediately from the Prophet (S) and the Imams. So, the occurrence of
such an event Ghaybat was an event not a surprise.

The awareness of the people towards this fact is older than the book
Kamaluddin of Saduq and the book Kafi of Kulaini. They did not invent it
but mentioned the traditions about it. If anyone were to give an
explanation of the Ghaybat it could have been the same about Saduq and
Kafi have told in their books.

Besides, those who have survived both the periods of the Ghaybat
(absence or occultation) have told the same thing and have narrated
their experience. What was foretold, is narrated; and what was foretold
took place.
