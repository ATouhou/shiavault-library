Preface
=======

When the Holy Imams of the Ahl al-Bayt (â€˜a) started building a virtuous
community inside Muslim society, they first set up a group of strong,
compact bases and foundations to establish it. These bases and
foundations were derived from the message of Islam, the seal of all
divine religions, to express an accurate concept of this message and
achieve the previously mentioned goals and characteristics.

The characteristics of these bases and foundations are universality,
genuineness, accuracy, and confidence. They are thus a mixture of
dimensions and aspects possessing adequate cohesiveness to enable the
virtuous community to undertake its historical role in maintaining and
defending Islam and the Muslim nation on the one hand, and being
excellent exemplars for human society throughout history on the other.

These bases and foundations correspond to the doctrinal, moral,
cultural, and mental aspects as well as the common facets of policy.
Thus, I have divided this book into five chapters. The superstructure
and the various systems of managing the affairs of the virtuous
community will be discussed in future volumes.

It is worth mentioning that each chapter can serve as an independent,
documentary, historical or analytical field of study.
