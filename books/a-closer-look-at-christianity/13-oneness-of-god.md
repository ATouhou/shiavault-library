Oneness of God
==============

One of the main doctrines in Christianity is the trinity. This idea
comes from I John 5:7***“For there are three that bear record in heaven,
the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.”***
This verse indicates that God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost are one. These
words are John’s words and not Jesus’ words nor God’s, but according to
the Christians John was inspired by God, and that is the reason for
taking his words as the truth. Let us investigate the Bible to see if
God is One and only One, or that He is, or they are three in one.
