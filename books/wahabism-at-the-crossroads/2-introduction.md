Introduction
============

Two types of Wahhabis â€” Extremist and Moderate:

1. Extremist and hard-line Salafis regard all Muslims, apart from
themselves, as infidels (*Kafir*) and polytheists (*Mushrik*), and
consider shedding their blood and wealth as admissible. Obduracy in
thought, ruthlessness in speech and action and contempt for logical and
rational discussions is amongst their most evident characteristics. In
Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and their own homeland, Saudi Arabia, their
brutality has made the world weary of them. Their hideous image of
Islam, as presented to the world, will take years of struggle to undo.
They have, as a result, come close to the end of their existence and
will soon be history.

2. The moderate and enlightened Wahhabis are the people of logic, debate
and dialogue (Hiwar), and respect other scholars and enter into friendly
discussions with other Muslims. They neither order the execution of
someone nor do they consider any Muslim as a polytheist or infidel, nor
consider admissible their wealth and property. They find more supporters
every day. And this is a glorified dawn for the Islamic world, the signs
of which have been witnessed in the recent books published in the Hijaz,
their journals and TV discourses.

This book will give you a detailed account of the above.
