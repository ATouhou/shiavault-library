The End
=======

Al-Husayn bin Numair was full of spite. He whipped his horse and
attacked Habib. Habib faced him. He hit al-Husayn's horse on the face.
So, al-Husayn bin Numair fell over the ground.

Many fighters rushed to save al-Husayn bin Numair. Habib clashed and
fought them bravely.

In spite of his old age, Habib could kill over sixty fighters. When the
fight became strong, a fighter threw a spear at Habib. So, Habib fell
over the ground and became a martyr.

Thus the brave companion's life was over. He spent all his life waging
holy war for Islam.

Al-Husayn bin Numair was not satisfied with killing Habib. He took his
head and tied it to his horse's neck. Then he began roaming through
Yazeed's fighters. He was boasting of his bad action.

Imam Husayn [a] tried to save Habib, but he got there late. So, his eyes
shed tears. He sadly said:

We belong to Allah and we shall come back to Him.

Imam Husayn [a] came back to his camp. He was sad because he lost the
closest and the most loyal companion.
