Social Interactions
===================

Courteous social relations with Allah's creation while avoiding all
acts of disobedience to Him is a sign of Allah's excessive generosity
with His bondsman. Whoever is sincere and humble before Allah in his
innermost being will have good social interaction externally.

Keep company with people for the sake of Allah and do not keep company
merely for your own share of worldly affairs, for seeking rank, showing
off, or for reputation. Do not fall below the limits of the shari'ah for
the sake of social intercourse, such as trying to keep up with others,
or gaining a reputation, for these things cannot make up for you, and
you will miss the next world, with no recourse. Treat someone who is
older than you as you would your father, someone who is younger than you
as you would a son. Treat your peer as you would a brother. Do not
abandon what you know to be certain within yourself for something heard
from other people which you doubt. Be gentle when you enjoin good, and
compassionate when you forbid evil.

Never abandon good counsel in any circumstance. As Allah said,


<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَقُولُواْ لِلنَّاسِ حُسْناً
  </p>
</blockquote>



***Speak to men good words.*** (2:83)


Cut yourself off from what makes you forget to remember Allah, when
temptation distracts you from obedience to Him, for that comes from the
friends and helpers of Satan. Do not allow the sight of them to move you
to dissimulation with the truth, for that would be a terrible loss
indeed. We seek refuge with Almighty Allah.
