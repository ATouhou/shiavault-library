The Neighbour
=============

Maytham was tied to the date palm trunk.

Amru bin Huraith saw him. Amru remembered Maytham's words:

*I'll be your neighbour. Treat me kindly.*

So, Amru bin Huraith ordered one of his daughters to sweep the ground
around the date-palm trunk. He also ordered her to splash it with water.

A person looked at Maytham and said:

*Disown Ali to save your soul!*

Maytham said with a smile:

*By Allah, this date palm has been created for me! And I've been created
for it!*

Thus, people knew the secret of Maytham's visit to the date palm
throughout the long years.
