Allah sent the Prophet at a time when the people were going astray in
perplexity and were moving here and there in mischief. Desires had
deflected them and self-conceit had swerved them. Extreme ignorance had
made them foolish. They were confounded by the unsteadiness of matters
and the evils of ignorance. Then the Prophet - blessing of Allah be upon
him and his descendants - did his best in giving them sincere advice,
himself trod on the right path and called (them) towards wisdom and good
counsel.

  <p>
بَعَثَهُ وَالنَّاسُ ضُلاَّلٌ فِي حَيْرَة، وَحَاطِبُونَ فِي فِتْنَة،
قَدِ اسْتَهْوَتْهُمُ الاْهْوَاءُ، وَاسْتَزَلَّتْهُمُ الْكِبْرِيَاءُ،
وَاسْتَخَفَّتْهُمُ الْجَاهِلِيِّةُ الْجَهْلاَءُ: حَيَارَى فِي زَلْزَال
مَنَ الاْمْرِ، وَبَلاَء مِنَ الْجَهْلِ، فَبَالَغَ (صلى الله عليه وآله)
فِي النَّصِيحَةِ، وَمَضَى عَلَى الطَّرِيقَةِ، وَدَعَا إِلَى
الْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ.
