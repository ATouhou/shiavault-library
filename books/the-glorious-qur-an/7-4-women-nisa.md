4: Women (nisa)
===============

This long chapter contains 176 verses arranged in twenty-four sections
which date from the fourth year that the Prophet spent in Madina, or
625-6 A. D. It was revealed after Examining Her 60 and before The
Earthquake 99, and it deals with women's rights and conditions after the
battle of Uhud 3 / 625. These concern marriage laws (I &IV), and how to
treat women, as the title itself suggests; in fact, the word women"
echoes constantly throughout this chapter.

It also takes up the subject of orphans (I & XIX), especially those
girls left after the battle of Uhud, men's duty in maintaining their own
households (VI), and matrimonial rifts (VI & XIX). Inheritance is also
dealt with (I-II, XXIV. Sexual offenses form a further theme (III), as
does etiquette and politeness (XI). The sin of Association is mentioned
several times (VI. VII &XVIII). Conditions for prayer are stated (VII)
and the problem of performing prayers during warfare when they are
probably most needed, is worked out (XV). Manslaughter and murder come
up in XIII. We are told to obey constituted authority (VIII), and to
strive to please God (X). Lackeys or "yesmen" are described in XX, while
the Jews are mentioned in XXII.
