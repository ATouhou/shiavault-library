The Mushaf of Fatimah (A)
=========================

Some may imagine that Fatimah's (A) \`mushaf' was something like the
masahif of \`A'ishah, Hafsah and other Sahabah, or that it contained
verses not mentioned in the Qur'an handed down by tawatur. Here we may
point out that a large number of traditions have been narrated regarding
Fatimah's mushaf and some of them explicitly mention that this mushaf
contained prophecies of future events and that it did not contain
anything about halal and haram. Other traditions say that it contained
Fatimah al-Zahra's testament (wasiyyah). Accordingly it is possible that
it contained some teachings which she had learnt from her father. Some
other traditions are explicit that Fatimah's mushaf did not contain the
Qur'an and was not a Quranic codex."53

We do not intend here an investigation of the contexts of Fatimah's
mushaf; all that we wish to point out is that her mushaf was not a
musÂ­haf of the Qur'an and therefore what some persons have imagined is
out of question.
