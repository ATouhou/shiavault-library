Pride
=====

   
 The concept of pride embraces all those aspects of vanity found in
those who are proud of their actions, little knowing what their end will
be. Whoever is proud of himself and his actions has strayed off the path
of right guidance and has claimed what is not his.  
    
 Anyone who claims something to which he has no right is a liar, even if
he conceals his claim for a long time. The first thing which happens to
the proud man is that he is stripped of his object of pride, so that he
will know that he is contemptible and incapable, and will testify
against himself; and that will be a firmer proof against him. This was
the case with Iblis.  
    
 Pride is a plant whose seed is disbelief, whose earth is hypocrisy, and
whose water is transgression. Its branches are ignorance, its leaves are
misguidance, and its fruit is being cursed to remain in the Fire
forever. Whoever chooses pride has sowed disbelief and cultivated
hypocrisy. It is inevitable that it must bear its fruit and he will end
up in the Fire.
