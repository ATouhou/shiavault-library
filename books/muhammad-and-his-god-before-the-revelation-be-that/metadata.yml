  This text, written by Dr. Hatem Abu Shahba and translated into English
  by Jerrmein Abu Shahba, sheds the spotlight on the immaculate character
  of the Holy Messenger (SA) and his inclination towards divine proximity
  before the Revelation (Be'that). The reader further realizes and
  appreciates the special secret relationship which Muhammad (SA) enjoyed
  with His beloved God long before his official inauguration as Seal of
  Prophets to deliver the universal message of Islam to all of mankind.
