(13) A Rose Bud Fades Away
==========================

In the dark desolate dungeon, the caravan halted

The scorpions and snakes took fright and bolted

Zaynab and Zainal Abedeen, prostrated themselves in prayer

Without a word of complaint, without any demur.

It was dark inside, despite the sun's bright rays

The stone walls were damp, crumbling with decay

Looks of sorrow and despondency, was on each face

Of joy and laughter, there was not even a trace.

The faces depicted sufferings, beyond human endurance

Prayer was the solace, they enjoyed, without hindrance

A few stale morsels of bread and a little water

Was their daily ration, in these horrible quarters.

"Stone walls do not a prison make nor iron bars a cage,"

Was equally true in that merciless land and cruel age

Though in shackles, every night their spirits soared high

To heights sublime, beyond all plains, in the heavenly sky.

Sakina, woke with a shriek, in the dead of the night

She had seen her father's heavenly soothing light

"O' Sakina, you have suffered enough, come with me

the days of your sufferings are over; O' where is he?"

It was just a dream, what a disappointment!

It was not a reality, to her bewilderment

Her uncontrollable lamentations, gathered a crowd

The ladies also lost control and wailed aloud.

Hearing the wails, Yazid sent slaves to inquire

Pacing up and down, he had not yet retired

On knowing the cause, his crooked mind strived

A devilish scheme, he soon mischievously contrived.

Yazid's men entered with a covered tray,

"I do not want food, please take it away

I want my father; promises he did give

Without taking me, why did he leave?"

They removed the cloth; Sakina beheld the face

Even in death, it was full of heavenly grace

With a cry, she flung herself on the wooden tray

Hugging to her heart, she snatched the face away.

Inconsolably, she bent down over the head

Putting, her cheeks, against that of her dad

Within a few moments, her sobbing had stopped

Her mortal remains, she had quietly dropped.

"How long will you lie on your father's head?"

Zaynab touched her hand; she was shockingly dead

Sakina had gone with her father, never to return

Husayn had kept his promise, as he had always done!
