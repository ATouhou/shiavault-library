YOU'RE FAR MORE PRECIOUS THAN DIAMONDS AND PEARLS
“If memory serves me correctly, I was wearing a little white tank top
and a

short black skirt. I had been raised Orthodox Muslim, so I had never
before

worn such revealing clothing while in my father’s presence. When we
finally

arrived, the chauffer escorted my younger sister, Laila, and me up to my

father's suite.

As usual, he was hiding behind the door waiting to scare us. We
exchanged

many hugs and kisses as we could possibly give in one day. My father
took a

good look at us. Then he sat me down on his lap and said something that
I

will never forget.

He looked me straight in the eyes and said, “Hana, everything that God

made valuable in the world is covered and hard to get to. Where do you
find

diamonds? Deep down in the ground covered and protected. Where do you

find pearls? Deep down at the bottom of the ocean covered up and
protected in a beautiful shell.

Where do you find gold? Way down in the mine, covered over with layers
and layers of rock.

You’ve got to work hard to get to them.”

He looked at me with serious eyes. “Your body is sacred. You’re far more
precious than diamonds

and pearls, and you should be covered too.”
