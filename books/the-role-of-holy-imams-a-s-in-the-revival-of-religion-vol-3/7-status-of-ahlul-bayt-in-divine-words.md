In the Prophet’s Sunnah
-----------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَمَلَائِكَتَهُ يُصَلُّونَ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ يَا أَيُّهَا
الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا صَلُّوا عَلَيْهِ وَسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيماً
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Surely Allah and His angels bless the Prophet; O you who believe!
Call for divine blessings for him and salute him with a (becoming)
salutation” (Qur'an, 33:56)***

In Tafsir al-Qurtabi as well as in other exegesis of the Holy Quran,
this verse has been explained. Also in Sahih Muslim and other books on
hadith it has been narrated from Abu Masoud Ansari that:

“The Prophet (S) approached us while we were in the company of Sa.’dibn-
Ebadeh. Basheer-ibn-Sa.’d addressed the Prophet; \`Allah has commanded
us to send greetings upon you. Tell us, how one should send greetings
upon you. The Prophet fell silent for such long time that we wished such
a question had not been asked at all. After a while, the Prophet (S)
replied: Say:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد كما صليت على ابراهيم و آل ابراهيم. و بارك
على محمد وآل محمد كما باركت على ابراهيم و آل ابراهيم في العالمين. إنك
حميد مجيد
  </p>
</blockquote>

In salutation too, you may recite what you have just learnt. “[^1]

Tirmidhi in his Sunan writes: “Traditions in this regard have also been
narrated from other companions like Ali, Abu Hamid, Ka.’b-ibn-Ajareh,
Talha-ibn- Ubaidullah, Abu Saeed, Zaid-ibn-Harith and Bareedah. “
Tirmidhi says: \`this hadith is acceptable and correct..’

Moreover, Ibn Hajar Haithami has recorded in Sawa.’eq al-Muharreqa and
Samhoudi Shafa.’ee has related in Jawaher al-Aqdain that the Prophet (S)
said: “Do not send imperfect salutations upon me. “ The people inquired:
‘O the Messenger of Allah! What is an imperfect salutation?

The Prophet (S) said: “That you say:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اللهم صل على محمد
  </p>
</blockquote>

(O Allah send salutations on Muhammad) and conclude. Desist from such a
recitation, rather say:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد
  </p>
</blockquote>

(O Allah sends salutations on Muhammad and his progeny)

Thus, reciting the words (progeny of Muhammad) after sending greetings
and salutations on the Messenger of Allah (S) is one Sunnah, neglected
and forsaken by a section of the Muslims.
