Ramadan: The Name of God
------------------------

Imam Sadiq (A.S.) has said: Say not, "This is Ramadan" and "Ramadan has
departed" and "Ramadan has arrived" for surely, Ramadan is one of the
names of Allah, The Mighty, the Glorious, who neither arrives nor
departs. Surely, arrives and departs that, which is ephemeral, Instead
say: "The month of Ramadan".*Al-Kafi, 4, pg. 70*
