NEW MACHINES AND CHANGE OF CONCEPTS
===================================

New inventions and new machines are actively contributed to the change
of our philosophical concepts, for example the ventilator as mentioned
earlier, helped to continue pumping air to the lungs and keep a person
who is in a coma state breathing regardless of losing consciousness, so
the machine assisted in prolonging life and this process delayed death,
thus our traditional concept of death changed to a new one which is
called “brain death”; with the assumption of not avoiding death but at
last delaying it. The concept of brain death itself is vague and not
agreed upon; the criterion of measuring it varies from an operational
one to a mere reflective, we can mention the irreversibility criterion,
the cognitive, and Harvard criterion as an example.

The list of how machines changed our concepts is long and you can just
reflect on some such as the refrigerator and the concept of ‘freshness’,
the cell phone and the concept of “communication”, the internet and
“virtual reality”etc, this is an interesting topic but it is much wider
than my prefatory remarks in this paper where the focus is philosophical
reflection on ethics and technology.
