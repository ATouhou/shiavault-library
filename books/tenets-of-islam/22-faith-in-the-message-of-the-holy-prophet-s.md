Faith in the Message of the Holy Prophet [s]
============================================

It is obligatory to have faith in all that has been conveyed by the Holy
Prophet and the Imams including what they have said about the
Prophethood of the past Prophets, about the revealed Books, the
existence of the angels, the account of what is going to happen in the
grave, its punishment and its reward, revivification, its horrors,
reckoning, the 'balance', the path, speaking of the limbs and organs,
the existence of the Paradise, the Hell and the Fountain (a reservoir of
nectar in Paradise) from which Imam Ali, Amirul Mu'minin will give water
to the thirsty to drink on the Day of Resurrection, intercession of the
Holy Prophet and the Imams on behalf of those who loved them out of the
perpetrators of grave and deadly sins. The infallible Imams and the Holy
Prophet have told us about all these things.
