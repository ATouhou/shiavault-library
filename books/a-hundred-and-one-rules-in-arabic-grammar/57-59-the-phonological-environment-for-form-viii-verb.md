59. The Phonological Environment for Form VIII Verb
===================================================

Thecharacteristic feature of Form VIII is the reflexive affix
/** ـتـَ** / which is inserted after the first radical of the root. That
/** ـتـَ** / will create the environment for a phonological rule of
assimilation that applies itself if the first radical is a dental stop
or fricative. The result is that the inserted /** ـتـَ** / is
assimilated. Involved here are the following consonants:

<p dir="rtl">
**ت ث د ذ ز ص ض ط ظ**
</p>

Compare the following examples:

(a) a fully pronounced  /** ـتـَ** /
**جَمَعَ     إجتَمَعَ**

(b) a fully assimilated  /** ـتـَ** /                           **زادَ -
إزدادَ    ،  دَعا - إدَّعی**

Luckily, Arabic does not have many verbs of this type. However, you need
to remember the three following related phonological rules:

**(1).** After the emphatic consonants **ص ض ط** the inserted /** ـتـَ**
/ becomes emphatic**ط** , as in **صَدَمَ - إصطدَمَ**

**(2).** After the fricatives **ت ظ** there is a complete assimilation
and the resultant double consonant is written with Shadda, as in**
ظَلـَمَ – إظـَّلـَمَ   **

**(3).** If the first radical of the verb is**(** **و** **)** as
in ** وَصَلَ** , the**(** **و** **)** will be completely assimilated by
the inserted  /** ـتـَ** /, and thus the use of the Shadda would be
required. Consider the following example:

<p dir="rtl">
** وَصَلَ – إتـَّصَلَ**
</p>
