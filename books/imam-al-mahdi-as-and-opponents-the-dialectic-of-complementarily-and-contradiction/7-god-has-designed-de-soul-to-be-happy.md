God Has Designed De Soul To Be Happy
====================================

. God Blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply,
and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the
sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves
upon the earth." (5)

The purpose of human life is an ideal which transcends the mundane
goals of human existence, for it is based upon the vision of God.

The highest and best of human values, truth, love, joy and happiness
are aspirations grounded in the original human nature. The word for
"humankind", Adam, comes from the same root as does "earth" and is a
generic term for the human species; humans, man and female, resemble the
Creator. Humankind was created to share a unique relationship with
God.

"God saw everything that He had made, and indeed, it was very good."
(6)

Adam and Eve, our first parents, were created in the state of
innocence, grace and happiness. They were adorned with the grace of God,
which God communicated to their souls, making them beautiful and truly
holy before him.

"Put on the new man, who according to God, is created in justice and
holiness of truth." (7)

The benefit they received it sanctified them, made them truly holy
before God, it subjected all their senses, appetites, and passions to
reason; it rendered their reason and their whole soul subject to the
will of God.This original righteousness was a free gift of God.

"For God created us for incorruption and made us in the image of his
own eternity." (8)

Being free from all state of sin, and adorned with the original
justice, they were on that account free from all sufferings, and enjoyed
a perfect happiness both in soul and body, suitable to their nature, and
the state they were in. They were endowed with great knowledge of
everything relating to their state and the reset of the creatures; they
were created free from all passions and irregular desires and appetites,
which so violently torment our souls. They enjoyed a perpetual peace and
serenity of mind.

Their hearts were inclined to all good, and their will united to God by
holy love. Their bodies were free of sickness and pain, and enjoyed a
perpetual health, and they were not subject to death.

o God has appointed rewards for good and virtuous acts and punishment
for vice acts.

"The believers will then pass over like the twinkling of an eye, like
lightning, like wind, like a bird, like the finest horses and camels.
Some will escape and be kept safe, some will be lacerated." (9)

Man, however, persuaded by the Fiend, has abused his freedom since the
dawn of the ages, rising up against God and trying to attain his own
purpose without God. While knowing God, he did not glorify Him as God,
but rather, his heart dimmed, and he served the creature instead of the
Creator.

Refusing to acknowledge God as his beginning, he broke the rightful
order with respect to his ultimate purpose, and with it the entire
hierarchy in relation to himself, to other men and to all created
things. Thus is man divided in his interior. Due to this division in
man - whether individual or collective - a dramatic struggle between
good and evil, between light and darkness, appears in the world.

"but through the devils envy death entered the world, and those who
belong to his company experience it." (10)

At the same time, man finds himself helpless and destitute in his
struggle against the attacks of the Fiend; he feels chained to evil. But
God, in His infinite mercy, without abandoning us, sent and continues to
send, beings that come to this world with the purpose of teaching us the
way to our liberation, strengthening us with His presence and imparting
His teachings amongst us for our inner renovation, and helping us cast
out the prince of this world who held man in the slavery of sin.

"Now is the judgement of this world; now the ruler of this world will
be driven out." (11)

Sin diminishes man, impeding him from reaching his fullness, the divine
fullness for which he was created.

Human progress, which is man's great treasure, brings with it the
temptation for individuals and human groups to look out only for their
own interests and not for the interests of others, lacking a coherent
hierarchy of values and mixing good with evil. This is propitiated by
the disease and the consumerism that the highly-industrialized societies
suffer to a greater extent, which promote values that are directly
contradictory to true human fraternity.

"what does it profit them if they gain the whole world, but lose or
forfeit themselves?" (12)

Power resides in having more, in consuming more, in an unbridled
madness that will inevitably lead to the destruction of human beings
themselves, if God does not put a remedy to this before. A hard battle
against the powers of darkness runs throughout the entire history of
man, which - already begun since the origins of the world - will
continue until the last day, as the Lord says.

"But the one who endure to the end will be saved" (13)

Arrogance and an unbridled love of self endanger the activities of man.
Man must - with austerity and freedom of spirit - come into possession
of the things of this earth, like unto one who has nothing and who yet
possesses everything.

Some conception of heaven and hell.

Among the religious of the world is found universally conceptions of
heaven and hell. Are these realms objectively real? The Scriptures are
unanimous in affirming they are.

Heaven and hell in the scriptures of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam
can be interpreted either to describe the state of the soul upon death
or what will be after the future resurrection. Some Koranic passages
describe the opening of Paradise and hell, others refer to de Last
Judgement. Most muslims regard the dead to be sleeping in the grave
awaiting that momentous event.

Do not say, "They are dead" about anyone who is killed for God´s sake.
Rather they living, even though you do not notice it" (14)

The biblical vision of heaven from the book of Revelation are visions
of a future recompense after the tribulations of the Last Judgement.
Those christians who hold a literal interpretation of these verses
concur with their muslim brothers and sisters that the souls of the dead
are asleep in the grave, awaiting the future opening of heaven and
hell.

Another theory of the christian tradition, supported by biblical
descriptions of the Sheol (Job 3,17-19); the heavenly Jerusalem (Hebrews
12,22-24; and the story of Lazarus and the rich man in (Luke 16,19-31),
teaches us that each person immediately after death enter his appointed
place in heaven or hell. The visions in Revelation are often interpreted
in this way.

II.- The believers attributes at "The Time of Appearance".

o Prudence

People! God´s promise is true, so do not let the present life deceive
you. Do not let the Deceiver deceive you about God: "Satan is your
enemy -treat him as an enemy-and invites his followers only to enter the
blazing fire." (15)

During the days of our youth we do not often remember God, nor do we
think of the days to come when we will have to reflect upon our acts.
The strength of youth makes us believe that that vitality will be with
us for always, but this is not the case. Man needs to live prudently,
giving priority to those higher values that bring him closer to God.

Which of these three, do you think, was a neighbor to the man who fell
into the hands of the robbers? He said, " The one who showed him mercy."
Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise." (16)

Being prudent means walking surely on the straight path, knowing that
if we take the winding one, we will get lost; it means not enjoying
trickery played upon others, but living in the exercise of good there
wherever we get the chance to do so. "Honor your father and mother;
also, You shall love your neighbour as yourself." (17)

Being prudent means working honestly to gain our sustenance without
exploiting anyone, without manipulating and using other people for our
profit, because all that we earn at the expense of others will lead us
inevitably to failure and dishonour.

In everything do to others as you would have them do to you; for this
is the law and the prophets. (18)

Being prudent means not judging others. If your mind is busy seeing the
faults of others, it will by itself fall into the same errors that it
sees in others. We see the mote in others' eyes and are incapable of
seeing the beam in ours. Whoever listens to slander is himself a
slanderer. "No one can withhold the blessing God opens up for people,
nor can anyone but Him release whatever He withholds: He is the
Almighty, the All Wise." (19)


**Renunciation and Detachment**

Plenty has been written about renunciation, not so much because it is
hard to understand, but because its practice is truly difficult. The
most important thing about renunciation is that nothing real is lost.
Every renunciation of material things, of indiscriminate consumption, is
an appropriation of that which is renounced on a higher level. It is a
paradox, but the more a person can do without the world, the less the
world can do without that person.

When desires dominate us, we are trapped in illusion and the only way
out is through discernment or reflection. Try to see ourselves as
automatons controlled and manipulated within a prison of unsatisfied
desires. Because in effect, these are not our own desires, but rather,
we are victims of a society that knows our dissatisfactions and
manipulates them, creating one desire after another in a chain of
desires that will produce great economic profits for a few, while it
engulfs us in our own terrible personal and spiritual dissatisfaction.

Whoever loves God does not worry about the vanities of the world,
because he respects himself above all else and respect for oneself
implies scorn for the vanities of the world.

"No one can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and
love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You
cannot serve God and wealth." (20)

The surfeit of desires and cravings is a source of spiritual disease.
It overloads the soul. There are persons who renounce themselves and
their uncontrolled cravings, albeit with reservations, since they do not
place all their confidence in God. In the beginning they offer him
everything, but afterwards, on being besieged by temptation, they return
to their old ways, and this stops them from advancing on the road of
virtue.

There are people who think that God should be given everything He is
owed, provided that He lets them enjoy what is theirs without being
bothered.

Their desire is to maintain their own privileges and imagine themselves
free without having to obey any kind of divine mandate, given over to
their own passions and desires.

"So, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to
spit you out of my mouth." (21)

These are the lukewarm about whom the apostle John spoke in his
Revelations. On one hand, they adore the world and its pleasures, and on
the other they want to live in peace with themselves and with God,
fulfilling one precept or another that adapts to their own needs and
passions.

They practice a social kind of religiosity; they do not know what
charity means and they comply with the minimum religious precepts, those
that are socially well-regarded. Their piety plays to an audience.
