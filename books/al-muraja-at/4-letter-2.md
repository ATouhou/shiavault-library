Letter 2
========

**Thul Qi’da 6, 1329 A.H.**

I Greetings Reciprocated
------------------------

1) Peace of Allah be with Maulana Shaykh al­Islam, His mercy and
blessings.

Your very kind letter has granted me and bestowed upon me so many graces
for which the tongue can hardly thank you enough, nor can it fulfill a
portion of its duty even in a lifetime.

You have placed your hopes on me and brought me your request while you
yourself are the hope of anyone with a quest, the refuge of whoever
seeks refuge. I myself have come to you all the way from Syria in order
to relish your knowledge and seek your favours, and I am sure I will
leave you strong in optimism except if Allah wills otherwise.

II Permission to Debate Granted
-------------------------------

2) You have asked permission to speak up. You have the right to bid and
forbid. Say whatever you will: you have the favour; your judgment is
final, your verdict fair, and peace be with you.

Sincerely,
