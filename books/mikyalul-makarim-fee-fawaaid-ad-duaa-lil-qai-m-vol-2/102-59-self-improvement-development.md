59: Self Improvement (Development)
==================================

The next duty is to get rid of dirty habits and evil traits and to
embellish our personality with good morals. This is obligatory at all
times but it is especially emphasized for the period of Ghaibat because
it is a necessary qualification to entitle one for being included among
his companions. Nomani (r.a.) has recorded a tradition from Imam Sadiq
(as) that says: “One who desires to be included among the companions of
Imam az-Zaman (aj) must be a Montazir (one who awaits), and he should be
pious and of good behavior. So even if he dies before the reappearance
of Imam (as) he would get the same reward as if he had been with the
Imam (as). Strive and await! If you want to be bestowed with Divine
Mercy.”[^1]

I say: In this tradition there is proof that the whole reward of
awaiting can be gained through piety and good manners as we have
previously explained.
