30. The Imam’s Displeasure  
============================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عن أَبِي جَعْفَرٍ (ع) قَالَ: إِنَّ أَبِي نَظَرَ إِلَى رَجُلٍ وَ مَعَهُ
ابْنُهُ يَمْشِي وَ الإِبْنُ مُتَّكِئٌ عَلَى ذِرَاعِ الأََبِ قَالَ
فَمَا كَلَّمَهُ أَبِي (ع) مَقْتاً لَهُ حَتَّى فَارَقَ الدُّنْيَا.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (peace be upon him) relates: “Once my father saw
a person and his son walking together.  As they walked, the son was
leaning against the arm of his father.  (This act of the son was so
abhorrent and infuriating to my father that) he (peace be upon him)
never spoke to him throughout his life.”
