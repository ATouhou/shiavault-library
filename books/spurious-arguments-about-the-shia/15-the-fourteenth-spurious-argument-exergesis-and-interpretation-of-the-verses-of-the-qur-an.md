The Fourteenth Spurious Argument: Exergesis and Interpretation of the Verses of the Qur’an
==========================================================================================

Some people fabricate lies against the Shias claiming that they
interpret the Qur’anic verses not according to what they mean but just
to support their beliefs and to praise their Imams.

The Answer
----------

It is not possible to deny that there are many Qur’anic verses that
either address the merits of Imam Ali alone or that of the rest of the
Prophet’s family members. There are many traditions in Sunni books
interpreting many verses as addressing the merits of Imam Ali and the
rest of the Prophet’s family members. The author of Ihqaqul-Haq has
collected in vol. 3,9, and 14 two hundred and fifty-five such verses,
and after each verse he wrote down the traditions related in the books
of the Sunnis that explains the verse with the page numbers.
