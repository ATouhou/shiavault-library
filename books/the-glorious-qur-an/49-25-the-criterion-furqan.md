25: the Criterion (furqan)
==========================

This rather long chapter of six sections consists of 77 Meccan verses.
and VV. 68- 70 in section vi which date from Madina. It was revealed
after Ya-Sin 36 and before Originator 35. The purpose of its message is
to make associators reflect on the future.

The Standard mentioned refers to man's intellectual faculties and his
power of distinguishing right from wrong. It begins with a statement
directed against those associators who accused Muhammad of copying
others and not being a Prophet in his own right, and likewise against
their objects of worship (I-II). It ends in a long hymn to God's
creation, His power, and the parable of The Two Seas" (V).
