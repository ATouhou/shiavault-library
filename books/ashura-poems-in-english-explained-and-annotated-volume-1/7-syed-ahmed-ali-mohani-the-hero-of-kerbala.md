Syed Ahmed Ali Mohani : the Hero of Kerbala
===========================================

Many, many years ago,
On bloody field of Kerbala,
A noble hero faced his foe,
As champion of God's Faith and Law.
Ov'erhead there was a scorching sun,
There were no shady trees,
Beneath a burning sandy plain,
With no refreshing breeze.
A scion of Hashim's noble line;
Of Heroism a model,
Son of Ali, the Lion of God,
Grandson of God's Apostle.
His comrades few but loyal and brave,
Some young and some advanced in age,
The record of whose actions gave,
To history its brightest page.
Of worldly comforts they had none,
No couch nor rosy bed,
To comfort their afflicted hearts,
The Holy Word of God they read.
Three days they every distress bore,
Deprived of drink and food,
The world does still wonder at,
Their unexampled fortitude.
They fell around him one by one,


Firm in their righteous ways,
And for their loyalty have won,
From friend and foe a world of praise.
His friends with loving grief he eyed,
Lying dead in sun's scorching rays,
To justify his aim he tried,
To deal with foes in peaceful ways.
He brought in arms his baby son,
Asked them to give him water,
Said he, ?The babe no harm has done,
To die of thirst or slaughter.?
Stones they threw and arrows shot,
Obedient to Yazid's behest,
And in their fury spared not,
Ev'n life of baby at the breast!
A little before his enemies were,
For water sorely passed,
Relief he gave them then and there,
And could not see even foes distressed.
He humbly prayed and praised the Lord,
The Giver of Spiritual beauty,
And though midst danger never failed,
To do his sacred duty.
Wickedness can no further go,
Cruelty needs no greater proofs,
His sacred body, after death,
Was trampled under horses' hoofs!
Victory, though mean, they gained, but still,
No bounds knew their ire.
Orphans and widows they captives made,


And set their tents on fire.
The captives saw with choking grief,
And eyes dimmed with tears,
The tragic sight of Martyrs' heads,
Uplifted on spears!\*

**Anonymous : A Journey**


It was peak of the mischief and virtues in chains;
Just laws were sacked with rules insane;
As the tyrants on the rise, and mass confused,
offered lust with lies, and faith abused.
Thus the signs indicated, and time dictated.
Some souls elevated as al-Husain (A.S.) navigated;
a seed of the Prophet (P) and the sight of his Parents(A.S.)
that time in deluge, he was ark so apparent.
In the Name of God, for the sake of Islam;
for the freedom of life and soul of Islam;
gave greatest sacrifice, but not his hands,
with the members of his kin and many of his friends.
Hur, Muslim and the friends those hearts so pure;
they offered their lives as shield and cure;
thus tyrants came forth from the curtain way old;
then peace was bought and lives were sold.


And daring in the manners were the two young brothers;

in the boldness of their moves were the teachings of a mother

59

Shone Aun and Muhammad with the valor known as Haider (A.S.);

Those children were slain not the feeling of the mother.20 With a
message from his father was Qasim bin Hassan (A.S.);


a radiant jewel of Islam was this glowing young son;
but Qasim into pieces with a bride day old;
on the sand in heat it was savage and cold.
Then the pride of the Hashims rode back from the river;
And the tyrants made sure that he did not deliver;
they cut off his arms, but spirit was set;
till an arrow hit the bag, only eyes got wet.

25

Fell Abbas (A.S.) from the horse, with no hands for resort;

then al-Husain (A.S.) rushed to shore for a brother's end resort;30

those children who waited with the patience were told; and thirst in
the camp was three days old. Soon Akbar cam down with spear in his
chest;

which a father had to pull so severe was the test;

He was image of the Prophet (P), and the life of al-Husain (A.S.);

He was vision of a mother and the eyes of al-Husain (A.S.)

60

Now the Leader was alone as he called for the help,
then a baby fell down; a response from the crib!
This thirsty, pure, infant was a son of Imam,
Who, acknowledged his father and the call of Imam.
40 Thus al-Husain (A.S.) brought him for some water in the field,

and showed them baby's dried lips and appealed;
but the six months old got an arrow so thick,
that turned him over and tore his neck.
Ali Asghar went to sleep, with his father and no fear; 45
with the cradle on the fire, and their head on spear;
and the mother's empty hand, with the tear dried eyes,
who looked for the baby to sing lullabies.
And a sister by the camp saw the horror of this trip;
as a knife tore the neck, where the Prophet (P) put his lips;50
Earth in grief, roared heavens and mourned,
Sand turned red when al-Husain (A.S.) was torn.
And a child full of tears with her tiny bleeding ears,
bruises on her face and her thirst so severe;
She ran for her father who laid beheaded,
and cried for the uncle for help she needed;
Syeda Zainab (A.S.) looked for her in the sadness of that night;


61

did inquire every soul in the land of the plight;
but Sakina was sleeping on the chest of a body;

with the love of the father, from the fragrance of his boy.

Then the camp pushed down, while flames went up;
little children rushed out, as their dresses lit up;
it was night full of cries and the innocent quests;
shattered were the dreams and broken were the nests.
60
All defenses laid to rest, after trials and the tests;65
left to face, one Imam, even history would detest,
who fainted with the illness faced torture and torment;
a Master of the pious and devotees' ornament.
Lashes on his back heavy chains on Imam;
but ladies were the prisoners, was the wound of Imam; 70
No chador for them but their rope tied arms;

and grief soared high from Kufa to Shaam.

But, the daughter of Ali (A.S.) challenged, miseries with the
messages;

with the families in bazaars, and deadly courts of savages; With the
depth of the patience and the Zenith of Braver Bravery;

Islam was rescued for ever from the slavery.\*

L. 45. Ali Asghar, Arabic title ?Al? al-Asghar, is ?Al? b. al- Husain.
[Asghar means the youngest.] When Imam al-Husain lost all his

intense thirst. To prevent his baby from dying of thirst, Imam al-Husain
brought him to the enemy so as to get him some water.

Al-Kufa served as a seat of Imam ?Al?'s government, hence a refuge and
center for the Shiites. Just prior to the Karbala incident, several of
its inhabitants wrote letters, inviting Imam al-Husain to move there;
however, most of them betrayed him and participated in the unbalanced
war against him in Karbala.
