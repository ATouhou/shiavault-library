Dream
=====

Imam Husayn's [s] companion went to their tents. Some companions went to
bed to get ready to tomorrow's fight, and some began praying and reading
the Qur'an. Al-Husayn was in his tent mending his sword. He felt tired
and closed his eyes.

It was early morning. Imam Husayn [a] dreamt that he saw dogs attacking
him. One of the dogs was spotted. It was biting his neck. Al-Husayn woke
and said:

*We belong to Allah, we shall come back to Him!*
