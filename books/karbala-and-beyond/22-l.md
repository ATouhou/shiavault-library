**Lat لات:** a chief deity in the religion of pre-Islamic Arabs during
the days of jahiliyya

**La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah لا حول و لا قوة إلا بالله:** The
meaning of this expression is: "There is neither power nor strength save
in Allah." This expression is articulated by a Muslim when he is struck
by a calamity or is taken over by a situation beyond his control. A
Muslim puts his trust in the hands of Allah, and submits himself
willingly to Allah.

**La ilaha ilal-Allah or La Ilaha Ill-Allah** **لا إله إلا الله:** This
expression is very important in Islam. It is part of the first pillar of
Islam which is called tawhid, the belief in the unity of God. It means:
"There is no god worthy of worship except Allah." The second part of
this first pillar is to say "Muhammadun Rasul-Allah" which means:
"Muhammad (ص) is the messenger of Allah." This statement is called the
“key to Paradise”. Before you close your eyes and slepp, pronounce it
three times because you do not know for sure whether you will wake up at
all.

**Labbayk لبيك!:** an exclamation conveying the meaning of "At your
service!" or "Here I am!"
