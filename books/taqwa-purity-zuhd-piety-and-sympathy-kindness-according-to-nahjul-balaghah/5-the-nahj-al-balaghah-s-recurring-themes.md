The Nahj al-balaghah's Recurring Themes
=======================================

Out of the 241 fragments collected under the title '*Khutab* ' by
al-Sayyid al-Radi (though not all of them are*Khutab* or sermons) about
86 can be classed as*mawa'iz* or at least contain a series of spiritual
advices. Some of them, however, are elaborate and lengthy, like
the*khutbah* 176, which opens with the sentence (*Avail of the Divine
expositions* ), the*khutbah* named '*al-Qasi'ah* ; (which is the longest
of the sermons of the*Nahj al-balaghah* ), and the*khutbah* 93
(called*khutbat al-muttaqin* , the 'Sermon of the Pious').

Out of some seventy-nine passages that are classed as '*kutub* '
letters, (which not all of them are) about twenty-five, either
completely or partially, consist of spiritual and moral teachings. Some
of them are quite lengthy and elaborate-like letter 31, which
constitutes 'Ali's advice to his son al-Imam al-Hasan al-Mujtaba ('a),
and the lengthiest of all, except the famous directive sent to Malik
al-'Ashtar. Another one is letter 45, the well-known epistle of 'Ali
('a) to Uthman ibn Hunayf, his governor in Basrah.
