(11) The Journey To Kufa
========================

The sun rose, crimson-red was its color

Downcast with shame, the world looked duller

Ladies and children, huddled with shambled remains

The victors rejoiced, without compunction or shame.

Vying with one another, to torture and torment

They took delight, in causing them lament

Marching them, by the bodies of their dear ones

Before being taken to Kufa, in a caravan.

Without any saddles, on camels' bare-backs

The ladies were put in a sheep like pack

Bound hand and foot, with ropes and chains

Children's necks were tied with their hands.

Burning with fever and heavily chained

Zainal Abedeen was marched, though in pain

The heads of the martyrs, carried on spears

Headed the procession of Muhammad's dears.

Kufa was reached in a few hectic hours

Shimr and Khooli gloated, over and over

To the governor was sent a courier

The caravan stopped at a barrier.

Zaynab and Kulthum had resided for four years

In Kufa as daughters of Islam's ruler

Now, they were captives of those Muslims,

Who were steeped in vices and sins.

The grand daughters of the Prophet of Islam

Were too noble, to cause anyone least harm

Helpless victims of those followers of Muhammad;

The lofty principles of Islam were thrown in mud.

O' Kufa, recall the days of glory of Zaynab!

The honored daughter of the noblest of Arabs

For four years, Kufians vied with each other

Every wish of theirs to fulfill like a mother.

The same Kufa now wore a festive look

People gathered in every corner and nook

To watch the grand daughters of Muhammad

People of Kufa were now thirsty for their blood.

Heading the caravan, the town crier was crying aloud

The prisoners are Zaynab and Kulthum, beyond doubt

Husayn and his followers have all been slain,

By Yazid's might and power, on Karbala's plain.

All who question Yazid, such is their fate

Beware, lest you be subjected to such hate

If you obey Yazid, without any question

Rewards will be plenty and pleasingly handsome.

When the identity was revealed, some were sad

Ladies and children of the house of Muhammad;

Could they be captives and his grand-son murdered?

None, however, dared protest; they merely shuddered.

It was noon, the sun increasingly blazing

Continuous pleading for water, Zaynab was facing

It was futile, to ask the brutes for water

Zaynab was explaining to Husayn's daughter.

A lady in balcony, saw the plight of Sakina

Rushing down with water, she was in a dilemma

She went to Sakina, breaking the police cordon

A tumbler of cool water; O' merciful heaven!

Was it Umm Ayman? Zaynab was not sure

Two decades had passed, since the days of yore

"I am thankful for your noble gesture,

May God, on you, His blessings shower."

She was astonished and completely dazed

Zaynab brushed aside the hair, from her face

The same Zaynab, whom she adored and venerated,

Was now a picture of woe, a victim of fate.

Kissing Zaynab's feet, out of reverence

Umm Ayman, weepingly, asked for forgiveness;

Lest, such display rouse public sympathy

The guards pounced and whipped, Ayman, mercilessly.

Thrown aside, she weepingly complained to Allah

The caravan proceeded to the court of Obeidullah

Seated on a throne, holding his royal court

The prisoners were marched in the villain's fort.

Seeing Zaynab and Kulthum, he ordered his men

To place at his feet, the head of Husayn;

He mockingly inquired, the son of a bitch'

"Are these slave girls or children of Prophet?"

as per the parting promise given to Husayn

Zaynab, who was controlling herself, lost restrain

"We are grand-daughters of your acknowledged Prophet,

Sisters of Husayn, whom your henchmen murdered!"

In frenzy, she gave him a bit of her mind

"You are the stooge of Yazid, O' you fiend!

He has flouted all the principles of Islam

The house of Prophet, he has unjustifiably harmed!"

"He has trampled all ethical concepts

reduced all beings to a condition abject

your success, is ephimeral, be sure

very soon, God's wrath, you will endure."

Ibn Ziad, was stunned by this bold rebuke

His embarrassment was apparent, though he fumed

The awe inspiring atmosphere of the court

Held no terrors for Zaynab and Kulthum, both.

He looked around to see the devastating effect

If she went on, the masses would defect

He shouted at the top of his heartless voice

Undaunted by threats, Zaynab dared him twice!

She projected the issues, the sacrifices of Husayn;

Most poignantly, she recalled his piety and fame

A blind companion of the Prophet, Ziad bin Arkan

Protested at the indignities on founders of Islam.

Ibn Ziad, shouting him down, ordered his removal

By nature, he was crafty and vindictively cruel

He hurriedly dismissed the corrupt court

"Carry the prisoners to Damascus", he roared.
