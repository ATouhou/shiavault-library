That Which Is Of No Concern
===========================

**That which is of no concern-ما لا يعني**

1. Your getting involved in that which is of no concern to you is
misguided ignorance.

> 1ـ وُقُوعُكَ فيما لايَعنيكَ جَهْلٌ مُضِلٌّ.

2. Do not busy yourself with that which is of no concern to you, and do
not take upon yourself more than what is enough for you, and exert all
your efforts for that which will save you.

> 2ـ لاتَشْتَغِلْ بِما لايَعْنيكَ، ولاتتَكَلَّفْ فَوْقَ ما يَكْفِيكَ،
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
واجْعَلْ كُلَّ هَمِّكَ لِما يُنْجيكَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

3. Leave aside that which does not concern you and busy yourself with
the important work that will save you [in the Hereafter].

> 3ـ دَعْ ما لايَعْنيكَ، واشْتَغِلْ بِمُهِمِّكَ الَّذي يُنْجيكَ.

4. Blessed is the one who reduces his effort in that which does not
concern him and exerts all his efforts for that which will save him.

> 4ـ طُوبى لِمَنْ قَصَّرَ هِمَّتَهُ عَلى ما يَعْنيهِ، وجَعَلَ كُلَّ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
جِدِّهِ لِما يُنْجيهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

5. One who discards that which is of concern to him falls into that
which does not concern him.

> 5ـ مَنِ اطَّرَعَ ما يَعْنيهِ وَقَعَ إلى ما لايَعْنيهِ.

6. One who prolongs his talk about that which he ought not to [speak of]
has indeed made himself liable to dispraise.

> 6ـ مَنْ أطالَ الحَديثَ فيما لايَنْبَغي فَقَدْ عَرَّضَ نَفْسَهُ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لِلْمَلامَةِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

7. The greatest inconvenience is troubling yourself with that which does
not concern you.

> 7ـ أكْبَرُ الكُلْفَةِ تَعَنّيكَ فيما لايَعْنيكَ.

8. One who occupies himself with that which does not concern him loses
that which is important to him.

> 8ـ مَنِ اشْتَغَلَ بِما لايَعْنيهِ فاتَهُ مايَعْنيهِ.

9. Whoever occupies himself with that which is unnecessary, it causes
him to lose [what is more to] his benefit.

> 9ـ مَنِ اشْتَغَلَ بِغَيْرِ ضَرُورَتِهِ فَوَّتَهُ ذلِكَ مَنْفَعَتَهُ.
