Surah al-Dukhan, Chapter 44, Verses 37- 59
==========================================

Surah al-Dukhan - Verse 37
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَهُمْ خَيْرٌ أَمْ قَوْمُ تُبَّعٍ وَالَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ
أَهْلَكْنَاهُمْ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا مُجْرِمِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***37. Are they better [in terms of opportunities] or the people of
Tubba’ and those before them? We destroyed them because they were indeed
criminals. [Why do you not take a lesson?]***

History provides man with the best lessons. The prosperous land of the
Yemen, located in the South of the Arabian Peninsula, was the cradle of
a great civilization ruled by kings called Tubba’ (the plural form is
Tababi’a).

The term literally indicates “those whose orders are followed by people”
or “those succeeding each other to rule.” The people enjoyed a very
powerful state wielding a vast sway.

The blessed Verse, preceded by making mention of Meccan polytheists and
their animosity toward the Prophet (S) and their denial of Resurrection,
makes a reference to the fate of the sinful and criminal people of
Tubba’ warns Meccan polytheists against Divine torment in store for them
on the Day of Resurrection.

The blessed Verse asks:

***“Are they better or the people of Tubba’? We destroyed them because
they were indeed criminals.”***

The people of Hijaz were to some extent aware of the fate of the people
of Tubba’ as a consequence of which no further details are provided in
the following Verses concerning them, but It merely suffices to warn
Meccan polytheists against a fate in store for them similar to that of
other peoples inhabiting the regions in Sham [viz. Syria, Palestine,
East Jordan, Lebanon, and the northwestern parts of the Fertile
Crescent] and Egypt.

Put the case that you deny Resurrection, how could you deny Divine
torments sent down on these criminal and disobedient peoples?

***“Those before them”***

alludes to the peoples of Nuh, ‘Ad, Thamud, and the like.

Some exegets maintain that Tubba’ was a believer and a truth seeking man
and the

***“people of Tubba’”***

mentioned in the two Qur’anic Verses bear testimony to the same since
not the ruler but his people are censured.

According to a prophetic tradition:

*“Do not slander Tubba’ since he submitted to Divine Will.”*[^1]

A tradition is narrated from Imam Sadiq (as) saying:

*“Tubba’ verily said unto [the tribes of] Aws and Khazraj:*

*‘Stay here until this Prophet proclaims his Call. Had I enjoyed the
opportunity to be his contemporary, I would have been at his disposal in
his Prophetic Call.’”*[^2]

Surah al-Dukhan - Verses 38 - 39
--------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا لاعِبِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا خَلَقْنَاهُمَا إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ وَلَكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لا

  </p>
</blockquote>

***38. And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is
between them, for merely play.***  
***39. We created them not except with truth, but most of them
[polytheists] know not.***

The word ***la’b*** is used in the sense of “merely play, anything done
in vain,” like childish plays. These two blessed Verses serve as a
prelude to the following Verses on Resurrection.

It is as if they indicate that if there were no Resurrection, creation
would be purposeless, since the world of existence has been created for
man and if man becomes non-existent by death, the world of existence
would also be in vain.

It is for the same grounds that God Almighty says:

***“We created not the heavens and the earth for merely play, but We
created them with truth.”***

Logical arguments are being produced for proving Resurrection to the
effect that any sensible person may use his intellection to perceive
that God Almighty created not the heavens and the earth and what is
between them in vain but they were created with truth as per Divine
Wisdom and Omniscience.

The Verses in question and the following Ones indicate that the purpose
behind creating the heavens and the earth is the creation of man and the
purpose behind creating man is to raise him up on the Day of
Resurrection, or else the creation of the heavens and the earth would be
in vain.

Surah al-Dukhan - Verses 40 - 42

<blockquote dir="rtl">

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِلَّا مَنْ رَحِمَ اللَّهُ إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ

</blockquote>

***40. Indeed the Day Distinction [between truth and falsehood] is the
time appointed for all of them –***  
***41. The Day when a friend avails not a friend [of his] in aught and
no help can they receive [from any source],***  
***42. Except him on whom Allah has Mercy. Indeed He is the Omnipotent,
the Most Merciful.***

Since creation enjoys a true purpose, Resurrection should occur. Since
the All-Wise Lord created the world of existence as per truth, He will
not abandon His favorite creature following his death. All humanity will
gather on the Day of Resurrection, but man will be alone then.

The Day of Distinction (yaw al-fasl), the appointed time when all
humanity gather, is one of the appellations of Resurrection, since truth
and falsehood will be distinguished on that Day and the wrong doings of
wrong doers will be compensated.

The people of truth and falsehood will clearly see their past deeds and
their deeds will be recompensed.

According to the latter two Verses no friend may meet the demands of his
friend since no one will be able to extend help to his friends unless
one will be granted Divine Mercy and Favor, since Glory, Dignity, and
Succor will solely belong to Divine Essence.

He is All-Merciful and All-Gracious toward his creatures. He chastises
or forgives whomever He Wills. It is needless to say that His
chastisement and forgiving are based on Divine Justice and Wisdom and no
wrong will be done to anyone.

Since His Mercy surpasses His Wrath, we are all hopeful to enjoy His
Mercy and sinners, no matter to what extent they have transgressed the
bounds, should not despair of His Mercy.

It is in the Holy Qur’an that:

***“Certainly no one despairs of Allah’s Mercy, except the people who
disbelieve”***[^3]***.***

The righteous good doing pious should fear God at all times and not be
arrogant for their deeds since they may never know whether their deeds
are accepted by God. It is reported from Infallible Imams that
believers’ hope and fear should be like the two pans of the balance.

Surah al-Dukhan - Verses 43 - 46

***43. Verily, the tree of Zaqqum***  
***44. Will be the food of the sinners.***  
***45. Like boiling oil, it will boil in the bellies.***  
***46. Like the boiling of scalding water.***

The word zaqqum indicates a kind of undesirable food served in Hell.
Mohl is used in the sense of molten or impure metal or copper. The four
Verses concern the torment of sinners, particularly disbelievers.

By

***athim (“sinful”)***

disbelievers may be intended since the preceding Verses were about
disbelievers and the general theme of the Verses indicate that one who
believes in Divine Unity, Resurrection, the prophethood of the Seal of
the Prophets (S), and the imamate of the Infallible Imams (as), even if
he happens to be a sinner, he will not be inflicted with such torment.

Based on the above, some exegets maintain that the Verses in question
allude to the cursed Abu Jahl who went to the extreme in disbelief,
grudge, and animosity against the Prophet (S). It is reported that once
Abu Jahl was eating some dates mingled with butter and was saying
mockingly that it was the ***Zaqqum*** against which Muhammad warned us
and we eat our fill of it.

Rejecting his false claim, God Almighty said that the fruit of the tree
of ***Zaqqum*** was the food of sinners rather than what Abu Jahl
conceived of it.

Any molten metal, e.g. gold, silver, and copper, is called muhl. Some
also hold that by it oil impurities are being meant such that when oil
is heated, its impurities settle as sediment or dregs which are also
called durdiy al-zit (“oil dregs”).

The fruit of the tree of ***Zaqqum*** boils in bellies in the manner of
boiling scalding water cutting up their intestines. The Almighty
(jabbar) and All-Subjugating (qahhar) Sovereign addresses the myrmidons,
i.e., the angels who thrust the damned into Hell (zabaniya) wrathfully.

***47. [It will be said] “Seize him and drag him into the midst of
blazing Fire,***  
***48. Then pour over his head the torment of boiling water.***  
***49. Taste you [this]! Indeed, you were [were pretending to be] the
mighty, the generous.***  
***50. Indeed, this is that whereof you used to doubt!”***

The torments of the Resurrection Day are both physical and non-physical.
The former include the use of boiling material and the latter include
hearing of humiliation and derision saying who you were who falsely
claimed to be mighty and generous in your mundane life?

The blessed Verse 47 asks the angels to seize the unbeliever and drag
him forcefully into the midst of Hell surrounded by fire.

The next Verse reads:

Then pour over his head boiling water such that ***Zaqqum*** cuts them
into pieces inwardly and burns them with it outwardly.

Regarding the third Verse exegest maintain that Abu Jahl would say unto
the Messenger of God (S):

*“O Muhammad! I enjoy power and I am held in esteem in Mecca but neither
you nor your God may ever inflict any harm unto me.”*

As a consequence of his boastful remarks, he will be held in contempt on
the Resurrection Day and it will be said unto him derisively:

***“Then taste the torments since you are mighty and you are held in
esteem.”***

Verse 50 reads that when disbelievers taste the torments, it will be
said unto them that this is the torment warned against by the prophets
but you held them in doubt and slandered them.

***51. Verily, the pious will be in place of security.***  
***52. Among gardens and springs.***  
***53. Dressed in fine silk and in thick silk, facing each other.***

Sundus and istabraq indicate fine and thick silk fabric respectively.
The word hur is the plural form of huriyya which is used in the sense of
women with black eyes and white complexion.

The word ***‘ayn*** the pluralized form of which is ‘ayna’ indicates
“having wide, lovely eyes.” The pious are certainly placed in place of
security, enjoying the bounties of Paradise and secure from the torments
of Hell.

God Almighty says:

***“Verily, the pious will be in the midst of gardens and rivers in a
seat of truth, near the Omnipotent King”***[^4]***.***

***“Place of security”***[^5]

and

***“seat of truth”***[^6]

are reserved for those who are ranked third among the pious.

They are the people whose hearts are secure through having faith and
their hearts are free from all existent beings besides God. They have
struggled against the hosts of estimative, irascible, and concupiscent
powers and have succeeded in subjugating them.

They have detached themselves from the attractions of the mundane world
and have blocked the way in this world through which powers of darkness
used to frequent their hearts; as a consequence of which their hearts
are frequented by angels of Mercy. They have stepped out of the abyss of
illusions and vain desires so that their hearts have turned into the
Threshold of Divine Mercy.

According to a Prophetic tradition,

*“The believer’s heart is the Threshold of the All-Merciful.”*

In short, the blessed Verse refers to those whose hearts are secure in
this world through faith. They are placed in the place of security. They
are secure in their worldly life from concupiscent and satanic desires
enjoying the protection of God Almighty. They will also be secure from
any affliction in proximity to God in the Hereafter.

The following Verse says that such person derives pleasure from
perceiving spiritual and Divine bounties as well those of physical
pleasures of Paradise since in the same manner that man is essentially
composed of soul and body, his pleasures are to be consistent with his
corporeality and spirituality.

The Verse apparently makes a reference to both dimensions since the
place of security is consistent with spiritual states attained by human
soul upon attainment to perfection. Thus, through perceiving corporeal
knowledge, man acquires the knowledge of the spiritual realm of the
Hereafter through which he attains to the place of security.

Verse 53 is concerned with the ranks of the corporeal bounties of the
pious whose clothes are made in Paradise from sundus and istabraq (fine
and thick silk respectively).

Some exegets also maintain that istabraq indicates the carpets prepared
for them and the word:

***mutaqabilin (“facing each other”)***

refers to the couches in Paradise facing each other so that they enjoy
meeting each other.

Surah al-Dukhan - Verse 54
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كَذَلِكَ وَزَوَّجْنَاهُمْ بِحُورٍ عِينٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***54. Such [We recompense them]. And We will marry them to fair females
with wide, lovely eyes.***

In depicting hur al-’ayn exegets say they are fair females wide, lovely
eyes and delicate of complexion. ‘Ayn serves as an adjective for the hur
of Paradise who are delicate of complexion. Such is the state of the
people of Paradise who will enjoy all kinds of bounties and pleasures in
Paradise.

Surah al-Dukhan - Verse 55
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَدْعُونَ فِيهَا بِكُلِّ فَاكِهَةٍ آمِنِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***55. They will call therein for every kind of fruit [that they wish]
in peace and security.***

The greatest bounty is security since the

***“place of security”***

precedes other bounties. It is worthy of note that security in Paradise
is all inclusive. There will be no fear of death, foes, the envious, or
perdition.

Peace and security in Paradise concerns the

***“place of security”***

and the foods

***(“every kind of fruit”).***

Eating some kinds of fruit may at times cause diverse diseases in this
world. Piety and fear of God Almighty in this world will lead to peace
and security in the Hereafter. The blessed Verse in question says
whatever kind of fruit desired will be available to them without
incurring and pain, hardship, or displeasure

***(“in peace and security”).***

Surah al-Dukhan - Verses 56 - 57
--------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">

***56. They will never taste death therein except the first death [of
this world] and He will save them from the torment of the blazing
Fire.***  
***57. As a bounty from your Lord! That will be the supreme success!***

One who protects himself through piety and fear of God in this world,
God will save him from Hell in the Hereafter.

Paradise is everlasting and the people of Paradise will be free from
being preoccupied with death. God Almighty owes nothing to anyone rather
all blessings are granted through Divine bounteousness (fadl) and all
the blessings bestowed upon the people of Paradise are through Divine
Favor

***(“as a bounty from your Lord!”).***

According to Verse 56, the highest bounty bestowed upon the people of
Paradise is their being admitted to Paradise and the worst torment of
the people of Hell is that they will be sent to Hell.

According to a tradition, when the people of Paradise and the people of
Hell are settled down in Paradise and Hell respectively, a sheep will be
brought to them. It will be said unto them that it is death and the
sheep will be killed and it will be said unto the people of Paradise and
Hell that it was death, but it no longer exists.

The allegory makes a reference to the absence of death in Resurrection.
This world is the world of generation and corruption in which death and
life follow each other, i.e., each life is followed by death, each
pleasure is followed by displeasure, and health is followed by ailment,
since this world is the world of corporeality and potentiality.

It is composed of contradictory constituents and the constituents of any
composite entity will disintegrate one day.

That is why death is imminent and inevitable for any entity.
Nonetheless, the Hereafter is the permanent and unchangeable world,
since any potentiality in this world will be actualized in the world to
come; as a consequence of which, all creatures inclusive of the jinn,
humanity, Paradise, Hell, and their constituent elements are neither
transient nor subject to disintegration or annihilation.

Another bounty reserved for the pious and the people of Paradise is that
they will be secure from the torments of Hell.

Addressing the Messenger of God (S), the blessed Verse says O Muhammad!
Saving them from the torments of Hell is a great Bounty, Mercy, and
Success from your Lord bestowed upon them. It is a reference to the
Divine Succor of faith and piety as bounties granted upon the pious and
the God fearing.

The possessive pronoun –ka whose antecedent is the Messenger of God (S)
may indicate that the Bounties and Favors bestowed upon the pious
springs from their adherence to the Noble Prophet (S), were guided to
the true path, worshipped the One God, and adhered to the Infallible
Imams (as).

Surah al-Dukhan - Verses 58 - 59

***58. Certainly, We have made this [Qur’an] facile in your tongue so
that they may remember.***  
***59. Await then [for your triumph]; indeed, they are also awaiting
[their ominous fate].***

The purpose behind the revelation of the Holy Qur’an is to make people
remember that they are God’s servants.

The Holy Qur’an is revealed as the last guidance sent down to people
saying unto them that if they fail to acknowledge that It is Divine
Revelation they should await Divine Wrath.

The last two Verses says unto man that God Almighty sent down the Holy
Qur’an in the Arabic tongue in order that upon noticing Its unsurpassed
Eloquence and Inimitability, they perceive that it springs from the
springhead of Divine Emanation. Thus, they may remember and believe in
the prophethood of the Messenger of God (S).

The blessed Verse addresses the Prophet (S) saying

*“O Muhammad! Await their being guided to the true path since
disbelievers await your fate.”*

The Verse apparently implies that you await their guidance and felicity
where as they await your defeat and death.
