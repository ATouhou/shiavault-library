The Battle Front
================

The three Satans, situated along the King's Street, are about one
hundred meters apart from each other. Each represents a "monument", a
"statue" or an "idol". Every year their faces are painted white!

"God is Great", how meaningful! The army has arrived; all have arms
(pebbles) in their hands and are ready to fire. When you reach the first
idol, do not shoot - but pass by. When you reach the second idol, do not
shoot but pass by. When you reach the third idol, do not pass by, but
shoot! Why? Those wise and experienced teachers usually tell us to
quietly and gradually take turns in a sequential way but here Ibrahim is
the Commander and orders:

"SHOOT THE LAST ONE IN YOUR FIRST ATTACK"! "DID YOU SHOOT?" "YES" "HOW
MANY TIMES?" "SEVEN!" "ARE YOU SURE THEY HIT THE TARGET?" "I AM SURE."
"DID YOU HIT THE BELLY OR THE LEGS?" "NONE!" "DID YOU HIT HIS BACK?"
"NO." "DID YOU HIT HIS HEAD AND FACE?" "YES, I DID." "WELL DONE!"

The fight is over. When the last idol falls, the first and second ones
cannot resist. The last idol supports the other two. After leaving the
front, you have nothing more to do except make the sacrifice then you
may announce and celebrate your victory! Take off your ihram put on your
desired clothing, cut your hair, use perfume if you want and embrace
your spouse. You are free now! You are a man! Mina is conquered by you
and Satan is defeated. What am I saying? You are Ibrahim now! You are in
the position to sacrifice your Ismail for Him.
