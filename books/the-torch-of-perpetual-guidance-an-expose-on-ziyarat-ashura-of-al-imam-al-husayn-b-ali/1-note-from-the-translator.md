Note From the Translator
========================

May the peace and mercy of Allah be upon you. This work, a brief expose
on Ziyarat ‘Ashura was originally translated as a work which would be
sent via email in a series of ‘weekly thoughts’. It is for this reason,
that we decided to keep each section short and concise – 400 words at
maximum. Obviously, much more can and has been said and written about
this visitation, which some scholars deem as being Hadith al-Qudsi or a
sacred tradition taught directly by Allah (swt) to the followers of His
path.

Since we wished for this work to be released during the sacred month of
Muharram 1426 AH/2005 C.E, it was decided to publish this work in
electronic format in its summarized version.

Insha-Allah, with the power and permission of Allah (swt), we intend to
revisit this translation, refer back to the original source and present
a complete look at the explanation of this beautiful and moving
greeting. This work is, Insha-Allah, expected to be ready by the ‘Arbain
(40th) of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn (as) and his family and friends.

It should be noted that whereas we have tried to remain faithful to the
original text, we have added our own thoughts into some segments to
better assist in this brief understanding – these will be amended in the
final version.

**work except with the permission of Allah...**
