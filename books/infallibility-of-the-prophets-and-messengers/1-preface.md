***In the Name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful.***

**May Allah shower His blessings upon Muhammad (S) and his Purified
Progeny (A)**

Imam Jafar as-Sadiq (A) says:

‘Write (down the traditions) and propagate the knowledge among your
brothers. When you die, bequeath these books as your legacy to your
sons. Verily, there will come on the people a time of disturbance, when
nothing will give them any satisfaction and to nothing will they pay any
heed except to their books.’ (Al-Kafi)

In the light of the above tradition, World Islamic Network (WIN) has
taken up the task of diffusing Islamic teachings according to the School
of Ahlul Bayt (A). This booklet is the sixth of the series titled: In
the Light of Quran and Hadith.

Compiled by the great scholar Allama Sayyid Murtadha Askari these
booklets deal with some of the important issues of faith. We pray that
Allah give us the tawfeeq to continue this noble endeavor.
