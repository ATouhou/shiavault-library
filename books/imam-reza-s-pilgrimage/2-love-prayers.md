Love Prayers
============

(Originally in Farsi)

Greetings my dear1 who are so honored
Who are in constant contact with the Image of the Mirror2
You are the stranger in the Town of Heart and there is turmoil
to see you You have a tribe of divine lovers attached to your hair
Do not blame me for entering the shrine in a rush
You are used to my stubbornness for many years now
I continually fly around your shrine
Since you smell and look better than jasmines
You have many white and colored flocks of doves
Flying around you and making sounds
Do you not want a dove as black as the night?
I am dead drunk as long as you are holding the cup
O the pure flowing water - help me since Iam thirsty
I am so thirsty as if I am in a desert. Would you kindly quench my
thirst?
I am eager to be blamed for wickedness
You have many like me along your river
I have sinned and now I hug you
Cleansed you are whom the filthy seek
I wish to attend the weeping behind your back
You are my source of honor since you face the Qibla
(Reza1) come and say two units of law prayers
Now that you have made ablutions with your lover's wine.

**Reza's Lovers**

We are all Reza's1 lovers; In his love we are known to everyone;
We are all Reza's lovers; We shall all gather in his court;
We are all Reza's lovers; From far distances we come to see him;
We are all Reza's lovers; We come to circumambulate around his
shrine;
We are all Reza's lovers; We are all enthusiastic to see him;
We are all Reza's lovers; We have no friends but him in this world;
We are all Reza's lovers; We have piece of mind due to you;
We are all Reza's lovers; We ask him for the fulfillment of all our
needs;
We are all Reza's lovers; We accompany Reza in expressing love for the
One to be worshipped;
We are all Reza's lovers; We cannot sleep due to our love for Reza;
We are all Reza's lovers; We are Reza's friends in the court of the
Lord.

**Master of the Shrine**

O the Master of the Holy Shrine
You are the Majestic and the Divine
O the Gem of Muhammad's Crown
You are the light of God in our town
O the golden hands that fly
Above the sick and those who cry
O the saviour of the deer
People love you so sincere
O the shining star of the sky
You are always out there so high
O the source of light in the believer's heart
You are always shining there so bright
O the shining face in my eye
I cannot stand to tell you goodbye
O the preacher of the Holy Book
Tell me the words and catch me on your hook
O the rain of peace and glory
Your life is filled with many a story.
