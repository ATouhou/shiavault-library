19: Mary (marium)
=================

These 98 verses form six sections dating from the Meccan period, except
for VV.

58-71 (IV-V) which date from Madina. This chapter was revealed after
Originator 35 and before the next one which is called Ta-Ha 20. It
furnishes us with the Islamic story about Jesus' mother, as well as his
speaking as a boy from the cradle (IV-VI). It was read to the emperor of
Ethiopia by the migrants or refugees to that kingdom before the classic
Hijra.

The chapter also deals with the role of Abraham and other prophets
(III-IV).

Great emphasis is laid in this chapter on God's aspect as The
Mercy-giving or Ar-Rahman, especially by Mary. The Angels' Message in
section iv is also significant. The chapter is sustained on an assonance
in -iyya (which is interrupted between VV. 33-40 (II: end).
