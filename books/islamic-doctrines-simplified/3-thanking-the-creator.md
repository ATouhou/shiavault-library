Thanking the Creator
====================

If one of your parents or relatives gives you a present, surely you will
be happy and thank them for it. Any one who does good to us deserves our
gratitude and should be thanked for his goodness and favour.

We are given many favours from our parents who bring us up and who spend
nights awake for our sake; from our teachers, who educate us and impart
good manners, from our friends who give us their help. We thank these
people and accept their favours and kindness. We consider it a virtue to
do good, and in return we praise them for their goodness.

Then do we not think our Creator, Who created us and provided us with
our parents and gave us so many blessings, deserves many thanks and
worship from us?

It is Allah and He Who alone created us, Who provides for us and blesses
us and it is to Him and Him alone for Whom should be reserved the
ultimate praise.

Anyone who fails in his duty and neither worships Allah nor thanks Him
can only be arrogant and evil.

No sane person can reject goodness and be ungrateful towards One Who
provides favours, offers help and is merciful towards him.

*My Lord! Inspire me to thank You for Your Favour which You bestowed
upon me and on my parents, that I may do righteousness such as will
please You.*
