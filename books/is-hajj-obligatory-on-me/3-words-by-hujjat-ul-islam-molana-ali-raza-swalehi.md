Translation From Urdu
---------------------

*In the name of Allah*

I have gone through this booklet “Is HAJJ obligatory on me?” compiled by
Maulana Muhammad Raza Dawoodani. He has tried to present Fiqh rulings in
a unique style. This is a new trend in Urdu language. He has focused on
following four points:

1. To discuss the rulings which believers **generally come across**
2. To use **friendly language** spoken in daily life
3. To set aside the differences of interpretation and mention the
**precautionary aspect** where ever possible
4. To follow **logical sequence without getting into the details**.

There are always merits and demerits in innovations. So is the case with
this booklet. This booklet will be helpful to many brothers in faith in
solving their problems but since it explains the precautionary angle,
can cause extra physical and financial efforts. Generally, *Momineen*
refer to rulings for their practical needs where details are not always
required. This booklet will be the best assistant on any such occasion.

Actually the topic of Hajj is so vast and comprehensive that it cannot
be covered in a single booklet. Although, the author’s effort is
commendable still few decrees have not been covered. Therefore readers
must take care that if their personal problem is different from the
stated decree, they should refer to the genuine *Ulema* in order to
fulfill their exact duty.

In the end, I pray for the acceptance of Agha Muhammad Raza Dawoodani's
this effort and hope this will please Imam-e-Zamana (AS.). May Allah
grant him further *Taufeeq* to work on other chapters of *Fiqh* in a
similar fashion.

Wassalam ...
