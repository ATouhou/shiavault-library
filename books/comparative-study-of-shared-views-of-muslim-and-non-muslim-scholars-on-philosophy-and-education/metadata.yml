description: |
  We live in a world where everything is always about me: my religion, my
  house, my phone..etc., forgetting on many occasions that there is a
  world beyond our own petty existence. In this context, the content of
  this book is a refreshing reminder that everything is not always about
  me but about us. Us, who believe, regardless of birth place, descend,
  religion or gender, that there is a God, a higher power that we all
  strive to know and to Whom we will all return in the end. We, as a
  whole, can always find things that unite us despite all out differences.
  This applies to how we think about philosophy and education.
