The Fruits of Hard Work
=======================

The Father
----------

Whatever possessions your mother and father have, such as the house and
all there is in it, real estate property and others, will someday by
yours, since we shall pass away and take nothing with us.

Think hard! You may even end up making better use of them. Your parents
have obtained them painstakingly and with hard work. But will take great
satisfaction in putting them at your disposal. They have even bought
some items especially for you.

The Child
---------

I pray that you will live for many years in happiness and in health and
fully enjoy the fruits of you hard work. I do not want anything but to
be able to live and enjoy life under your auspices and your protection.
