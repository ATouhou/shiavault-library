**In the Name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful**

By the Grace of the Almighty, alhamdolillaah, Islamic Study Circle is
pleased to announce the publication of the third and the final volume of
the English Translation of Ayatullah Dastghaibâ€™s Greater Sins (Gunahane
Kabira).

The delay in bringing out this last volume was mainly due to our
emphasis on perfection, especially in the language of the book. This not
only enhances the value of a book but the English reader also feels at
home when he reads an English translation of a book that was originally
written in one of the oriental langauges.

All the credit for lucid and flawless language goes to Sister Zainab
Muljiani who spent hours rewriting many portions that did not satisfy
her. She also went out of her way to confirm and check any point that
seemed doubtful or unclear. May the Almighty shower His choicest
blessings on this noble lady. We can only thank her for all this but the
actual rewards for these labours is with the Lord of the Worlds.

Our readers had been impatiently waiting for the last volume and we are
sure they would find it as useful and as informative as the previous
volumes.
