Lesson 12 : If My Mother Is Terribly Upset…?
============================================

A young lad lay ailing in bed. He suffered from a sickness that had no
cure except death. People, realising that no worldly medicine could help
him, went to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) and asked him to come and pray
for the young man's suffering to be eased.

When the Prophet (s.a.w.w.) arrived, he saw a frail youth, tossing,
turning and all the while moaning in extreme pain. He constantly cried
out in fear, screaming about wild and terrifying things that no one else
seemed to see.

Our Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) realised immediately that the man was fast
approaching death and could see what awaited him in the hereafter. He
sat down near the bed and asked gently, "Why are you in so much grief?
What makes you cry so?"

The man slowly opened his eyes and saw the gentle face of the Prophet
(s.a.w.w.) looking down at him. With great difficulty, he managed to
say, "Oh Messenger of God! I am now conscious of my limited time in this
world and feel the nearness of death.

Just a few minutes ago, I saw some extremely ugly and frightening faces
and I felt that they wanted to imprison me and chain me in a world of
severe punishment. I am scared of those faces and I fear for myself!"

Hearing this, the Prophet (s.a.w.w.) turned to those who were present
and asked. "Is this young man's mother alive? If she is, please ask her
to come right away." by the pain your son is in, are you angry with him
for any reason?"

The people rushed out to find her and brought her to the Prophet
(s.a.w.w.). She entered and stood a little way away from the dying
youth's bed. Seeing this behaviour, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) asked
her, "You do not seem to be affected At this, the woman replied, "O
Prophet of Allah (S.W.T.)! I have endured great pain and difficulties in
raising my child.

During his infancy, I spent sleepless nights to make sure that he slept
peacefully and during the day, I struggled to earn money for our bread.
Many days I remained hungry but fed him. Despite all this, when he
became older, he forgot all that I had sacrificed for him. His attitude
changed and he started disrespecting me.

Often, he was rude and angry. I was deeply hurt and in the end I could
not bear his treatment anymore so I complained to my Lord Allah
(S.W.T.)."

Having heard the mother express her bitter feelings, the Prophet
(s.a.w.w.) advised her, "O Mother! Your son was young and naïve. You
have every right to grieve and feel hurt but in the end you are a mother
and a mother's compassion exceeds everything else. I beg you to forgive
your son's ignorance. Do not be bitter about him. If you will be happy,
Allah (S.W.T.) will forgive him and relieve him from the pain that he is
presently suffering."

Hearing this and looking at her son crying out in pain, the mother felt
her love rekindled and she quickly raised her hands pleading to her
Lord,
"O Allah (S.W.T.)! For the sake of Your Prophet, I forgive my son and
request You to do the same."

The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) then added his own dua asked for
forgiveness for the man from Allah (S.W.T.). The Almighty accepted their
prayers and excused the youth's sins.

In a few moments, the man stopped thrashing about and a peaceful look
came over his face. He opened his eyes once again and this time smiled,
looking at the Prophet (s.a.w.w.), he spoke with gratitude, "O Prophet
of Allah (S.W.T.), I the Kalematu - Shahaadatayn and he left this
temporary world to meet with His Lord, with a smile on his face.

In the Holy Qur'an, Allah (S.W.T.) has given great emphasis on the
respect to our parents. He has advised children to treat their parents
with kindness and be humble and obedient towards them. If a person fails
in this important duty, he must seek forgiveness both from his parents
as well as from the Almighty.

According to our 6th holy Imam, Jaffer Al-Sadiq (a.s.), sincerely thank
you for your blessed visit. The two beastly figures who had approached
me earlier have gone and instead two handsome angels with broad smiles
on their faces are now coming towards me!"

With these words he recited "One who does good to his parents will
indeed receive goodness and during the time of his death, his soul will
leave his body very gently and easily. Such a person will never face
poverty in this world."

A Holy Verse We are told in the Qur'an

"And your Lord has commanded that you shall not serve any but Him, and
do goodness to your parents. If either or both of them reach old age
with you, say not to them (so much as) 'uf' nor harass them, and speak
to them a generous word." Sura Bani Israeel, Verse 23

**SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT …**

1. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) of Islam highly recommended and
encouraged believers to visit the sick and show kindness to them.
2. Islam has laid great emphasis for children to respect and value
their parents, especially the mother, for she has borne great pain in
nurturing and looking after them. If one fails to show kindness to ones'
parents, he will live in despair and a severe punishment awaits him in
the hereafter.
3. Allah (S.W.T.) in the Holy Qur'an has commanded all believers to
show Mercy and Kindness towards parents. He has ordered children to
lower their voice in front of their parents. Even the smallest word in
reply i.e. 'UF!' is forbidden.

**Think and Answer**

1. Why was the young lad in severe pain?
2. What brought the changes in his severe condition?
3. What do you understand from the warning in the Holy Qur'an to
mankind on behaviour towards one's parents - verse 23 of Sura Bani
Israel? Explain your answer fully.
4. What lessons have you derived from the ailing man's experiences,
hours before death?

**ANECDOTE**

Infacncy and Age One day, in the rashness of youth, I spoke harshly to
my mother. She sat in a corner with tears in her eyes said:

"You forget the days of your infancy! Can you recall those days when
you would cling to my bosom helplessly and would not dare to speak to me
loudly? Now you are powerful as a tiger and formidable as an elephant
only because I am an old woman …" **Introduction to Chapter Five**

In The Name Of Allah (S.W.T.), the Beneficent, the Merciful

**ALL ARE EQUAL IN THE DIVINE SYSTEM OF LAW AND ORDER**

Issues related to politics and well-being of the society are part of
the fundamental Islamic laws. For a Muslim leader to govern a society he
must practice justice and equity. In this chapter and the lessons that
follow, we will look at the importance of "Equality and Justice" in
accordance to the divine laws.

'JUSTICE' is one of the core elements in the establishment of an
Islamic Government. It is noteworthy to mention that in order to spread
and apply justice it is necessary for there be a sense of Islamic
Brotherhood which allows a person to know another's problems.

The implementation of justice helps Muslims to attain a life of
respect, honour, dignity and total commitment to Islam.


**Lesson 13 : Srirtual Role Models**

**The Infallible Imams**

At the time of the khilafat of Imam Ali Ibn Abi Taalib (a.s.), he once
lost his armour. Later, he happened to pass by the open market (bazaar)
of Kufah and his eyes fell on a Christian selling the very same armour!
Imam (a.s.) came a little closer to the Christian glancing at the armour
and then took it in his hand and studied it closely while asking the
seller about it. The man quickly replied, "That which is in your hand
belongs to me," and using some force took it from the Imam (a.s.)'s
hand.

His behaviour attracted the attention of the people around and they
gathered around the two men. Imam Ali (a.s.) calmly told the Christian,
"What are you saying? How can you claim this to be yours, when it does
not belong to you?" He further added, "I am certain this armour is mine
therefore return it to me…"

When the Christian continued to deny his claim, the Holy Imam (a.s.)
decided to take him to the court and lodged a complaint against him. As
they walked into the court, the Qaadhi saw them enter and quickly stood
up in respect of the Imam (a.s.). He greeted him politely and then
inquired, "What has brought you here?"

"This armour is mine. I neither sold it nor did I give it as a present
to anyone; now I have found it with this man, and he refuses to give it
back to me," explained the Imam (a.s.).

The Qaadhi turned and asked the Christian seller "What do you have to
say about it?"

The man insisted stubbornly, "I will not give the armour to him,
because it belongs to me. I am not calling him a liar, but it is
mine."

Seeing that he could not make a clear decision based on the facts he
had, the Qaadhi requested both the Imam (a.s.) and the seller to bring
two witnesses who would give evidence on their behalf. Our Holy Imam
(a.s.) began laughing and said, "The judge is right! Now I must present
witnesses, but I have none."

Since the plaintiff had no witnesses, the judgement was passed in
favour of the Christian who walked away with the armour. After a few
steps, he stopped. He knew the armour belonged to Imam (a.s.) and his
conscience struck him.

He thought to himself, "This manner of rule and conduct is not of
ordinary human beings. Rather, it is the government of prophets. Islam
advocates matters in absolute fairness, equality and justice. The law
applies in the same way to all people - even the khalifa, himself! How
wonderfully just!"

Retracing his steps, he entered the court again and with great shame
admitted his mistake and addressed those were sitting, saying "O
Muslims! The Islamic laws show perfect justice and this indeed has
awakened me.

Your laws give importance to equality. I won in the case against your
Holy leader, and this surprised me. Even though I a Christian, the laws
didn't change but brought justice as they were meant to. I have
witnessed that even a leader of the Muslims can be summoned in the court
of justice. This shows that no one can misuse the divine laws!

"How was it possible for the judge not to favour the Imam, and to
maintain the law as the final word? This court has brought truth -
complete truth. I bear witness that there is no other deen except Islam
that advocates divine laws, I now embrace Islam."

The man accepted Islam and pledged his loyalty to Allah (S.W.T.), the
Holy Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.w.) as the final Messenger from God and to
Imam Ali (a.s.) as the guardian of Islam and the pure, truthful Imam. He
then spoke to the Holy Imam (a.s.) and confessed his wrong-doings:

"I swear by God, truth is with you and this armour is yours. It was
after the Battle of Siffeen, when you had left behind the armour on the
battleground that I took it. I am really ashamed for having caused all
this to you, I seek forgiveness from you."

Imam Ali (a.s.) was very happy and said to the man: "In respect of the
love of truth you have shown and your accepting of this perfect deen, I
give back the armour to you."

The man turned out to be a devout companion of the Holy Imam (a.s.). He
was a great defender of Islam and its teachings. Later, he participated
in the battle of Naharwan and fought with bravery becoming a symbol of
martyrdom.

**SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT…**

1. The laws of Islam establish social justice. This helps Muslim
societies to promote equality, for the success of mankind.

2. When a society does not implement divine laws, there is no true
peace, harmony or contentment. Theft and usurping of one's rights are
common evils. This destroys the roots of families and societies at
large.

3. Muslims should follow the laws of Islam, and take full
responsibility in their duties as defenders of the divine regulations.
We should try to avoid bribery and any sort of un-Islamic commands made
by men.

4. When a society advocates equality and justice, there is room for
love, friendship and truth. This is one of the greatest gifts of Allah
(S.W.T.).

5. When such sublime laws are practised both by the Islamic judges and
the common men, there is no place for corruption. The wealth and
property of the public is safeguarded. One should seek solutions from
the laws of Islam rather than turning to man-made laws.

6. Muslims should make it a policy to combat injustice and support the
truth.

7. The Islamic courts should be flawlessly just and act as role models
for others to emulate (copy).

8. There is no distinction in Islam. Whether rich or poor, status and
recognition do not serve as conditions in performing justice.

9. The Muslim Qaadhi (judge) should always take into consideration the
views of both parties and be completely impartial i.e. not take sides.

**Think and Answer**

1. Explain how the Christian man came to embrace Islam.

2. What were Imam Ali (a.s.)'s words when he heard the Christian turn
to Islam?

3. How does equality and justice help build a healthy society? What are
the positive effects?

4. What do you think justice actually mean in the eyes of the divine
laws of Islam? Explain your answer.
