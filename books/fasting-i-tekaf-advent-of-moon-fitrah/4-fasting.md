Fast to be observed **in place of Sacrifice** of *Hajj-e-Tamattau*

(For details, check ***Manasik-e-Hajj**)*

Intention For Fasting

Q \# 1 : Is the intention for fasting compulsory?

ANS : Yes. Fasting is a worshipping act (***ibadat***) and worship can
not be done without intention.

Q \# 2 : Is intention anything like saying some **words**?

ANS : No. It is just to **intend in heart**.

Q \# 3 : What should this intend be?

ANS : **I** \*From **Morning** till **Maghrib** prayers

\*Am fasting \**Qurbat-an-ilAllah*

QS \# 4 **:** ***Qurbat-an-ilAllah*** means?

ANS : To fulfill the **order of Almighty Allah**. As a result of which
Allah’s nearness is definitely achieved.

QS \# 5 : What is **meant** by the **morning prayers**? 15 minutes after
the commencement of time of Fajar Prayers, Summons to Prayers from my
neighborhood mosque is called. Will my fast begin with that summon?

ANS : No. By morning prayers the **very first time** of Fajr Prayer is
meant.

**NOTE**: To **ascertain** this, it is necessary that:

Stop eating,drinking etc. a **few minutes before** this time

Avoid these things few minutes even **after Maghrib**.

**Attention**: During the month of Ramadhan, if one **changes his
Intention** or purposely intend to do any such work that breaks the
fast, then the fast will be considered void **even if he does not commit
that act**.

QS \# 6 : The kept fast is which one? Is it necessary to decide? Means
can the fast be kept without deciding and afterwards by choice it is
determined as the *qadha* or the expiated fast?

ANS : No rather it is **necessary to decide** if the fasting is being
observed as *qadha* or expiated or for any other purpose.

**Attention**: It is naturally decided in the month of Ramadhan that the
kept fast is of the month of Ramadhan because in this month no other
fast can be observed.

QS \# 7 : I forget that tomorrow is **either 15th** **or 16th** of
Ramadhan. Does this affect fast too?

ANS : No. This does not affect fast.

QS \# 8 : I have not yet decided for tomorrow’s fast. Till **what time
can I intend**?

ANS : It has to be checked that the **fast is of what type**. Whether
it’s obligatory or recommended? If it is obligatory then what type of
obligatory fast it is? This is being explained in the following but
**please note that**:

In few cases you will see that even after the morning summons, it is
permitted to intend. This is **only allowed** in such case when from
morning summons till that time **no such act is committed that breaks a
fast.**

**Example:** Intention for **recommended fast** can be made even a
**minute before** the time of Maghrib but one who had his **lunch** can
not keep this fast.

**Important question \# 1:**

The day of **29th** **Shaban has ended**. It is not known whether the
moon has been sighted or not? What shall I do?

ANSWER: \* **If the moon is sighted** then tomorrow will be the first
day of Ramadhan. It is obligatory to fast.

\* **If the moon is not sighted** then tomorrow will be the 30th of
Shaban. It is not obligatory to fast.

\* **If there is doubt** whether the moon has been sighted or not even
then it is not obligatory to fast.

QS \# 2 : In state of doubt, fasting was not observed. Later it was
known that the moon did appear. Then?

ANS : You did not commit any sin but you have to later observe a *qadha*
for this fast.

QS \# 3 : I want to observe fast on this **day** **of** **doubt**. With
what intention shall I fast? Can I intend that **if** it is the month of
Ramadhan than the fast shall be considered of it **otherwise** for the
month of Shaban?

ANS : Do not intend like this. Instead **if** any *qadha* fast is due on
you then make intention for that **otherwise** observe fast with the
intention for a recommended fast.

**Benefit**:

In this case the benefit will be that later on if it is established that
the moon was sighted then that fast would **automatically** be assumed
as the first fast for the month of Ramadhan.

QS \# 4 : I kept fast with the intention for *Qadha* or Recommended Fast
but **during daytime I came to know** that the moon was sighted and
today is the first of the month of Ramadhan. What shall I do?

ANS : Just change your intention to the fast for the month of Ramadhan.
That is enough.

QS \# 2 : I recite Holy Quran in state of fasting. But my **recitation
is weak**. I have no intention to relate falsehood with Allah. My
intention is to seek reward. Will this affect my fast?

in water in the state of fasting is **highly undesirable**. Means reward
is lessened but **neither is it prohibited nor it invalidates the
fast**.

VOMITING:

Vomiting **intentionally** invalidates a fast. Though one may have been
obliged to do so on account of sickness. However, the fast does not
become void, if one vomits **involuntarily**.

If one **forgets** that he is fasting and vomits even then the fast does
not become void.

**discharge of one’s own semen**.

**NOTE :** It does not make any difference if the help was taken from
something or someone or not.

**Attention:**

This act is prohibited **even if one is not fasting.** However, the case
of **husband** and **wife** is exceptional.

Because of this act, **bath for** ***Janabat*** (ceremonial
uncleanliness) is also to be performed.

While fasting, if this act is done, the **fast will become void** even
if it was the results of husband-wife inter relationship.

QS \# 2 : Does the fast become void by **just** **looking at a**
***Non-Mehram***?

example while **sleeping.**

QS \# 4 : Will the fast become void then?

ANS : No.

QS \# 5 : In such case, is it mandatory for the fasting person to
perform **bath (*****Ghusl*****) immediately?**

ANS : No.

Bath will be necessary before performing **prayers**.

Although performing bath early is definitely **better**.

QS \# 6 : A fasting person knows that **if he sleeps,** **semen would
discharge**, is it permissible for him to sleep?

ANS : **Yes**. Even then he may sleep.

Sexual intercourse (establishing sexual relations):

This also Invalidates the fast, regardless of whether the semen is
discharged or not.

There is no harm for a married couple to indulge in **courtship** with
each other without involving in sexual intercourse.

fast.

QS \# 1 : Husband is not fasting while wife is observing obligatory
fast. Can husband **force** the wife **to have intercourse**?

ANS : No

QS \# 2 : A newly wedded couple went for **honeymoon** to some other
city in the month of Ramadhan. Can they establish **matrimonial
relations during daytime**?

ANS : If the stay is for **less than 10 days** then the decrees for a
traveler would be applicable. Means they cannot fast. In this case
matrimonial relations can be established during daytime but it is not
advisable (*Makrooh*).

If the stay is for **10 days or more** then it is obligatory to fast.
Establishing matrimonial relations will be **prohibited**.

Remaining in the state of *janabat* (ceremonial uncleanliness) till the
call for *fajr* prayers

After being *Junub* (ceremonially unclean), if a person does **not
take** ***Ghusl*** **(bath) till the time for** ***Fajr*** prayers or if
his responsibility is to do ***tayammum*** and he does not perform that,
then in few conditions his fast will become void.

**EXPLANATION:**

If he does not take *ghusl/tayammum* intentionally, then if:

QS \# 1 : If a person **forgets** to perform
***Ghusl*****-e-*****Janabat*** **(bath for ceremonial uncleanliness)**
in the month of Ramadhan and remembers it after few days, then?

ANS : For all those **fasts**

And will perform ***qadha***

For all **prayers** as well

***Janabat**.* Knows that if he goes to **sleep** he will **not wake up
before** ***Fajr*****,**

QS \# 2 : Can he sleep?

ANS : No. It is obligatory for him to perform ***ghusl*** **first.**

If he sleeps without performing *ghusl* and wakes up after *Fajr*
summons, his fast will be void.

QS \# 3 : It is the night of the month of Ramadhan. Zaid is not in the
state of *Janabat*. He went to sleep and wakes up after the *Fajr*
summons and finds that he has become *Junub* in sleep. **Does not know
whether the semen discharged before or after the** ***Fajr***
**summons**. What is his responsibility?

ANS : In any case, his fast remains **valid.**

QS \# 4 : *Ghusl* was **delayed intentionally** till the time for *fajr*
summons remained so less that now ghusl **cannot be performed**. What
should he do?

ANS : He committed a **sin**. But it is obligatory for him to fast after
performing ***tayammum**.*

QS \# 5 : Can he offer his *Fajr* prayers with the same *tayammum*?

ANS : No. When the water is available and time is also sufficient then
it is necessary to perform *Ghusl*.

**Bath for touching dead body and fast:**

This *Ghusl* becomes obligatory because of bringing part of one’s body
**in contact with a dead body** with some conditions.

One **can fast** without performing this obligatory *ghusl*.

**Prayers** cannot be offered until this *ghus*l is performed.

For a woman, after the end of menstruation (*haidh* or *nifas*),
non-performance of bath (*ghusl*) before the call for *fajr* prayers:

If a woman gets pure from *Haidh* or *Nifas* before the call for *Fajr*
prayers in the month of Ramadhan then it is necessary for her to:

\* Perform ***ghusl*** before the *Fajr* summons.

\* If time is short; *ghusl* is not possible then perform
***tayammum**.*

Keep **fast** on that day

QS \# 1 : Can *Fajr* prayers be also performed with that *tayammum*?

ANS : No. if water is available then *ghusl* has to be performed.

QS \# 2 : If one does not perform *tayammum* too, will the fast become
void?

ANS :

**Recommended fast** remains **valid** even without *tayammum.*

QS \# 3 : If a woman gets **pure** during the **daytime** then?

ANS : She can not fast on that day, keep *qadha* later.

QS \# 4 : If the condition of *haidh* or *nifas* begins **during
fasting** then?

ANS : Fast is void even if *Maghrib* is very near. Keep *qadha* for that
fast. Please note that in this case the woman has not committed any sin.

QS \# 5 : A woman gets pure before morning summons but the **time is too
short** for performing either ghusl or *tayammum*?

ANS : Then the fast is valid even without performing *ghusl* and
*tayammum*.

QS \# 6 : If a woman comes to know after the *Fajr* summons that she has
already got pure before the call for prayer then?

ANS : If any of the fast abolisher has not been performed yet then the
fast is valid otherwise it is void. Keep *qadha* later on.

QS \# 7 : Can women use tablets etc. to **change** their **periodical
cycle**?

ANS : Permitted if they are **not** **harmful** for them.

***Istihaza*** **and fast:**

In this case if a woman performs all of the obligatory baths then her
fast is absolutely valid.

**Note** : Details for this are available in ***Tozeeh-ul-Masail***.

ENEMA WITH LIQUIDS:

**Enema**: means to insert medicine from the **place of rectum** in
order to remove **constipation**. This medicine can be solid as well as
liquid.

Taking enema with a **liquid** invalidates a fast, even if he is obliged
to take it for the sake of treatment.

**Attention**: Taking enema with **solids** does not invalidate a fast.
