The Final Words
===============

The Father
----------

My beloved! Concentrate for a moment and think of the conclusion of your
life. If you find my words of advice as I meant them to be, then correct
yourself. And respect the rights of your father and mother and do not
hesitate in fulfilling your obligations to them. And if you did not find
them so, I will leave it then, up to you. And let Allah take care of
you. I will beg him to give you a happy and prosperous life. And to
protect forever under his auspices.

The Child
---------

I wish to thank you for your useful words of advice. They are all
logical. I hope I will be able to put them into practice and treat you
satisfactorily.
