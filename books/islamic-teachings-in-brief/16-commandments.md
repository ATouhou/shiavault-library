Commandments
============

As mentioned in the beginning of this book, the precepts and teachings
of Islam are divided into three parts: beliefs, ethics, and
commandments. After knowing Allah, we must perform actions such as
reciting salat and observing sawm which are the signs of the worship and
obedience to Allah. Now, we would explain the precepts of salat which
would be followed by the precepts of sawm.

**RECITING SALAT**

The Almighty Allah states:

"What has brought you into Hell? They shall say: 'We were not of those
who recited salat' (74:42-43)." The Holy Prophet (SA) states: "Prayer is
the pillar of faith. If it is accepted by Allah, the other worships will
also be accepted and if it is not accepted, the other worships will not
be accepted either." Just like a man who removes dirt and uncleanliness
from his body by washing himself five times a day in a river, he will
also purify himself from sins by reciting salat five times a day.
Surely, it should be known that the one who recites salat but attaches
no significance to it, is like the one who does not recite salat. The
Almighty Allah states in the Holy Qur'an:

"So woe to the ones who recite salat but unmindful of their salawat
(107:4-5)." One day, the Holy Prophet (SA) entered the mosque and saw
that a man was reciting salat but without performing proper ruku' (a
part of the salat in which one bows down, genuflexion) and sujud (the
acts of prostration in the salat or worship to Allah). The Holy Prophet
(SA) stated: "If this man dies in this condition, he will not die as a
Muslim."

Thus a man should recite salat with humility and respect. He should
realize to whom he is talking while reciting salat. He should perform
ruku', sujud, and all other actions correctly in order to be benefited
by best results of reciting salat.

The Almighty Allah states in the Holy Qur'an:

"...Surely the salat keeps (one) away from indecency and
evil...(29:45)." Surely, this is true, for the rules of reciting salat
are such that, if observed, the person who recites salat will never be
tempted to evil acts.

For example, one of the rules of reciting salat is that the place where
one recites salat and the clothes with which one recites salat should
not be usurped or unlawful. His salat is not accepted even if a single
thread of his clothes is usurped. One who shuns haram things to such an
extent, will never use haram wealth and property at all and will never
deny the rights of others. Also the salat will be accepted provided that
man keeps himself away from avarice, jealousy, and other indecent and
bad qualities. It is certain that the source of all indecencies is these
bad qualities. If one who recites salat keeps himself away from these
qualities, he will definitely be free from all indecencies and evil
acts. If some people perform indecent deeds even though they recite
salat, it is because they do not exactly follow the necessary rules of
reciting salat. As a result, salawat are not accepted and they do not
enjoy the excellent advantages of reciting salat.

The holy religion of Islam has attached such an importance to salat
that it has made it wajib for every Muslim under all the circumstances,
even at the point of death. If one cannot recite Surat al-Hamd and the
other surah, and other dhikr (words for remembering Allah) of salat, he
should pass these through his heart. If he is unable to recite salat in
a standing posture, he should recite salat in a sitting position. If he
is unable to recite salat even in sitting position, he should do so in
lying down. In any case, under no circumstances a man is exempted from
reciting salat. If one who w ants to recite salat cannot face the Qiblah
(facing towards Ka'bah while reciting salat) in the state of war, for
the fear of the enemy, or in emergency cases, he can recite salat
without facing the Qiblah and he should recite salat in whatever
condition or direction he is.

WAJIB SALAWAT

There are six wajib salawat: (i) Al-salat al-yawmiyyah (the daily
prayers); (ii) Salat al-ayat (the prayer of the signs of Allah's
creation); (iii) Salat al-mayyit (the prayer for the dead person); (iv)
Salat of wajib tawaf (the ritual prayer of circumambulation around the
Ka'bah); (v) Qada' (settling the salawat which had not been performed in
time) Salawat of the father which become wajib on the eldest son upon
the death of the father; and
(vi) Salawat which become wajib upon a person due to: ijarah (receipt
of money by him for their recitation), nadhr (vow), qasam (oath), and
'ahd (promise).

PREREQUISITES OF SALAT

Reciting salat, i.e. standing before Allah, expressing servitude to
Him, and worshipping Him, requires certain prerequisites. Salat is not
valid unless these prerequisites are met. These essential requirements
are: (i) taharah (specified Islamic way of purification), (ii) time,
(iii) dress, (iv) place, and (v) Qiblah.

These prerequisites have been explained in detail here.


(i) TAHARAH

One who recites salat should be tahir; that is, he should recite salat
as per the requirements, viz: by having wudu' (statutory ablution
according to Islamic Shari'ah) before salat, or by wajib ghusl (taking
bath according to the Islamic Shari'ah) or by tayammum (statutory
Islamic ablution with soil, sand, etc) and also his body and dress
should not be polluted with najasah.

NAJIS SUBSTANCES

There are several substances which are najis (inherently impure). They.
are as follows: First and Second: The urine and faeces (The outlet of
urination must be made tahir only by water, but the outlet of faeces can
be washed with water or cleaned with three pieces of stone and the like
provided the faeces have not exceeded the outlet of defecation;
otherwise, it will not be cleaned by anything other than water. It
should be reminded that if faeces are not cleaned by three pieces of
stone, more pieces of stone can be used to clean the outlet thoroughly)
of animals whose meat is haram for eating and whose blood gushes out,
meaning the animals whose blood will gush out if their blood vessels are
cut, such as cats, foxes, rabbits, etc. If the flesh of chicken or birds
or animals has become haram for eating due to their eating faeces, then
the urine and faeces of such birds or animals are also najis.

Third: The carcass of an animal whose blood gushes out (if its blood
vessels are cut) whether its flesh is halal or haram for eating. But
some parts of the carcass, such as its wool, hair, and nails which are
soulless, are tahir. Fourth: The blood of an animal whose blood gushes
out (if its blood vessels are cut) whether its meat is halal or haram
for eating. Fifth and Sixth: All parts of the body of wild dogs and
pigs, even their hair, are najis.

Seventh: Wine and anything which intoxicates a man and is basically in
liquid form.

Eighth: Beer.

MUTAHHIRAT (PURIFIERS)

Anything which purifies (and makes tahir) najis substances is called a
mutahhir (purifier which purifies a najis). Mutahhirat are as follows:
(i) Water is a mutahhir which makes tahir all najis substances provided
that the water is mutlaq (pure). Thus mudaf (mixed) water, such as the
juice of watermelon and rose-water are not mutahhirat and do not make
tahir the najasah. Wudu' and ghusl with mudaf water are not valid either
(There are two kinds of water: kurr and qail (small quantity, i.e., less
than kurr). Kurr water is a certain quantity of water which can make
tahir any najis object as long as its colour, taste, and smell have not
been altered. It is 128 manns of Tabriz (Mann is a unit of weight of
approximately 3 kg.) minus 20 mithqal (unit of weight of about 4.6 g)
and is equal to 384 kg. Kurr water will not become najis if a najis
object reaches it. Qalil water, i.e., less than kurr is the water which
becomes najis if a najis object reaches it. Its taharah is dependent
upon its connection to the flowing water or rain or the addition of kurr
water to it.).

(ii) Ground: It makes tahir the sole of the shoes and the sole of the
feet. (iii) Sun: The najis ground and strawmats will become tahir by the
direct rays of the sun.

(iv) Istihalah (The transformation or a chemical change of the state of
an object): In this chemical process, the very commodity of the najis
object transforms and becomes tahir, for example, a dog that falls in a
salt lake and transforms into salt. (v) Blood transfusion: It means the
transfusion of a man's blood or the blood of an animal whose blood
gushes out, into the body of an animal whose blood does not gush out,
such as the transfusion of man's blood into the body of a mosquito, fly,
etc.

(vi) The removal of the very najasah from the outer parts of an animal
and the inner parts of a man, for example, if the back of an animal or
the nostril of a man becomes najis with blood, it will be tahir after
blood is removed, and there is no need for flowing water over it. (vii)
Following: It means that a najis becomes tahir as a result of becoming
the najis the tahir, for example, if a kafir becomes Muslim, his child
will also become tahir as a result of following him.

(viii) Diminishment, i.e., loss of two-thirds of volume of grape-juice:
If the grape-juice is boiled, it becomes najis. However, if it loses
two-thirds of its volume as a result of boiling, the remainder becomes
tahir.

WUDU' AND ITS PRECEPTS

It is mustahabb for a man to brush his teeth and rinse his mouth with
.clean water before performing wudu' . . It is also mustahabb for a man
to inhale tahir water up his nostrils.


THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR WUDU'

In performing wudu', the face must be rinsed first by taking water in
the hand and wiping it over the face beginning from the place of growing
hair of head (forehead) downward to the chin. Next, the right elbow
should be rinsed by taking water in the left hand and wiping it from the
elbow downward to the fingertips. This procedure should also be exactly
performed for the left elbow using the right hand. Then for mash
(anointing), the front portion of the head must be anointed. Then the
right foot followed by the left foot must be anointed from the toe-tips
to the upper part of both feet with the fingers. The following should be
observed while performing wudu'.

(1) The parts of body related to wudu' must be tahir while performing
wudu,

(2) The water for wudu' must be tahir, mutlaq and mubah
(permissible).

(3) Niyyah (intention), i.e., wudu' must be performed for the pleasure
of Allah; and hence if someone performs wudu' with an intention of
cooling and comforting himself or for any other purpose, his wudu' will
not be right.

(4) Tartib (the order as prescribed by Islamic Shari'ah), that is,
wudu' must be performed in the prescribed order. The face must be washed
first, next the right hand which should he followed by washing of the
left hand. The head and the feet should be anointed afterwards.

(5) Muwalat (performing the parts of an Islamic act in succession
without undue delay): It means that wudu' must be performed in
succession without undue delay. One should not allow a time gap while
washing or anointing the subsequent part to the extent that the previous
part gets dried up. However, if wudu' is performed consecutively but the
moisture gets dried up due to hot weather, the high temperature of the
body, and the like, the wudu' will be valid.

Note: While performing mash, it is not necessary to anoint the scalp,
rather it is also correct to anoint the hair of the front portion of the
head. But if the hair of other parts of the head gather in the front
portion of the head, then these should be pushed back. If the hair in
the front portion of the head are very long, i.e., if combed, these
reach up to the face, then the root of the hair must be anointed or the
hair should be parted and the scalp must be anointed.

MUBTILAT OF THE WUDU'

The things or acts which make the wudu' invalid are called the mubtilat
(things or acts through which, the salat, the sawm, the wudu', etc
become invalid). There are eight items which render the wudu' invalid:
(i) urination; (ii) defecation; (iii) wind or flatus (wind in the
stomach or intestines) this is when flatus comes out from the usual
outlet or from an outlet that is changed due to illness and surgery;
(iv) unconsciousness; (v) drunkenness; (vi) falling asleep when the eyes
cannot see and the ears cannot hear; however, if the eyes are unable to
see, but the ears can hear, the wudu' will not be batil (invalid); (vii)
insanity; and (viii) janabah (major ritual impurity or al-hadath
al-akbar caused by the sexual intercourse, or the like) resulting from
sexual intercourse or by seminal ejaculation and other things for which
one should perform ghusl. Also, istihadah (menstrual bleeding), whenever
noticed by women, makes the wudu' batil.

THE GHUSL

The ghusl can be performed in two ways: ghusl tartibi (performing ghusl
by washing the body part by part as specified in Islamic Shari'ah) and
ghusl irtimasi ( performing ghusl by the immersion of the whole body in
water).

The ghusl tartibi should be performed in the prescribed order, i.e.,
the head and the neck should be washed with water first, then the right
side of the body, and finally the left side of the body.

For the ghusl irtimasi, one should completely immerse h is body into
the water at once.

There are two types of ghusl: wajib and mustahabb. The mustahabb ghusul
are numerous in Islamic Shari'ah but the wajib ghusul are seven: (i)
ghusl al-janabah; (ii) ghusl almayyit (bathing the dead body); (iii)
ghusl mass al-mayyit (performing ghusl due to touching of the dead
body), i.e., if one touches a dead body after it has become cold and
before its ghusl al-mayyit, he must perform ghusl mass al-mayyit. (iv)
performing ghusl for the fulfilment of a nadhr, 'ahd, or qasam; (v)
ghusl al-hayd; (performing ghusl after menstruation); (vi) ghusl
al-nifas (performing ghusl after puerperal period); and (vii) ghusl
al-istihadah. The first four ghusul are wajib both for men and women and
the last three are wajib for only women.

While one is in the state of janabah, the following acts are haram for
him: (i) touching the writing of the Holy Qur'an, the name of Allah, and
the names of the Prophet (SA) and the infallible Imams (AS); (ii)
entering al-Masjid al-Haram and the Masjid al-Nabi in Madinah; (iii)
staying in other mosques and leaving something in them; and (iv)
reciting any one of the four suwar of the Holy Qur'an which require
wajib sajdah, viz, the suwar of al-Najm, Iqra' Alif-Lam-Mim Tanzil, and
Ha-Mim Tanzil. For the other precepts on janabah, hayd, nifas and
istihadah one should refer to al-Risalah al-'Amaliyyah.

Note: Like in the case of wudu', niyyah is also required while
performing ghusl. The body should be tahir before performing ghusl and
there should be no obstacle for the water to reach the whole body.


THE TAYAMMUM

If a person is unable to perform wudu' or ghusl for reciting salat and
the like due to the lack of time, illness, or non-availability of water
and the like, he should perform tayammum (statutory Islamic ablution
with soil, sand, etc).

PROCEDURES FOR TAYAMMUM

There are four obligatory factors in doing tayammum:

(i) Niyyah; (ii) Simultaneous striking both palms on soil or on
something upon which tayammum is valid; (iii) Drawing both palms on the
whole forehead starting from the hairline to the eyebrows and the top of
the nose. It is better to draw the hands over the eyebrows as well. (iv)
Then drawing the left palm on the entire back of the right hand (from
wrist to fingertips). Next, drawing the right palm on the entire back of
the left hand: This much is sufficient when tayammum is performed
instead of wudu' However, if the tayammum is being performed instead of
ghusl, one should strike both palms on the soil, etc once again and draw
the palms on the back of the hands, as mentioned above.

THE PRECEPTS PERTAINING TO TAYAMMUM

(i) The tayammum should be performed on tahir soil. If soil is not
available, the tayammum may be performed on sand or pebbles. In the
absence of pebbles, it can be performed on stones. In the case of the
non-availability of all of these, the tayammum can be performed on dust
accumulated at a place.

(ii) The tayammum is not valid on lime and other minerals.

(iii) If water is sold at a high price and in case one can afford to
buy it, he is not permitted to perform tayammum, rather he must purchase
the water and perform wudu' and ghusl.

(ii) TIME

The next prerequisite for reciting salat is the time. The salawat must
be recited in a sequence. Salat al- Zuhr (noon prayer) and Salat al-'Asr
(afternoon prayer) each has a specific and common time. The specific
time for Salat al-Zuhr is from beginning of zuhr (If a piece of wood or
a similar object is erected on a flat ground, its shadow is cast towards
the west when the sun begins to shine in the morning. The more the sun
rises up, the smaller this shadow becomes. The shadow becomes the
smallest at zuhr or noon. As the zuhr passes, the shadow changes its
direction and tends towards the east. The more the sun moves towards the
west, the longer the shadow gets. Thus, when the shadow reaches the
smallest length and begins to get longer again, it indicates the zuhr.
But it should be remembered that in some cities, like Makkah, the shadow
disappears entirely at noon. In cities like this the time at which the
shadow reappears indicates the zuhr.) or noon until the time required to
recite Salat al-Zuhr. If a person recites the Salat al-'Asr even
inadvertently at this time, it will be invalid. The specific time for
the Salat al-'Asr is the time before the evening just enough to recite
the Salat al-'Asr. If a person has not recited the Salat al-Zuhr until
then, his Salat al-Zuhr has become qada'

and he should recite the Salat al-'Asr. Between the specific time of
the Salat al- Zuhr and the specific time of the Salat al-'Asr' is the
common time for reciting the both. If one inadvertently recites the
Salat al-'Asr' before the Salat al-Zuhr during this entire common time,
his salat is valid. and he should recite the Salat al-Zuhr afterwards.

The Salat al-Maghrib (evening prayer) and Salat al-'Isha' (night
prayer) each has a specific and common time. The specific time for Salat
al-Maghrib (The maghrib is approximately 15 minutes after the sunset. It
is signified by the disappearance of the redness which appears in the
east after the sunset.) is from the evening until the time required for
reciting the Salat al-Maghrib. Th e specific time for Salat al-'Isha' is
the time before the midnight (The midnight, from Islamic point of view,
is eleven hours and fifteen minutes after zuhr.) just enough to recite
the Salat al-'Isha'. If a person has not recited the Salat al-Maghrib up
to this time, he should first recite the Salat al-'Isha' and then the
Salat al-Maghrib.

Between the specific time of the Salat al-Maghrib and the specific time
of the Salat al-'Isha' is the common time for reciting the both. If
during this common time, one inadvertently recites the Salat al-'Isha'
before the Salat al-Maghrib, his salat is valid and he should recite the
Salat al-Maghrib afterwards.

The time for the Salat al-Subh (morning prayer) is from the beginning
of true aurora or the first light of dawn (At dawn, a whiteness in the
sky moves upward from the east which is called the first or false
aurora. When the whiteness is spread, it is the true aurora and the time
for the Adhan (call) for the Salat al-Subh, and the beginning of the
time of the Salat al-Subh.) till just before sunrise.

(iii) DRESS

The third prerequisite for reciting the salat is the dress of the
person who recites salat. The dress should meet the following
conditions:

(i) The dress should be mubah. It should be owned by the person
reciting the salat. If it does not belong to him, its owner should be
willing to let him recite salat with it.

(ii) It should not be najis.

(iii) It should not be made of the skin of carcass, irrespective of the
carcass belonging to the animals whose meat is halal or haram to eat.

(iv) It should not be made of the wool, hair, and the fluff of an
animal whose meat is haram to eat, but it is possible to recite salat
with a fur dress.

(v) The dress of a male person who recites salat should not be made of
silk and gold threads. He must also not wear ornaments or dress made of
gold or silk while reciting the salat. Putting on silken dress and using
ornaments made of gold are haram for men even while not reciting the
salat.

(iv) PLACE

A few conditions apply to the place where one recites salat:

(i) It must be mubah., i.e., it should not be usurped.

(ii) The place for reciting salat should be stationary. If one is
compelled to recite salat in moving vehicles, such as automobiles or
ships, he may do so provided he attempts to pray towards the Qiblah. If
the direction of the vehicle changes during the salat, one must change
his direction also accordingly so that he always faces the Qiblah.

(iii) If the place where one recites the salat is najis, it should not
be so wet that the moisture permeates to his dress and body. But if the
place where one puts his forehead on is najis, the salat is batil even
though the place may be dry.

(iv) The place where one puts his forehead on should not be more than
four closed fingers lower or higher than where one puts his knees and
toes at the time of performing sujud.

(v) QIBLAH

The Ka'bah, located in the holy city of Makkah, is the Qiblah of the
Muslims and anyone who recites salat must always face the Qiblah. But if
a person, who is far away from it, stands or sits in such a way that it
is said he is reciting salat in the direction of Qiblah, his salat is
valid. Similarly, other acts such as slaughtering of animals must be
done while facing the Qiblah.

If it is not possible for a man to recite salat even in a sitting
posture, he should lie down on his right side such that the front
section of his body faces the Qiblah. If this is also not possible, he
should lie down on his left side such that again the front section of
his body faces the Qiblah. If this is not possible either, he should lie
down on his back such that the soles of his feet face the Qiblah.

If one who wants to recite salat is unable to discover the direction of
Qiblah after a thorough investigation, he must go by the opinion which
he has from the altars of the Muslims, or their graves, or other means
available to him.

MANDATORY ACTS WHILE RECITING THE SALAT

The following eleven acts are mandatory while one recites salat:

(i) Niyyah; (ii) Takbirat al-ihram (the first takbir, i.e., Allahu
Akbar -Allah is Great - said at the beginning of the salat just after
the niyyah,); (iii) qiyam (the standing erect while reciting the salat;
(iv) qira'ah (the recitation in the salat), (v) ruku' (vi) sujud; (vii)
tashahhud (testifying for Tawhid of Allah and prophethood of Prophet
Muhammad (SA)]; (viii) salam; (ix) tartib. I.e., recitation of salat in
accordance with the prescribed sequence without changing the order of
performance; (x) tuma'ninah; i.e., recitation of salat with quietude and
repose; and (xi) muwalat, i.e., reciting all parts of salat in
succession without undue delay.

Five out of the eleven items mentioned above are called the rukns
(basic parts) of the salat. Deliberate or inadvertent additions or
deletions of the rukns will render the salat "batil" But the rest of the
above-mentioned items are not rukns. It means that the addition or
deletion of these items (other than rukns) will not render the salat
"batil" unless they are done intentionally.

THE RUKNS OF THE SALAT

The rukns of the salat consist of the following: (1) niyyah, (ii)
takbirat al-ihram, (iii) qiyam, i.e., standing erect while saying
takbirat al-ihram and also the qiyam just before the ruku', and (iv)
ruku', and (v) the two sujud.

(i) Niyyah: Niyyah means that the sole purpose of the person who
recites salat is to seek qurbah (pleasure of Allah) to Allah and to
comply with His commands. It is not necessary to pass the niyyah through
the heart or, for example, to mention: "I recite four raka'at (sections
of salat) of Salat al-Zuhr with the intention of seeking pleasure of
Allah."

(ii) Takbirat al-ihram: The salat begins right after Adhan (the
specified wordings called out at salat time) and Iqamah (the specified
wordings, almost similar to the Adhan and recited after it, before
commencing the salat), with niyyah and saying Allahu Akbar. Since at
this point of time, several acts such as eating, drinking, laughing, and
turning the back to Qiblah become haram, this takbir (saying "Allahu
Akbar" i.e., Allah is Great) is called "takbirat al-ihram". It is
mustahabb to raise both the hands while saying takbirat al-ihram. By
this action, we take the Greatness of Allah into consideration and
consider other than Allah insignificant and pay no attention to them.

(iii) Qiyam: The qiyam while saying takbirat al-ihram and also the
qiyam just before the ruku' is one of the rukns of the salat; but the
qiyam or standing erect while reciting the Surat al-Hamd and the other
surah and the qiyam after ruku' are not the rukns. Thus, if one forgets
to perform ruku' and remembers it before reaching ground for performing
sujud, he should stand erect and then perform ruku'. If he performs
ruku' in a bent position, his salat is batil because he did not have
qiyam as is required just before performing ruku'.

(iv) Ruku': After the qira'ah, one should bend his body in such a way
that his palms reach his knees. This action is called ruku'. While in
ruku', one who recites salat, must say once: "Subhana Rabbiyal-'Azimi wa
bihamdih (all glory and praise is for my Lord, the Mighty)", or he must
say thrice: "Subhanallah (all glory is due to Allah)". After the
completion of ruku', one must always stand erect before performing
sujud.

(v) Sujud: Performing sujud means that one should lay his forehead,
palms, knees, and the tips of his toes on the ground. He should then say
once: "Subhana Rabbiyal-A'la wa bihamdih (all glory and praise is for my
Lord, the Most High)';, or he must say thrice: "Subhanallah (all glory
is due to Allah)". After completing the first sajdah, he must sit before
performing the second sajdah and repeating the previous recitation. The
forehead must be laid on the ground or on something growing from the
ground. Sujud is not ja'iz (permissible) on foodstuffs, clothing
materials, and minerals.

TASHAHHUD AND SALAM

If the salat consists of two raka'at, one should stand up after
performing two sujud and should recite the Surat al-Hamd and the other
surah. One must then perform qunut [After the recitation of the Surat
al-Hamd and the other surah in the second rak'ah of the salat, one holds
his palms before his face and recites any dhikr and supplication that he
wishes. For example, he may say: "Rabbana atina fiddunya hasanah wa
fil-Akhirati hasanah waqina 'adhabannar (O our Lord grant us goodness in
this world and the Hereafter and save us from the torment of the
Fire)."] and recite tashahhud [The following should be recited in
tashahhud:

"Ashhadu an la ilaha illalah, wahdahu la sharika lah, wa ashhadu anna
Muhammadan 'abduhu wa rasuluh, allahumma salli 'ala Muhammadin wa ali
Muhammad (I bear witness that there is no god except Allah; He is One,
for Whom there is no partner; I bear witness that surely Muhammad (SA)
is His servant and His Prophet; O Allah shower Your blessings on
Muhammad (SA) and his progeny.)"] and salam [The following should be
said in salam: "Assalamu 'alayka ayyuhan-Nabiyyu wa rahmatullahi wa
barakatuh; assalamu 'alayna wa 'ala 'Ibadillahissalihin; assalamu
'alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh (May peace be upon you, O Prophet
(SA), and mercy and blessings of Allah. May peace be upon us and on all
servants of Allah who guard against evil. May peace be upon you all
together with mercy and blessings of Allah.)"] after ruku' and both the
sujud. If the salat is of three raka'at, one should stand up after
reciting tashahhud and must recite the Surat al-Hamd only or must say:
"Subhanallahi walhamdu lillahi wa la ilaha illallahu wallahu akbar (All
glory and praise to Allah, and there is no god but Allah, and Allah is
Great.)" three times, perform ruku' and two sujud and recite tashahhud
and salam. If the salat consists of four raka'at, one must perform the
fourth rak'ah like the third rak'ah and recite tashahhud and salam.

SALAT AL-AYAT

The Salat al-Ayat (the salat of Allah's creation or signs) becomes
wajib under any one of the four following conditions: (i) solar eclipse;
(ii) lunar eclipse, although it may be partially eclipsed and even
though it may not create fear among the people; (iii) earthquake,
although it may not create fear for anyone: (iv) thunder, lightning. red
and black winds or storms, and the like which create 'fear among most
people.

THE PROCEDURE FOR RECITING THE SALAT AL-AYAT

The Salatal-Ayat consists of two raka'at There are five ruku' in each
rak'ah. The procedure for reciting Salat al-Ayat is as follows. After
nuyyah and saying takbirat alihram, one should recite the Surat al-Hamd
and another complete surah. He must then perform ruku'. Standing erect
at this point, he should once again recite the Surat al-Hamd and another
surah and perform ruku'. This procedure should be repeated five times.
After the completion of the fifth ruku', he should stand erect and then
perform two sujud. At this point, the first rak'ah is completed. He
should then stand erect and perform the second rak'ah exactly as the
first one. The Salat al-Ayat is completed after the recitation of
tashahhud and salam.

In the Salat al-Ayat, after the niyyah, takbirat al-ihram, and reciting
the Surat al-Hamd, it is possible for the one who is reciting the salat
to divide the Ayahs of a surah into five parts and read one Ayah or more
before performing ruku'. He should then stand up and recite the second
part of the partially read surah without reciting the Surat al-Hammd.
Then he should perform ruku'. He should exactly follow this procedure
until the fifth ruku' and he must complete the surah by then.
Afterwards, he must perform ruku' and two sujud. The second rak'ah of
the salat is performed exactly in the same manner as the first one.

THE SALAT OF A TRAVELLER

A traveller must recite two raka'at instead of his four rak'ah salawat
under the following six conditions:

(i) His journey must cover not less than eight farsakhs (each farsakh
is of about 5.6 kilometres). Alternatively, if his going covers four
farsakhs and his returning equals to four farsakhs.

(ii) He must have the intention to travel eight farsakhs prior to the
start of his journey.

(iii) He must not change his mind in the course of his travel.

(iv) His journey should not be undertaken with an intention of
committing a sin.

(v) He must not be a traveller by profession. Thus, a person whose
profession requires travelling (like a driver) must recite his salat
completely. However, if he stays in his house for ten days, for his
three journeys, he must recite his 4-rak'ah salawat as qasr (reciting
two raka'at instead of 4-rak'ah salawat).

(vi) When he reaches the limit of the tarakhkhus (seeing off), i.e., he
reaches a distance, from his hometown or from a place where he has
intended to stay for ten days, from where he can neither see the walls
of the city nor hear the Adhan of the city.

SALAT AL-JAMA'AH (CONGREGATIONAL PRAYER)

It is mustahabb for all Muslims to recite al-salat alyawmiyyah in the
form of salat al-jama'ah. The thawab (Allah's reward) for salat
al-jama'ah is several thousand times more than the thawab for the salat
recited individually.

CONDITIONS CONCERNING SALAT AL-JAMA'AH

(i) Imam al-jama'ah (the leader or imam of congregational salat) must
be a mukallaf (the one who reached the age of maturity and thus became
responsible for performing the Islamic duties) believer, just, and born
legitimately. He must recite the salat correctly. If the ma'mum (the
follower who follows the imam in salat al-jama'ah) is a man, the imam of
the salat al-jama'ah must also be a man.

(ii) There should be no curtain, barriers, or obstacles between the
imam and his ma'mum, so that the ma'mum is unable to see the imam. But
if the ma'mum is a woman, a curtain and the like is permissible.

(iii) The place where the imam stands must not be higher than that of
his ma'mum, but there is no objection if the place is slightly higher
(about the height of four fingers or less) than that of the ma'mum.

(iv) The ma'mum must stand behind the imam or in his row (most of the
'ulama' prefer that ma'mum should stand behind the imam).

THE PRECEPTS CONCERNING SALAT AL-JAMA'AH

(i) The ma'mum must recite all parts of the salat himself, except the
Surat al- Hamd and another surah after it. But if his first and second
raka'at correspond to the third and fourth raka'at of the imam's salat,
he must recite the Suratal- Hamd and another surah as well. If as a
result of reading the other surah, he feels that he would not catch up
with the imam in ruku', he should only read the Surat al- Hamd and
perform the ruku' with the imam simultaneously. If he fails to do so, he
should complete his salat individually.

(ii) The ma'mum must perform ruku', sujud, and other parts of salat
simultaneously with the imam or shortly after the imam, but he must
certainly say takbirat al-ihram and recite salam only after the imam has
done so.

(iii) If one commences iqtida' or follows the imam while he is in the
state of ruku' and catches up with the imam in ruku', his salat is
correct and is counted as one rak'ah of salat.
