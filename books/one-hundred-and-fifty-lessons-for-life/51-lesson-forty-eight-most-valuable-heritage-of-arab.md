Lesson Forty Eight: Most valuable heritage of Arab
==================================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَصْدَقُ كَلِمَة قالَتْها الْعَرَبُ كَلِمَةُ لُبَيْد: ألا كُلُّ شَىء
ما خَلاَ اللّه باطِلُ، وَ كُلُّ نَعِيْم لا مَحَالَةَ زائلُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The most accurate and eloquent phrase that an Arab has stated is the
speech of Lobaid (famous poet) where he says: be aware anything other
than God is false and any grace would be finally lost.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Awareness of the eventual destruction of wealth and positions and end of
graces admonishes man to observe truth and justice in gaining them and
to be moderate in consuming them.

Eternity and everlasting are terms that can only be applied to God’s
majestic stature, just as indestructibility and morality are
attributable only to His pure essence.

One should remember this reality in every phase of material life and
keep away from arrogance.
