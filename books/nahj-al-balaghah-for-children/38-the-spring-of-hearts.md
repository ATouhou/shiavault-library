The Spring Of Hearts
====================

Learn the Qur'an,

for it is the most splendid of all speech;

and become learned in it,

for it is **the spring of the hearts**.

Cure yourselves with its light,

for it is a remedy for sick hearts.

Recite it in the best manner,

for it is the fairest of accounts.

(Sermon 110)
