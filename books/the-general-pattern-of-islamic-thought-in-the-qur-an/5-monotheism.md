Monotheism
==========

Monotheism in the Islamic Ideology
----------------------------------

The Quranic monotheism is not an indifferent and irresponsible concept.
It is rather a committed and a constructive notion. It is a way of
thinking which has an effective role in the construction and
administration of the society. It defines the aim and the strategy of
the society. Monotheism is indeed one of the cornerstones - the
principal one - of Islamic ideology.

The dependence of the world and man on the Superior Power (God) demands
the world to have been created for a purpose. It also demands
responsibility: that is man by using his power of thinking and decision
should choose the straight path in order to achieve an aim. He should
actually know this aim and the direction which ends in it.

Considering God as the only Creator of the world necessitates that the
power of legislation be exclusive to His Will, and all the animate who
possess common sense be subject to follow His rules (Exclusive
Divinity). Also, the infinite knowledge of God demands that the
competency of making rules of men, which are unavoidably based on man's
needs and interests, be solely confined to Him.

The uniform servitude of all the living things towards God necessitates
that none of His creatures be granted the right to govern over others
(negation of idolatry). It also necessitates that the leader of mankind
be the one whom God himself has chosen to govern, either by appointing
the infallible Imams or by defining the criteria for Islamic governors
at the time of the infallible Imam's absence.

The following verses of the Qur'an will elucidate parts of the Islamic
thought about monotheism.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَتَّخِذُ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ أَنْدَادًا
يُحِبُّونَهُمْ كَحُبِّ اللَّهِ ۖ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَشَدُّ حُبًّا
لِلَّهِ ۗ وَلَوْ يَرَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا إِذْ يَرَوْنَ الْعَذَابَ
أَنَّ الْقُوَّةَ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعَذَابِ
إِذْ تَبَرَّأَ الَّذِينَ اتُّبِعُوا مِنَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوا
وَرَأَوُا الْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ الْأَسْبَابُ وَقَالَ
الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوا لَوْ أَنَّ لَنَا كَرَّةً فَنَتَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُمْ
كَمَا تَبَرَّءُوا مِنَّا ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُرِيهِمُ اللَّهُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ
حَسَرَاتٍ عَلَيْهِمْ ۖ وَمَا هُمْ بِخَارِجِينَ مِنَ النَّارِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Yet of mankind are some who take unto themselves (objects of worship
which they set as) rivals to Allah, loving them with a love like (that
which is the due) of Allah (only) - those who believe are stauncher in
their love for Allah –***
***(On the day) when those who were followed disown those who followed
(them), and they behold the doom, and all their aims collapse with
them.***
***And those who were but followers will say: If a return were possible
for us, we would disown them even as they have disowned us. Thus will
Allah show them their own deeds as anguish for them, and they will not
emerge from the Fire. (2: 165-167)***

God Exclusive Obedience and Worship
-----------------------------------

So far we understood that monotheism is not only a philosophical concept
but a belief on which man's social and individual life should be based.

Some of the general articles of the Monotheistic Resolution the Qur'an
are as follows:

According to the principle of monotheism, human beings do not have the
right to worship or obey any person or anything except God. On this
basis all the sufferings and oppressions which have been imposed on
mankind by false gods throughout the history have been devoid of any
true justification. This general statement includes idols, gods, tyrants
and finally the inclinations of the carnal soul. The following verses
which are about false gods whether mankind or other things-clarify the
general pattern of this aspect of monotheism.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ نَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا
مَكَانَكُمْ أَنْتُمْ وَشُرَكَاؤُكُمْ ۚ فَزَيَّلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ ۖ
وَقَالَ شُرَكَاؤُهُمْ مَا كُنْتُمْ إِيَّانَا تَعْبُدُونَ فَكَفَىٰ

عَنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا يَفْتَرُونَ قُلْ مَنْ يَرْزُقُكُمْ مِنَ
السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَمَّنْ يَمْلِكُ السَّمْعَ وَالْأَبْصَارَ
وَمَنْ يُخْرِجُ الْحَيَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ
الْحَيِّ وَمَنْ يُدَبِّرُ الْأَمْرَ ۚ فَسَيَقُولُونَ اللَّهُ ۚ فَقُلْ
أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"'And the day We shall muster them all, then We shall say to those
who associate partners (with God): ·Get you to your place, you and your
associates. Then We shall separate between them, and their associates
will say, 'Not us you were serving. God is a sufficient witness between
us and you; assuredly we were heedless of your service. There every soul
shall prove its past deeds: and they shall be restored to God, their
Lord, and the True and there shall go astray from them that they were
forging Say: 'Who provides you out of the heaven and earth, or who
possesses hearing and sight, and who brings forth the living from the
dead and brings forth the dead from the living, and who directs the
affair?' They will surely say, 'God' Then say: 'Will you not be
God-fearing?"' (10:28-31)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْ هَلْ مِنْ شُرَكَائِكُمْ مَنْ يَهْدِي إِلَى الْحَقِّ ۚ قُلِ
اللَّهُ يَهْدِي لِلْحَقِّ ۗ أَفَمَنْ يَهْدِي إِلَى الْحَقِّ أَحَقُّ
أَنْ يُتَّبَعَ أَمَّنْ لَا يَهِدِّي إِلَّا أَنْ يُهْدَىٰ ۖ فَمَا
لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Say: 'ls there any of your associates who guides to the truth?' Say:
'God guides to the truth; and who is worthier to be followed-He Who
guides to the truth, or he who guides not unless he is guided? What then
ails you, how you judge?" (10:35)***

It is clear that to guide and being guided is a quality which man
deserves. Thus, the above verse is about those men who proclaim
themselves as gods or consider themselves to be the partners of God and
oblige other people to obey them as slaves. ! Islam negates the
servitude to the pretended gods, being religious powers (monks) or
political and economic powers (tyrants, nobles and rich men).

In a verse of the Qur'an Islam offers the following suggestion to the
people of the Book:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ تَعَالَوْا إِلَىٰ كَلِمَةٍ سَوَاءٍ
بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَلَا نُشْرِكَ
بِهِ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضًا أَرْبَابًا مِنْ دُونِ
اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَقُولُوا اشْهَدُوا بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Say: 'People of the Scripture come now to a word common between us
and you, that we worship none but God, and that we associate not aught
with Him, and do not some of us take others as Lord s. apart from God.'
And if they turn their backs, say: 'Bear witness that we are Muslims."'
(3:64)***

However, the Qur'an considers people's obedience to the true believers
as an obedience to God , and in a few verses it introduces the executive
powers of the Islamic community (the Prophet and those who are in
authority, i.e. Ulil amr[^1].

The Spirit of Monotheism: Negation of Servitude to False Deities
----------------------------------------------------------------

Scrutinizing about some other verses of Qur'an will much more clarify
the effect of monotheism and its monotheistic procedure on individual
life and social organizations.

According to the Qur'an, the refusal to worship false gods does not
necessarily imply that one is a monotheist. In order to be considered a
monotheist, one has to negate the obedience to the opponents of God as
well. This point is so much evident in the Qur'an that those who obey
false gods are called idolaters. In this way worshipping God which is
the meaning and the spirit of monotheism can be called the exclusive
obedience and servitude to God.

Thus, the obedience to and the worshipping of false gods being in the
form of an individual's commands, public rules, social organization or
so forth is considered idolatry. This is why with the protesting tone
monotheism is manifested in the verses of the Qur'an such as the
following:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَفَغَيْرَ اللَّهِ أَبْتَغِي حَكَمًا وَهُوَ الَّذِي أَنْزَلَ
إِلَيْكُمُ الْكِتَابَ مُفَصَّلًا ۚ وَالَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ الْكِتَابَ
يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ مُنَزَّلٌ مِنْ رَبِّكَ بِالْحَقِّ ۖ فَلَا

وَإِنْ تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَنْ سَبِيلِ
اللَّهِ ۚ إِنْ يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا الظَّنَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا
يَخْرُصُونَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ مَنْ يَضِلُّ عَنْ سَبِيلِهِ ۖ
وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُهْتَدِينَ فَكُلُوا مِمَّا ذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللَّهِ
عَلَيْهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ بِآيَاتِهِ مُؤْمِنِينَ وَمَا لَكُمْ أَلَّا
تَأْكُلُوا مِمَّا ذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَقَدْ فَصَّلَ لَكُمْ
مَا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِلَّا مَا اضْطُرِرْتُمْ إِلَيْهِ ۗ وَإِنَّ
كَثِيرًا لَيُضِلُّونَ بِأَهْوَائِهِمْ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۗ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ
هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُعْتَدِينَ وَذَرُوا ظَاهِرَ الْإِثْمِ وَبَاطِنَهُ
ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْسِبُونَ الْإِثْمَ سَيُجْزَوْنَ بِمَا كَانُوا
يَقْتَرِفُونَ وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ
عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ ۗ وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰ
أَوْلِيَائِهِمْ لِيُجَادِلُوكُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ

***What shall I seek other than God for judge? For it is He Who sent
down to you the Book well-explained; and those whom We have given the
Book know it is sent down from thy Lord with the truth; so be not thou
of the waverers. Perfect is the Word of thy Lord in truthfulness and
justice; none can change His words; He is the All-hearing, the
All-knowing. If thou obeys the most of those on earth they will lead
thee astray from the path of God; they follow only surmise, merely
conjecturing. Thy Lord knows very well who goes astray from His path; He
knows best who erred from His way and He knows best t" rightly-guided.
Eat of that over which God’s Name has been mentioned, if you believe in
His signs. How it is with you that you do not eat of that over which
God's Name has been mentioned, seeing that He has explained for you that
He has forbidden unto you unless you are constrained to it'.' But surely
many lead astray by their caprices. Without any knowledge; thy Lord
knows best the transgressors. Forsake the outward sin, and the inward;
surely the earners of sin shall be recompensed for what they have
earned. And eat not of that over which God's Name has not been
mentioned; it is ungodliness. The Satan inspire their friends to dispute
with you; if you obey them you are idolaters... (6:114-121)***

advanced for the erring. And it will be said unto them where were you
serving apart from God:' do they help you or help themselves?" Then they

altogether. They shall say as they dispute there one with another. 'By
God we were certainly in manifest error when we made you equal with the
Lord of all being. It was naught but the sinners that led us astray; so
now we have no intercessors, nor a loyal friend. O that we might return
again, and be among the believers! ·· Surely in that is a sign. Yet most
of them are not believers...”*** ***(26:90- 103)***

Monotheism and the Negation of Social Classes
---------------------------------------------

Social discrimination has always been the great cruelty of the human
history. In order to justify this cruelty, sometimes it is said:
Different gods have created different classes of the society and
therefore, each class has its own peculiar advantages and right."
Sometimes it is said, “The One God has granted particular rights to a
special group of people when creating them." On the whole at different
stages of the history of man’s life this justification has had different
forms and on this basis, the luxury of the highly distinguished class
and deprivation of the oppressed class have been considered a natural
necessity.

The principle of monotheism not only considers all the animate as
creatures of One God but also obliterates the roots of social
discrimination from the minds of human beings. A part of the
monotheistic instructions which can be seen in the verses of the Qur'an
is as follows:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْ لِمَنِ الْأَرْضُ وَمَنْ فِيهَا إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ
سَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّهِ ۚ قُلْ أَفَلَا تَذَكَّرُونَ قُلْ مَنْ رَبُّ
السَّمَاوَاتِ السَّبْعِ وَرَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ سَيَقُولُونَ
لِلَّهِ ۚ قُلْ أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ قُلْ مَنْ بِيَدِهِ مَلَكُوتُ كُلِّ
شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ يُجِيرُ وَلَا يُجَارُ عَلَيْهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ
سَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّهِ ۚ قُلْ فَأَنَّىٰ تُسْحَرُونَ بَلْ أَتَيْنَاهُمْ
بِالْحَقِّ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ مَا اتَّخَذَ اللَّهُ مِنْ وَلَدٍ
وَمَا كَانَ مَعَهُ مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ ۚ إِذًا لَذَهَبَ كُلُّ إِلَٰهٍ بِمَا
خَلَقَ وَلَعَلَا بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ ۚ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ عَمَّا

***"Say: 'Whose is the earth, and whose is in it, if you have knowledge?
They will say, 'God's· Say: ·Will you not then remember?' Say: ·Who is

will say, 'God'. Say: ·will you not then be God-fearing? Say: In Whose
hand is the dominion over all things and He protects, while against Him
there is no protection. If you have knowledge? They will say. God, Say:
·How then arc you bewitched? Nay, but We brought them the truth, and
they are truly liars. God has not taken to Hi1mself any son, nor is
there any god with Him: for then each god would have taken off that he
created and some of them would have risen up over other; glory be to
God. Beyond that they described, who has knowledge of the unseen and the
visible; high exalted be He, above that they associated!''

The Psychological Effects of Monotheism
---------------------------------------

Although the principal responsibility of monotheism is to establish a
monotheistic society, that is a society where there is no class
discrimination and the Divine rules and the command of Allah are
dominant. The psychological effects of this belief in the spirit of the
believers is tremendous and worth considering. On the whole it can be
said that the monotheistic belief has two constructive dimensions: the
construction of the society and the construction of the individual.

The follower of monotheism, under the influence of this belief enjoys
important characteristic including, infinite hope, untiring effort, and
protection against fright and lusts broad-mindedness rightly- chosen
direction and so forth.

The Quran in some of its verses when speaking about faith and the life
and efforts of the true believers clearly point out some of these
characteristic . Example verses are as follow"

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الَّذِينَ اسْتَجَابُوا لِلَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا
أَصَابَهُمُ الْقَرْحُ ۚ لِلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا مِنْهُمْ وَاتَّقَوْا

***"And those who answered God and the Messenger after the harm had
smitten them-to all those of them who did good and feared God, shall be
a mighty wage; those to whom the people said.'The people have gathered
against you, therefore fear them'; but it increased them in faith, and
they said, 'God is sufficient for us; an excellent Guardian is He. So
they returned with blessing and bounty from God, untouched by any harm:
they followed the good pleasure of God; and God is of abounding bounty.
That is Satan frightening his friends. Therefore do not fear them; but
fear Me. if you are believers.” (3: I 72-175)***

[^1]: Ulil-'amr: Generally it means "those of you who are in authority".
But the question is that "Who is authority?" Some say that it refers to
the Prophet(S) and his Household. It is also said that it refers to the
juris consults. However ulil-'amr are those people who are as immaculate
as the Prophet(S). In the Surah of 'Women', verse 59,the Qur'an says: "O
ye who believe obey Allah, and obey the Prophet and ulil-'amr'.' Here
ulil-'amr enjoys the same position as the Prophet. One is to obey the
Prophet as he is to obey ulil-'amr.
