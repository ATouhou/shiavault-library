Foreword
========

“This is the spiritual way of reaching human perfection, which I have
obtained from God, the last Prophet, his religion, and the Qur’an. I
invite to it, out of insight, all humans who have a clear conscience.”

I present this book to all wise and righteous people who believe the
religion of Islam to have come from a noble source, to have been
revealed and commissioned by the All-merciful God, and to be the last
divine doctrine and life-conducting program, which was sent down for
achieving social guidance, education, and perfection. I present this
book to all those who seek to approach Islam, the noblest of all
religions, which is introduced to the Muslim nation through the
articulate speech of the Holy Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him and
his Household.

The material of this book is derived from the Glorious Qur’an and the
Prophet’s conduct (*Sunnah*). It represents a derivation of the religion
and a brief account of its laws, without demonstration of proofs.

This book is one of a kind because it presents the issues the society is
confronted with, in a brief and simple language, both in the field of
thought and practice.
