**Notes:**

[^1]. See Muhaqqiq's introduction to al-Suyuti's Tadrib al-rawi;
al-Madinah 1379/1959. One instance of this case is the "hadith" which
was forged regarding the following verse of the Holy Qur'an on the
orders of Mu\`awiyah:

And among men is he who sells himself in exchange for God's good
pleasure....(2:207)

Through this forgery, an attempt was made to relate this verse to Ibn
Muljam, the assassin of Imam \`Ali (A); whereas, in reality, this verse
is related to \`Ali (A) himself, who exposed himself to the danger of
death by lying in the Prophet's (S) bed on the night of his hijrah to
al-Madinah. See also Kazim Mudir Shanehchi, \`IIm al-hadith, p. 66;
Mashhad University 1964-65

Ahmad ibn Nasr says: "The Prophet in reply [to a question that he had
put] said, 'Hold on to al-Shafi\`i for he is from me and God is with him
and his followers."' See Kazim Mudir Shanehchi \`IIm al hadith, p. 69,

[^3]. The Encyclopedia of Islam, pp. 24, 25. Ahmad Amin, Fajr al Islam,
p.256; Egypt 1347/1928. See also Parto e Islam vol I p. 258. An instance
of this is the case of Abi \`Ismah Nuh ibn Abi Maryam whose practice was
to forge a tradition in relation to every surah of the Qur'an. Once when
asked about the source of his narrations, he said, "Since people started
turning towards the fiqh of Abi Hanifah and the chronicles of Muhammad
ibn Ishaq they have been neglecting to memorize the Qur'an by heart. I
have fabricated these traditions only for the sake of God's good
pleasure." See Parto e Islam p. 258 and Fajral Islam p. 256.

[^4]. Partoe Islam, vol.11, pp. 356, 385.

[^5]. An instance of this is the case of Ghiyath ibn Ibrahim, who once
on visiting the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur saw him playing with pigeons.
On the spur of the moment, he fabricated a "hadith" for the caliph's
good pleasure: The Prophet said, "No racing is better than that of hoofs
and feathers." See Fajr al-'Islam, p. 255, and Partoe Islam, vol. I,
p.258. Abu Hurayrah once fabricated a "hadith" about onions of Akka
(seaport in Palestine). Asked by Mu'awiyah as to where the Prophet said
such a thing, he answered, "there where he said, 'Mu'awiyah is the
maternal uncle of the faithful (khal al-mu'minin)'."

[^6]. Kazim Mudir Shanehchi, \`Ilm al-hadith, pp.74,75, Mashhad
University, 1344 A.H. According to Ibn al-Jawzi, once Ahmad ibn Hanbal
and Yahya ibn Ma\`in were in the mosque of al-Rasifah (in Baghdad) for
prayers. In the meanwhile, a storyteller gathered around himself some
people and began to recite a tradition, citing as his sources Ahmad ibn
Hanbal and Yahya ibn Ma\`in, that the Prophet said, "whoever says, 'La
ilaha illa Allah', God will reward him with a bird whose beak is of gold
and feathers of coral." Then he proceeded to describe the bird and the
reward of the recipient in such a detail as can not be contained even in
twenty pages. On hearing him, Yahya and ibn Hanbal looked at each other
while the "muhaddith" started collecting tips from the people. Yahya
approached the man and asked him as to who had told him this tradition.
"Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Yahya ibn Ma\`in," was his reply. "I am Yahya and
this is Ahmad ibn Hanbal", said Yahya pointing to Ibn Hanbal, "we
ourselve have never heard of such a tradition." The storyteller replied,
'I had heard that Yahya ibn Ma\`in is an idiot I didn't believe it. You
talk as if you two are the only Yahya and Ibn Hanbal in the whole world!
I have written traditions from seventeen Yahya ibn Ma\`ins and Ahmad ibn
Hanbal's." Then he promptly slipped out of the mosque. See Hafiz
Nishaburi Hakim Abu \`Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Abd Allah, Ma\`rifat ulum
al hadith, p. 289; Egypt 1937.

1379/1959.

[^8]. During the earliest times the traditions were transmitted orally
by teachers to students of hadith. One who had leant traditions in this
way under the direction of a teacher could, in his turn, again
communicate them to others. Ijazah (lit. permit) was the term for a
teacher's sanction granted to those considered reliable by him for
further transmission of traditions to others.
