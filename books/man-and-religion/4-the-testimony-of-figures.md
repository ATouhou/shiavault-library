The Testimony of Figures
========================

In concluding this study we cite the testimony of statistics in support
of the viewpoint of religion, confirming that there is no substitute for
religion, and that man cannot make a civilization that is capable of
offering him prosperity and peace, away from religion and the message of
Allah.

These figures, as we shall see, are a witness telling the truth before
the tribunal of history and judgement of intellect; the witness that
will explain to us the severity of the tragedy under the reign of the
substitute brought by man to take the place of the civilization of
Faith, after having dismissed from his life the idea of faith, the moral
values and the way of religion.

Let us hear these figures speak, and let us ask for the testimony of
the institute for statistical researches. Let us put the contemporary
civilization in the cage of accusation, so that we may uncover its
secrets and its identity before the eyes of deceived humanity. We can
figure out only snap-shots and mere samples, randomly taken, to disclose
the bitter truth hidden behind these figures.

The concerned studies and statistics show horrible facts about the
incidents of the individual and social decline and ruin, in the
materialistic and capitalistic communities. Hereunder are excerpts from
those statistics:

\*A crime is committed every 30 seconds in New York.

\*Nine girls out of every twelve are raped or kidnapped in Great
Britain. The police could arrest only 13% of the criminals. \* The
percentage of crimes increased by 84% during recent years;

whereas the juvenile crimes increased by fivefold during the first half
of 1975. Groups of youngsters - below 20 years of age -are kept every
day waiting at the doors of the courts, for grave crimes such as burning
vehicles, immoral transgression, rape, robbing and murder.3
Dr. Homer, a Swede, and envoy of the United Nations who had been asked
to study the status of the women in the Arab countries in 1975,
announced: "It is the Swedish woman who should demand her freedom. as
the woman in the Arab countries has already reached the peak of her
freedom under Islam. "She also said: "The Swedish woman tries these days
to have this year announced as The International Year of the Woman', and
then declare another year for the man, so that he may extract his rights
from the woman.

She added that the tragedy of the Swedish woman is the very freedom
which took her to a dangerous and tem1~'ing stage.

In her report, Dr. Homer says: "25%of Swedish women suffer from
psychological and nervous sicknesses; and 40% of Sweden's income is
spent on these diseases caused by the freedom which the Swedish woman
attained and which she is practicing .4 \*Another report disclosing the
tragedy of humanity under the materialistic culture says: "The American
association for Family Services announced that the disintegration of the
family, which reached an epidemic stage, tops the list of social
problems. Every year more than one million persons are separated or
divorced, which is sevenfold higher in percentage, compared to that of a
hundred years ago.

\*The juvenile crimes, which are strongly connected to divorce cases,
are three times as much compared with the statistics of 1940.~

\*Let us listen to Mr. Winch, who says: "Do you know that most of the
murder crimes are not committed by professional criminals, and that they
are not motivated by theft; and that most of them are committed by
friends and relatives? \*The Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I)
reports that in murder cases within families, the husbands are mostly
the murderers; and in 15% of family murders the children are the victims
of their parents.6

\*According to a referendum carried out recently by the UNESCO, 60% of
the housewives in the USA and Europe feel discontented, disappointed and
miserable.7

\*1n the report issued by the French Physician, Dr. Lyreete: 30,000
people die every year in France of Syphlis, while in the USA the victims
of inherited syphlis are between 30,000 and 40,000 children.8 This
disease is spread by adultery.

\*A report about divorce cases on the grounds of unfaithfulness in
Great Britain shows the following figures:

In 1938 9970 cases

in 1950 29096 =

In 1960 27870 =
In 1969 60134 =
In 1970 70575 =
In 1971 110017=
In 1972 109822=
In 1973 115048=

\*The grave problem in the pre-Soviet communist society was that of
every two marriages one was ended in divorce, in most of the cities of
west USSR. In Moscow, for example, 49 out of 100 marriages ended in
divorce after the birth of the first child. In Mavadansk the percentage
of divorce is 72.9%. The Physicians' Conference held in Moscow in 1975
called for urgent measures to tackle this grave social instability -
that is, the high divorce percentage and low birth rate... 9

The "Hospital Today , a magazine of London, in its editorial of the
April 1975 issue, published a summary of the annual report of the
British Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. It says:

"...Despite the abundance of contraceptive medicines and legalized
abortion, it is noted that 8.6% of the children are born to unmarried
mothers! There is a further serious problem. In 1973 the following cases
were noted:

I case of an 11 - year old pregnant girl.
6 cases of 12 - year old pregnant girls.
38 cases of 13 - year old pregnant girls.
255 cases of 14 - year old pregnant girls.

There were 166,000 cases of legal abortion during the same year, 50% of
which were by unmarried women. If these talking figures give us
astounding facts about the social and moral state of the materialistic
and communist civilizations, there are some other figures which draw the
picture of their economic tragedy, giving more evidence of the failure
of man-made systems and their being incapable of solving man's
problems.

\*International statistics show that, "there are in the world 400
million persons undergoing a slow death because of hunger , and that
five million persons actually
die of hunger. Several conferences have been held within the past two
months in Bucharest, Rome, London and elsewhere to discuss the food
problem. Before holding each of these conferences, the observers used to
assert that the results of the conference would be no better than those
of the previous one. They say: "It has become a common thing to see
these conferences held and concluded without finding the solution for
this human drainage to which the peoples of the world are subjected,
especially in Africa and Asia..."10

"...at the same time, the experts stress that the USA alone can feed
all those millions of people who are being subjected to slow death...''
11

Perhaps the best confirmation of the said statement came from the
American Minister of Agriculture who announced: "If we killed half of
the cats and dogs we keep, the food which we thus spare can satis1~ all
the hungry stomaches in the world.'12 "In the fields of development,
food and housing, all the experts unanimously agree that the available
natural sources in the world can meet the needs of all the people of the
world, should there be enough good intention to exploit them, and to
equally distribute them among the people of the world. But the root of
the problem stems from the unjust distribution of wealth.

13 This is the picture which is drawn by the figures and statistics
accumulated by the substituted civilization, a civilization devoid of
any faith and spirit. A civilization devised by the deviated ignorant
minds after refusing to live under the shade of the message of the
religion and faith, the message which tells the truth, and invites the
lost and the proud to repeat the reckoning of their accounts, and review
the history of their lives, and reconsider the evaluation of their
attitudes, deriving a lesson from Allah's saying:

"And how many a generation We destroyed before them who were mightier
in prowess than they! so they went about in the lands! Is there a place
of refuge? Surely there is a reminder in this for him who has a heart or
he gives ear and is a witness. Holy Qur'an (50:38-37)

And praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds.
