The Supporter of the Persecuted
===============================

Abu Talib disliked persecution very much. In the meantime, he liked the
persecuted a lot. So, our Master Muhammad [s] liked Abu Talib very much.

One day, a battle took place between the tribe of Kinana and the tribe
of Qais. The tribe of Qais was the aggressor.

A man from the tribe of Kinana came to Abu Talib and said:

*“Son of the bird feeder and pilgrim water-giver; don't be absent from
us. We get victory in your presence.”*

Abu Talib answered:

*“I will not be absent from you when you avoid persecution, enmity,
rudeness and falsehood.”*

So, they promised him to do that.

Our Master Muhammad [s] stood by his uncle, against Kinana.
