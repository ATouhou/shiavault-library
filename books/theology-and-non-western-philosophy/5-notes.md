[^54] D’Costa, G. (1993).

[^55] For a fuller examination of the problematic relationship between
the practice of traditional Christian theology and that the study of
religion in the modern secular university see, D’Costa, G. (2005)
Theology in the Public Square Oxford:Blackwell.  Many contemporary
comparative theologians work as academics without no substantial
belonging or accountability to a Christian tradition, as acknowledged,
for instance, by Clooney in his survey of comparative theology and its
practitioners.  See Clooney (2010).

and explored in (1988), pp. 370-[^388]:
