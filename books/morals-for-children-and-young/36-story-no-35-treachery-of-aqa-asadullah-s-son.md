Story no. 35: Treachery of Aqa Asadullah’s son
==============================================

Aqa Asadullah liked to sit with his son in the evenings so that he would
do his given homework.  
 But one day he found a new pencil in his son’s bag.  
 He asked “Where did you get it from?”  
 His son did not reply.  
 When he insisted, his son put his head down in shame.  
 It became clear that he had stolen it from the other children.  
 His father was very unhappy.  
 First, he gave him advice, but when he continued the action, he bought
stationary in abundance for him.  
 But when that also did not give any benefit, he beat his son and
scolded him so that he would not steal again.

Yes, this is one of the bad and dangerous qualities. Hope that the
children and young stay away from this bad habit.
