51: Winnowing [winds] (zariat)
==============================

This highly mystic chapter, as the title suggests, deals with Abraham
and other prophets. It contains 60 early Meccan verses in three
sections, and was revealed after The Dunes 46 and before The Pall 88.

The end (III) concerns Divine worship and our duty towards God. See also
Chapter 77 on [Winds] Sent Forth and The Chargers 100 for similar
apocalyptic pictures. The shorter verses are now very apparent.
