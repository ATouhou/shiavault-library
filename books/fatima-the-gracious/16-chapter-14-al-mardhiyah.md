"Mardhiyoun" have an excellent rank, and lofty position near Almighty

Just a few of Allah's worshippers achieve this rank, which is attained
by piety, and sincerity. Fatima az-Zahra (sa) was one of those who was
able to reach this lofty position. She achieved this rank through her
good deeds that pleased Allah, and made Him well-satisfied with her.
