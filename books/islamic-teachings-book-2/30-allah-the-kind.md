Allah - The Kind
================

***“Allah is very kind and generous to His creatures”.*** (Surah
al-Baqarah, 2:217).

Allah, whom we worship, is Just. He is kind to all His creatures and is
not cruel to anyone. He gives a good reward to those who do good deeds.
On the other hand, those who do bad deeds, have to undergo punishment
therefor.

Allah loves His creatures. He helps them and guides them to the right
path through His Prophets.

Allah wants that all human beings should do good deeds so that they may
lead prosperous and happy lives. He also wants that those who do evil
deeds, due to their ignorance, should forsake their unbecoming ways,
repent sincerely for their sins and begin doing good deeds.

Allah wants goodness and happiness for everyone and is very kind to
everybody.
