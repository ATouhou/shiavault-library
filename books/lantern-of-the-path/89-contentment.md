Contentment
===========

   
 Contentment is when a person is content with what he loves and what he
hates; it is a ray of the light of gnosis. He who is content is
annihilated to all his choices; he is really the one with whom Allah is
content. Contentment is a name which contains the meanings of servitude,
and maybe described as the joy of the heart.  
    
 I heard my father, Muhammad al-Baqir, say, 'To attach the heart to what
is present is association (shirk), and to what is not there is disbelief
(kufr): these are the wings of heedlessness.' I am amazed at anyone who
claims to be a slave to Allah and then contends with Him over His
decrees. Content gnostics ('arifin) are far from being like that.'
