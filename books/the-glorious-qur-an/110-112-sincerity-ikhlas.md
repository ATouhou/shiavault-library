112: Sincerity (ikhlas)
=======================

These 4 Meccan verses were revealed after the last chapter in the Book,
Mankind 114, and before The Star 53. The doctrine of God's pure Unity or
the Divine Oneness is stated clearly here; in fact, it is a strong
declaration against the God-head being looked upon as consisting of more
than one person or God's having any son. The title Al-Ikhlas, one of the
Divine attributes, is the direct opposite to shirk or the sin of'
association \`, and involves freeing oneself from such impure worship
through pure faith.

This chapter is sometimes called the " Third " of the Qur'an!, since it
explains one of the three essential dogmas in Islam, but its stark
simplicity is not always appreciated by non-Muslims, nor translated
clearly. It forms an answer to a previous rhetorical question implied in
the first word which is "SAY:

It may be said in cemeteries, (and generally is recited there eleven
times), and in memory of deceased loved ones. Through it awareness of
God's Omnipresence reaches us. The rhyme is in -ad.
