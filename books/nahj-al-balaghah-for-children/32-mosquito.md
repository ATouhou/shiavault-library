Mosquito
========

![](/sites/default/files/mosquito.gif)

The annihilation of the world

after bringing it into being

is no stranger than its

origination and creation.

How can it be so?

For even if all its living beings,

birds and beasts,

the animals of the stable and the

pasture,

all the genera and species of beings,

the dull and the intelligent of the world's

nations

-were all of them together try

to create a **mosquito**,

they will be incapable

of bringing it into being,

and will not know

how it has been created.

(Sermon 185)
