H - Hani Ibn Urwah Al-Sib'eey
=============================

The last messenger the Imam sent to the people of Kufa. He went to Kufa
along with Saeed Ibn Abdullah Alhanafi. When Ibn Ziyad learned why Hani
was in Kufa, he ordered his people to cut off his head and drag his body
throughout the streets of Kufa.
