Question Nine
=============

### If Shiites are right, then why are they in the minority, and why have most other Muslims not recognized this religious sect?

Answer:
-------

Distinguishing truth from falsehood does not depend on counting their
followers. Nowadays, Muslims form one-fifth of the whole population of
the world; most people who live in the Far East worship idols and bulls;
some others even do not believe in the metaphysical world.

China, a country with over one billion people, is the center of
communism and most Indians, apparently as many as one billion, worship
bulls and idols. However, being in the majority is no sign of being
right. The Holy Quran often blames the majority of the people and
praises some of the minority:

*- Thou wilt not find most of them thankful. (8:18)*

- Its only protectors are the God-fearing; but most of them know not.
(8:38)

- Few of my bondsmen are thankful. [1] (34:36)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1] The full verse reads as follows: But what have they now, that God

So, a realistic person should not worry if the followers of the religion
he believes in constitute a minority, nor should he take pride if they
form the majority; he should, rather, ponder logically.

During the Battle of Jamal, a man asked Imam \`Ali (a.s), How is it
possible to call your enemies, who are relatively greater in number, the
followers of falsehooda the Imam answered, The truth and falsehood are
not dependent on the number of followers. Recognize the truth, and you
will know its followers; recognize the falsehood, and you will know who
its followers are.

It is thus necessary that a Muslim solve the issue scientifically and
logically taking the Quranic instructions as a light to guide his
reason: *And pursue not what thou hast no knowledge of. (17:36)*

It is true that Shiites constitute only one fourth of the Muslims in the
world.[1] However, it can be seen that throughout history, there are far
more scientists and writers among this seemingly minor group of Muslims.
Even the founders of Islamic sciences are in many cases Shiites, too.
Among them mention may be made of:

- Abul-Aswad al-Du'ali, the founder of Arabic syntax

- Al-Khalil Ibn Ahmad, the founder of the science of prosody

should not chastise them, when they are barring from the Holy Mosque,
not being its protectorsa Its only protectors are the God-fearing. [1]
For further details, see A\`yan al-Shiah, Vol. 1, p. 194.

- Mu\`adh ibn Muslim Ibn Abi-Sarah of Kufah, the founder of the science
of conjugation

- Abu-\`Abdullah Muhammad Ibn \`Imran Katib of Khorasan (also called
Marzbani), a forerunner of the science of rhetoric[1]

More names can be found in such books as: *al-Dhariah Ila Tasanif
al-Shiah, A\`yan al-Shiah, and Tarikh al-Shiah.*
