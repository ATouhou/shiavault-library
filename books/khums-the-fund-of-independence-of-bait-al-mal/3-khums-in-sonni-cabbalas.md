Khums in Sonni Cabbalas
=======================

Some people say that in none of Islamic cabbalas Khums has been
mentioned in a case other than spoils of war and in cabbalas it has been
talk about Khums exclusively for spoils of war.

This claim is one of baseless claims and is a sign of ignorance of the
person who has said this about Islamic Ahadith, because Khums in other
than spoils of war has been mentioned in Sonni cabbalas and also Shiite
cabbalas (but in Sonni cabbalas only some parts of Khums have been
mentioned, while in Shiite cabbalas all of them have been expressed).

First, we point to a part of Sonni cabbalas which explicitly proves
Khums of things other than spoils of war.

These cabbalas have been chosen from famous resources of Ahl -e- Sonnat
which are acceptable for all of them.

A) It has been quoted in “Sunan of Beihaghi” from Abu Harira that
Prophet (s.a.) said:

<p dir="rtl">
فى الرّكاز الخمس قيل و ما الرّكاز يا رسول اللّه؟ قال الذّهب و الفضّة
الّذى خلقه اللّه فى الارض يوم خلقت.
</p>

There is Khums in Rekaz, a person who was there asked: What is Rekaz?
Prophet (s.a.) answered: “Mines of gold and silver which Allah has been
created on earth from the beginning day.

It should be considered that Rekaz (it is pronounced like Ketab)
literally means any kind of asset that is placed in earth; and
accordingly all mines are called Rekaz; and also all treasures and
assets which have been remained in earth from former humans are called
Rekaz; and the fact that we see in the Hadith above it has been
interpreted to mines of gold and silver is that a kind of clear samples
not being exclusive to them.

1- Sunan of Beihaghi, vol. 4, page 152.

B) It has been quoted in a Hadith from Anas ibn Malik that: We were in
a road with Prophet (s.a.), one of our friends entered to ruins … and he
found there a treasure of gold … they weighted that and it was about two
hundreds dirhams, Prophet said that it is Rekaz and it is obligatory to
pay its Khums.1

C) It has been quoted in Sahih of Muslim from Abu Harira that Prophet
(s.a.) said: “في الرّكاز خمس” (there is Khums in Rekaz).

The same matter has been also mentioned in Sahih of Bokhari.2

1 & 2- Sunan of Beihaghi, vol. 4, page 155.

It has been affirmed in this Hadith which is one of famous Ahadith
among Sonnies that there is Khums in Rekaz and as we said and it is
understood from its main root and also it has been affirmed in some
famous dictionaries like Qamoos, Rekaz has a vast meaning which consists
of any kind of asset that is placed and saved in earth, like mines and
treasures of former humans that has been buried in lands; and
accordingly, some pf Sonni Faqihs like “Abu Hanifa” affirmed that Khums
is obligatory in mines and Nisab (minimum needed level or amount) of
Zakat is not a condition in this case.1

It has been quoted in the book “Kanz Al-Ummal”, vol. 7, page 65 that
Prophet (s.a.) said:

ان لكم بطون الارض و سهولها و تلاع الاودية و ظهورها، على ان ترعوا نباتها
و تشربوا مائها على ان تؤدّوا الخمس 2

Deep inside the earth, fields and inside the valleys and out of them
are all in your hands in order to use their plants, drink their water
and pay Khums about them.

1- “Al-Mughani” by Ibn Qudama, vol. 2, page 580, printed in Beirut
2- Makateeb Al-Rasool, vol. 2, page 365, it has been quoted from other
evidences.

There is no doubt that here, the purpose of Khums is not Zakat of
sheep, because Zakat of sheep is not one fifth. Therefore, the purpose
is to use these lands and pay the Khums of its income.

It has been quoted in a Hadith in the book “Usd Al-Ghaba” that “Masrooq
ibn Wael” came to prophet (s.a.) and became Muslim, and he said I like
you to send some people to my tribe in order to invite them to Islam,
and please write a letter for them, may Allah guide them all. Prophet
(s.a.) ordered to write this letter:

<p dir="rtl">
بسم الله الرّحمن الرّحيم من محمّد رسول الله الي الاقيال من حضرموت باقام
الصّلوة و ايتاء الزٌكوة و الصّدقة علي التيعة و لصاحبها التيمة و في
السّيوب الخمس و في البعل العشر.
</p>

In the name of Allah the Compassionate the Merciful

From Mohammad, prophet of Allah to chieftains of Hadhramut, Orders them
to perform prayer and pay Zakat, Zakat is for animal that pastures in
fields and the animal that is taken in house for the need of its owner
has not Zakat and Khums is obligatory in “Soyoob” and it is obligatory
to pay one tenth in palms which grow without the need of water.

We will discuss soon about the purpose of Soyoob which Khums is
obligatory in it.

We read in another Hadith in the book “Al-Aghd Al-Fareed” that Prophet
(s.a.) wrote a letter to Wael ibn Hajr Hadhrami: “From Mohammad Prophet
of Allah to chieftains of Abahela …” to the point that said: “and there
is Khums in Soyoob”.2

1- Usd Al-Ghaba, vol. 3, page 38.
2- Al-Aghd Al-Fareed, vol. 2, page 48, printed by Ismaelian.

We read in footnote of the book “Al-Aghd Al-Fareed” after quoting the
Hadith above that “Soyoob” is plural form of “Sayb” that means assets
which had been remained as treasures from the time of ignorance or
mines, because they consider as divine gifts.

But we read in “Qamoos” which is one of famous Arabic dictionaries
that: Mainly “Sayb” means any kind of gift and benefaction and “Soyoob”
is in the meaning of “Rekaz” (treasures and mines).

If we consider “Sayb” in the meaning of any kind of gift and
benefaction and the purpose is divine gift and benefaction, it consists
of all incomes and according to that Khums should be paid in all of
them; and if we consider it as the exclusive meaning of mines and
treasures, it also proves that Khums is obligatory in other than spoils
of war and it is not exclusive to spoils of war.


**Opinion of Commentators**

Lots of commentators who have discussed about this verse explicitly
confessed that Advantage (غنيمت) has mainly a vast meaning and consists
of spoils of war and other than them and generally all that a person
could gain without hardship. Even those who consider this verse
exclusive to spoils of war confess that there is no such a limitation in
its main meaning, but for another reason its meaning has been limited.

“Ghartabi”, famous Sonni commentator, writes below this verse in his
interpretation:

“Literally, “advantage” (غنيمت) is the thing that a person or a group
of people gain with endeavor … and know that the consensus (of Sonni
scholars) is that the meaning of advantage (غنيمت) in the verse “ وَ
اعْلَمُوا اَنَّما غَنِمْتُمْ” is assets which reach Muslims by fight and
victory over infidels, but it should be considered that this limitation
is not in its literal meaning as we said before, but this bond has been
set in the common law of religion”.

“Fakhr Raazi” affirms in his interpretation that: “ الغنم الفوز بالشيء
(advantage is that a person gains something”. And then after expressing
this vast literal meaning adds: “Religious meaning of advantage ( غنيمت)
(in opinion of Sonni scholars) is spoils of war”.

And also in “Al-Manar” interpretation, the definition of advantage
(غنيمت) has been expressed in its vast meaning and it has not been
limited to spoils of war, although author believes that according to
religious bond the vast meaning of this verse should be limited to
spoils of war.

Also it has been mentioned in the interpretation of “Rooh Al-Ma’aani”
written by Aloosi, famous Sonni commentator, that:

“Mainly, “غنم” (three word root of غنيمت in Arabic) means any kind of
interest and benefit”.3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- Fakhr Raazi interpretation, vol. 15, page 164.
2- Al-Manar interpretation, vol. 10, pages 3-7.
3- Rooh Al-Ma’aani, vol. 10, page 2.

And in “Majma’ Al-Bayan” interpretation first advantage has been
interpreted in the meaning of spoils of war, but during the explanation
of the meaning of the verse it says:

<p dir="rtl">
قال اصحابنا انّ الخمس واجب فى كلّ فائدة تحصل للانسان من المكاسب و ارباح
التّجارات، و فى الكنوز و المعادن و الغوص و غيرذلك ممّا هو مذكور فى
الكتب، و يمكن ان يستدلّ على ذلك بهذه الاية فانّ فى عرف اللّغة يطلق على
جميع ذلك اسم الغنم و الغنيمة
</p>

Shiite scholars believe that Khums is obligatory in any benefit that a
person would gain, consisting of it is from business, or from treasure
or mine and anything that derives from the sea by diving, and other jobs
that has been mentioned in Fiqh books, and it is possible to ratiocinate
with this claim about this verse because advantage (غنيمت) implies to
all of these in its common meaning”.1

1- Majma’ Al-Bayan interpretation, vol. 4, pages 543 &544.

It is amazing that some partial persons who seems to have a special
mission for poisoning the common thoughts, have tried a funny
falsification in their book which have written about Khums in the
expression of Majma’ Al-Bayan interpretation; they have mentioned the
first part of the expression which guaranties the interpretation of
advantage (غنيمت) in the meaning of spoils of war (according to the
opinion of some commentators), but they have ignored the explanation
about the generality of literal meaning of the word and the meaning of
the verse completely and have ascribed a false matter to this great
Islamic commentator, maybe they thought they are the only persons who
have the book “Majma’ Al-Bayan” and nobody will read that book in order
to reveal their lie to everyone and it is strange that they did not
perform this betrayal only about this matter, but in other cases
anything that might have benefit has been mentioned and anything that
might be the opposite direction has been ignored.

Also it has been affirmed in Al-Mizan interpretation according to the
words of scientists of literature that advantage (غنيمت) is any benefit
that person gains from business, working or the war and although the
point for descending of the verse is spoils of war but we know that
never the point particularizes the generality of definition.1

It is concluded from all that has been said:

The verse of advantage (غنيمت) has a vast meaning and consists of any
kind of income, interest and benefit, because literal meaning of this
word has a vast meaning and there is no clear proof about
particularizing it in hand.

The only thing that some of Sonni commentators refer to, is that the
verses before and after this verse are about Jihad and this matter shows
that the verse of advantage (غنيمت) points to spoils of war in
proportion.

1- Al-Mizan interpretation, vol. 9, page 89.

While we know that the reasons of descending or the direction of
discussion in Suras never particularize the generality of a verse; and
in more clear way, there is no problem in that the meaning of the verse
to be a general and overall definition while the reason of descending
the verse is one sample of that general and overall concept.

For example, we read in verse 7 of Hashr Sura:

<p dir="rtl">
ما آتيكُمْ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَ ما نَهيكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانْتَهُوا
</p>

Take anything which Prophet (s.a.) brings for you and abstain from
anything which he prohibit.

This verse says a general order about the necessity of obeying Prophet
(s.a.), while the case for descending was assets which has been taken
under the ownership of Muslims from enemies without war (and the term
“فيء” is used for them).

And also in verse 233 of Baqara Sura “ لا تُكَلِّفُ نَفْسٌ اِلاّ
وُسْعَها (nobody has the duty to do more than his/her ability)” has been
mentioned as a general rule while the case for descending was about
paying women who feeding babied and it has been ordered to the father of
infant to pay according to his ability; but can reference of the verse
to this special matter prevent the generality of this rule (not to do
more than the ability)?!

Briefly, this verse has been said among the verses of Jihad but it
says: Pay one fifth (Khums) of any income that you gain from any source
(which one of them is spoils of war). Specially the relative word ”
(any) and the word “شيء” (thing) which are two general and without any
bond or condition words emphasize this matter.
