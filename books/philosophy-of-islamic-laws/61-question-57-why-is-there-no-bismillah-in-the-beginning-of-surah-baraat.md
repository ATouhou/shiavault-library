Question 57: Why Is There No ‘Bismillah’ In The Beginning of ‘Surah Baraat’?
============================================================================

**Question:** Why is there no 'Bismillah' in the beginning of 'Surah
Baraat'? and Why we see Bismillah in the middle of Surah Naml?

**Answer:** Because Surah Baraat as is apparent from the following, is
for the warning of polytheists and the breaker of covenant and its aim
was to warn those people who were trying to destroy the light of the
belief in Oneness of Allah, moral and social reformation in the Arabian
Gulf thus it was not suitable that its beginning should be with
Bismillah because this sentence is the sign of mercy, peace and
friendship.

As far as the mention in the middle of Surah Naml is concerned it is the
beginning of the letter that Sulaiman (a.s.) had written to the Queen of
Saba. And since the full text of this letter is quoted in the Qur’an,
the Bismillah is also mentioned because this letter began with this
sentence.
