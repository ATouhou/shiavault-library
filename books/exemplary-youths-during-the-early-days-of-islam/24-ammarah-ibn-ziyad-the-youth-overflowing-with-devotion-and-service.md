‘Ammārah ibn Ziyād, the Youth Overflowing with Devotion and Service
===================================================================

‘Ammārah ibn Ziyād belonged to the Tribe of Aws and was one of the
Helpers [*Ansār*] of Medina. When the Noble Prophet (S) was encircled by
the enemy, in the Battle of Uhud, Mus‘ab ibn ‘Umayr and Abū Dujānah
protected and defended him with all their might and strength.

Five youths of the *Ansār* of Medina hurried up to help defend the Noble
Prophet (S). One of those youths was ‘Ammārah ibn Ziyād. ‘Ammārah ibn
Ziyād fought bravely with all his might till he was seriously wounded.

A group of Muslims returned from the battlefront and drove the enemies
of Allah away from the Noble Prophet (S). The Noble Prophet (S) looked
at ‘Ammārah ibn Ziyād, who had sustained fourteen fatal wounds, and
stated, “Come close to me.” ‘Ammārah dragged himself close to the Noble
Prophet (S), placed his forehead at his feet and died.[^1]
