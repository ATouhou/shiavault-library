(7) Effect On the Children
==========================

It is no secret that the songs music and films depend upon sex-appeal
for their success. The more sexy a song the more its sale; the more
suggestive a music, the more its market value. And also it is no secret
that building the character of the children begins from their very
tender age. If they are exposed to obscense songs sexy music and
suggestive dances in their childhood, their entire outlook on the
matters of sex morality and marriage-sanctity will become jaundiced.
They will lose the capacity to distinguish between moral and immoral
modesty and immodesty chastity and promiscuity.

Some people think that the children do not understand these things!
Such people are wrong.

Thus, by listening to the songs and seeing the dance on television, we
ruin the moral uprightness of our children. If we believe that the
children are given to us by Allah as a trust and that we are responsible
to give them such a training that they become good Muslims and virtuous
servants of Allah, then we must abstain from songs and music; and must
keep them safe from the evil influence of these sinful habits. You will
find this subject adequately explained in the Appendix.


**(8) The Qur'an on Music**

After briefly explaining the evil effects of Music and dance, now time
has come to give here some of the ayats of the Qur'an and some of the
traditions of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) and Imams (a.s.) on this
subject.

Here are four Ayats of the Qur'an which forbid the Muslims from
indulging into music. "So abstain from the pollution of the idols and
abstain from false vain words." 22:30. The Arabic word "Zoor" has
several meanings which include falsehood and the musical expressions.
According to Imam Jafer Sadique (a.s.) "pollution of the idols" means
Chess; and "Vain words" means music.

See how 'Music' has been joined in this Ayat with the pollution of
idols"; only then you can appreciate the seriousness of the sin of the
Music. "And of the people there is he who buys a 'vain talk' so that he
may lead others astray from the path of Allah without (real) knowledge
and takes it (the revelation of Allah) for a mockery; for these shall be
a disgracing chastisement (punishment)." 31:6.

'Lahw' means any thing which diverts the mind from serious thinking.
"Vain talk" has been interpreted by the Imam as some talk sound or thing
which diverts the attention of man from the ultimate aim of his
creation; in other words makes him forget Allah and His commands. For
example, fictions romantic stories, and such useless talks. "It includes
'Music', intoxicants and all such diversions." (Tafseer As-Safi)

Imam Muhammad Baquir (a.s.) said: Music is among the things for which
Allah has promised the Fire (of Hell). Then he recited the above Ayat.
(Kafi; Wasael us Shia; Tafseer As-Safi)

"Indeed successful are the believers those who in their prayer are
humble and those who keep themselves aloof from Vain (words and deeds)."
(23:1-3).

'Laghw' (Vain words and actions): The first Imam Ali (a.s.) said that
"all that is void of the remembrance of Allah is 'Laghv'. According to
other authentic traditions of Imams, 'Laghv' means all useless
entertainment, wasteful of times among which music has been specifically
mentioned. Also included in this term are vain games played just to
while away the time.

"And the servants of the Merciful Allah are those ... who bear not
witness to what is false, and when they pass by what is vain they pass
with dignity". (25:72).

The words 'Zoor' and 'Laghv' have been explained earlier. According to
the traditions of Imams (a.s.), the first part may also be translated in
this way: "who do not witness what is vain"! and accordingly, it has
been interpreted in the exegesis of the Qur'an as "do not listen to
music."

The following two traditions explain the second part:

Imam Jafer Sadique (a.s.) asked some of his companions: "Where are you
staying?"

They replied: "With so and so, who has singing and dancing girls.

Imam said: "You should have dignity."

They thought that Imam (a.s.) had advised them to treat that man
generously. But they were not sure; so they returned to the Imam and
requested him to explain his meaning to them.

Imam said: "have not you heard Allah saying when they pass by what is
vain they pass with dignity'? Imam meant that you should not stay with a
man who has singing and dancing girls. Second tradition: Muhammad bin
Abi Ibad was known to indulge in music and liquor. He once asked Imam
Ali Ar-Ridha (a.s.) about listening to music. Imam said: Some people in
Hijaz have their own view about it; but that view is absolutely wrong.
Have you not heard the word of Allah 'when they pass by what is vain
they pass in dignity'?"

I think this much should be enough for a follower of, Muhammad (s.a.w.)
and Ahul ul Bait (a.s.).


**(9) Some Traditions on Music**

After Ayats of the Qur'an, I mention here some of the traditions of the
Holy Prophet of Islam (s.a.w.) and Imams (a.s.) about musical sound,
musical instruments, and musical parties.

1. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) said: "When my Ummat (followers) will
acquire fifteen habits they will be visited by disasters:

1) When the booty will be treated as personal property;
2) and trust will become like a booty of war;
3) and charity will be (disliked) like a loss;
4&5) and man will obey his wife and disobey his mother;
6&7) and will be generous to his friend and tyrant to his father;
8) and voices will be high in the mosques;
9) and a man will be respected as a safeguard against his evil;
10) and the leader of the people will be the worst of them;
11) and men will wear silk;
12) and people will keep singing and dancing girls;
13) and will keep musical instruments;
14) and will drink intoxicants;
15) and fornication will increase;

at that time expect red storms or depression of land-mass or changing
your faces like the image of animals and the victory of your enemy upon
you; and then you will not be helped (by Allah)."

2. The Holy Prophet of Islam describing the signs of the Day of
Judgment said: "Verily amongst the signs of the Hour is that people will
neglect prayers (will not pray in the preferred time)! and will follow
their desires, and will incline towards their own preferences ... In
those days, there will be people who will learn the Qur'an for other
than Allah (i.e.; for earning worldly benefits), and will treat the
Qur'an as musical instrument (as is happening today in Islamic countries
where Qur'an is recited on the radios just to entertain the
listeners);

and there will be people who will study religion for other than Allah
(for earning prestige or wealth as is happening today when the main
purpose of study of religion is to be come a good orator, so that higher
and higher fees may be demanded from the audience), and number of
illegitimate children will increase, and people will sing the Qur'an,
... and will adore musical instruments, and will dislike enjoining the
good and forbidding the evil, ... These are the people who will be
called unclean and dirty in the kingdom of heaven."

3. Imam Jaffer Sadique (a.s.) said: "Music is the nest of hypocrisy."

4. Also he said: "Music is the worst of the sounds."

5. Imam Jafer Sadique (a.s.) said: The place where music is performed,
Allah does not look at its participants (with mercy).

6. Also the Imam (a.s.) said: "Listening to music and vain (sounds)
grows hypocrisy as the water grows the plants.

7. Hassan (a companion of Imam Jafer Sadique a.s.) said: There was a
man in my neighbourhood who had singing girls; and he always remained
immersed in music and dance. When I went to W.C., I used to stay a bit
longer (to listen to those sounds). When I want to Imam Jafer Sadique
(a.s.), he told me: O Hasan, Verily the ear, and the eye and the heart,
all of them will he asked. The ear and what it listened to, the eye and
what it looked at and the heart and what it intended."

Hasan says: When I heard that Ayat of the Qur'an, it was as though I
had never heard it before. Then I repented (from my sin of listening to
music) and made a convent with Allah not to do it again.

The Imam (a.s.) said: "Stand up have bath and pray to Allah as much as
you wish. How bad would have been your position if you had died with
this habit. Repent before Allah and ask His forgiveness for every evil
because Allah does not dislike but evil, leaves evil for evil people;
because for every thing are its people.

In a list of major sins which he sent to Caliph Mamun Rashid, Imam Ali
Ar-Ridha (a.s.) mentioned the participation in the musical gatherings.


**Music as per the Companions of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.)

** Caliph Omar heard the sound of a flute of a sheperd and he hastily
plugged his ears with his finger and turned his mouth to a different
path saying : "The Prophet (s.a.w) heard the sound of a sheperd once
when I was with him. He did not like it." Abu Aamah reported on the
authority of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w) that Holy Prophet (s.a.w)
prohibited trade in singing slave maids and training them for singing
and said that their sale proceeds were unlawful.

On the authority of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w) Hazarat Ayesha narrates
that the Prophet (s.a.w.) said that Almighty Allah has made unlawful the
trade in singing slave maids, their training and listening to their
songs. Abdur Rahman bin Auf narrates that the Holy Prophet said that
Almighty Allah has forbidden two nonsensical and wicked voices, one is
melody and the other is the cry in distress.

Akramah reports the words of Ibne Abbas that the Prophet (s.a.w.) said
that Almighty Allah has raised me to destroy flute and the drum. Sahl
Bin Saad narrates that Holy Prophet (s.a.w) said, "Submersion below the
surface of the earth, raining of stones from the sky and multilation of
figures shall come about in my ummat."

The companions asked, "O the Prophet of Allah when shall it happen.?"

The Prophet (s.a.w) there upon said:" When musical instruments shall be
in abundance and there shall be a large number of the singing girls and
shall be unlawful."

Abu Talib Tibri says that Imam Malik condemned music and forbid
listening to it and said :"If you buy a slave maid and afterwards you
find her to be singing girl, it shall be lawful for the buyer to restore
her to the seller." Imam Safii said that music was an abhorant sport. It
was just like a filty thing and the one who listening to excessive music
was a fool. His evidence shall be rejected.

Abu Tayyab says: Shafii declared music as abhorrent.

Tradition on abhorence of music has also come down from Ahmad Bin
Hambal. Abu Tayyeb Tibri says that Imam Abu Hanifa considered music as
abhorrent and held singing as sin. The same is the view of all the
scholars of Kufa like Ibrahim, Shahabi, Hammad, Soufian Thousi and
other. There is no difference even among the scholars of Basarah in
respect of its being abhorrent and forbidden.

This was the reaction of the companions towards the ordinary music of
past times. How forceful would have been their condemnation of music,
musical bands and dance of today.


**Music in the Light of Traditions**

Holy Prophet (s.a.w) said, "I forbid you to dance and to play the
flute, the drum and the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) said," Molten lead will be
put in the ears of that person who listens attentively to music and
songs.

Imam Ali Reza (a.s) said," And to listen attentively to the musical
instrument (is also a greater sin ) ..." manufacturing, buying or
selling musical instrument is forbidden, and the profits accured from
such dealings are illegal and the transaction is also null and void.
Even safe keeping of musical instrument is forbidden and to destroy them
is obligatory.

Imam Jafar Sadique (a.s) said," Allah has prohibited the manufacturing
of such things which are used for harmful purpose. And the things which
only create harm. Thus the manufacturing of harp, flute, chess, musical
instruments cross of crucification, idols is forbidden."

Imam Mohammed Baqir (a.s) said : Singing is one of those sins for which
Allah has reserved the punishment of Hell.

The place where songs and music are played, Allah's warth descends, as
the following traditions says:

Imam Ali (a.s) said," And music and songs give rise to hypocrisy, and
is one of the ways leading towards poverty and hunger.

Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) said," Molten lead will be put in the ears of
that person who listens attentively to music and songs.

Imam Jafar Sadqiue (a.s) said," Thus to teach singing and music to
learn to play it or to receive payment for it and to indulge in any kind
of musical pastime is forbidden."

Imam Jafar Sadqiue (a.s) said," Don't enter a house in which Allah's
Blessings And bounties are turned away from the habitants of the house,
at such a place neither the Supplications are responded nor the Angels
come near such place." Imam Jafar Sadqiue (a.s) said," One who has been
bestowed with favours of Allah; while in possession of such favours
plays flute, he has been unthankful to the favours of Allah."


**(10) Music and the Last Epoch**

Masoomeen (a.s) said," And you will see that music will become so
common that no one will forbid others. Nor will anyone find himself the
courage to forbid anyone."

The words masoomeen is a proved fact as we do experience the situation
in our day to day lives.

**(11) Singing and Adultery**

Singing becomes the cause of Adultery as the below mentioned tradition
states: The Holy Prophet (s.a.w) said," Singing is a ladder to
Adultery." Singing gives rise to the lust in man which ultimately gives
out bad consequences. Not only he who sings but also the one who listens
attentively to it becomes negligent towards Allah and is ready for
immoral deeds.

Imam Jafar Sadqiue (a.s) said," All those past times and amusement are
major sins, which makes a person negligent in remembering Allah. Example
people indulging in singing, music and musical gadgets. Yes, indeed its
a fact that music not only makes shame and modesty disappear, but also
destroys love, brotherhood and generousness. In short, it makes the
whole environment a specimen of Hell.

**(12) Effects of Music**

Imam Jafar Sadqiue (a.s) said, "One who plays music in the house for
forty days, will be beset by a satan named Fogander. Allah will cause
that satan to occupy each and every part of that persons body. When this
would happen then shame would depart from him and he would not care what
he is saying, nor what is being said about him. Then the Satan would
blow unto him and after that his modesty would be completely destroyed.
Then he would not feel ashamed, even if the chastity of his women is
being defiled."

The Holy Prophet (s.a.w) said," the playing of violen cause hypocrisy
to grow in the heart, in the same way as water becomes the cause of the
growth of greenery."

Imam Ali (a.s) said," Angels do not enter the house which has wine,
drum, tambourine or a flute. Even the innovations of the people of that
house are not accepted, and the fortunate blessings from them are taken
away." Imam Ali Reza (a.s) said," That person in whose house is kept for
forty days a drum' flute or any other musical instrument chess or
similar things that person invokes the warth of Allah and if that person
dies during those forty days his death shall be of a transgressor and a
libertine. His abode shall be Hell and what a terrible abode it is."

The Holy Prophet (s.a.w) said," A person who sings will be put in the
group of those people on whom Allah will not look with grace, on the Day
of Judgement."

Dance halls are modern nurseries of the Divorce Courts, training shops
of prostitution, and the graduating school of infamy and vice. "Dr. l.
l. Holling worth.)

I attack the mordern dance as a reversion towards savagery. As a
medical man, I flatly charge that modern social dancing is fundamentally
sinful and evil. I charge that it is the most insidious of the monoevres
prelimary to sex betrayal. It is nothing more or less than damnable dia
bolical animal physical, dissipation. Do brother and sister dance like
that? Father & mother? Mother & son? I tell you the basic spell of the
dance is the spell of illict physical contact ... We doctors know trial
of broken homes prove this." (Dr. E.S. Sonners)

**(13) Musicians Fate**

The Holy Prophet (s.a.w) said," The person possessing aguiler WILL be
brought on the Day of Judgement with a black face he would have a guitar
of fire in his hand, and above him will be seventy thousand angels, all
carrying the maces of fire. They would be striking the maces on the head
and face of that person And the singer shall arise from his grave blind,
deaf and dumb and the adulterer shall also be raised from the graves in
this way. And the one who plays flute shall be similarly raised and the
one who plays the drum too."

The above Tradition clearly proves that all those people involving
themselves in singing, committing adultery or playing musical
instruments will be gathered on the Day of judgement as Deaf, Dumb and
Blind.

Let us seek refuge in Allah from the temptations of Shaitaan so that he
may never lead us into the disgraceful vice of listening to music. Let
us make a firm resolution to keep our houses clean of this ignominy, let
our children listen to sounds inuocating and glorifying Allah, rather
than the satanic chants of music.

Let us not follow the habits promoted by the killers of Imam Hussain
(a.s.).

Let us make a firm determination to eradicate this sin from our society
completely.

**(14) Influence of Music**

Often people are heard to say: "But music has so much influence upon
our feelings; so why such a thing should be forbidden?" But it is
precisely because of its great influence upon heart and mind that it is
forbidden. There would have been no need to ban it if it were with out
any effect. The thing which is to be decided is whether its influence is
good or bad. And it has been shown in the previous pages that music and
dance have harmful effects physiologically, spiritually and ethically
upon human beings.

Music is like intoxicants in that it makes one forget one's
surroundings; and one does not know what is happening to him or her. The
following episode is a good example of the effect of music: Frank King
is reported in 'Reader's Digest (Vol. E No. 481; May 1962) as saying:

"I returned home one evening and noticed a large red mark that looked
like a burn on my wife's right cheek. When I asked her what had happened
she sheepishly told me the story. She set up the iron-board in the
living room so that she could watch a favourite television programme
while doing the ironing the telephone table was also near at hand. As
she was intently watching TV, the phone rang, and she reached out
automatically and answered the iron."

Another interesting story was published in the Tanganyika Standard
(Dar-es-Salaam) some 23 years ago. A pregnant woman attended a musical
programme in a local cinema. She became so much engrossed in it that she
gave birth to a baby on the spot without realizing what was happening to
her. 'Was it a cinema hall or maternity home?', asked the paper.

Realizing the importance of this engrossing quality of music, the
scientists are trying to use it as an aid in surgery. Reader's Digest
(Vol. 80, No. 477; January, 1962) writes:

"Audio-analgesia, or painkilling by sound, is one of modern science's
newest discoveries. The combination of music and other sounds has
alleviated pain in dentistry, surgery and childbirth. Nobody can predict
how widely the technique will be used, but those who have^ experienced
it entertained high hopes —like the new mother who wheeled from the
delivery room exclaiming, What a wonderful experience! I'll always
remember South pacific.

Palcetry Galiard, while on the operation table, asked for one of his
own musical tapes to be played in the room. The effect was a spate of
grief which made as present cry; and the operation was performed without
any anesthetic.

All this goes a long way to prove that the music has the same effect on
nerves and mind as the anesthesia. Nobody, in his right mind, would
suggest that chloroform should be daily used by the general public,
because it is such a good thing in the operation theatre. If music is a
good anaesthetic, let it be used in surgery and deliveries of children.
But can that use ever justify its common use in every home at all times
and in all circumstances?


**Appendix**

Note : Here I would like to include an article "Television — A Blessing
or a curse?" by Muntazir. If a child is afraid of something, expose him
to it often and his fears will diminish or disappear. Dr. Victor B.
Cline, a University of Utah (USA) Psychologist and four year research
assistant, wrote, "Psychologists have for years demonstrated, for
example, that you can overcome a person's fear of snakes by gradually
exposing him to others who casually play with snakes." He then adds, "It
stands to reason that you can also change attitudes and emotional
responses to violence, sex and various antisocial behavior by repeated
exposure."

Everyone, especially a Muslim, should seriously consider the effect
before he exposes himself or his children to anti-religious behavior.
These days, it is a sign of "Education" and "intelligentsia" to have
Television at home, giving little thought to its long-term effect,
especially on children.

Much research has been done in the United States of America on the
effect of Television on its viewers. President Nixon had appointed a
Commission to study Causes and Prevention of Violence. The commission,
in its Report published in; 1970, said that Television networks were
"pandering to a public preoccupation with violence that television
itself has helped to generate." The Commission concluded that on the
basis of many experimental studies "observed violence stimulates
aggressive behavior."

Dr. Robert M. Liepert of the State University of New York at Stony
Brook (U.S.A.), after considerable research, concluded: "There is a link
between televised violence and aggressive behavior for the majority of
normal children." Although it has previously been assumed that only
abnormal children would be affected by viewing scenes of violence,
Liepert strongly disagreed. He writes, "The data show no evidence that
only a minority is influenced. This is a factual error."

Dr. Victor B. Cline, the Psychologist, says that "The media are
powerful teachers of values and ethical behaviour, and sometimes may
play a more significant role than the Church."

To this "Newsweek" commentator, Joseph Morgenstern, adds: "If the
effect of Television violence on children has been finally demonstrated,
it's not un reasonable to assume that ultra-violence in the movie has
some effect on adults."

The real danger of films shown on Television lies in the philosophy of
life or value system that they propagate very subtly in many cases. This
underlying more system does not get edited out for television, as do
most of the sex scenes and profanity.

And one cannot switch off the set as soon as some thing objectionable
appears, because often the viewer does not even realise the subtle moral
implication of the film. Even an intelligent and educated person can
easily be effected by such films.

On U.S.A. T.V., a film "Easy Rider" was show which made heroes of two
young men who "earned their freedom to take a crosscountry motorcycle
tour by smuggling heroin into the United States from Mexico. NO
criticism of their offense, nor even of their own indulgence in drugs
was implied in the film. In fact, smoking marijuana was portrayed as
perfectly normal and very agreeable, and even the use of hard drugs left
no ill-effects. When these points were discussed with a group of College
freshmen-all of them from highly religious homes of them admitted that
the film had left them confused about using drugs. "It (the film) made
it look so nice, "one said, (Eternity-October, 1971, pp. 29).

In some films the main characters are portrayed as sweet, gentle,
loving and admirable young people, in spite of the fact that they are in
bed with partners whose names they do not know. Even a person with
firmly grounded sexual morals and little temptation to change them
begins to sympathize with these gentle youngsters and to feel that,
after all, such behaviour is not particularly damaging.

When children are exposed to such films, it gradually changes their
attitude and undoes what the poor Mulla or Maulana has been trying to
instill in them.

Almost every evening he sees ngomas, dances, kissing, dating, violence,
scenes of night clubs; and eventually he accepts all these things as
normal and starts considering all those who oppose these things as
"abnormal". It might be argued that not much violence or immoral films
are shown on local Television. It should, however, be borne in mind that
poison, however small the dose, seeps in and does damage.

Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that the standard of morality
of those who control showing of television programmes is different from
ours. Things which in their eyes are "innocent" are most objectionable
from our point of view. Drinking, dating, dancing, kissing, etcetera,
may be "innocent" to them but we would not like our children to accept
these ideas and follow them.

Even with much noise being made by those in authority about guarding
the morality of the public, quite Often extremely objectionable films,
even from their own point of view, are shown on television. Once such a
highly objectionable film was shown on Nairobi television about which
"East African Standard" had to write as follows:

"The Nana' controversy is just dying out the film having now been
"deported" to Mombasa. But another Nana' in the name of Celestina'
appeared on V.O.K. television last Wednesday, as the Midweek movie.

Part of this otherwise excellent drama depicts Celestina's husband
indulging in massage treatment to a charming and highly romantic young
girl. The exercise develops into proper romance when Celestina's husband
starts undressing the girl, and she obliges. The bedroom scene continues
until: Enter Celestina, looking furious.

Having suspected what was taking place, she picks up a knife and drives
it into her husband's heart. I would not mind seeing this film, and
particularly the sex scene, in a cinema, as it would be my individual
decision to see it by paying for it.

What V.O.K. has done is to bring right in our homes such a film with
highly romantic scenes. What are we expected to do in our houses with
children around? Just look at such scenes and laugh them off? One
wonders what sort of society we are trying to build." (EAST AFRICAN
STANDARD — 15.5.72)

The "Perry Mason" and "Falk" series films which are often shown on our
television are American films showing violence, immorality, etc, which
is likely to have an effect, specially on children. Some of these films
propagate "ends justify the means" slogan. In a film called "Evening
Rider" shown on Cost television, a teenager was shown married to a man
her father's age and being tempted by the husband's own son of the same
age. (East African Standard, 19th April, 1983). It left one with the
impression that adultery, for such a teenager was justified.

"Grab Game" was shown on Nairobi television which showed a person
looking for a job attacking the manager of the firm and the manager
tells him in fear to "come next Thursday" (East African Standard,
12.3.73) it was nothing but propagation of "Might is right". That such
films have an effect on even adults car be judged from the reviews of
these programmes from accredited journalists who are not only
intelligent but highly educated.

A reviewer of Television of East African Standard once wrote, "I have
in mind the fact that a procrastinating father finds himself sharing a
girl friend with his own son. One may turn round and blame the poor girl
for having extended both hands, but what about difficult time when the
father, and I bet he was doing it without the knowledge of his perhaps
halfway starving family, offers assistance, including paying overseas
academic fees and all that goes with it.?

(EAST AFRICAN STANDARD 26.3.73)

It can be seen that instead of revolting against the immorality of the
girl, viewers are made to sympathize with her and condone her actions.
The censor Boards controlling showing of programmes on television
change, and we may see a time when the Board is more lax and permissive.
We may then see highly objectionable films being shown on our television
which have brought chaos in the United States of America. It will then
be difficult to tell our children to stop viewing TV when we have
introduced it to them and made them its addict.

However strict we may be at home in trying to control what programme
our children should see, but once they are addicted to it they will see
even the highly objectionable programmes as and when they get an
opportunity. We shall be held responsible before God for introducing
televisions to them and weakening their moral fibre. God says in Quran,
"O ye who believe, save yourselves and your families from a fire whose
fuel is men and stones." (66.7)

Let us not expose our children to immoral behaviour and turn them into
fuel of fire. (All quotations in this article unless stated or
