Types of Pilgrimage
===================

There are three types of pilgrimages:
1. Tamatu.

2. Ifraad.

3. Qiraan.

The first is the obligation on those who reside more than 48 miles from
Makkah and the other two are prescribed for those who reside within 48
miles of Makkah.

Hajj-ut-Tamatu
--------------

This is divided into two parts.
1. Umra-ut-Tamatu.

2. Hajj-ut-Tamatu.

Philosophy of Umra-ut-Tamatu
----------------------------

The first part of pilgrimage is *Umra-ut-Tamattu* the reason might be
that during the Umra the cleansing of soul begins and during the
pilgrimage rites it reaches its zenith. A person's soul heats up during
*Umra* and pilgrimage cooks it completely. A hot thing can become cold
but a cooked thing cannot become raw.

If while performing *Umra* the body made the soul do *tawaf* then during
the pilgrimage the soul should guide the body during *tawaf.*
