------------------------------------------------------------------------

1-  Note that it is better to seek permission of the
Executor(s)/Trustee(s) of your will. Failure to do this and listing
someone without their permission does not mean the named
Executor/Trustee will carry out their duties; they can even refuse to
act.

2-  A Will should be updated from time to time. A change in the
circumstances may require one to change his/her Will. For example if one
of the Executor passes away then, a new Executor for one’s Will should
be immediately appointed.

3-  Note that only permanent wives can inherit, wives on a temporary
contract with a man cannot inherit from his estate, although children
from a such wife would be entitled to inherit.

4-  Children from a divorced wife/husband are entitled to inherit. Only
legitimate children can inherit.

5-  Note that adopted children are not lawful heirs and should not be
listed here. Note also that if you have a child(ren) who you have given
up for adoption, then that child(ren) must be listed here.

6-  It is advisable to seek permission from the guardian before writing
his/her name here.

\* It is advisable to have all your bank accounts in joint names, where
either of the account holders can operate it.
