28: Stories (qasas)
===================

This nine-section chapter consists of 88 late Meccan verses, except for
VV. 52- 55 (in section VI) which date from Madina. The whole chapter was
revealed after The Ants 27 which immediately precedes it. and before The
Night Journey 17, during the Transfer from Mecca to Madina in the year 0
/ 622.

The reader should gather all of these tales about Moses and the proud
rich man, Qarun (VIII), together and try to understand them they are
similar to the comparisons found in Poets in Chapter 26.

Moses previously appears in Midian in connection with the Burning Bush
(IIV), and we are once more shown God and His light in vii. The chapter
ends with solace for Muhammad and believers, and relief for the
Prophet's worries as they all contemplate God's face (IX).
