Story n. 1: Little Ahmad’s Present
==================================

Little Ahmad had a toy in his hand as he left his home happily.  
 One of his friends of the street asked “Ahmad, why are you so happy?”
To which Ahmad replied “My father promised me to get a toy as a present
for me if I learnt the Usool-e-Deen. I did, and my father bought this
for me”.  
 The children said “Now that you know it, can you say it for us?”  
 Ahmad began:

First – Tawheed,  
 Second - Nabuwwat  
 Third – Adal  
 Fourth - Imamat  
 Fifth – Qiyaamat

Bravo to those fathers who make their children aware of the various
topics of the religion.
