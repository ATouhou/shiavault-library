J - Jabir Ibn Abdullah Al-Ansari
================================

Jabir, along with Atiya, were amongst the greatest Shi'as -followers of
Imam Ali. They came to Karbala after Imam Husayn's martyrdom. Jabir was
born 15 years before the Hijra (journey) of the Prophet in Medeenah. He
was originally from the tribe of Khazraj.

His father was killed in the battle of Ohod with the Prophet (pbuh&hf).
He fought in 18 of the Prophet's battles, and in Siffeeen with the Imam
Ali Ibn Abi Talib. He was struck with blindness at the end of his life
and was killed by Al- Hajjaj only because of his loyalty to Ahlul Bayt
in 78 AH at the age of 91.
