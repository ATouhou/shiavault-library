Abstract
========

Man is innately curious about ‘causes’ and it is this same quality that
has impelled him to seek the origin or the primary cause of existence.
As far as God is concerned, everyone seeks Him in a different way.
However, to prove His existence, the Glorious Quran has taught us to use
simple but strong reasonings. Among such reasonings, the Quran has put
more stress on the ‘reasoning of order’. The proof, which is attainable
through study and contemplation in the secrets and wonders of creation
and the tremendous harmony, concord and consistency embedded in it.

This work, through the ‘reasoning of order’ deals with theology (knowing
god) and oneness, the attributes of God, the different types of oneness
and also justice.

This book is part of ideological collection of “Youths and Truths” with
topics such as: Knowing God, Resurrection, Prophethood and the Prophet
of Islam, Introduction to Islam, Rights and duties of Women, Imamate and
the Imams, Youth and Spouse Selection. All these volumes are written by
Ayatullah Ibrahim Amini, who has succeeded to author this collection
based on years of delving into religious texts and sources, constant
contact with the young generation and pondering over ideological and
educational issues.
