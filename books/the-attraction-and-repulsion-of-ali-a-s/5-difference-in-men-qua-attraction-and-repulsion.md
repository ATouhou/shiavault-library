Difference in Men Qua Attraction and Repulsion:
===============================================

**( 23 )**

For the individual attraction and repulsion, all men are not equal to
one another; they are rather divisible in various groups: -

Individuals who neither have attraction nor repulsion: They are no
body's friends and no body's foes. They do neither excite any body's
love, devotion or friendship, nor do they instigate anybody to
animosity, hatred, jealousy and vindictiveness; without being
acknowledged they move about amidst men as if a stone happens to be
afoot.

He is a good-for-nothing and is an infructuous being. A man without any
positive point (positive herein is not confined only to virtues, it also
covers wretchedness) virtue-wise or vice-wise, is an animal, feeds
himself goes to sleep, and moves about amidst men. Like a sheep, he is
no body's friend and no body's foe. If men care about a sheep or serve
water and fodder to it, it is just as a measure preparatory to its
slaughter, as and when so required. He blows neither trade wind nor
otherwise. They are a group rightly called: Cheap individuals, vain and
shallow. Man needs friends and needs to befriend and vice-versa, we say
man needs foes and needs to be offended.
