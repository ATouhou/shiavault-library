Right n. 5: The Right of the Sight
==================================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حق البصر
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَأَمَّا حَقُّ بَصَرِكَ فَغَضُّهُ عَمَّا لا يَحِلُّ لَكَ وتَرْكُ
ابْتِذَالِهِ إلاّ لِمَوضِعِ عِبْرَةٍ تَسْتَقْبلُ بهَا بَصَرًا أَو
تَسْتَفِيدُ بهَا عِلْمًا، فَإنَّ الْبَصَرَ بَابُ الِاعْتِبَارِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**And the right of your sight is that you lower it before everything
which is unlawful to you. And that you abandon using it except in
situations in which you can take heed in such a way that you gain
insight or acquire knowledge by it. Indeed the sight is the gateway to
reflection.**

Both vision and the eyes are considered here. For example, consider the
following verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَا أَمْرُ السَّاعَةِ إِلاَّ كَلَمْحِ الْبَصَرِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And the Decision of the Hour (of Judgment) is as the twinkling of an
eye.” [The Holy Qur’an, al-Naĥl 16:77]***

Also, consider the following verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْسَّمْعَ وَالأَبْصَارَ وَالأَفْئِدَةَ لَعَلَّكُمْ
تَشْكُرُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And He gave you hearing and sight and intelligence and affections:
that ye may give thanks (to God).” [The Holy Qur’an, al-Naĥl 16:78]***

It also covers the concept of insight. For example, consider the
following verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْ هَـذِهِ سَبِيلِي أَدْعُو إِلَى اللّهِ عَلَى بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَاْ
وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِي وَسُبْحَانَ اللّهِ وَمَا أَنَاْ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Say thou: "This is my way: I do invite unto God, - on evidence clear
as the seeing with one's eyes, - I and whoever follows me. Glory to God!
And never will I join gods with God!" [The Holy Qur’an, Yusuf 12:108]***

The Vision System: A Multidisciplinary One
------------------------------------------

The vision system is so important in our understanding that it is given
special consideration in psychology. It is so important in physics
because it is related to light and optics. It is given especial
consideration by philosophers because it is important in discovering
mysterious things. It is of especial consideration in biology because it
is an important part of the human body. Thus, it is not an exaggeration
to say that it is the subject of study of several fields of science.

Proper Use of the Eyes
----------------------

God the Almighty advised us about the importance of the eyes in the Holy
Qur’an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَلَمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُ عَيْنَيْنِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Have We not made for him a pair of eyes?” [The Holy Qur’an, al-Balad
90:8]***

The eyes are man’s most important means of communicating with the
outside world. The eyes are so amazing that they force us to be humble
to our Creator. However, some people do not make proper use of them:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلَقَدْ ذَرَأْنَا لِجَهَنَّمَ كَثِيراً مِّنَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ
لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ لاَّ يَفْقَهُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْيُنٌ لاَّ
يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ آذَانٌ لاَّ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا أُوْلَـئِكَ
كَالأَنْعَامِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْغَافِلُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Many are the Jinns and men we have made for Hell: They have hearts
wherewith they understand not, eyes wherewith they see not, and ears
wherewith they hear not. They are like cattle, - nay more misguided: for
they are heedless (of warning).”[The Holy Qur’an, al-A’raf 7:179]***

There is a tradition from the Prophet of God regarding the above verse
[al-Balad 90:8] which reads: “God told the children of Adam:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يا بْنَ آدَمَ! إنْ نازَعَكَ لِسانُكَ في ما حَرَّمْتُ عَلَيكَ فَقَد
أَعَنْتُكَ عَليهِ بِطَبَقَتَينِ فَأَطْبِقْ. وإنْ نازَعَكَ بَصَرُكَ إلى
بَعضِ ما حَرَّمْتُ عَلَيكَ فقَدْ أَعَنْتُكَ عَلَيهِ بِطَبَقَتَينِ
فَأطْبِقْ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“O Children of Adam! I have given you two lips. If your tongue tries to
make you commit a forbidden act, close your lips. I have given you
eyelids. If your eyes try to make you commit a forbidden act, close your
eyelids.”*[^1]

The eyes must be closed to what is forbidden by God. We read the
following about the unbelievers in the Holy Qur’an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الَّذِينَ كَانَتْ أَعْيُنُهُمْ فِي غِطَاء عَن ذِكْرِي وَكَانُوا لَا
يَسْتَطِيعُونَ سَمْعًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“(Unbelievers) whose eyes had been under a veil from remembrance of
Me, and who had been unable even to hear.” [The Holy Qur’an, al-Kahf
18:101]***

In this verse, we read that the unbelievers did not close their eyes to
what is forbidden to look at. Rather they closed their eyes from what
reminds man of God. They did not hear even though they had the hearing
faculty. In fact, the unbelievers disabled their most useful faculty to
seek the truth and realize the realities. It is interesting to note that
God says that their eyes had been under a veil from His remembrance.
Thus, they could not see God’s signs. They went astray due to not seeing
the truth. We cannot see God’s remembrance with our eyes. Rather we see
His signs that remind us of him.

Looking at One’s Creation
-------------------------

One proper use of the eyes is in cases that the Qur’an has pointed out.
The Qur’an invites us to look at our own creation in the following
verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَلْيَنظُرِ الْإِنسَانُ مِمَّ خُلِقَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
خُلِقَ مِن مَّاء دَافِقٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَخْرُجُ مِن بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَائِبِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Now let man but think from what he is created! He is created from a
drop emitted proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.” [The
Holy Qur’an, al-Tariq 86:5-7]***

Thus, the Qur’an directs man to consider how he is created from sperm to
realize what we are.

Looking at Food
---------------

The second instance that the Qur’an invites man to look to is to
consider what he eats. The Qur’an says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَلْيَنظُرِ الْإِنسَانُ إِلَى طَعَامِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Then let man look at his food, (and how We provide it)” [The Holy
Qur’an, ‘Abasa 80:24]***

The closest thing to man that exists outside our body but becomes a part
of us when eaten is food. If we do not eat, we will die soon. That is
why the Qur’an stresses food items, especially those derived from plants
and trees. There are various interpretations of this verse. Some
consider this looking to be considering whether what we have obtained
for eating is from legitimate means or not. Others consider food for the
mind, too. Imam Baqir said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عِلمُهُ الّذي يأخُذُهُ، عَمَّنْ يأخُذُهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Look and see from whom you get your knowledge.”*[^2]

There are many occasions in the Qur’an where we are instructed to look
such as:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللّهَ
وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الطَّاغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللّهُ وَمِنْهُم
مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلالَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِي الأَرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ
كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

***For We assuredly sent amongst every People an apostle, (with the
Command), "Serve God, and eschew Evil": of the People were some whom God
guided and some on whom error became inevitably (established). So,
travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who denied
(the Truth). [The Holy Qur’an, al-Naĥl 16:36]***

We also read:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْ سِيرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ فَانظُرُوا كَيْفَ بَدَأَ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ
اللَّهُ يُنشِئُ النَّشْأَةَ الْآخِرَةَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ
شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Say: Travel through the earth and see how God did originate
creation; so will God produce a later creation: for God has power over
all things.” [The Holy Qur’an, al-‘Ankabut 29:20]***

It is Forbidden to Look at Unfamiliar Women
-------------------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَغُضُّوا مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِمْ وَيَحْفَظُوا
فُرُوجَهُمْ ذَلِكَ أَزْكَى لَهُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا
يَصْنَعُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ

وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَى جُيُوبِهِنَّ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ

  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard
their modesty: that will make for greater purity for them: And God is
well acquainted with all that they do. And say to the believing women
that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they
should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must
ordinarily) appear thereof; that they should draw their veils over their
bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their
fathers, their husband's fathers, their sons, their husband’s sons,
their brothers or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their
women, or the slaves whom their right hands possess, or male servants
free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame
of sex; and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw
attention to their hidden ornaments. And O ye Believers! Turn ye all
together towards God, that ye may attain Bliss.” [The Holy Qur’an,
al-Nur 24:30-31]***

In these verses, we are advised to look down when we encounter an
unfamiliar woman.[^3] We cannot close our eyes since then we cannot walk
or we might fall down on the ground. However, by limiting our view we
can reduce the amount that we see. Thus, we restrict our looking at the
forbidden. As said before God has admonished men and women against
looking at each other. There are many traditions that have expressed the
ill effects of such looks.

Muhammad ibn Yaqoob quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn Yahya on the
authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad on the authority of Ibn Fazzil on the
authority of Ali ibn Aqabeh on the authority of his father that he heard
Imam Sadiq say:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
النَّظْرَةُ سَهْمٌ مِن سِهامِ إبْلِيسَ مَسْمومٌ، وَكَم مِن نَظْرَةٍ
أوْرَثَتْ حَسْرَةً طَويلَةً
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“A look is like a poisonous dart from the darts of Satan. How many a
look has caused long-lasting regret.”*[^4]

The similitude between a look and a dart is because a dart will pierce
through when it hits the target. A dirty look will also tear down the
veils of modesty and chastity. Some dirty looks might lead to a
long-lasting sorrow. There are many people whose life is ruined due to a
dirty look. Then they cannot compensate for this all lifelong. They will
be sorry but it will be of no use. Ibn Abi Umayr quoted on the authority
of Al-Kaheli on the authority of Imam Sadiq :

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
النَّظْرَةُ بَعدَ النَّظرَةِ تَزْرعُ في القَلبِ الشَّهْوَةَ وكَفَى
بِها لِصاحِبِها فِتْنَةً.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“One look after another will sow the seeds of desire in the heart, and
it is sufficient temptation for the person.”*[^5]

Imam Sadiq said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ نَظَرَ إلى امْرَأةٍ فَرَفَعَ بَصَرَهُ إلى السَّماءِ لمَ يَرْتَدَّ
إليَهِ بَصَرُهُ حَتىّ يُزَوِّجَهُ اللهُ مِن الحُورِ العِينِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“If one sees a woman but turns away his eyes and looks at the sky, he
will be rewarded with a ‘Hoori’*[^6] *in Heaven.”* [^7]

However, there are exceptions that are discussed below.

Exceptions
----------

We learned from the verses of the Holy Qur’an and the sayings of Imam
Sajjad that it is not permitted to look at divinely forbidden sights.
Now we will point out exceptions to this rule in Islam. One such case is
looking at a woman with whom you want to marry. There is a chapter in
Wasa\`il al-Shī\`ah on this subject. The first tradition in this chapter
is as follows.

Muhammad ibn Yaqub quoted on the authority of Ali ibn Ibrahim, on the
authority of his father, on the authority of Ibn Abi Amir, on the
authority of Ayoub ibn Khazar, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Muslim
who asked Imam Baqir :

“Can a man who intends to marry a woman look at her?” Imam Baqir said:
“Yes, since he wants to buy the most expensive thing.”[^8] This
tradition only discusses the permission to look. There are other
traditions that clarify things more.

Ali ibn Ibrahim quoted on the authority of his father on the authority
of Hisham ibn Salim, Himad ibn Isa and Hafs ibn Bakhtari on the
authority of Imam Sadiq :

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لا بَأْسَ بأنْ يَنظُرَ إلى وَجْهِها وَمَعاصِمِها إذا أرادَ أنْ
يَتَزَوَّجَها.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“When one intends to marry a woman, it is fine for him to look at her
face and her wrists.”*[^9]

In another tradition from Abi Al-Ash\`ari on the authority of Hasan ibn
al-Sani, Imam Sadiq was asked: “How is it if a man who intends to marry
a woman looks at her carefully. He looks at her face and the back of her
head.” Imam Sadiq replied: “When he intends to marry her it is fine for
him to look at her face and the back of her head.”[^10] There are also
other traditions in this respect that permit looking without lustful
intentions.

The Look of a Male Doctor at a Female Patient
---------------------------------------------

Another exception to this rule applies to a female patient whom no one
but a male doctor can treat. This is expressed in Chapter 130 of
Wasa\`il al-Shī\`ah. The first tradition in this chapter reads:
“Muhammad ibn Yaqoob quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn Isa, on the
authority of Ali ibn al-Hikam, on the authority of Abi Hamzah al-Thumali
that Imam Baqir was asked:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
سَأَلْتُهُ عَن المَرْأةِ المُسْلِمَةِ يُصِيبُها البَلاءُ في جَسَدِها
إمّا كَسْرٌ وَإمّا جُرْحٌ في مَكانٍ لا يَصْلُحُ النَّظَرُ إلَيهِ
يَكونُ الرَّجُلُ أرْفَقَ بِعلاجِهِ مِن النِّسَاءِ، أيَصْلُحُ لهُ
النَّظَرُ إلَيها؟ قَال: إذا اضْطُرَّتْ إلَيهِ فلْيُعالجْها إنْ شاءَتْ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Consider when a Muslim woman is ill, injured or a part of her body is
broken in a place that cannot be looked at. If the male doctor is more
expert in treating her than women, can he look at her body?” The Imam
said: “If she is compelled to do it, then let him treat her if she
wishes.”*[^11]

Looking at Bedouin Women and Women under the Protection of Islam
----------------------------------------------------------------

Another exception is looking at Bedouin women and those who live under
the protection of Islam. There are two traditions on this issue in
Chapter 112 of Wasa\`il al-Shī\`ah. Muhammad ibn Yaqoob quoted on the
authority of Ali ibn Ibrahim on the authority of his father on the
authority of al-Nawfeli on the authority of al-Sak’kooni on the
authority of Imam Sadiq that God’s Prophet said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لا حُرْمَةَ لِنِساءِ أهْلِ الذِّمَّةِ أنْ يُنْظَرَ إلى شُعُورِهِنَّ
وَأَيْدِيهِنَّ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“It is not forbidden to look at the hair or the hands of women who live
under the protection of Islam.”*[^12]

Muhammad ibn Yaqoob quoted on the authority of some of the companions,
on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of Ibn
Mahboob, on the authority of Ibad ibn Sohayb, on the authority of Imam
Sadiq :

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لا بَأسَ بِالنَّظَرِ إلى رُؤوسِ أهْلِ تِهامَةَ وَالأعْرابِ وأهْلِ
السَّوادِ والعُلوجِ لأنَّهُم إذا نُهُوا لا يَنْتَهونَ. (قال)
والمَجْنُونَةُ وَالمَغْلوبَةُ على عَقْلِها لا بَأسَ بالنَّظَرِ إلى
شَعْرِها وَجَسَدِها ما لمَ يَتَعَمَّدْ ذلِكَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“There is no harm in looking at the head and the hair of the people of
Tihamah, Bedouin women, (women from) the people of the lowlands (of
Iraq) and infidels, since such women will not abstain (from displaying
themselves) when they are forbidden.” (He said); “And there is no harm
in looking at the hair and body of the possessed or mentally disturbed
women as long as there are no bad intentions.”*[^13]

An Educational Look
-------------------

Imam Sajjad said: “Indeed sight is the gateway to learning.” Educational
looks can help us learn and gain benefits. Haroun wrote to Imam Kazim :

“Please advise me tersely.” The Imam replied:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا مِنْ شَيءٍ تَراهُ عَينُكَ إلاّ وفِيهِ مَوعِظَةٌ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“There is nothing on which you look in which there is no advice for
you.”*[^14]

Imam Ali said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا أكْثَرَ العِبَرَ وأَقَلَّ المُعْتَبِرَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“How many lessons are there to learn, and how few those who learn
them!”*[^15]

He also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَن اعْتَبَرَ أبْصَرَ ومَنْ أبْصَرَ فَهِمَ وَمَن فَهِمَ عَلِمَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Whoever looks in order to learn will gain insight. Whoever gains
insight will understand. Whoever understands will attain ranks of having
knowledge.”*[^16]

There is a tradition that is about the time Imam Ali passed by the
Mada’in palace and saw the ruins of the palace of Khosrow about to
collapse. One of his companions remembered the poem by Ibn Ya’fur as
follows: “Winds started blowing in their ruins as if they all had a
meeting place to which they rush.” Then Imam Ali said: “Why did you not
recite the following verses of the Holy Qur’an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كَمْ تَرَكُوا مِن جَنَّاتٍ وَعُيُونٍ وَزُرُوعٍ وَمَقَامٍ كَرِيمٍ
وَنَعْمَةٍ كَانُوا فِيهَا فَاكِهِينَ كَذَٰلِكَ ۖ وَأَوْرَثْنَاهَا
قَوْمًا آخَرِينَ فَمَا بَكَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّمَاءُ وَالْأَرْضُ وَمَا
كَانُوا مُنْظَرِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“How many were the gardens and springs they left behind, and
corn-fields and noble buildings, and wealth (and conveniences of life),
wherein they had taken such delight! Thus (was their end)! And We made
other people inherit (those things)! And neither Heaven nor earth shed a
tear over them: nor were they given a respite (again).” [The Holy
Qur’an, al-Dukhan 44:25-29]***

These verses are related to Pharaoh and his tribe. They committed many
atrocities but were finally destroyed. Their land and rule fell into the
hands of the Israelites, they themselves sank at sea, and nothing could
save them. Such events should be looked upon with an educational look,
and we should learn from them.

Imam Ali al-Naqi and Al-Mutawakkil
----------------------------------

Masoudi has recorded that when the agents of Mutawakkil forced their way
into Imam Ali al-Naqi’s house to search and did not find anything they
let Mutawakkil know that. He was drunk in his palace and ordered them to
bring the Imam there. When the Imam was brought in, he respected him,
had him sit next to himself and offered him a drink of wine.

The Imam said: “Excuse me. Wine has never entered into my blood and
body.” Mutawakkil said: “Then tell me some poems.” The Imam said: “I am
not acquainted with poetry.” Mutawakkil insisted. Then the Imam said
some beautiful poems in Arabic as follows:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
باتوا على قُلَلِ الأجْيالِ تَحْرِسُهُمْ غُلْبُ الرِّجالِ فَلَمْ
تَنْفَعْهُمْ القُلَلِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ اسْتُنْزِلُوا بَعُدَ عِزٍّ عَن مَعاقِلِهِمْ وَ اُسْكِنوا حُفْراً يا
بِئسَ ما نَزَلوا
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ناداهُمْ صارِخٌ مِنْ بَعْدِ دَفْنِهِمْ أينَ الأساوِرُ وُ التِّيْجانُ
وَ الحُلَلُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أينَ الوُجُوهُ الَّتِي كانَتْ مُنَعَّمَةً مِن دونِها تُضْرَبُ
الأسْتارُ وَ الكِلَلُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَأفْصَحَ القَبْرُ عَنْهُمْ حِينَ سائَلَهُمْ تِلْكَ الوُجُوهُ عَلَيها
الدُّودُ تَنْتَقِلُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَدْ طالَما أكَلُوا دَهْراً وَ قَدْ شَرِبُوا فَأصْبَحُوا اليَومَ
بَعْدَ الأكْلِِ قَدْ اُكِلُوا
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“They lived at the highest points of their palaces for a while;*  
*they were guarded there and protected by their especial guards;*

*however, these high points were of no use for them;*  
*they fell down from their strong castles in which they lived with
honor;*  
*and became residents of the ditches of their graves;*

*How bad a place to which they descended;*  
*after they were buried there, a call came;*  
*as to what had happened to all those jewels, bracelets and crowns?;*

*What had happened to all those wealthy and happy faces?*  
*They were forgotten and lost.*

*A call came from the grave responding;*  
*that the faces have become homes for worms;*  
*they were busy eating for a long time;*  
*but their dawn came and they became eaten themselves.”*[^17]

When Mutawakkil heard these poems, he cried so hard that tears rained
down on his face. Some even say that he put down his cup of wine. Yes,
this is the outlook that can be educational. However, Mutawakkil did not
gain any benefits from this lesson! The story of Orwe Salm has been
quoted by Mohaddith Qumi on the authority of Imam Sadiq as follows:

“The Prophet David left his house while he was reading the Psalms, and
birds and beasts were singing along with him. He went to a mountain
where the worshipper called Ezekiel lived. He asked Ezekiel if he would
let him in. However, Ezekiel did not grant him permission to enter.
David cried. Then God revealed to Ezekiel not to hurt David .

Thus, he let David enter. David asked him: “Have you ever decided to
commit any sins?” He said: “No.” Then David asked: “Have you ever become
proud of your deeds?” He said: “No.” David asked: “Have you ever become
inclined to this world?” He said: “Yes.” Then David asked: “How then do
you get rid of the love for this world?” He said: “I go to the valley.”

Then Ezekiel took David to the valley where there was a metal couch on
which there was a skull. There was a tableau beside the couch on which
it was written: “This is the skull of Orwe Salm. He ruled for one
thousand years. He built one thousand towns. He married one thousand
young women. He finally reached this point where the dirt is his bed and
worms are his companions. Whoever sees this should not be fooled by this
world.”[^18] This is a lesson to take heed of.

Eye Anatomy and Physiology
--------------------------

### How the Eye Sees

The eye is a complex organ composed of many small parts, each vital to
normal vision. The ability to see clearly depends on how well these
parts work together. Light rays bounce off all objects. If a person is
looking at a particular object such as a tree, light is reflected off
the tree to the person’s eye and enters the eye through the **cornea.**
Next, light rays pass through an opening in the **iris**, called the
**pupil**. The iris controls the amount of light entering the eye by
dilating or constricting the pupil. In bright light, for example, the
pupils shrink to the size of a pinhead to prevent too much light from
entering. In dim light, the pupil enlarges to allow more light to enter
the eye.

Light then reaches the **crystalline lens**. The lens focuses light rays
onto the retina by bending (refracting) them. The cornea does most of
the refraction and the crystalline lens fine-tunes the focus. In a
healthy eye, the lens can change its shape (accommodate) to provide
clear vision at various distances. If an object is close, the **ciliary
muscles** of the eye contract and the lens becomes rounder. To see a
distant object, the same muscles relax and the lens flattens.

Behind the lens and in front of the retina is a chamber called the
**vitreous body**, which contains a clear, gelatinous fluid called
**vitreous humor**. Light rays pass through the vitreous before reaching
the retina. The **retina** lines the back two-thirds of the eye and is
responsible for the wide field of vision that most people experience.
For clear vision, light rays must focus directly on the retina. When
light focuses in front of or behind the retina, the result is blurry
vision.

The retina contains millions of specialized photoreceptor cells called
**rods** and **cones** that convert light rays into electrical signals
that are transmitted to the brain through the optic nerve. Rods and
cones provide the ability to see in dim light and to see in color,
respectively.

The **macula**, located in the center of the retina, is where most of
the cone cells are located. The **fovea**, a small depression in the
center of the macula, has the highest concentration of cone cells. The
macula is responsible for central vision, seeing color, and
distinguishing fine detail. The outer portion (peripheral retina) is the
primary location of rod cells and allows for night vision and seeing
movement and objects to the side (i.e., peripheral vision).

The **optic nerve**, located behind the retina, transmits signals from
the photoreceptor cells to the brain. Each eye transmits signals of a
slightly different image, and the images are inverted. Once they reach
the brain, they are corrected and combined into one image. This complex
process of analyzing data transmitted through the optic nerve is called
**visual processing**.

### Eye Movement

#### Extraocular muscles

The stabilization of eye movement is accomplished by six extraocular
muscles that are attached to each eyeball and perform their horizontal
and vertical movements and rotation. These muscles are controlled by
impulses from the cranial nerves that tell the muscles to contract or to
relax. When certain muscles contract and others relax, the eye moves.
The six muscles and their function are listed here:

1) Lateral rectus — moves the eye outward, away from the nose  
 2) Medial rectus — moves the eye inward, toward the nose  
 3) Superior rectus — moves the eye upward and slightly outward  
 4) Inferior rectus — moves the eye downward and slightly inward  
 5) Superior oblique — moves the eye inward and downward  
 6) Inferior oblique — moves the eye outward and upward

There are five different types of eye movements:

1) Saccades — looking from object A to object B  
 2) Pursuit — smoothly following a moving object  
 3) Convergence/divergence — both eyes turning inward/outward
simultaneously  
 4) Vestibular — eyes sensing and adjusting to head movement via
connections with nerves in the inner ear  
 5) Fixation maintenance — minute eye movements during fixation

#### Eyelids, Eyelashes, Conjunctiva

The eyelids are moveable folds of skin that protect the front surface of
the eyes. They close the eyes and blink, which moistens the surface of
the eyes and removes debris. The eyelashes (also called cilia) are hairs
that grow at the edge of the eyelids and remove minute particles of
debris away from the surface of the eyes. The conjunctiva is the thin,
transparent, mucous membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the front
surface of the eyeballs. The section that lines the eyelids appears red
in color because it contains many blood vessels. The section that covers
the cornea appears white because of the sclera behind it.

### Tear Production and Elimination

Tears perform vitally important functions:

1) Carry bacteria-fighting compounds to the eye  
 2) Carry nutrients to and waste products away from the eye  
 3) Keep the eye moist  
 4) Provide a smooth refracting surface  
 5) Remove debris from the eye

Tear components are produced by the **lacrimal gland**, several other
small glands, and cells within the eyelid. As the eyelid closes, tears
are swept downward, toward the nose, and enter the **puncta**.[^19] As
the eyes blink, tears are forced through narrow channels into the
**lacrimal sac**. Once the muscles relax and the eye opens, the tears
move from the sac to the **nasolacrimal duct** and into the nose. This
accounts for stuffy, runny noses when crying.

### Aqueous Humor Production and Elimination

Aqueous humor is nutritive watery fluid produced by the ciliary body
through the **ciliary body processes** and secreted into the posterior
chamber (i.e., space between the iris and the lens). It maintains
pressure and provides nutrients to the lens and cornea. Aqueous humor
diffuses through the pupil into the anterior chamber (between the lens
and cornea) and is reabsorbed into the venous system by two routes:

1) Through the trabecular meshwork[^20] into the canal of Schlemm, which
carries it into the venous system: Responsible for 80–90% of aqueous
drainage.

2) Through the anterior ciliary body directly into larger blood
vessels:[^21] Responsible for 10–20% of aqueous drainage.

The Jurisprudents’ Views on the Worth of the Eyes
-------------------------------------------------

Imam Khomeini said: “The compensation for two eyes is the same as the
full compensation. There is half of full compensation for each eye. The
compensation for one whose vision is blurry, is cross-eyed, sees double
images, has small eyes, can see better at night than in the daytime,
cannot see at night, or has another eye disease is the same as one whose
eyes are perfect.

If there is a white spot in the black of the eye in such a way that his
sight is not affected, then there is full compensation for damaging this
eye. However, if the white spot in the black of the eye has limited the
person’s sight, there is partial compensation relative to the amount of
vision for damaging the eye. This is so if it can be properly detected.
If not, the compensation is somewhat in between.” [^22]

We also read the following regarding the compensation for the eye: “The
compensation for both eyes is equal to that of the whole person.”[^23]
Then it is written in the same source that there are no differences
among the companions on this issue. The following tradition from
Abdullah ibn San’an on the authority of Imam Sadiq also supports this:
“The compensation for each organ of which man has a pair is half of
both.”

Thus the compensation for each eye is half of full compensation and
there is no difference between a perfect eye and a defective one in this
respect.”[^24] When the great Ayatollah Golpayegani was asked about the
compensation for blinding one eye of a girl, he said: “The compensation
for one eye of a female is half of the full compensation for a woman.”
This implies that the worth of the eyes is equal to that of life.

the Holy Qur’an: “Hur implies the following ideas: (1) Purity, possibly
the word ‘Hawariyun’ as applied to the disciples of Jesus, is connected
with this root; (2) Beauty, especially of the eyes, where the intense
white of the eyeballs stands out against the intense black of the
pupils, thus giving the appearance of luster, and intense feeling, as
opposed to dullness or want of expression; and (3) Truth and goodwill.”
