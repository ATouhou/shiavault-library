Lesson One Hundred Forty Four: Revival Of Doctrine Of The Prophet’s Household
=============================================================================

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ جَلَسَ مَجْلِساً يُحْيى فيهِ اَمْرُنا لَمْ يَمُتْ قَلْبُهُ يَوْمَ
تَمُوتُ الْقُلُوبُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

One who participates in a meeting in which our doctrine is revived, his
heart shall not die when the hearts die! [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

It is clearly inferred from the above sentence that the followers of the
Prophet’s household are duty bound to revive the ideas and practices of
the pure household by understanding their doctrine, perceiving the
spirit of their speeches, and becoming familiar with their instructions
. They should not allow their meetings to degenerate into channels of
amusements and gossip or harping on their needs and personal problems
and desires . Instead, they should concentrate on higher human and
social concerns with efforts directed at inculcating correct Islamic
values, beliefs and practices. Such meetings will revive hearts and
awaken the thoughts.
