Third: Right Based On Relationship To The Holy Prophet (S.A.W.S.)
=================================================================

As mentioned in Surah Shura:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْ لَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي
الْقُرْبَىٰ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Say: I do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near
relatives…” (Qur’an, Surah Shura 42:23)***

It is narrated from His Eminence, Abu Ja’far Imam Muhammad Baqir (as)
that the word al-Qurba in this verse denotes, the Imams.[^1]

And it is said in traditions that at the time of his reappearance, His
Eminence, Qa’im (aj) will call out:

“And I call you by the right of Allah, by the right of the Messenger of
Allah and by my right as I have the right of relationship to the Prophet
over you.”[^2]
