Q - Al-Qassim Ibn Al Hasan
==========================

The son of Imam Hasan (as). He was a young boy, in his teenage years.
His famous line in Karbala was when Imam Husayn asked him: "Qassim, how
do you see death?" He replied: "Oh uncle, in your service, it is sweeter
than honey". He asked permission from Imam Husayn to enter the battle
several times before the Imam agreed. When he fell to the ground, Imam
Husayn ran to him and told the others to come and take him to the tents
because he could not stand taking his body by himself. Al-Qassim was
also known for being handsome.
