Ziyarats in & Around Makkah
===========================

Ka’aba
------

Which stands majestically in the center of Masjid-ul-Haraam. The Ka’aba
was first built by Prophet Adam exactly under Baitul Mamoor which is in
Jannat.

It is said that after the strong waves and currents of Prophet Nuh's
A.S. ship, the Ka’aba was destroyed except for the foundation. Prophet
Ibrahim later built the walls of the Ka’aba again. During the time of
the Prophet of Allah, the people were still idol worshippers.

Our fist Imam, Hazrat Ali A.S. was born in the Ka’aba and one can still
notice the crack in the wall which opened up to allow Bibi Fatima Binte
Asad A.S. to enter few days before the birth or our Imam.

Hajr al-Ismail
--------------

In this arc Hazrat Ismail, Bibi Hajra and many prophets are buried. It
is great thawab to recite two rakaat Salaat. If you are standing in the
arc and if you raise your head to see the top of the Ka’aba you will see
a golden pipe was draining out rain water on the Ka’aba. This is the
place where you should ask for your Haajat. Here are the graves of Bibi
Hajra and his son Hazrat Ismail. It is also believed that other Prophets
are also buried here.

Hajr-ul-Aswad
-------------

This is the black stone from Heaven. It is narrated that Prophet Adam
A.S. (when he was in Heaven), he used to sit on this stone and pray.

When Prophet Adam A.S. was sent down to the earth as a calipha, the
stone started crying because it was missing the company of Hazrat Adam,
so Allah (SWT) sent this stone to the earth and the angels put it in the
Ka’aba. On the day of judgement it is a witness for those who have gone
for Hajj and Umrah.

Makaam al-Ibrahim
-----------------

There is a footprint of Prophet Ibrahim (which can be seen through the
glass) when he used to put his foot on it when building the walls of the
Ka’aba.

Zam Zam
-------

By the order of Allah (SWT), Prophet Ibrahim left is wife Hajra and his
son Ismail on the plains close to where the Ka’aba is situated to spread
the word of God. Hazrat Ismail became thirsty so Bibi Hajra went to look
for water. She went running seven times between the Hills of Safa and
Marwa but could not find water.

While Bibi Hajra desperately searching for water, Hazrat Ismail rubbed
his feet on the ground as he was very thirsty and through the miracle of
Allah (SWT) water sprang furiously near the feet of Hazrat Ismail, so
much water sprang forth that Bibi Hajra shouted ‘Zam Zam’ which means
‘stop’. The well of Zam Zam is still there but now instead a well you
see some pipes which brings the water supply to the Masjid and to the
whole of Makkah. It is said that the water level is the same, and it is
pure and free from any kind of dirt or germs.

Hills of Safa and Marwa
-----------------------

These are the same two hills between which Bibi Hajra ran between them
seven times to look for water for Hazrat Ismail. Allah (SWT) loved this
act of hers so much that He made it obligatory on Hajjis who are
performing Hajj and Umra.

Janatul-Mualla
--------------

This is a general cemetery in existence since the time of the Prophet
and many Ulemas, relatives of the Prophet (SAW) and many well known
personalities are buried here including:

Janab al-Khadijatul Kubra
-------------------------

She was very rich prosperous and successful businesswoman who entrusted
the Prophet of Allah with her caravan going to Syria, Egypt and other
places; she later married the Prophet (SAW) at the age of 40.

Janab al-Abu Talib
------------------

He was the father of our first Imam. He died when the Prophet of Allah
was 50 years old.

Janab al-Abdul Mutalib
----------------------

He was the Prophet of Islam (SAW) paternal grandfather.

Hazrat Abdullah
---------------

He was the father of our Prophet (SAW) and it is narrated that when
Masjid al-Nabawee in Medina was being extended, his grave was dug and
his body which was intact was transferred to Jannat-ul-Maulla.

Hazrat Amina Bint al-Wahab
--------------------------

She was the mother of our Prophet (SAW) who died when he was only 5
years old. Some historians say that she is buried at Jannatul-Mualla and
some say she is buried at a place called Abawa.

Masjid al-Jinn
--------------

A group of Jinn were passing by, when they heard the Prophet of Allah
(SAW) reciting the Holy Quran. They were so moved and came to the
Prophet, repented and accepted Islam. A Masjid was later built here
called Masjid al-Jinn.

Cave of Thawr
-------------

During the Hijrah the Holy Prophet (SAW) (with Abu Bakr) stayed here for
three days. The Miraculous incident of a spider’s web and a pigeon
laying eggs occurred at the mouth of this cave. This misled the trackers
and the Prophet of Allah (SAW) was safe.

Cave of Hira
------------

The first ‘revelation’ of “Iqra Bismi Rabbek” was revealed here.

Arafah
------

It is also known as the ‘tent’ city that comes into existence only one
day in a year and this on the 9th of Dhulhijja when all Hajjis are
required to stay here from Dhohar until Maghrib.

It is said that this is the first place where Prophet Adam A.S. and Bibi
Havva met for the first time after they were asked to leave Jannat.

Jabal al-Rahmah
---------------

This mountain is in Arafah. During Umra season one can climb it by steps
and it is highly recommended to pray two rakaat Salaat of Haajat and
then ask for your Hakata.

Muzdhalifa or Ma’shar
---------------------

The Hajjis are required to spend the night here and also collect 70
pebbles for hitting the Shaitaan in Munna.

Munna
-----

This is a city that comes to existence for three days in a whole year.
All the Hajjis are required to spend the night in Munna, to hit the
three Shaitaans and sacrifice of an animal. Men must also to do Taqseer
or Halaq. Women are required to do Taqseer and not Halaq.

Masjid al-Kheef - In Munna
--------------------------

It is highly recommended to pray 6 rakaat Salaat in this Masjid that has
great thawab as it is said that many Prophets of Allah prayed here.
