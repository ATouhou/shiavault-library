The Winds In, Charge of Solomon
===============================

VERSE NO.81ِ82

The mountains were conquered by David, and the hard iron was made soft
in his hand, so as to turn it to any form and shape that he willed.
Following that, in the above verses, some of the wonderful gifts of God
that was bestowed on his son Solomon, has been mentioned:ِ \`\`And for
Solomon, We subjugated the fast moving wind that ran by his command
towards the land which We had blessed....'' And some of the Satans too
were subdued to him who dived, and did other jobs besides. In S 38:36,
we read that the winds ran by his command, not only towrds the blessed
land which is supposed to be Syria, but to any place and direction that
Solomon willed.

[ 195 ]

So also, in S 34:12, we read that the fast moving winds by Solomon's
command could cover a distance equal to one month a journey in a short
morning or evening travel. This is a moderate measure, with the
aeroplanes that we have now-a-days travelling with the speed of 600 Km.
per hour.

Any how; God had granted Solomon a certain kind intelligence and power
by which he could have control over the fast moving winds and over the
supernatural and hidden creatures like Jinns, and other forces of
nature. He had a remarkable naval power, and bold and skilled divers,
who dived for him. Supernatural creatures like Jinns worked for him in
various fields of land and sea:ِ

\`\`And some of the Satans, We subdued, who dived for him, and did
other works besides, and we were protectors for them.''

From S 34:13 we may understand that, by \`\`SATAN'' in the above verse
(NO.83)Jinns are meant. JINN or GENIE, in Muslim literature, and Arabic
folklore, is a supernatural creature having magical power, who can
influence mortal affairs either for good or for evil. Occasionally the
Jinn is depicted as a slave in temporary bondage to a human master. Jinn
has wisdom and intelligence, and is an invisible being from the human
eyes. Like human being they too are of two groups of believer and
unbeliever. The Jinns who were engaged by Solomon, were a creature
intelligent, hardy, active, and with industrial skills.

There were also some rebellious Jinns who were chained and imprisoned
by Solomon, and hence the ending of the above verse (NO.82):ِ
\`\`....And We were protectors for them.''

Many false fairy tales have been forged, relating Solomon and his
wonderful kingship, that We Muslims reject them all, unless they have
roots in Qura"n. [ 196 ]

وَأَيُّوبَ إِذْ نَادَى رَبَّهُ أَنِّى مَسَّنِىَ الضُّرُّ وَأَنْتَ
أَرْحَمُ الرَّاحِمِينَ(( 83 ))

83- AND JOB; WHEN HE CALLED ON HIS LORD (SAYING); \`\`DISTRESS HAS
AFFLICTED ME, AND YOU ARE THE MOST MERCIFUL OF ALL THOSE THAT SHOW
MERCY.''

فَاسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ فَكَشَفْنَا مَا بِهِ مِنْ ضُرّ وَآتَيْنَاهُ
أَهْلَهُ وَمِثْلَهُمْ مَّعَهُمْ رَحْمَةً مِّنْ عِنْدِنَا وَذِكْرَى
لِلْعَابِدِينَ(( 84 ))

84- THEN WE ANSWERED HIM, AND REMOVED THE DISTRESS THAT WAS UPON HIM,
AND WE BROUGHT TO HIM HIS FAMILY; AND THE LIKE OF THEM WITH THEM, AS A
MERCY FROM US, AND A REMINDER TO THE WORSHIPPERS.


**THE COMMENTARY
WE RELIEVED JOB FROM THE WHIRLPOOL OF DIFFICULTIES**

VERSE NO.83ِ84 The above two verses refer to a part of the teaching
story of another apostle who was indeed a pattern of patience, piety,
and faith in God. AYYUB, (JOB) is the name of the apostle, who had a
very sad story, and meanwhile a glorious and dignitary one. The patience
that Job showed of himself in his great anguish was wonderful a thing.
The above verses point to his final success over evil:

At first, Job, lived a very prosperous life with his good household.
But the prophet was put to trial by our Lord, and then he suffered from
a number of distressful calamities! In a short period of time, he lost
his cattle, then his servants were slain, and soon after all [ 197 ] his
family were crushed when the roof fell on them.

In spite of all that, Job held fast to his faith in God. Further, he
became sick, and was covered with disgusting sores, all over his body.
Some of the monks who came to comfort him, claimed that suffering is the
result of sins. Such ironies increased his mental pain; but Job
maintained his blamelessness. Then God recalled to him His Mercy and
Grace, and emphasized His majesty and sovereignty over nature, and the
inability of mortal man to fully understand the mysteries of the Divine
Government of the world.

Job became the pattern of patience and faith in God and by that he
vanquished evil. When his anguish and distress became unbearable, he
called unto our Lord, and said:ِ \`\`O, My Lord! Distress has afflicted
me, and You are the Most Merciful of all those who show Mercy.'' Allah
answered his prayer, and restored him to prosperity with twice as much
as he had before.

وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِدْرِيسَ وَذَا الْكِفْلِ كُلٌّ مِّنَ الصَّابِرِينَ((
85 ))

85- AND ISHMAEL, AND IDRIS, AND DHOL KAFL, WERE ALL OF THE PATIENTS.

وَأَدْخَلْنَاهُمْ فِى رَحْمَتِنَا إِنَّهُمْ مِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ(( 86
))

86- AND WE ADMITTED THEM TO OUR MERCY, THAT THEY WERE OF THE
RIGHTEOUS.

[ 198 ]

**THE COMMENTARY
ISHMAEL, IDRIS, AND ZUL-KIFL**

VERSE NO.85ِ86 Another three of the long line of apostles have been
named and reminded here, who were of the righteous and very patient
apostles. Their main characteristic is said to have been constancy and
patience. Their names are Ishmael, Idris, and Zul-Kifl.

Ishmael was the son of Abraham, and he is the founder of a great Ummat,
consisting od Arabs and Muslims. This is because Mohammad (SA) the
founder of Islam is an offspring of Ishmael. He is famed for his
submission to the will of God, particularly for the patience that he
showed when his father decided that he had to sacrifice him to the
Lord.

Commentators have known IDRIS to have been the grand, grand father of
Noah, and in the Bible his name is, \`\`OKHNUKH''. He was the first man
who wrote with pen, and was also the first man who taught Man to sew his
clothing. He was in a high position in life, but high rank did not
deceive him. He was sincere in faith, true with God and with all, and
was a pattern in constancy and patience. Zul-Kifl is not well known to
the commentators, and they differ in opinion as to who is meant, and,
why has he the title of \`\`Zul-Kifl'' which literally means, the owner
of a double requital, or portion.

Some commentators have said that, he had made a covenant with Allah to
pray all nights and to fast all the days, and not to get angry in
judgements. He fulfilled his promise and hence the title Zul-Kifl. Some
others have said that, Kefil is the Arabic for Ezekiel.

[ 199 ]

وَذَا النُّونِ إِذْ ذَهَبَ مُغَاضِباً فَظَنَّ أَنْ لَّنْ نَّقْدِرَ
عَلَيْهِ فَنَادَى فِى الظُّلُمَاتِ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ أَنْتَ
سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّى كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ(( 87 ))

87- AND ZOL-NOON (JONAH), WHEN HE WENT IN ANGER, AND DEEMED THAT WE
WOULD NOT TAKE IT HARD OVER HIM. THEN (WHEN HE WAS SWALLOWED BY A WHALE)
HE CRIED OUT IN THE DARKNESSES THAT:ِ \`\`THERE IS NO GOD EXCEPT YOU.
GLORY BE TO YOU. I WAS OF THE OPPRESSORS.''

فَاسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ وَنَجَّيْنَاهُ مِنْ الْغَمِّ وَكَذَلِكَ نُنْجِى
الْمُؤْمِنِينَ(( 88 ))

88- SO WE ANSWERED HIM, AND DELIVERED HIM FROM GRIEF, AND THUS DO WE
DELIVER THE BELIEVERS.

**THE COMMENTARY
JONAH'S RESCUE FROM THAT DREADFUL PRISON** VERSE NO.87ِ88

We shall narrate the story of JONAH with more detail in the chapter of
SA"FA"T, an abstract of which will follow here:ِ ZUN-NUN is the title of
JONAH (YUNUS) for being swallowed by a whale. The Arabic, \`\`NUN''
means large fish or a whale. He was a prophet sent to the people of
Nineveh. His people paid no heed to the prophet's warning. Jonah
threatened them with God's wrath, and proclaimed Allah's punishment on
them, but with no result. So he left his people in anger due to his
failure:ِ \`\`And Zun-nun, when he went in anger, and deemed that We
would not take it hard over him.''

Instead of being steadfast and patient in conveying his message; he
left his people in the field of combat with evil. He went in a voyage by
sea, and the sailors threw him in the water as a man of bad omen in
storm. Soon after, a whale appeared and swallowed Jonah. There in the
darknesses of the sea, and that of the whale's stomach, he cried out
unto our Lord that:ِ [ 200 ]

There is no God except You. Glory be to You. I was of the
oppressors.''

That is to say; I did oppress myself, as well as my people, whom I left
them behind.

God, the Merciful, and Forgiving, answered his prayer and forgave him,
and delivered him from his dreadful grief:ِ

\`\`So We answered him, and delivered him from Grief, and thus do We
deliver the believers.''

He was cast out on the sea shore, and was restored to life once again.
When he returned to fulfil his mission, he found his people repented and
converted by the advices of two learned men of the towns-folk.

This sort of forgiveness and rescue was not exceptionally designed for
Jonah. This is God's Methodical way that any believer who does something
wrong, and then repents and returns to God to beg His pardon like Jonah,
Allah the Compassionate will answer him of surety:ِ

\`\`And thus do We deliver the believers.''

وَزَكَرِيَّا إِذْ نَادَى رَبَّهُ رَبِّ لاَ تَذَرْنِى فَرْداً وَأَنْتَ
خَيْرُ الْوَارِثِينَ(( 89 ))

89- AND ZACHARIA"H, WHEN HE CALLED UNTO HIS LORD, (SAYING):ِ \`\`O, MY
LORD! LEAVE ME NOT ALONE, AND YOU ARE THE BEST OF INHERITORS.

فَاسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ يَحْيَى وَأَصْلَحْنَا لَهُ
زَوْجَهُ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يُسَارِعُونَ فِى الْخَيْرَاتِ وَيَدْعُونَنَا
رَغَباً وَرَهَباً وَكَانُوا لَنَا خَاشِعِينَ(( 90 ))

90- SO WE ANSWERED HIM, AND GRANTED HIM JOHN, AND AMENDED FOR HIM HIS
(BARREN) WIFE; THAT THEY WERE VYING WITH EACH OTHER IN GOOD WORKS, AND
CALLED US WITH DESIRE AND WITH AWE; AND THEY WERE HUMBLE TO US.

[ 201 ]

**THE COMMENTARY
ZACHARIA WAS DELIVERED FROM LONELINESS**

VERSE NO.89ِ90 Here two more of the apostles of great personality have
been referred to; namely ZACHARIA"H and YAHYA". (JOHN THE BAPTIST)
ZACHARIA"H and his wife were a true believer couple, who lived in
faithful performance of their religious duties. The wife was barren, and
they had reached the old age, without having a child. He desired to have
a son, so as to train him to continue with his religious works to be
done after him; and also to carry on his linage. This was so because he
could see no one around him, from among the priests, sincere enough to
carry on his religious works as his successor.

So in a fervent prayer Zacharia"h, sincerely, and in a polite manner
said to our Lord:ِ

\`\`O, My Lord! Leave me not alone and You are the best of
inheritors.''

Allah answered his prayer, and granted him a righteous son an apostle,
whom the Christians know as; JOHN THE BAPTIST:ِ

\`\`So We answered him, and granted him YAHYA", and amended his(BARREN)
wife.'' The Arabic, \`\`ASLAHA'' translated, \`\`AMENDED'' means to
improve, amend, reform, develop, cure, or made better. Here with the
reference to Zacharia"h's wife who was barren, we have chosen the word,
\`\`AMENDED'' which may imply that she was cured and prepared for being
pregnant.

The above verses allude to three characteristics for distinguishing the
three religious personalities (FATHER, MOTHER & SON) from others:ِ

1) That they were vying with one another in doing good work.
2) That they always called Allah with desire and awe.
3) That they were very humble before Allah. [ 202 ]

وَالَّتِى أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا فَنَفَخْنَا فِيهَا مِنْ رُّوحِنَا
وَجَعَلْنَاهَا وَابْنَهَا آيَةً لِّلْعَالَمِينَ(( 91 )) 91- AND
(REMEMBER) THE WOMAN WHO GUARDED HER CHASTITY. SO WE BREATHED IN HER OF
OUR SPIRIT, AND MADE HER, AND HER SON, A SIGN FOR ALL THE WORLDS.

**THE COMMENTARY
MARY, THE CHASTE GIRL** VERSE NO.91

Here, the mention of Mary in the line of the great prophets of God,
might either be for her son, Jesus Christ, who is a great Arch prophet;
or that, her childbirth was somehow similar to that of John. It might
also want to show us that in the history of Mankind, there have been
women with a virtue and dignity no less than the great men; an example
of whom is, \`\`Mary who guarded her chastity''.

Here, by, \`\`the women who guarded her chastity'' Mary, the mother of
Jesus is meant whose special virtue was chastity. She gave birth to
Jesus as a virgin, and was untouched by any man. Therefore, she and her
son were both a miracle from God, and a sign for all people.

As to the ending of the verse:ِ \`\`We made her, and her son one sign
for all the worlds.'' Here two personalities are cited as one singular
sign! This may imply that the existence of Mary and Jesus, are so
mingled and mixed, that they are not separable. In other word; the birth
of a son without a father, is as miraculous and wonderful, as the
pregnancy of a woman without a husband.

[ 203 ]

إِنَّ هَذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَأَنَا رَبُّكُمْ
فَاعْبُدُونِ(( 92 ))

92- VERILY THESE (SAID PROPHETS AND THEIR TRUE FOLLOWERS) ARE YOUR
COMMUNITY, A ONE COMMUNITY; AND I AM YOUR LORD, SO WORSHIP ME (ALONE).

وَتَقَطَّعُوا أَمْرَهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ كُلٌّ إِلَيْنَا رَاجِعُونَ(( 93
))

93- AND (EVENTUALLY) THEY DIVIDED THEIR AFFAIR AMONG THEMSELVES (INTO
SCHISM). ALL OF THEM WILL RETURN TO US.

فَمَنْ يَعْمَلْ مِنَ الصَّالِحَاتِ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلاَ كُفْرَانَ
لِسَعْيِهِ وَإِنَّا لَهُ كَاتِبُونَ(( 94 ))

94- THEN HE WHO DOES OF THE RIGHTEOUS WORKS, BEING A BELIEVER, THERE IS
NO INGRATITUDE TO HIS ENDEAVOUR, AND WE WILL WRITE IT DOWN FOR HIM.

**THE COMMENTARY
THE SINGLE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY** VERSE NO.92ِ94

Following the mention of several great prophets; the above verses
conclude that all of them had one creed and belonged to a single
religious community (UMMAT). That is to say; God is One, and God's
Message has always been one, and therefore, all His Messengers have
treated it as one too. They all had one message, one program, and one
main object; but according to the exigencies of time and space, and
specialities of the occasions, they used different tactics, and
procedures for accomplishing an end.
The Arabic, \`\`UMMAT'' means community, nation, group of people,
religion and etc. Technically, we may translate it here to a Religious [
204 ] Community made of a people with different race, language, history,
who are united in a brotherhood in which man and woman are engaged in
the service of God. The next verse (NO.93) points out the perversion of
a great many people of the single Godly Ummat; who deviated from the
right and true course that was laid before them:ِ

\`\`And eventually they divided their affairs among themselves.'' In
other word; people of different views, and with various material
interests have explained the Message of God to satisfy their selfish
gains, and social advantages, and so have they divided their affairs
among themselves, by breaking the Message of God. And thus have they
divided the single and united Ummat, into jarring camps and hostile
sects.

وَحَرَامٌ عَلَى قَرْيَة أَهْلَكْنَاهَا أَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَرْجِعُونَ(( 95
))

95- AND IT IS FORBIDDEN FOR ANY (SINFUL) TOWN THAT WE HAVE DESTROYED
IT, TO RETURN;

حَتَّى إِذَا فُتِحَتْ يَأْجُوجُ وَمَأْجُوجُ وَهُمْ مِّنْ كُلِّ حَدَب
يَنسِلُونَ(( 96 ))

96- UNTIL THE GOG AND MAGOG ARE LET LOOSE, AND THEY PASS OVER EVERY
HEIGHT SWIFTLY.

وَاقْتَرَبَ الْوَعْدُ الْحَقُّ فَإِذَا هِىَ شَاخِصَةٌ أَبْصَارُ
الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا يَا وَيْلَنَا قَدْ كُنَّا فِى غَفْلَة مِنْ هَذَا بَلْ
كُنَّا ظَالِمِينَ(( 97 ))

97- AND THE TRUE PROMISE (OF RESURRECTION) IS DROWN NEAR. THEN THE EYES
OF THE UNBELIEVERS WILL STARE IN AWE! (THEY WILL CRY OUT:ِ) WOE TO US!
THAT WE WERE NEGLIGENT OF THIS. NAY! WE WERE RATHER OPPRESSORS.

[ 205 ]

**THE COMMENTARY
UNBELIEVERS AT THE THRESHOLD OF RESURRECTION** VERSE NO.95ِ97

When the unbelievers die to live in the Intermediate world, they will
get a keen sense of sight, and in seeing the symptoms of God's
punishment, their pride and vanity vanishes, and they become aware of
their great loss. In such that condition their only desire is to return
back to this material world to do some good works to compensate for
their loss, but it is too late now:ِ \`\`It is forbidden for any sinful
town or townsfolk, that We have destroyed; to return.''

When a town is drowned in its sinful acts and wickedness, and the
punishment of God, which is the result of their own evil deeds afflicts
them, and the decree of God, has been issued to destroy them; return
shall be forbidden for them. They will have no more chance to return to
God and repent, and will have no more time to amend their deeds, because
they have already rejected and wasted all their previous chances. Here
the Gog and Magog may stand for their connotation as a wild and lawless
tribe who break their barrier and swarm up and down any steep or slope.
This is a sign of the approach of Resurrection Day.

إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنْتُمْ
لَهَا وَارِدُونَ(( 98 ))

98- YOU AND WHATEVER YOU WORSHIP APART FROM ALLAH, ARE FUEL OF THE
HELL, THAT YOU ENTER IT.

لَوْ كَانَ هَؤُلاَءِ آلِهَةً مَّا وَرَدُوهَا وَكُلٌّ فِيهَا
خَالِدُونَ(( 99 ))

99- HAD THESE BEEN GODS, THEY WOULD NOT ENTER IT, AND ALL OF THEM ABIDE
THEREIN FOR EVER.

[ 206 ]

لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ وَهُمْ فِيهَا لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ(( 100 ))

100- FOR THEM IS THEREIN GROANING, AND IN THERE THEY HEAR NOT.

إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَئِكَ عَنْهَا
مُبْعَدُونَ(( 101 ))

101- BUT AS TO THOSE, TO WHOM OUR GOODNESS HAS ALREADY BEEN FORWARDED,
THEY ARE KEPT FAR FROM IT.

لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ حَسِيسَهَا وَهُمْ فِى مَا اشْتَهَتْ أَنفُسُهُمْ
خَالِدُونَ(( 102 ))

102- THEY HEAR NOT ITS NOISE, AND DWELL FOREVER IN WHAT THEY DESIRE.

لاَ يَحْزُنُهُمْ الْفَزَعُ الاَْكْبَرُ وَتَتَلَقّاهُمُ الْمَلاَئِكَةُ
هَذَا يَوْمُكُمُ الَّذِى كُنْتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ (( 103 ))103- THE GREAT
DREAD GRIEVES THEM NOT, AND THE ANGELS WILL WELCOME THEM; SAYING:ِ
\`\`THIS IS YOUR DAY THAT YOU WERE PROMISED.''

**THE COMMENTARY
THE FUEL OF HELL** VERSE NO.98ِ103

Here the future of the heathens and polytheists have been discussed,
that they themselves and their idols are all fuel for the fire of Hell:ِ
\`\`Their idols will be cast into Hell to serve as fuel of the Fire and
then they will enter it.''

The Arabic, \`\`MA"'' in the verse (NO.98), translated to,
\`\`WHATEVER'' implies inanimate things like idols, that are not endowed
with life and spirit, or understanding: [ 207 ] \`\`Had these been gods,
they would not enter the Hell, and so they will abide therein for
ever.'' In other word, falsehood will vanish, and truth will abide.
Those who worship false gods, will expect nothing but regret, groaning,
and everlasting anguish. The truthful believers will remain for ever in
what they desire of happiness and prosperity. Their good deeds will go
before them so as to illuminate their way up to salvation.

In the next verses, four great blessings of God have been named which
are bestowed on the righteous people:ِ

1- They do not hear any sound or noise or groaning of the Fire of
Punishment, for being far from the Hell.
2- They live for ever, and will always have whatever they desire it.
3- The great dread of God's punishment grieves them not.
4- And they are welcomed by the angels who congratulate them for their
good end, and express their sympathetic pleasures at their salvation.

If according to the above verses, the great dread of Dooms Day will not
grieve them and they hear not the noises of the Fire of Punishment, it
is because, they knew from before, that, the balancing of account would
at last be a great terror for the evil doers. يَوْمَ نَطْوِى السَّمَآءَ
كَطَىِّ اسِّجِلِّ لِلْكُتُبِ كَمَا بَدَأْنَآ أَوَّلَ خَلْق نُّعِيدُهُ
وَعدًا عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا فَاعِلِينَ(( 104 )) 104- THE DAY IN WHICH
WE ROLL UP THE HEAVENS LIKE THE ROLLING OF A SCROLL FOR WRITING. AS WE
ORIGINATED THE FIRST CREATION (OF MAN) SO SHALL WE BRING HIM BACK (TO
LIFE) AGAIN. (THIS IS) A PROMISE BINDING ON US THAT WE WILL FULFIL IT.

[ 208 ]

**THE COMMENTARY
THE DAY IN WHICH HEAVENS ARE FOLDED UP** VERSE NO.104

The last argument still continues that the Resurrection Day with its
great dread, will come to pass but the truthful believers will have no
fear in that. In that dreadful day, the heavens shall be folded up like
a roll of paper, or scroll which the ancient people used for their
writing.

Folding of solar system does not mean that they will become
non-existent. It rather means the constituent materials of the heavens
will exist, while the form and shape of them will change. In other word;
our solar system will be folded up like a roll of paper or parchment,
for having done its work. God created them at first, out of nothing, and
now it is far easier to renew an existing entity, and making a new
heaven and earth out of their present material. Allah has promised to
that, and he will definitely fulfil the promise which is binding on
Him.

وَ لَقَد كَتَبْنَا فِى الزَّبُورِ مِن بَعْدِالذِّكْرِ أَنَّ الاَْرْضَ
يَرِثُهَا عِبَادِىَ الصَّالِحُونَ(( 105 ))

105- AND VERILY WE HAVE WRITTEN IN THE PSALMS, AFTER THE REMINDER, THAT
THE EARTH SHALL BE INHERITED BY MY RIGHTEOUS SERVANTS.

إِنَّ فِى هَذَا لَبَلاَغاً لِّقَوْم عَابِدِينَ(( 106 ))

106- VERILY IN THIS THERE IS A MESSAGE FOR A PEOPLE WHO ARE (MY)
WORSHIPPER. [ 209 ]

**THE COMMENTARY
THE RIGHTEOUS WILL INHERIT THE LAND**
VERSE NO.105ِ106

A good and clear reward for the righteous servants of God has been
promised here, that:ِ \`\`We wrote in ZOBUR, after ZIKR, that the earth
shall be inherited by My righteous servants.''

Here, apparently ZOBUR is the PSALMS, and by ZIKR, the BIBLE is
meant.
