***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

This Surah has been revealed at Mecca, and contains fifty four verses.
For the explanation of the people of Saba mentioned in this Surah, it
has been called Saba and, like other Meccan suras, most expressions of
it are about ideological issues, and the Origin and the End (Hereafter)
in particular.

In the story of Solomon, of course, and his encounter with the people of
Saba, a part of the Divine bounties and the end of the thankful
believers and disbelievers are pointed out.

The Virtue of the Surah
-----------------------

Imam Sadiq (as) in a tradition has said:

*“He who recites the couple of Suras which has begun with the praise of
Allah (suras Saba and Fatir) in a night, he will be in the protection of
Allah, the Almighty and in His guard; and if he recites them in the
daytime, no undesirable thing will come to him on that day, and he will
be given so much good of this world and the next that has never come to
his mind and which he has never desired or thought of.”* [^1]
