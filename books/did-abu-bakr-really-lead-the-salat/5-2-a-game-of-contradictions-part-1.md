2. A Game of Contradictions (Part 1)
====================================

There actually is no *valid* Sunni proof to establish that Abu Bakr was
ever deputized by the Messenger, *sallallahu ‘alaihi wa alihi*, as
prayer-leader during the latter’s fatal or other illness. The reports
about Abu Bakr’s alleged appointment were narrated *mainly* by both Umm
al-Muminin ‘Aishah and Anas. Most of the reports on the matter trace
directly to them both, and to ‘Aishah in particular. There were other
Sahabah – such as Ibn Mas’ud, Ibn ‘Abbas, Ibn ‘Umar, Abu Musa
al-Ash’ari, Buraydah, Salim b. ‘Ubayd, and Ibn Zam’a. However, their
reports were mostly carbon copies of the severely contradictory
*riwayat* of both ‘Aishah and Anas. In this chapter, we will be
dissecting primarily the narrations of ‘Aishah and Anas – and by
extension, those of all the others too. We will be exposing their
extreme weakness as valid proofs in the issue at hand.

Imam Muslim (d. 261 H) has compiled many of these reports under the
chapter: “*The Imam* *is authorized to appoint someone as khalifah who
will lead the people in salat when there is a valid reason for it, for
example illness, or journey or others. And whoever performs salat behind
a sitting Imam who is unable to stand should do so standing if he can.
And there is an abrogation of performing salat sitting behind a sitting
Imam for whoever is able to stand*.” So, we will be examining the
landmark reports in it in this investigative research.

Muslim records:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا محمد بن المثنى وهارون بن عبدالله قالا حدثنا عبدالصمد قال سمعت
أبي يحدث قال حدثنا عبدالعزيز عن أنس قال لم يخرج إلينا نبي الله صلى
الله عليه و سلم ثلاثا فأقيمت الصلاة فذهب أبو بكر يتقدم فقال نبي الله
صلى الله عليه و سلم بالحجاب فرفعه فلما وضح لنا وجه نبي الله صلى الله

Muhammad b. Al-Muthanna and Harun b. ‘Abd Allah – ‘Abd al-Samad – my
father – ‘Abd al-‘Aziz – Anas:

**The Prophet of Allah, peace be upon him, did not come out to us for
three days. When the** ***salat*** **was about to start, ABU BAKR
STEPPED FORWARD TO LEAD**. The Prophet of Allah, peace be upon him, was
near the curtain and he lifted it. When the face of the Prophet of
Allah, peace be upon him, became visible to us, we had never seen
anything as wonderful to us as the face of the Prophet, peace be upon
him when it became visible to us. **So, the Prophet of Allah, peace be
upon him, gestured to Abu Bakr with his hand to lead**. The Prophet of
Allah, peace be upon him, then drew the curtain, and we were unable to
see him until he died.[^1]

This report explicitly states that the Messenger of Allah was unable to
lead the Sahabah in *salat* for a total of *four* days – the initial
three days and his day of death. Basically, he did not participate in
*salat* with the Muslims in his mosque throughout the last four days of
his lifetime.

Exhibit B
---------

In another report, Anas indicated that the Messenger died on a Monday.
Muslim again documents:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثني عمرو الناقد وحسن الحلواني وعبد بن حميد (قال عبد أخبرني وقال
الآخران حدثنا يعقوب) (وهو ابن إبراهيم بن سعد) وحدثني أبي عن صالح عن
ابن شهاب قال أخبرني أنس بن مالك أن أبا بكر كان يصلي لهم في وجع رسول
الله صلى الله عليه و سلم الذي توفي فيه حتى إذا كان يوم الاثنين وهم
صفوف في الصلاة كشف رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم ستر الحجرة فنظر إلينا
وهو قائم كأن وجهه ورقة مصحف ثم تبسم رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم
ضاحكا قال فبهتنا ونحن في الصلاة من فرج بخروج رسول الله صلى الله عليه و
سلم ونكص أبو بكر على عقبيه ليصل الصف وظن أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و
سلم خارج للصلاة فأشار إليهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم بيده أن
أتموا صلاتكم قال ثم دخل رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم فأرخي الستر قال
فتوفي رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم من يومه ذلك
  </p>
</blockquote>

‘Amr al-Naqid, Hasan al-Halwani and ‘Abd b. Hamid – Ya’qub b. Ibrahim b.
Sa’d – my father – Salih – Ibn Shihab – Anas b. Malik:

**Abu Bakr led them in** ***salat*** **during the fatal illness of the
Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, UNTIL IT WAS A MONDAY and they
had stood in congregational rows PERFORMING** ***salat***. The Messenger
of Allah, peace be upon him, drew aside the curtain of the room and
looked at us while he was standing. His face was like the page of the
*mushaf*. Then, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, felt happy
and smiled. And we were confounded with joy DURING THE *SALAT* due to
the coming out of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. **Abu Bakr
stepped back upon his heels to continue the** ***salat*** **in the
congregational row, thinking that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon
him, had come out for the** ***salat*****. The Messenger of Allah, peace
be upon him, gestured to** ***them*** **with his hand to “complete
your** ***salat*****”. Then, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him,
entered and drew the curtain**.

He (Anas) said: **The Messenger of Allah breathed his last ON THAT VERY
DAY of his**.[^2]

This *hadith* is interesting. Anas made it absolutely clear that they
were already performing the *salat* (في الصلاة), in their congregational
rows, before the appearance of the Prophet. Yet, the Sahabah were able,
during *salat*, to see the Messenger of Allah draw the curtain, to view
his bright face and his happy smile, to witness how Abu Bakr stepped
back, to notice how the Prophet’s hand gesture to him, and to look at
him returning to his room. What kind of *salat* was that?! Where were
they really looking during the prayer? Were they even concentrating at
all?

Muslim has this further *riwayah* as well:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وحدثنيه عمرو الناقد وزهير بن حرب قالا حدثنا سفيان بن عيينة عن الزهري
عن أنس قال آخر نظرة نظرتها إلى رسول الله عليه وسلم كشف الستارة يوم
الاثنين
  </p>
</blockquote>

‘Amr al-Naqid and Zuhayr b. Harb – Sufyan b. ‘Uyaynah – al-Zuhri – Anas:

**The last glance which we had** of the Messenger of Allah, peace be
upon him, **was when he drew the curtain aside ON MONDAY**.[^3]

Therefore, the Prophet did not participate in congregational *salat* on
Monday, the day of his death. He also did not pray in his mosque
throughout the three days before that. That means that he stopped
leading his Sahabah on Thursday, most probably in its afternoon or
evening. So, on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, he did not come out to his
followers at all. On Monday, the day he died, he showed himself to them
but did not join them in the *salat*. The direct implication of all this
is that his last ever *salat* with his Sahabah was offered on Thursday.

Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir (d. 774 H) agrees with our conclusions:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قلنا فعلى هذا يكون آخر صلاة صلاها معهم الظهر كما جاء مصرحا به في حديث
عائشة المتقدم، ويكون ذلك يوم الخميس لا يوم السبت ولا يوم الأحد كما
حكاه البيهقي عن مغازي موسى بن عقبة وهو ضعيف
  </p>
</blockquote>

We say: based upon this, **the last** ***salat*** **which he performed
with them would be** ***Zuhr***, as it is explicitly reported in the
foregoing *hadith* of ‘Aishah, **and that would be on Thursday** – and
not on Saturday or Sunday as al-Bayhaqi quoted from *Maghazi* of Musa b.
‘Uqbah, and it (i.e. that submission of Musa) is *ḍa’if*.[^4]

Imam al-Salihi al-Shami (d. 942 H) has a backup for him:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال الحافظ :اختلف في مدة مرضه، فالأكثر على أنه ثلاثة عشر يوما وقيل
:بزيادة يوم وقيل :بنقصه .وقيل :تسعة أيام رواه البلاذري عن علي رضي الله
تعالى عنه وقيل :عشرة، وفيه جزم سليمان التيمي، وكان يخرج إلى الصلاة إلا
أنه انقطع ثلاثة أيام .قال في العيون :أمر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم
أن يصلي بالناس فصلى بهم فيما روينا سبع عشرة صلاة
  </p>
</blockquote>

Al-Hafiz (Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalani) said: “There is disagreement about the
length of his (i.e. the Prophet’s fatal) illness. The majority are of
the opinion that it lasted thirteen days. Some say: it was a day more.
Some say: it was a day less.” Some also say: it was nine days. This
opinion was narrated from ‘Ali, may Allah the Most High be pleased with
him, by al-Baladhari. Some say: it lasted ten days. This was explicitly
stated by Sulayman al-Tamimi.

**He (the Prophet) used to come out for the** ***salat*** **(throughout
his illness) except that he missed three days**.

The author of *al-‘Uyun* said: “The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon
him, ordered that he (Abu Bakr) lead the people in *salat*, **and he led
them in seventeen** ***salats***, according to what was narrated to
us.”[^5]

One glaring omission from Anas’ reports is that of any explicit order
from the Prophet concerning Abu Bakr’s leadership of *salat*. As such,
we do not know – from Anas’ narrations – whether he led the Sahabah in
*salat* from Thursday till Monday on the order of the Messenger of Allah
or not. What is clear from them, however, is that the Prophet was
allegedly pleased with Abu Bakr’s leadership of *salat* when he saw it
on the Monday of his demise. This is also the best – based upon Anas’
reports above – that can be said about Abu Bakr’s leadership of *salat*
for the three previous days: that the Prophet knew about it, and
silently approved it by not objecting. Nothing more can be claimed from
those texts. Of course, an approval is not always the same thing as an
order.

Exhibit C
---------

Ibn Kathir makes reference to a *hadith* of Umm al-Muminin ‘Aishah. This
is it, as recorded by Imam Muslim:

Ahmad b. ‘Abd Allah b. Yunus – Zaidah – Musa b. Abi ‘Aishah – ‘Ubayd
Allah b. ‘Abd Allah:

I visited ‘Aishah and said to her, “Would you tell me about the illness
of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him?” She replied, “Yes, I
will. The Prophet, peace be upon him, was seriously ill, and he asked,
‘Have the people performed *salat*?’ We said, ‘No, they are waiting for
you (to lead them), O Messenger of Allah’. He said, ‘Put some water for
me in the tub’. We complied. So, he performed ablution. Then, he was
about to move with difficulty but fainted. Then, he woke up and said,
‘Have the people performed *salat*?’ We said, ‘No. They are waiting for
you, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said, ‘Put some water for me in the tub’.
We complied. So, he performed ablution. Then, he was about to move with
difficulty but fainted. Then, he woke up and said, ‘Have the people
performed *salat*?’ We said, ‘No. They are waiting for you, O Messenger
of Allah.’ He said, ‘Put some water for me in the tub’. We complied. So,
he performed ablution. Then, he was about to move with difficulty but
fainted. Then, he woke up and said, ‘Have the people performed *salat*?’
We said, ‘No. They are waiting for you, O Messenger of Allah.’

She (‘Aishah) said, “The people were standing in the mosque waiting for
the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, **FOR THE** ***‘ISHA***
**PRAYER**.”

She (‘Aishah) said, “Then, the Messenger of Allah sent a messenger to
Abu Bakr to tell him to lead the people in *salat*. When the messenger
(of the Prophet) got to him, he said, ‘The Messenger of Allah, peace be
upon him, orders you to lead the people in *salat*.’ So, Abu Bakr, who
was a man of tenderly feelings, said, ‘O ‘Umar, lead the people in
*salat*.’ ‘Umar replied, ‘You are more entitled to that.’

She (‘Aishah) said, ‘**So, Abu Bakr led them in** ***salat*** **during
those days**. THEN, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, felt some
relief and he went out, supported by two men, **one of whom was
al-‘Abbas,** **FOR THE** ***ZUHR*** **PRAYER while Abu Bakr was already
leading the people in** ***salat***. When Abu Bakr saw him, he began to
move backwards. But the Prophet, peace be upon him, indicated to him not
to move backwards. He also told them both (i.e. the two men with him),
‘Sit me *beside* Abu Bakr.’ Therefore, they sat him beside Abu Bakr. Abu
Bakr was performing *salat* while standing, **and he was following the**
***salat*** **of the Prophet**, peace be upon him, and the people were
following the *salat* of Abu Bakr. The Prophet, peace be upon him, was
sitting.”

‘Ubayd Allah said: I visited ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Abbas and said to him,
“Should I tell you what ‘Aishah told me concerning the illness of the
Messenger of Allah?” He said, “Tell.” So, I presented her *hadith* to
him, and he did not deny anything from it, except that he asked, “Did
she tell you the name of the other man who was with al-‘Abbas?” I said,
“No”. He said, “He was ‘Ali.”[^6]

But, ‘Aishah has only blown up everything here! The Messenger of Allah
became unable to lead *salat* on Thursday, according to the *hadith* of
Anas. In this report of ‘Aishah, that was at the time of the *‘Isha*
prayer – and not *Zuhr* as al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir wants us to believe. That
*‘Isha* prayer, as well as the subsequent *salats* for a few days, were
led by Abu Bakr on the explicit order of the Prophet. These are claims
of ‘Aishah which are missing in the reports of Anas. But, according to
Anas, the Messenger of Allah never again joined the Muslims in *salat*
once Abu Bakr started leading.

By contrast, ‘Aishah claimed that her blessed husband actually took over
the leadership of *salat* from her father after some “days”! In the
Arabic, the word *ayam* is used for the days of Abu Bakr’s leadership
after the initial *‘Isha*. That word is plural, and refers to at least
three days. This means that Abu Bakr led the *salats* on Friday,
Saturday and Sunday. Then, the Prophet of Allah intervened in his
*salat* and took over from him on Monday. Here, Anas and ‘Aishah clash
again. He submitted that the Messenger never participated in
congregational *salat* on the Monday of his death, while she insisted
that her husband did in the *Zuhr* prayer of that day!

Exhibit D
---------

Yet, ‘Aishah proceeded to contradict herself too in a very fundamental
way. Muslim records:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا أبو بكر بن أبي شيبة حدثنا أبو معاوية ووكيع ح وحدثنا يحيى بن يحيى
(واللفظ له) قال أخبرنا أبو معاوية عن الأعمش عن إبراهيم عن الأسود عن
عائشة قالت لما ثقل رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم جاء بلال يؤذنه
بالصلاة فقال مرو أبا بكر فليصل بالناس قالت فقلت يا رسول الله إن أبا
بكر رجل أسيف وإنه متى يقم مقامك لا يسمع الناس فلو أمرت عمر فقال مروا
أبا بكر فليصل بالناس قالت فقلت لحفصة قولي له إن أبا بكر رجل أسيف وإنه
متى يقم مقامك لا يسمع الناس فلو أمرت عمر فقالت له فقال رسول الله صلى
الله عليه و سلم إنكن لأنتن صواحب يوسف مروا أبا بكر فليصل بالناس قالت
فأمروا أبا بكر يصلي بالناس قالت فلما دخل في الصلاة وجد رسول الله صلى
الله عليه و سلم من نفسه خفة فقام يهادي بين رجلين ورجلاه تخطان في الأرض
قالت فلما دخل المسجد سمع أبو بكر حسه ذهب يتأخر فأومأ إليه رسول الله
صلى الله عليه و سلم قم مكانك فجاء رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم حتى
جلس عن يسار أبي بكر قالت فكان رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم يصلي
بالناس جالسا وأبو بكر قائما يقتدي أبو بكر بصلاة النبي صلى الله عليه و
سلم ويقتدي الناس بصلاة أبي بكر
  </p>
</blockquote>

Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaybah – Abu Mu’awiyah and Waki’ AND Yahya b. Yahya –
Abu Mu’awiyah – al-A’mash - Ibrahim – al-Aswad – ‘Aishah:

When the Messenger of Allah became seriously ill, **Bilal came to summon
him to** ***salat*****. He said, “Ask Abu Bakr to lead the people in**
***salat***.”

She said: I said, “O Messenger of Allah! Verily, Abu Bakr is a tenderly
man. If he stood in your place, he would not be able to make the people
hear anything. You should instead order ‘Umar.” He said, “Ask Abu Bakr
to lead the people in *salat*.”

She said: “So, I told Hafsah my statement to him, ‘Abu Bakr is a
tenderly man. If he stood in your place, he would not be able to make
people hear anything. You should instead order ‘Umar.” She told him. On
that, the Messenger of Allah said, “You are like the women who gathered
around Yusuf. Ask Abu Bakr to lead the people in *salat*.”

She said: “**Therefore, Abu Bakr was asked to lead the people in**
***salat*****.” She said: “As he (Abu Bakr) began the** ***salat*****,
the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, felt some relief**. So, He
got up and moved, supported by two men, and his feet dragged on the
ground.

She said: “When he entered the mosque, Abu Bakr heard his sound. He
moved backwards, but the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him,
indicated to him to ‘stand in your place.’ **The Messenger of Allah,
peace be upon him, then came and sat on the** ***left*** **side of Abu
Bakr**.”

She said: “The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was leading the
people in *salat* in a sitting posture. **Abu Bakr was following the**
***salat*** **of the Prophet, peace be upon him, in a standing posture
and the people were following the** ***salat*** **of Abu Bakr**.[^7]

The contradictions between this report and *Exhibit C* above are
tremendous:

1. According to *Exhibit C*, Bilal did not come to summon the Prophet
for *salat*. In *Exhibit D*, he came.

2. According to *Exhibit C*, the Messenger of Allah attempted to join
the Muslims in the mosque but fainted three times. In *Exhibit D*, the
Prophet did not faint at all, and made no attempt whatsoever to join his
followers in his mosque.

3. According to *Exhibit C*, the Prophet only ordered Abu Bakr to lead
the *salat* after three failed attempts to do so by himself. In *Exhibit
D*, he gave the order *immediately* Bilal came to him, without making
any attempt to lead the *salat* by himself.

4. According to *Exhibit C*, the Prophet sent a specific messenger to
Abu Bakr to lead the *Salat*. Moreover, Abu Bakr too offered the
“honour” to ‘Umar, who politely turned it down. However, in *Exhibit D*,
the Messenger of Allah did not send any specific messenger to Abu Bakr.
Rather, he only gave a general order to inform Abu Bakr to lead the
*salat*. Besides, Abu Bakr did not offer the “honour” to ‘Umar.

5. According to *Exhibit C*, ‘Aishah did not object to the Prophet’s
order to Abu Bakr to lead the *salat*. However, in *Exhibit D*, she
allegedly fiercely objected to it.

6. According to *Exhibit C*, after the Prophet’s order to Abu Bakr to
lead the *salat*, he continued to do so for *days*, till Monday before
the Messenger of Allah felt a relief and “took over” an already ongoing
*salat* from him. In *Exhibit D*, the Prophet felt a relief and “took
over” from Abu Bakr, on that same Thursday, only *minutes* after giving
his order to him to lead the *salat*! ‘Aishah’s “frantic” objection to
Abu Bakr’s appointment, especially the text of her arguments - as
narrated in *Exhibit D* - shows that Abu Bakr had *never* led Muslims in
*salat* before then!

7. According to *Exhibit C*, Abu Bakr led the *salat* for several days
before the Prophet’s intervention. By contrast, in *Exhibit D*, Abu Bakr
did not even lead a single *salat* before the take-over!

8. According to *Exhibit C*, the Messenger – on his order - was taken by
two men to the side of Abu Bakr. But, in *Exhibit D*, the Prophet went
to the left side of Abu Bakr *by himself*, with no support.

What exactly are we supposed to believe from all these terrible
contradictions?!
