Dedication of the First Edition
===============================

Presented at the feet of the most Noble and Immaculate Lady

Zainab bint Ali ibn Abi Talib (a.s)

whose courageous eloquence,

in times of extreme suffering, while facing the tyrants,

has perpetuated the righteousness of the cause

and innocence of Imam Husain (a.s)

and those who were martyred with him.

Dedicated to my parents and my ancestors

who were rightly guided and who adored

the Immaculate and Infallible (Ma’soomeen) (s)

 

Dedication of The second Edition {style="text-align: center"}
--------------------------------

This Second Edition is Dedicated to the memory of

the stillborn child of the Noble and Blessed Lady Fatima (a.s)

and those Martyrs whose names are lost in History

and who readily sacrificed their lives

for perpetuating the faith in the Vicegerency of Imam Ali (a.s) and the
Eleven Imams (a.s) from his progeny
