Lesson 28: The Twelfth Imam,  Muhammad al-Mahdi (a.j.)
======================================================

Imam Mahdi (a.j.) was born on 15th of the month of Sha'ban in the year
255 A.H. in the town of Samarra, and in 260 A.H., when his great father
died, he assumed the exalted position of the Imamat. His name (Muhammad)
and his agnomen epithet (Abul-Qasim) are the same as those for the holy
Prophet (S). His father, the 11th Imam, was Imam Hasan al-'Askari
(a.s.), and his mother was the great lady Nargis may the peace of Allah
be with her.

For various reasons, the twelfth Imam, from the first day of his life,
did not appear in public. For about seventy years people were in
communication with him through his special representatives, whose names
are as follows in order of succession: 'Uthman Ibn Sa'id, Muhammad Ibn
'Uthman, Husayn Ibn Ruh, and 'Ali Ibn Muhammad al-Sammam. This period of
seventy years is known as the minor occultation (al-Ghaybat al-Sughra’),
after which the major occultation (al- Ghaybat al-Kubra’) began.

During the major occultation and until the time of his re-appearance, no
one has been and will be his special representative. The people have the
duty to refer in the matters of the Islamic laws to the Fuqaha, those
excelling in knowledge of the Shari'ah and the narration of Hadith who
are specialists in such matters.

Belief in Imam Mahdi (a.j.) and Universal Reform
------------------------------------------------

The belief in the re-appearance of Imam Mahdi (a.j.) the universal
reformer is not confined to the Shi’ah Muslims. Other Muslim groups and
even non-Muslim groups like the Jews and the Christians and some of the
great world intellectual figures believe in the appearance of a great
spiritual reformer. The following passage is from Psalm 37:

“...Trust in the Lord and do good; so you will dwell in the land, and
enjoy security.

…For the wicked shall be cut off: but those who wait for the Lord shall
possess the Land.

…But the weak shall possess the land, and delight themselves in abundant
prosperity.

...The Lord knows the days of the flawless, and their heritage will
abide forever.

....For those blessed by the Lord, shall possess the land, but those
cursed by Him shall be cut off.

...The righteous shall possess the land, and dwell upon it forever...”

The Holy Qur’an and belief In al-Mahdi (a.j.)
---------------------------------------------

In the Qur’an a time is promised when the worshippers of Truth, the
world's people of righteousness, will take over the power and government
of the world, and the glorious Din, religion, Islam will reign all over
the earth. Other verses have been revealed, which with proper exegesis
point to Imam Mahdi (a.j.).

***“We have written it in the psalms, which We had revealed after the
Torah that the earth will be given to Our righteous servants as their
inheritance (21:105).***

***God has promised the righteously striving believers to appoint them
as His deputies on earth, as He had appointed those who lived before. He
will make the religion that He has chosen for them to stand supreme. He
will replace their fear with peace and security so that they will
worship God alone and consider no one equal to Him. Whoever becomes an
unbeliever after this will be a sinful person. (24:55).***

***It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the true
religion to stand supreme over all religions, even though the pagans
dislike it (61:9).***

***But We have decided to grant a favour to the suppressed ones by
appointing them leaders and heirs of the land, (28:5).”***

The above verses clearly show that in the end the world will come into
the hands of Allah's worthy and righteous servants and that they will
become the leaders of the people of the world. Then all people will
accept Islam instead of all religions.

Belief in al-Mahdi (a.j.) and the Sunni Authorities
---------------------------------------------------

In this subject, the scholars in the Sunni school have related many
Hadith from the Prophet of Islam, through narrators who they themselves
trust. From among them are such Hadith expressing that the Imams are
twelve persons and that they are all from the Quraysh.

Al-Mahdi, the promised one, is from the family of the Prophet (a.s) and
is a descendant of Imam 'Ali and Sayyidah Fatimah al-Zahra (a.s.), and
in many of these Ahadith, (plural for Hadith), it is mentioned that he
is from the line of Imam Husayn (a.s.). They have mentioned and recorded
hundreds of Hadith about al- Mahdi in more than seventy books by their
own valued and dependable authorities of which the following are a few
examples.

• Al-Musnad of Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d. 241 A.H.)

• Sahih Bukhiri (d. 256 A.H.)

• Sahih Muslim Ibn Hajjaj Nishapouri (d. 261 A.H.)

• Sunan of Abi Dawud Sajistani (d. 275 A.H.)

• Sahih Muhammad Ibn 'Isa al-Tirmidhi (d. 279 A.H.)

The authors of the above books, each one of them are among the most
authoritative books of the Sunni Muslims died either before the birth of
the Imam of the Age (255 A.H.) or shortly after his birth.

Also of the works that mention Imam al-Mahdi are the following:

• Musabih al-Sunnah of al-Baghawi (d. 516 A.H.)

• Jami' al-‘Usul of Ibn Athir (d. 606 A.H.)

• Al-Futahat al-Makkiyyah of Muhyiddin Ibn al-'Arabi (d. 638 A H.)

• Tadhkira al-Khawas of Sibt Ibn al-Jawzi (d. 654 A.H.)

• Fara'id al-Simtayn of al-Hamawi (d.716 A.H.)

• Al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah of Ibn Hajar al-Haythami (d. 973 A.H.)

• Yanabi' al-Mawaddah of Shaykh Sulayinan al-Qunduzi (d.1293).

Some of the Sunni scholars have written books especially about the Imam
of the Age:

1. Al-Bayan fi Akhbar Sahib al-Zaman of al-Ganji al-Shafi’i.

2. Al-‘Iqd al-Durar fi Akhbar al-Imam al-Muntazar of Shaykh Jamaluddin
Yusuf al-Damishqi.

3. Mahdi of ale-Rasul of 'Ali Ibn Sultan Muhammad al-Harawi al-Hanafi

4. Kitab al-Mahdi of Abu Dawud.

5. 'Alamat al-Mahdi of Jalaluddin al-Suyuti

6. Manaqib al-Mahdi of Hafiz Abu Na'im al-Isfahani

7. Al-Qawl al-Mukhtasar fi 'Alamat al-Mahdi al-Muntazar of Ibn Hajar

8. Al-Burhan fi 'Alamat al-Mahdi Akhir al-Zaman of Mulla 'Ali al-Muttaqi

9. Arba’un Hadith fi al-Mahdi of Abul 'Ala' al-Hamadani.

The Hidden Reformer
-------------------

There are three hundred Ahadith from the Prophet (S) and from the five
Imams about the Imam of the Age. From them it is clear that the Imam of
the Age is the ninth son of Husayn Ibn Ali. His father is Imam Hasan
al-'Askari (a.s.), his mother Nargis Khatun. His name is the same as
that of the Prophet (S) of the end of time; he is also called al-Mahdi.
He was born during his father's lifetime; in Samarra, Iraq, that his
father died when he was young, that he lives even to this day, and as
long as God wishes it. Then he will reappear and the world will be
filled with justice after a time of injustice everywhere and that why is
he now hidden from the sight of men.

And when he comes, may his appearance be come soon, with his back
towards the Ka'bah's edifice, he will lean against the wall and call out
loud for his supporters and followers, who will number 313 persons.
Prophet 'Isa (a.s.) will come from the heaven down to the earth, and
will pray in a prayer led by al-Mahdi. The Imam of the Age will cause
the commands of Islam to reach all over the world, and the earth will
become like heaven.

There are many Hadith related by the Shi’ah and Sunni scholars on many
aspects pertaining this great Imam (a.s.), and these are mentioned in
books like Behar al- Anwar and Muntakhab al-Athar.

The following are some of the Hadith, which the authors of Muntakhab
al-Athar have mentioned.

When looking at the above mentioned and other Ahadith, it should be kept
in mind that the Hadith mentioning al-Mahdi (a.j.) have been narrated
most frequently, and that there are few subjects in Islam which have
been mentioned in Hadith so often. Thus, in this light, belief in Islam
and the Holy Prophet (S) must necessarily follow with belief in the
existence of the promised Mahdi who is now in occultation.

The following are some text of these Ahadith.

1. The author of Yanabi' al-Muwaddah reports that the Prophet (S) said,
“al- Mahdi is a descendant of mine. He will be in concealment, and when
he manifests himself, the earth will become filled with justice, just as
it was previously filled with injustice.”

2. In this book it is also reported that Salman al-Farsi said, “I went
to the Prophet, while Husayn Ibn 'Ali was sitting in his lap. The
Prophet (S) was kissing his eyes and mouth saying, “You are a noble one,
the son of a noble one, and the brother of a noble one. You are the
Imam, the son of the Imam, and the brother of the Imam. You are the
Authority, son of the Authority and the brother of the Authority. You
will be the father of nine (divine) Authorities of whom the ninth will
be the Qa’im, one of the names of Imam al-Mahdi (a.j).”

3. Ibn Abi Dalaf says: “I heard from Imam Ali Ibn Muhammad (the 10th
Imam) who said, “The Imam after me will be Hasan, my son, and after him
his descendant the Qa'im, who will fill the earth with justice, when it
was previously filled with injustice.”

4. Hudhayfah said that the Prophet (S) said, “If no more than one day is
left of the world, God will make that day long enough to a man,
descendant of mine, whose name is my name, to appear in the world.”
Salman asked: “O Prophet of Allah, which descendant will he be?” The
Prophet placed his hand on Husayn and said that he will be one of his
descendants.

5. Mas'adah reports from Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.) who said, “The Qa’im will
be born to Hasan (the eleventh Imam, Imam Hasan al-'Askari). Hasan will
be the son of Ali (the tenth Imam, Imam Ali al-Naqi). Ali will be the
son of Muhammad (the ninth Imam, Imam Muhammad al-Taqi). Muhammad will
be born to Ali (the eighth Imam, Imam Ali Ibn Musa al-Rida). Ali will be
the son of this child (he pointed to Imam Musa Ibn Ja'far, the seventh
Imam). We are twelve Imams, all-pure and of noble birth. I swear by
Allah, if there remains of the world no more than one day, Allah will
make that day long enough so that the Qa'im of us, the Ahlul Bayt of the
Prophet (S), will appear.”

The Opinion of Sociologists
---------------------------

The world's foremost intellectuals are of the opinion that the wars,
massacres, murders, irresponsible sexual behaviours, and all the evils
of this age which are daily in the increase are because there is no
equilibrium between man's material and spiritual requirements.

The man of today has turned his back on moral virtues and spiritual
riches, although he has conquered the sea, the desert and space, and has
taken himself to the moon.

It is obvious that by relying on force and power he cannot establish
order and justice in the world, and that only with technology and the
material sciences the happiness of humanity will not be secured. Man has
no other resort than to strengthen his social relations on the basis of
faith and virtue, and to save himself from the vortex of dangers with
the guidance of a great world reformer, to establish a rule based on
justice together with peace, security and sincerity. In this state of
affairs, human society is moving quickly towards preparation for the
rising up of the Imam of the Age (a.j.).

The Length of al-Mahdi's Life
-----------------------------

We believe that the lengthening of a man's life is not an impossibility,
because it is explicitly said in the holy Qur'an that:

***“We sent Nuh to his people, as he tarried among them a thousand
years, all but fifty.” (29:14)***

What is more, research undertaken in the biological sciences has
corroborated the possibility of lengthening the human life span. Even
great scientists are of the opinion that food and drugs may be prepared
which can prolong man's life.

The late Ayatullah As-Sadr[^1] in his book “al-Mahdi”, quoted from a
scientific article written in 1959, which stands as a witness to the
above matter. Here is a summary of what scientists say.

“Authoritative scientists say that all the basic tissues of the animal
body can live forever, and it is possible for man to live for a thousand
years, provided that it doesn't happen that the thread of his life is
not severed. These scientists do not speak on the basis of guesswork or
surmise, for they have arrived at their conclusion through scientific
experiment.

“A professor at Johns Hopkins University has said that it has been
proved that the basic members of the human body have the potentiality
for eternal life. Apparently the first person to carry out these
experiments on parts of an animal's body was Dr. Jack Lubb, and after
him Dr. Warren Lewis, who, together with his wife, proved that parts of
bird fetuses could be kept alive it buffer solutions.

These experiments were systematically continued until Dr. Alexis Karel,
as a result of further experimental work established that parts of
animals subjected to experiments did not degenerate, and even that they
lived longer than the animal from which they had been taken. In January
1912 he started his experiments and by dint of self-sacrifice and
removing the numerous difficulties, he discovered the following facts:

“1. Unless complications such as lack of nutrition or attack by microbes
intervened, living cells would continue living forever:

These cells, which continued to live, also grew and multiplied.

2. The growth and division of these cells could be controlled by the
nutrition given to them.

3. The passing of time did not affect them and did not make them age or
lose strength. Not even the smallest effect of aging, was seen. Each
year they grew and multiplied exactly as in previous years. So why does
man die? Why is his span of life rarer more than a hundred years?

The part of the human or animals body are numerous and various, and
there is also a perfect relationship and unity between them; so that the
life of some of then depends on the life of others, and the failure or
death of parts of human or animal bodies is the consequence of the death
of the other parts. Sudden deaths, which are the result of infection,
are for this reason, and it also provides the reason for the average
limit of man's life being: around seventy to eighty years.

Of course, what experiments have shown is that the cause of death is not
the arrival at seventy or eighty years of age, but that the fundamental
causes are diseases and accidents which may attack one of the body's
organs and put it out of work; then the death of this part causes a
break in its relation to other parts and the death of other organs
ensues.

Thus if science could eliminate accidents or obstruct their harmful
effects, there would be no impediment to the prolongation of life.

So if we know that a greatly extended life is not an impossibility,
there is no hindrance to prevent God, the All-powerful, from keeping a
man safe and sound for thousands of years, because the regulations of a
man's life is in the hands of God. He can bring a new harmony into
existence, which has preference over the usual order of things, just as
He did in the case of all the miracles.

The miracles of the prophets, the cooling of the fire for Ibrahim
al-Khalil, the turning into a serpent of Prophet Musa's (Moses) staff,
the bringing to life of the dead through Prophet 'Isa, (Jesus) and so
forth, are all against the usual flow of things, but Cod brought another
order into existence by His own power and a miracle occurred. All
Muslims, Jews and Christians, believe in these miracles.

Similarly for the length of the life of the Imam of the Age (a.j.) there
remains no place for any kind of objection, because if someone says that
such a length of life is impossible, his claim cannot be at all accepted
after that the Qur'an has spoken concerning the length of Prophet Nuh's
life, and also after the latest revelations of biology.

If it is said that it is possible, but against the normal natural order
of things, it can be answered that the length of life of the Imam of the
Age (a.j.) is against the natural order just as the miracles of the
prophets, and is carried out according to the will of God. Someone who
believes in the power of God and the occurrence of the miracles of the
prophets cannot have the slightest objection to the length of the Imam's
life.

The Occultation of the Imam of the Age (a.j.)
---------------------------------------------

The Prophet of Islam (S) sometimes gave people a hint concerning the
occultation of the twelfth Imam, and the infallible Imams (a.s.) also
reminded people of this matter, the news of the occultation of the Imam
of the Age (a.j.) was so well known even before his birth, that everyone
who believed in the birth of the Imam also believed in his prolonged
occultation. The following indications have come down to us from many
Ahadith on this subject.

1. The Prophet said, “The Qa'im of my descendants will disappear from
public sight, as the result of a covenant between I and him, and then
people will say that Allah has no need of the family of Muhammad and
some will doubt his birth. So everyone who is aware of his time must act
according to his religion, and must not let Shaytan enter him by
faltering lest he be thrown out of my people and my religion.”

2. Amir al-Mu'minin said, “Our Qa'im has an occultation which will be of
great duration... Beware! Everyone who is firm in his religion, and does
not become hard hearted from the lengthening of the occultation of this
man (and turn away from his religion) will find himself in the same rank
as I on the Day of Resurrection.”

Then he said, “Our Qa'im, when he rises, has no responsibility for
anyone's allegiance to him, and for this reason his birth will be secret
and he will be hidden.”

3. Muhammad Ibn Muslim said that he heard from Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq
(a.s.) saying, “If you hear of the occultation of your Imam, do not deny
it.”

4. Al-Tabarsi has written this, “The Ahadith of the occultation were
recorded by the Shi'ite narrators in books which were composed in the
time of Imam al-Baqir and Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.). Of all these reliable
narrators one was Hasan Ibn. About a hundred years before the time of
the occultation, he wrote a book called “al- Mashiykhah., and mentioned
the Ahadith about the occultation in it. The following is one of them.

“Abu Basir has said, “I said in the presence of Imam al-Sadiq (a s.)
that Imam abu- Ja'far had said, 'The Qa'im of the family of Muhammad (S)
will have two occultation; one prolonged, one short.' He said, “Yes, O
abu-Basir, one of those occultation will be longer than the other.”

The Prophet of Islam (S) and the infallible Imams (a.s.) reminded people
that the report of the occultation of the Imam of the Age (a.s.) became
public with the announcement of the existence of the Prophet himself.
Belief in the Imam's occultation is not separate from belief in the
existence of the holy Prophet (S)

Shaykh Saduq has narrated from al-Sayyid al-Himyari, “I had some
exaggerated idea about Muhammad Ibn al-Hanafiyyah, and believed that he
was hidden, till Allah enlightened me through Imam al-Sadiq (a.s) and
saved me from the Fire. I was guided to the true way, whereby after the
Imamate of Ja'far Ibn Muhammad had been proved to me with solid evidence
and reason, I said one day to him, “O son of the Prophet of Allah, tell
me some Hadith from your forefathers about occultation and the truth of
it. If you please, I would appreciate if you tell me for whom the
occultation is.” He replied, 'The occultation will occur for my
descendant in the sixth generation, and he will be the twelfth Imam
after the Prophet of Allah, the first one being 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib, and
the last the Qa’im, the one who will stand for the Truth, the remaining
of the reminders of Allah on earth and the Imam of the Age...”

Why is the Imam of the Age out of the Public sight?
---------------------------------------------------

In previous lessons it was said that the existence of the Imam (a.j.)
and the successor of the Prophet (S) was necessary for a number of
reasons, such as settling differences, explaining the laws of Allah, and
giving spiritual, inward guidance, and that Allah, the Merciful,
appointed Amir al-Mu'minin (a.s.) Ali Ibn Abu Talib and after him eleven
people from his descendants, one after the other, as Imams after the
Prophet of Islam (S).

It is obvious that the duties of the Imam of the Age, in all the aspects
of the Imamate, leadership, are the same as that of his predecessors. If
there were no hindrance, it would be necessary that he be clearly in
public sight, so that people would prosper in all the benefits of his
existence. So why was he went out of public sight at all?

Basically, there is no need to look for the philosophy or reasons behind
his occultation so as to believe in the rule of Allah, for there is no
obligation on one to know the basic reason for it, just as we remain
ignorant of the metaphysical reasons behind many other things. It is
sufficient that we know on the basis of the many Hadith and true proofs
that God, the Almighty, sent his own Proof, but that, for various
reasons, He kept him out of public sight.

It can also be found out from some Hadith that the basic and fundamental
reason for the occultation will become known after the appearance of
al-Mahd. 'Abdullah al-Fadl al-Hashimi says, “I heard Imam Ja'far
al-Sadiq (a.s.) saying, “The occultation (of the 12th Imam) will be
indispensable, so that the people of vanity will fall into doubts about
him.” I asked, “Why is it so?” He said, “For a reason which I am not at
liberty to declare.” I asked, “What will his role be?” He replied, “The
same role as existed in the occultation of previous divine authorities.
It will not be disclosed until after his appearance, just as the role of
the works of Khidr was not known (meaning the drilling of a hole in the
boat, the killing of the youth, the repairing of the wall in the story
of Khidr in the Qur'an) until Musa and Khidr decided to part company.” O
Fadl, the subject of the occultation is a command of Allah and a secret
of His secrets, and since we acknowledge Allah, we must say that that
His acts are done with Knowledge and Wisdom, even if the reason for them
is not known to us.”

Of course the benefits of al-Mahdi's occultation can be discovered, and
these have been indicated in some of the Ahadith.

1. A test for people is one of the benefits of the occultation of the
Imam of the Age. On one side, the inner failings of the group without
faith become evident. On the other side, those in the depths of whose
hearts faith have taken root, their hope of deliverance, their patience
in adversity, their faith in the unseen become more perfect, their
worthiness become known.

Imam Musa Ibn Ja'far (a.s.) has said, “When my fifth descendant will go
out of the [public sight, persevere in your religion, so that no one may
turn you away from it. There will be an occultation for the Imam of that
Age, when a group of believers in him will relinquish their belief. This
occultation is a test with which Allah will test His slaves.”

2. A Protection for the Imam against being murdered. From a study of the
leaders of Islam, and their situation i.e. the Umayyide and Abbaside
Caliphs, it can clearly be seen that if the twelfth Imam would remain in
public sight they would surely kill him like his forefathers or poison
him. When they heard and knew that there will arise from the family of
the Prophet, and from the descendants of 'Ali and Fatimah (a.s) someone
who would destroy the government of the oppressors, and that that person
would be a child of Imam Hasan al- 'Askari (a.s.), they, the Abasside
planned to kill him. But Allah protected him and his enemies lost hope.

Zurarah reports from Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.) that he said, “There will be
an occultation prior to the appearance of the Qa'im.” Zurarah asked,
“Why will it be there?” He replied, “So that he may escape murder, and
that occultation will continue till the ground for his appearance and
triumph over the rule of the oppressors is ready.”

3. The third benefit that can be gleaned from the Hadith is that by this
means al-Mahdi will be saved from the allegiance to him of the
oppressors, Caliphs, and usurping rulers. When he appears no one will
swear allegiance to him, he can freely expose the truth and establish a
just and righteous rule.

The Benefits of the Existence of the Hidden Imam (a.j.)
-------------------------------------------------------

God appointed the Imam of the Age (a.j.) to be a guide for people.
However, it is the people who are the obstacle to his appearance.
Whenever they are ready for a single, Divine rule worldwide, formed on
true justice and observance of all rights, truth and the practice of all
the laws of Islam without any dissimulation or fear, al- Mahdi (a.j.)
will openly declare himself.

So, with regard to Allah, the Merciful, there is not even the slightest
lack of favour or mercy. The fault lies with the people that the Imam is
out of public sight and the appearance of his rule is delayed. Still, it
must be remembered that the benefits of the existence of the Imam are
not limited to outward guidance among people. Just the existence of the
Imam has other benefits, which are not necessarily evident among people.

The most important benefit of the Imam's existence is that he is the
intermediary for Divine favour. On the basis of the evidence the
scholars have produced and also according to numerous Hadith which speak
of the Imamat, leadership, if there were no Imam the relation between
the world and its Creator would no longer exist. All of the favors of
Allah come through the Imam to the rest of humanity. In many Hadith it
is said very clearly that the earth will not remain without an Imam.

The Imam is the heart of the world of existence, the leader, the
preceptor of mankind, and for this reason his presence or his absence
makes no difference. What is more, the spiritual guidance of the Imam
towards worthy individuals will always be there, although they may not
see him, especially as it is mentioned in Hadith that the Mahdi (a.j.)
comes and goes among the people in the meetings of the believers without
anyone understanding. Thus the guarding of Islam and the protection of
the worthy is well undertaken by the Imam, even during the time of his
occultation. In reality the hidden Imam is like the sun behind a cloud
from whose light and heat existent things may profit, although the
ignorant and the blind may not see it.

Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.) also said in answer to the question: “How can
people benefit from a hidden Imam?” He replied, “Just as they do from
the sun when it is behind a cloud.”

The following is an excerpt from the writings of Henri Corbin the famous
French scholar, “I believe that the Shi’ah sect is the only religion
which maintains eternally the link of Divine guidance between God and
his creation, and continually keeps alive the union of walayat.

The Jewish religion, finished prophethood, which is the relationship
between God and the world of man, with Moses, and do not acknowledge the
prophethood, of Jesus or Muhammad. Thus they have served this link. The
Christians, also, stopped with Jesus, and the Sunni Muslims stood still
with Muhammad. With the seal of prophethood among the latter, they admit
of no further link being maintained between the Creator and creation.

“Only the Shi'ah faith believes that the prophethood ended with
Muhammad, but that walayat, which is this link of guidance and
progression, continues to live after him and forever.

“Indeed, only among the Shi’ah does this reality between the world of
man and the Divinity remain forever.”

Belief in the Imam of the Age means that the link between people and the
unseen world is inseparable. If someone believes this, he must always
remember the Mahdi and await the appearance of this hidden reformer.

Waiting for the Imam of the Age does not mean that all Muslims and
Shi’ah should fold their arms and take no steps and measures in the way
of furthering the aims of Islam but only wish him to appear. The great
Shi’ah scholars have been saying from the earliest times that a Muslims
and a Shi’ah has the duty to make every effort to establish and
strengthen the Islamic system of education and laws in the face of
injustice and evil.

In other words, to strive prepare for a just rule and harmonize the
society that justice is served to the suffering. Oppression and cruelty
are condemned. Every Muslim has the duty to offer some in the way of
Imam and Islam, and to always be prepared to welcome the promised
al-Mahdi (a.j.). One must so order his life that it may be not
contradict the project of the Imam, and that he may take his piece in
the ranks in support of the Imam and fight against the enemies.
