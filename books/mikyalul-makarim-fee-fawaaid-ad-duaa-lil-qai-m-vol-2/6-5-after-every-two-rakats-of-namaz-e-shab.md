5. After Every Two Rakats Of Namaz-E-Shab
=========================================

That is which proves this point, is the fact mentioned especially in
supplications our scholars have quoted in their authentic books and some
of them have quoted this supplication among the recitations that are
supposed to be recited after every two units of Midnight Prayer. The
supplication is:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وتجعلنا من أصحابه وأنصاره وترزقنا به رجاءنا وتستجيب به دعاءنا.
  </p>
</blockquote>

And make us among his companions and helpers and grant us all our hopes
through him; and accept our prayers.

I say: In Jamalus Saliheen, the above supplication has following
additional words: “And include us among his companions and his helpers;
and give us our Rajat (return after death) through him and accept our
supplication through him.”
