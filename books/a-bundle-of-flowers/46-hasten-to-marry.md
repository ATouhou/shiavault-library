Hasten to Marry
===============

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Verily, maidens are like fruits of a tree;
when its fruits ripen and are not reaped, sunshine ruins them and the
wind scatters them. Maidens are in the same situation. When they
comprehend what the women perceive, there is no remedy for them save a
husband. If they are not given in marriage, they will not be secured
from corruption, because they are human beings, too. (They have the same
human instincts and temperament as others)."

Al-Kafi, vol. 5, p. 337

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Any young man who marries at the beginning
of his youth, his devil moans and intensively regrets that he has
protected two-third of his Faith from Satan."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 103, p. 221

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "O' young people! If one of you is capable of
marrying, then do it, because it is good for your eyes (not to stare at
women) and protects your privy part (to remain more pious).

Mustadrak Wasa'il-ush Shi'ah, vol.14, p.153

The Holy Prophet (S) forbade the life of celibacy, and prohibited women
from living in chastity and allowing their selves to remain unmarried."
