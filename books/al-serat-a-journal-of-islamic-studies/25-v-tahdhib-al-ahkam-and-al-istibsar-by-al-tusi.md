**The Author**

Shaikh al-ta'ifa (the teacher of the community) Abu Ja'far Muhammad b.
al-Hasan b. 'Ali b. al-Hasan al-Tusi was born in Tus in Iran in the year
385 of the Islamic era. His career marks the climax of a very great
period in Shi'ite Islamic scholarship and learning. It was during this
period that Shi'ite scholars were without rivals in the Islamic world.
Al-Shaikh al-Tusi's teachers included al-Shaikh al-Mufid, and the two
brothers, members of Ahl al-bait and both outstanding scholars,
al-Sharif al-Murtada and al-Sharif al-Radi.

This period of great public Shi'ite Islamic scholarship had begun with
al-Kulaini (died 328/9 A.H.), whose collection of traditions, al-Kafi,
is the first of the four major works of Shi'ite Islamic traditions.[^1]
It was then continued with al-Shaikh al-Saduq lbn Babawaih (died 381
A.H.); his great collection of traditions, Man la yahduruh al-faqih, is
the second of the major works of traditions.[^2] The remaining two major
collections of traditions were compiled by al-Shaikh al-Tusi and they
are Tahdhib al-ahkam fi sharh al-munqi' a[^3] and al-Istibsar fima
'khtalaf min al-akhbar.[^4]

Al-Shaikh al-Tusi grew up in Tus and began his studies there. In 408
A.H. he left Tus to study in Baghdad. There he first studied under
al-Shaikh al-Mufid, who died in 413 A.H. Leadership of the Shi'ite
scholars then fell to al-Sharif al-Murtada. The latter remained in this
position until his death in 436 A.H. During this time al-Shaikh al-Tusi
was closely associated with al-Sharif al-Murtada. His vast scholarship
and learning made him a natural successor of al-Sharif al-Murtada as the
leading spokesman of Shi'ite Islam. So impressive was his learning that
the Abbasid caliph, al-Qadir bi-'llah, attended his lectures and sought
to honour him.

In the closing years of al-Shaikh al-Tusi's life the political
situation in Baghdad and the domains of the Abbasid caliphate was in
turmoil. The Saljuqids fiercely anti-Shi'ite, were gaining commanding
power in the centre of the Islamic Empire at the expense of the Buyids
who had always seemed tolerant to Shi'ite views.

In 447 Tughril-bek the leaders of the Saljuqids entered Baghdad. At
this time many of the 'ulama' in Baghdad, both Sunni and Shi'ite were
killed. The house of al-Shaikh al-Tusi was burnt down, as were his books
and the works he had written in Baghdad, together with important
libraries of Shi'ite hooks. Fanaticism against the Shi'a was great.

Al-Shaikh al-Tusi, seeing the danger of remaining in Baghdad, left and
went to al-Najaf. Al-Najaf, the city where 'Ali b. Abi Talib had been
martyred, was already a very important city in the hearts of Shi'ite
Muslims. However, it was al-Shaikh al-Tusi's arrival which was to give
that city the impetus to become the leading centre of Shi'ite
scholarship. This is a role, which it has maintained down to the present
day.

Al-Shaikh al-Tusi died in al-Najaf in 460 A.H. His body was buried in a
house there, which was made into a mosque as he had enjoined in his
will. Even today his grave is a place of visitation in al-Najaf. Al-Tusi
was succeeded by his son al-Hasan, who was known as al-Mufid al-Thani,
and was himself an outstanding scholar.[^5]

The learning of al-Shaikh al-Tusi extended over the whole of Islamic
studies. He was a learned traditionist, whose two compilations will be
discussed below; but he was not only a traditionist, he was also an
authoritative jurist, who could interpret traditions to meet the needs
of jurisprudence, and many of his works on jurisprudence and the
principles of jurisprudence still survive, in particular al-Mabsut and
al-Nihaya. In addition, he was the leading Shi'ite theologian of his
time.

As well as writing works of a general theological nature, he also wrote
specific works on individual topics. On the Imamate, he wrote Talkhis
al-Shafi, which was based on al-Sharif al-Murtada's al-Shafi fi
'l-imama. He wrote a work on al-Ghaiba, the occultation of the 12th
Imam. As a traditionist, he naturally had an interest in the men who
related traditions, in his Kitab al-rijal, he tries to list most of the
important Shi'ites.

His Fihrist is an important work of Shi'ite bibliography. In it he
lists many of the works of early Shi'ite writers and sometimes gives an
account of their writers and the contents of the works. This work may to
some extent reflect al-Tusi's own library before it was so tragically
destroyed.

**Tahdhib al-ahkam fi sharh al-muqni 'a**

The title of this work could be translated as "The Refinement of the
Laws (as Discussed) in Terms of the Explanation of the Sufficiency".
"The Sufficiency" or al-Muqni'a was a work on traditions by al-Shaikh
al-Mufid, the teacher of al-Tusi, who has been mentioned earlier. Thus
the original intention of al-Tusi had been to write a commentary on
al-Muqni'a of al-Mufid.

However, he makes it clear in his introduction that his work would only
concern the furu' of Islamic law, i.e. the practical regulations for
carrying out the sharia, the holy law of Islam. He said: "I went first
to the chapter which was connected with ritual purity (tahara), leaving
aside the (chapters) which preceded it, which were about the Unity of
God (tawhid), Justice ('adl), Prophethood (nubuwwa) and the Imamate
(imama), because the explanation of these would be too lengthy, and also
because it was not the intention of this book to elucidate the
principles of religion (al-usul).[^6]

In his introduction, al-Tusi makes it clear that the principal motive
for writing this work and limiting it to the furu', was the great
differences which were arising in Shi'ite traditions. He mentions that
these differences were being used against the Shi'a by their opponents
as an argument against the truth of Shi'ite beliefs. The situation had
become so critical that al-Tusi reports al-Mufid's account of one
Shi'ite adherent who had left the community because of the contradictory
traditions. Al-Tusi set himself the task of analysing the traditions
concerned with furu', explaining which traditions were deficient and
reconciling apparent contradictions in sound traditions. He used
al-Mufid's al-Maqni'a as the basis for this task.[^7] However, he did not
only deal with the traditions used in al-Muqni'a; he analysed many more
traditions which he included at the end of various sections, appendices
of traditions not mentioned by al-Mufid, which he also discusses.

The method used is to quote the traditions and then al-Mufid's comments
on them. This is often followed by al-Tusi's explanation of al-Mufid's
comments. Sometimes, it is not always clear whether the explanation
belongs to al-Mufid or al-Tusi. However, he quite often makes it clear
that it is al-Mufid when he says: "Al Shaikh said..." But sometimes a
discussion is introduced by the ambiguous terms: "He said..." This could
refer to either al-Mufid or al-Tusi. In the appendices al-Tusi makes it
quite clear that he is making the comments, for he says: "Muhammad b.
al-Hasan said..."

The discussions on the traditions are sometimes of considerable length.
An example is the discussion of the method of performing ritual
ablutions, there quotations are made from Arabic verse to support the
Shi'ite version of rubbing the feet instead of washing them.[^8]

The work is divided into chapters (kutub) and the chapters into
sections (abwab) with appendices following when appropriate. The work is
a very comprehensive study of Shi'ite traditions and consists of the
following chapters:

al-Salat

Fasting

**Indemnities for Bodily Injury**

It is said that al-Tusi began this work during the life of al-Mufid and
had reached the end of the chapter on "Ritual Purity" by the time of his
death (413 A.H.). However the work was not finally finished until
al-Tusi moved to al-Najaf (448 A.H.).[^9]

One of the remarkable features of this work is that despite the great
number of traditions, which had become known to al-Tusi since the time
of al-Kulaini and lbn Babawaih, al-Tusi's interpretation of what are the
correct traditions, preserves Shi'ite law in a very similar position to
that of al-Kulaini and lbn Babawaih. The reason for the great spread of
diverse traditions during the period from al-Kulaini's death to
al-Tusi's (328/9 A.H.) death (460 A.H.) may have been the fact that this
was a period in which the Buyids held sway in Baghdad; they were very
sympathetic towards the Shi'a. Thus, this was a period in which the
Shi'a were not persecuted and could admit their beliefs without too much
fear.

In such circumstances, there was much more opportunity for outsiders to
bring extraneous traditions into the Shi'ite corpus. However al-Tusi had
available to him many of the early works of Usul which had been
available to the earlier Shi'ite compilers of collections of traditions.
Al-Tusi says about this work: "When our companions looked at the akhbar
(traditions) connected with what is permitted and forbidden (al-halal
wa-'l-haram) which we had collected in it, they saw that they included
most of what the sections of laws connected with jurisprudence. In all
its sections and its chapters, only very little of the traditions of our
companions, their books, usul and compilations has escaped.[^10]

**Al-Istibsar fima 'khtalaf al-akhbar**

Al- Istibsar is the fourth and last of the major works of Shi'ite
Islamic traditions. It covers the same field as Tahdhib al-ahkam but is
considerably smaller. Al-Tusi mentions that his colleagues, after seeing
the size of Tahdhib al-ahkam considered: "...... It would be useful that
there should be a reference (madhkur) book which a beginner could use in
his study of jurisprudence, or one who has finished, to remind himself,
or the intermediate (student) to study more deeply.

Thus (so that) all of them could obtain what they need and reach their
soul's desire, what is connected with different traditions would be set
in an abridged way . . . Therefore they asked me to summarise it
(Tahdhib al-ahkam) and devote care to its compilation and abridgement,
and to begin each section with an introduction about what I relied on
for the legal decisions and traditions in it; then I should follow with
those traditions which disagree and explain the reconciliation between
the two without leaving out anything which was influential. I would
follow my practice in my big book mentioned earlier (i.e. Tahdhib
al-ahkam) and at the beginning of the book, I would explain briefly how
traditions are weighed against each other, and how the practice of
something was possible through (the authority) of (some of) them to the
exclusion of the rest ..."[^11] Al-Tusi, then, follows this statement
with a brief but comprehensive and clear outline of the principles of
jurisprudence.[^12]

As can be seen from al-Tusi's own introduction, al-Istibsar is
essentially a summary of Tahdhib al-ahkam. Its methods are similar but
briefer; there are not so many traditions used in the work and the
explanations are more concise. In many ways it is closer to Man la
yahduruh al-faqih, although unlike the latter it gives full isnads for
the traditions quoted. However it is possible to say that al-Kafi and
Tahdhib al-ahkam represent comprehensive collections of traditions,
while Man la yahduruh al-faqih and al-Istibsar are books intended to be
used as ready reference works for students and scholars.

The collections and commentaries of Shi'ite traditions did not end with
al-Tusi but his works mark the high point in this process. It had begun
with al-Kulaini, whose al-Kafi, while not the first collection, was
certainly the first major collection based on the early works of usul.
The process had been continued by lbn Babawaih; in his introduction to
Man la yahduruh al-faqih he makes it clear that he had also used these
usul. Al-Tusi, the author of the other two major works of Shi'ite
traditions also admits his dependence on these early works. As has
already been pointed out, these three authors and their four major works
of tradition present a generally consistent picture of Shi'ite Islamic
legal thinking. It is a remarkable picture of tradition and shows that,
whatever the vagaries of individuals may have been, leading Shi'ite
scholars had a clear and consistent view of their traditions.
