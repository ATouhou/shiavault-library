Proper Social Transaction
=========================

   
 Behaving correctly with Almighty Allah's creation without disobedience
to Him comes from Allah's increased favour to His bondsmen. Whoever is
humble to Allah in his heart behaves well openly.  
    
 Keep company with people for the sake of Allah, not for your portion of
something which belongs to this world or to seek position or for showing
off or to increase your own reputation.  
    
 Do not cross the limits of the Law for the sake of eminence and fame:
they will not profit you at all, and you will miss the next world
without gaining any benefit.
