Rules of Fasting
================

**WAYS TO IDENTIFY THEFJRSTANDLASTDAYS OF RAMADHAN**

Since Ramadhan is a lunar month, it is necessary to ascertain the new
moon in order to facilitate fasting. The Sharia has accordingly
prescribed one of the following ways to identify the first and last days
of Ramadhan:

1- One sees the new moon himself.
2- A group of trustworthy people report seeing the new moon.
3- Two just men report seeing the new moon, and their descriptions do
not disagree.
4- Thirty days have passed since the beginning of Sha ban.
5- The leading mujtahid\* states that it is the first of Ramadhan.

The same procedure also applies to the last day of Ramadhan and
Eid-uI-Fitr. Note: an astronomical report on the new moon is not a
binding verification of the first day of Ramadhan.

**DAY OF DOUBT**

1- If one is not certain whether it is the last day of Sha'ban (the
preceding month) or the first day of Ramadhan, that person is not
obliged to fast that day. However, if one chooses to do an optional or
defaulted fast that day, and later on discovers it was the first of
Ramadhan, it will be regarded as a normal Ramadhan fast.

2- If one intends to break fast on the day of doubt, but has had none
of the fast-breakers, then before noon the day was proved to be of

--------------------------------------------------------------------
\* A mujtahid is a person who is an expert in Islamic jurisprudence
(fiqh): he is also called faqih.

Ramadhan, one must intend to fast that day as a fast of Ramadhan. In
this way the day's fasting will be deemed correct.

3- But if one has had a fast-breaker, and before noon the day was
proved to be of Ramadhan, it is obligatory to al~tain the rest of the
day, and make default for it later. Similarly if it was known in the
afternoon, that the day was proved to be of Ramadhan, one must abstain
the rest of the day, and make default later, even if one has had none of
the fast-breakers. necessary for fasting. Those who are sick are
exempted, and nor should one fast when sure of adverse effects on
health, or fears possibility of adverse effects.

**CLARIFICATION:**

a. If one fears -the fear of any prudent person- that fasting will make
him/her sick, worsen malady or bring harm then he/she should not fast,
but make up for the defaulted fasts later, on regaining health.

b. Mere feeling of weakness~.or for that matter psychological fear is
not an excuse to forego fasting or to break fast. But if the physical
weakness is very severe and unbearable and is taxing the power of
resistance, then it is allowed to break the- fast.

c. If fasting has no adverse effects for a sick person, then it is
obligatory for him/her to fast.

d. If one fasts, believing there will be no adverse effects, but it
turi~ out later that fasting did harm his/her condigion, such a fast is
not regarded as correct.

e. If one fasts knowing that it will be harmful, or possibly harmful,
his/her fasting is null.

**INTENTION**

Earlier we had briefly mentioned the significance of inten necessary
for fasting. Those who are sick are exempted, and nor should one fast
when sure of adverse effects on health, or fears possibility of adverse
effects.

**CLARIFICATION:**

a. If one fears -the fear of any prudent person- that fasting will make
him/her sick, worsen malady or bring harm then he/she should not fast,
but make up for the defaulted fasts later, on regaining health.

b. Mere feeling of weakness,or for that matter psychological fear is
not an excuse to forego fasting or to break fast. But if the physical
weakness is very severe and unbearable and is taxing the power of
resistance, then it is allowed to break the- fast.

c. If fasting has no adverse effects for a sick person, then it is
obligatory for him/her to fast.

d. If one fasts, believing there will be no adverse effects, but it
turns out later that fasting did harm his/her condigion, such a fast is
not regarded as correct.

e. If one fasts knowing that it will be harmful, or possibly harmful,
his/her fasting is null.

**INTENTION**

Earlier we had briefly mentioned the significance of inten tion
(Niyya). Here, we wish to deal in detail with this important subject. A
tradition from Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.) says:

"Deeds depend on intentions."

Hence, Intention is compulsory for every devotional act. A devotional
act, without a true, purely God-oriented intention, is void. Fasting is
thus one such act which requires the intention of gaining proximity to
Allah. Yet, such an intention need not necessarily be present in the
mind of the fasting person at each and every single moment of fasting,
but the person concerned should be aware of the state. The intention to
fast will remain effective, and even if one forgets or sleeps, the fast
will be valid.

However, the intention to fast requires certain basic rules:

1. Intention depends on two options. One can intend on the first eve of
Ramadhan to fast for the whole month, or can make the intention daily
for that particular day, but before dawn breaks.

2. The intention should be to fast from fair (a little before dawn
breaks) till Maghrib (a little after sunset). Thus, fasting will cover
the entire period of the day, beginning at dawn till the redness of the
dusk disappears in the east. During this time one should abstain from
eating, drinking and all other acts which break fasting.

3. The end of the day comes a little after sunset. Sunset is not
determined by the mere disappearance of the sun's orb, but the
disappearance of the redness of the dusk in the east.


**Actions Which Make The Fast Invalid**

1. Eating or drinking anything in any quantity.
2. Sexual intercourse.
3. Any sexual activity that leads to ejaculation.
4. Attributing a lie to Allah, the Holy Prophet or the Imams (peace be
upon them).
5. Allowing heavy dust or thick smoke (including tobacco) reach one's
throat.
6. Submerging one's entire head in water.
7. Remaining in need of obligatory bathing for janabah,\* haydh
(menstruation) or nifas\* up to the time of the morning adhan.
8. Taking a liquid enema.
9. Intentional vomiting.

-----------------------------------------------------

\* The state resulting from sexual intercourse with or without
ejaculation. or seminal discharge while awake or asleep. \* Bleeding
that occurs after childbirth or abortion.


**CLARIFICATIONS:**

1) If a person commits intentionally and willingly an act which breaks
the fast, that day's fast will be considered invalid, but the fast is
valid if the action committed was unintentional or involuntary.
2) If one breaKs fast after merely being threatened, that fast is
considered invalid and must be compensated later.
3) A fasting person can swallow the saliva gathered in the mouth, but
nasal discharge and frothy sputum must be spitted out.
4) To rinse mouth during ablutions is allowed and while doing if the
water slips unintentionally down into the throat it will not break the
fast.
5) Taking of injection in the muscles or veins is permitted as also
using of medicinal drops in ears or eyes is allowed.
6) Brushing of teeth is permitted, provided the froth or saliva does
not enter the throat.

**EXEMPTIONS FROM FASTING**

Islam is called a natural religion. In other words, its laws unlike
other creeds have logic and reason behind them and divine providence has
fashioned them according to the nature of man and woman. It has no hard
and fast rules for all age groups ignoring the state, or circumstances
of the individual concerned. In such a case, its very claim to be
natural and universal would have been open to doubt. How merciful and
benign is the Creator, Who as a sign of His unbounded bounty exempted
from fasting,persons passing through particular circumstances, and in a
certain state of health or age group.

Following are those whom Islam has quite logically exempted from
fasting and furthermore has released them from expiation for defaults:

1. Minors- for pre-puberty years.
2. Insane- for the period insanity lasts.
3. Unconscious- for the period of unconsciousness.

4. Non-Muslims -for the years before conversion to Islam.

**DEFAULTED FASTS**

There are different status of defaulted fasts:

1. An aged person who cannot fast is exempted from fasting and also
from expiation. If, after Ramadhan, it becomes possible for that aged
person to fast, he/she should make up the defaulted Rarnadhan fasts.

2. An aged person for whom fasting is hard is exempted but must pay 3/4
kilogram (1 Mud) of food to the poor for every day of defaulted fast. 3.
One who has a condition which causes insatiable thirst and who cannot
tolerate going without water,or for whom fasting is hard is exempted. a-
In the latter case, one must pay 3/4kilogram of food to the poor for
every day of defaulted fast.

b- If after Ramadhan , it becomes possible for both cases to fast, one
should make up defaulted fasts.

4. A woman who is pregnant and whose delivery time is near, or a woman
who is breast-feeding her child, if fasting will harm herself or her
baby, she should not fast.

a- She must give 3/4 kilogram of food as expiation to the poor and,
make up for the defaulted fasts.

b- In case the harm was for herself only and not for the child, then
she should make up for the defaulted fasts without giving expiation.

5. Apostate (murtad) -A Muslim who turns away from Islam, should
compensate for fasts defaulted during the period of apostacy.

6. Women in their monthly period or during childbirth should compensate
for defaulted fasts.

7.A travellerwho missed certain days fast because of journey has to
make up for missed fasts.

8. A sick person after recovery must fast the number of
days missed during Ramadhan.

a- A sick person provided the sickness continues for one full year
until next Ramadhan is exempted. However, in such case one must pay 3/4
kilogram of wheat or any other staple food to the needy as expiation for
the days missed. b- If one has not kept the fast for reasons other than
sickness (example: being on a journey), and the same reason continues
until next Ramadh an, that person must make up for the defaulted fasts,
and it is also advisable to give 3/4 kilogram of food to the poor for
every day of defaulted fast.

**CLARIFICATIONS:**

Defaulted fasts should be made up before the next Ramadhan. In case
defaulted fasts are delayed after next Ramadhan, then one has time to
fast afterwards whenever one can but that person should in addition
distribute 3/4 kilogram of wheat or any staple food to the needy for
each day of defaulted fasts as expiation.

**ATONEMENT**

If a person for whom Ramadhan fasting is compulsory, breaks the fast
intentionally and willingly, must do an act of atonement in addition to
making up the defaulted fast.

Sharia prescribes three methods of atonement, and any one method will
atone for one day of defaulted fasting:

1- Freeing a slave.
2- Fasting for 60 days. The first 31 days of this fast must be
consecutive. If, in the first 31 days, a reason arises for brcaking
fast, such as the menstrual period, or a journey which can on no account
be delayed, one need not start the 31 days of fasting over and again.
Rather, that person can complete the remaining days when the cause is
removed.
3- Feeding 60 poor Muslims (for one full meal). If one cannot afford to
feed 60 poor Muslims, should then feed as many as possiblç. In case of
not being able to feed anyone, then that person should sincerely plead
Allah for forgiveness (say astaghflrullah) for the deed done. It is a

necessary precaution to perform any of the three methods of atonement
whenever one is able to do. If one invalidates the fast with a forbidden
act (haram) such as drinking wine, adultery etc., must observe all the
three above-mentioned atonements and if unable to afford all, must
observe the least taxing, and if that is also not possible must
sincerely seek forgiveness from Allah.

**TRAVELLER'S FAST**

1- A traveller who has to shorten prayers\* for a journey must not
fast. But this does not apply to a person whose duty is to travel and
who observes normal prayers, such as a proPessional travller (e.g.
sailor, pilot driver,roving salesman, etc.), who must fast.

2-A fasting person who begins a journey in, the afternoon, must
continue the fast. If the journey was before noon, and on reaching a
point where neither on&s hometown houses are visible nor the sotrnd of
adhan is heard, the traveller must break the fast. But if the fast was
broken before reaching that particular point, an atonement should be
paid.

3- If a trayeller returns,to hometown. Qr reaches a place before noon,
intending to siay ten days, and jias not done anything which would
invalidate the fast, must fast that day. In case the traveller did
something that would invalidate the fast, that day's fast is not
obligatory. However, if a traveller arrives home or to a place
afternoon, where a ten day stay is intended, that particular day's fast
is not obligatory.

**Recommanded Fasts**

Besides the obligatory fasting of Ramadhan, there are recommended fasts
in ordinary days of the year, for those seeking to avail of Allah's
unbounded bounty. Some of these are as follows:

1) Three days of every lunar month, especially the first, the middle
and the last.
2) Every Thursday and Friday.

-----------------------------------------------------------

\* To andfto distance of about 45 kilometers shortens four Rakaat
prayer to two, and breakes the fast.

3) Fastfrig during the months of Rajab and Sha'ban.

4) Fasting during the Hajj (pilgrimage) in Mina (11, 12, 13th of

for her to do so.

1- ZAKAT-UL-FITR

1) Zakat-ul-Fitr,paid on Eid, following the end of Ramadhan is
obligatory for any person who is mature, sane, conscious and financially
able, at sunset on the last day of Ramadhan to pay for himself and his
dependents. The rate is three kilograms of wheat, barley, raisin, rice
or similar produce per person. It is also permitted to give the cash
value of such items.

2) The proper amount of the said Zakat must be paid or set aside before
one offers the Eid prayer on Zakat-ul-Fitr.

3) If one does not offer the Eid prayer, the Zakat-uI-Fitr must be paid
before noon of that day.

**SELECTED SUPPLICATIONS**

It is recommended to recite the following two supplications after every
prayer during Ramadhan:.

nothing can resemble, and is All-Hearing, All-Seeing. And this is the
month which You have honoured, exalted, glorified and excelled over

me. And it is the month of Ramadhan, in which You sent down the Qur'an,
as a guidance to people, and clear signs of guidance and Furqan
(distinction between right and wrong). And You have made in it the Night
of Qadr, and made it better than a thousand months. 0 One Who favours

**EID PRAYER**

The Eid Prayer is obligatory under certain conditions, and its time is
sunrise till noon. It is prayed in congregation. Women are exempted from
this prayer, but if they are inclined there is no restriction for them
to pray.

The Eid prayer has two rakaats. In the first rakaat, there are five
takbirs\* and five qunuts\* and in the second rakaat, there are four
takbirs and four qunuts . Eid prayer is performed as follows:

In the first rakaat, after reciting aI-Hamd and another sura,
(preferably sura A'ala), recite takbir and raise your hands to recite
qunut. After finishing, recite takbir and qunut again. Repeat After the
fifth qunut, recite takbir and then perform ruku (bowing) and two
sajdahs (prostration) and stand erect. This completes one rakaat. In the
second rakaat, after reciting al-Hamd and one other sura, (preferably
sura Shams), recite takbir and qunut four times in the same manner as in
the first rakaat and complete the prayer as usual.

After prayer, the Imam (prayer leader) recites two Khutbas (sermons).
Note: The Eid prayer unlike the 5 daily prayers is not preceded by Adhan
or Jqamah, but it is recommended to call thrice As-Salaat (To Prayer).

**DU'A-QUNUT**

"0 Allah, Lord of magnqfcence and greatness; and Lord of generosity and
overwhelming power; and Lord of pardon and mercy. We implore You for the
sake of this day which You have appointed as a Festival for the Muslims
and for Muhammad (s.a. w.) and his progeny as a reminder, a distinction,
an honour, to bless Muhammad and his progeny and admit me to all the
bounties to which You have admitted Muhammad and his progeny, and keep
me away from all evils from which You have kept away Muhammad (s.a.w.)
and his progeny. May Your blessings be upon him and his progeny. I beg
of You of the best which has been asked for by Your virtous good
servants, and I seek Your protection from all those evils from which
Your sincere servants have sought Your protection."

--------------------------------------------------------
\* Takbir is to say Allahu akbar (Allah i~ Great).
\* Qunut is the recommn'~ded supplication recited during the daily
prayers ti.jt is obligatorfor a total of five takbirs and qunuts.

It is preferable to go to the Mosque for Eid Prayer. If this is not
possible then one should say the prayer at home, in the manner described
above. If this is not pOssible, then recite it like the morning prayers,
but in the first Rakaat recite Qunut (whatever you know) 5 times, and in
the second Rakaat 4 times.

Ghusul (bath) on Eid day is optional which should be taken und& a
shelter and not under the open sky. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the
worlds.
