Prophet Ibrahim (a) & Prophet Ishaq (a)
=======================================

The Well of Zamzam

where water first flowed

to save the lives of

Hajar and Ismail, became

a popular place for the

caravans to stop.

Some people liked the

place so much they decided

to stay there.

This place became known

as Makkah.

One day Ibrahim had

a message from Allah.

He and Ismail were to

build a place for

people to pray.

They were to build

an altar, it was to

be known as the Ka'aba.

The angel Jibrail

brought the message

saying that the Ka'aba

should be built near

the Well of Zamzam,

the most sacred place

on earth.

The foundation stone

for the Ka'aba was to

come from heaven.

It is found today in a

corner of the Ka'aba and is

known as the black stone.

When Ibrahim was

building the Ka'aba

he was standing on

a large rock. Allah

softened the rock and

the shape of Ibrahim's

bare feet was left in

it. It is still there,

for all to see.

When Ibrahim was

very old the angels

came to see him and

said Allah was

going to give a son

to him and Sarah.

Sarah could not believe

it was true. She too was

old. The angels said that

all things are possible

to Allah. They said the

son was to be called

Ishaq. He was to be a prophet.

Sure enough,

Sarah did have

a son and they called

him Ishaq. he grew

up to be a great

prophet.

Ishaq married a

girl called Rebecca.

They had two sons,

called Esau and Yaqub.

Yaqub became a

great prophet.

Yaqub grew up and

married Zia and they

had lots of children,

both boys and girls.

His second wife

Rohsie had two sons,

Yusuf and Benjamin.

Yusuf and Benjamin

were very good, obedient

sons and they became

Yaqub's favourites because

of their good behaviour.

Yusuf too grew up

to be a prophet.

All of these great

prophets were

descendents of Ibrahim.

He is known as

the father of all

the prophets.

Muhammad (s), our great

and beloved prophet,

the last of all the

prophets was a

descendant of Ismail.
