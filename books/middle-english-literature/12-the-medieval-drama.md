The Medieval Drama
==================

The drama of the whole medieval period - though it did not reach a very
high literary level, was one of the most characteristic expressions of
the age.

In England the**folk-plays** , throughout the Middle Ages and in remote
spots down almost to the present time, sometimes took the form of
energetic dances. Their characters gradually came to be a conventional
set, partly famous figures of popular tradition, such as St. George,
Robin Hood, Maid Marian, and the Green Dragon. Other offshoots of the
folk-play were the 'mummings' and 'disguisings,' collective names for
many forms of processions, shows, and other entertainments, such as,
among the upper classes, that precursor of the Elizabethan Mask in which
a group of persons in disguise, invited or uninvited, attended a formal
dancing party. In the later part of the Middle Ages, also, there were
the secular pageants, spectacular displays (rather different from those
of the twentieth century) given on such occasions as when a king or
other person of high rank made formal entry into a town. They consisted
of an elaborate scenic background set up near the city gate or on the
street, with figures from allegorical or traditional history who engaged
in some pantomime or declamation, but with very little dramatic dialog,
or none.
