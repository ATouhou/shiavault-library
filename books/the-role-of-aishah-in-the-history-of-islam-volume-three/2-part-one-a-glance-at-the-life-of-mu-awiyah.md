Part One : a Glance At the Life of Mu'awiyah
============================================

Mu'awiyah was the son of Abu Sufyan and fiend and was nicknamed 'Abd
ar-Rahman. According to the most common historical narrations, he seemed
to apparently embrace Islam after the capture of Mecca, and in the 12th
year of the Hijrah when Abu Bakr dispatched an army to ash- Sham under
the command of Yazid, the other son of Abu Sufyan, to fight the Romans,
Mu'awiyah accompanied his brother as a banner-bearer of the army.

Yazjd, Abu Sufyan's son, died of plague in the year 18 of the Hijrah;
in 'Amwas(16), and appointed his brother, Mu'awiyah, as commander of the
army, a nomination that was accepted and signed by the caliph.

During the caliphate of 'Uthman who was of the Umayyads and a cousin of
Mu'awiyah, many lands were annexed to the dominion governed by him, and
'Uthman placed ash-Sham under his rule which to-day comprises Lebanon,
Syria, Palestine and Jordan.

Thus for nineteen years Mu'awiyah governed ash-Sham in peace and
tranquility. But after this period when Imam 'Ali assumed the position
of caliph, Mu'awiyah rebelled against and disobeyed him. He rose with
the deceptive claim of avenging 'Uthman's blood, and entered the region
of Siffin with a huge army. The Imam collected an army of the Emigrants,
Ansar - (helpers) and other Muslims to suppress him and proceeded to
Siffin to confront him.

The two armies faced each other in the month of Dhu al-Hijjah of the
year 36 of the Hijrah, and during one hundred and ten days ninety
skirmishes took placed between them, and finally when the victory of the
Imam's army seemed certain, 'Amr ibn al-'As suggested to resort to
trickery, which was carried out by the order of Mu'awiyah.

Soldiers were ordered to stick a copy of the Qur'an on their
spearheads, inviting the Imam and his army to the arbitration of the
Qur'an. This trick carried a considerable emotive effect on the army of
ash-Sham and the simple-minded people of Kufah who faced the Imam to
accept peace with their brothers-in- faith!

The war thus ended, and then the arm of Kufah, contrary to the view of
the lmam, chose Abu Musa al-Ash'arj as their arbitrator, while Mu'awiyah
nominated 'Amr ibn al-'As to act as arbitrator on behalf of himself and
his army. These two arbitrators came together to the land of Dumat
al-Jandal in the month of Ramadan of the year 38 of the Hijrah to
negotiate.

'Amr ibn al-'As cunningly suggested that they should both reject 'Ali
and Mu'awiyah as caliph so that the Muslims could then vote to choose
anyone they wished as caliph.

Abu Muss accepted the proposal and was asked by 'Amr ibn al-'As to
climb the pulpit and declare the denouncement. He did so. But when 'Amr
ibn al-'As climbed the pulpit, contrary to their agreement, he denounced
'Ali and nominated Mu'awiyah as caliph. Abu Musa rose in anger of 'Amr
ibn al-'As's trickery and began to abuse him. 'Amr ibn al-'As was ready
to retaliate. In this way Mu'awiyah was chosen as caliph.

In Ramadan of the year 40 of the Hijrah, the sword of 'Abd ar-Rahman
ibn Muljam split the Imam's forehead, who died after three days. The
Emigrants Ansar and other Muslims except the people of ash-Sham swore
allegiance to Imam al-Hasan a1-.Mujtaba, but eventually failed to
support him against Mu'awiyah, and showed such weakness that evil
intentions of Mu'awiyah were carried out without any serious
confrontation.

In that year which was named "Am al-Jama'ah" Mu'awiyah sat on the seat
of caliph, and ruled some nineteen years. He died in Rajab of the year
60 and was buried in Damascus.


**Abu Sufyan and Hind**

Controversy over the true identity of Mu'awiyah's father On his
father's side Mu'awiyah is related to four persons.

**az-Zamakhshari**

Mu'awiyah's father was Abu Sufyan, Sakhr ibn Harb ibn Umayyah ibn 'Abd
Shams, and his mother was Hind, daughter of 'Utbah ibn Rabj'ah ibn 'Abd
Shams. Hind's first marriage was with a1- Fakah(7), son of al-Mughayrah
of the Banu Makhzum tribe, who was killed in the district of al-
Ghamisa'(8) After the death of al-Fakah Hind married Hafs, another son
of alMughayrah, who died sometime after. So for the third time she
married Abu Sufyan.(9)

Some historical texts have described her marriages at a greater length,
and said that al-Fakah Hind's first husband, suspected her of adultery.
So he separated from her since he could not tolerate the disgrace.(10)
Other historians believe that Hind had won notoriety in Mecca for
illegitimate acts and adultery.(11)

But concerning Hind's marriage with Abu Sufyan they write that Musafir
ibn 'Amr, who was of the Umayyads, was so deeply in love with Hind that
everyone suspected an affair between them. Hind became pregnant from him
and when people came to notice this Musafir ibn 'Amr fled from Mecca and
went to an-Nu'man ibn al-Mundhir, the well-known Arab king of Hira, to
beg his aid. It was in his absence that Abu Sufyan married Hind.(12)

Hisham ibn Muhammad al-Kalbi, well-known genealogist, in the book of
al-Mathalib and al- Asma'i, famous scholar and man of letters, say:
Mu'awiyah was, in pagan times, related to four persons, namely:

a) 'Am arah ibn al-Walid of the Banu Makhzum
b) Musafir ibn 'Amr of the Umayyads
e) Abu Sufyan of the Umayyads
d) al-'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib of the Banu Hashim.(13)
All these men were each other's friends, and each of them was known to
have had a love affair with Hind!

a) 'Amarah ibn al-Waljd was one of the handsomest men of the Quraysh.
He accompanied 'Amr ibn al-'As in his journey to Abyssinia to bring back
the Muslims who had emigrated to that country and request Negus the king
of Abyssinia to aid them in this task.

Owing to the attachment he showed to the wife of 'Amr ibn al-'As during
this journey, he was involved with the vengeful slyness of her husband,
who took preliminary steps to slander him before Negus and rouse the
King's anger against him. So by the king's order he was given certain
drugs that drove him mad, and he took to the desert to keep the company
of wild beasts.(14)

b) Concerning Musafir ibn 'Amr, al-Kalbi, a great genealogist writes:
During pagan times it was supposed that Mu'awiyah is his son, since
Musafir was more deeply attached to Hind then his rivals. When Hind
became pregnant, Musafir fearing exposure and being regarded as the
begetter of the child, fled to the king of Hira and settled there.

After some time Abu Sufyan traveled to Hira and there he met his old
friend. At this Musafir- had fallen ill owing to his love for and
separation from his beloved. After talking for some time about the
people of Mecca, Abu Sufyan mentioned that after Musafir's flight from
Mecca, he himself had married Hind.

This news was a great shock to Musafir whose condition deteriorated and
he died soon after.(15) A historian considers Musafir a victim of love
in pagan times.(16) az-Zarnakhsharj, the well-known scholar and
commentator, in his book of "Rabi' al-abrar" mentions the four people to
whom Mu'awiyah was related, as follows: Musafir ibn 'Amr, 'Amarah ibn
al-Walid, al-'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-Mu alib, and lastly as-Sabbah, the
minstrel slave of 'Amarah.(17)

az-Zamakhsharj says: Abu Sufyan was short of stature and ugly looking,
whereas as-Sabbah who was his slave, possessed the freshness of youth,
and Hind was attracted to him. Finally she could not conceal her love
for him, and invited him to sleep with her and thus a secret love affair
started between them.

Some historians go even so far as to say that in addition to Mu'awiyah,
'Utbah, the other so-called son of Abu Sufyan, too, was really begotten
by as- Sabbah. They say also that Hind had no inclination to give birth
to this child at her home, so she went out to the desert and gave birth
to him there.

Hassan ibn Thabit a great poet of Islam, before the capture of Mecca
and at a time when a cold war raged between the Muslims and infidels,
composed a poem about this incident, satirizing and criticizing Hind:

"Whose is that child who lies in the corner of that sandy desert of
al-Batha', Mecca? A child, lying on the earth and out of cradle. He is
born by a young and beautiful woman of the Banu Urnayyah tribe!"

Hisham ibn Muhammad al-Kalbi writes as follows in his book of
al-Mathalib: Hind was one of the women who was greatly attracted by
black men, and whenever she gave birth to a black baby, she killed it.
He adds: One day a heavy quarrel took up between Yazid ibn Mu'awiyah and
Ishaq ibn Tabah in the presence of Mu'awiyah and during his caliphate.
Yazid said ironically to Ishaq: "It is to your interest that all the
children of Harb ibn Umayyah should enter heaven", meaning that Ishaq
was an illegitimate son of that house and a bastard, since his mother
had secret relations with the Umayyads.

Ishaq retorted sarcastically: "O Yazid! It is to your interest that all
the children of Banu 'Abbas should go to heaven!"

Yazid did not get the meaning of Ishaq's sharp remark, but his father,
Mu'awiyah, did. So when Ishaq left the gathering, Mu'awiyah said to
Yazid: "Why do you open your mouth to abuse when you do not understand
what they say about you?" Yazid said: "My intention was to show his
defects. "Mu'awiyah said: "He, too, had the same intention about you."
Yazid asked:

"How?" Mu'awiyah said: "Don't you know that some of the Quraysh of
pagan times considered me a son of Banu 'Abbas?" It -was then that Yazid
realized what an insult he had received.

Indeed, Hind's bad reputation was so obvious and certain that on the
day of capture of Mecca the Prophet made some reference to it. When Hind
came to his presence to show allegiance, the Prophet pardoned her, even
though he had declared Hind's blood worthless owing to her great
anti-Islamic crimes, and accepted her allegiance, and showed indulgence
towards her unworthy deeds.(18)

She asked the Prophet: "On what ground should we show allegiance to
you?" The Prophet answered: "On the ground of abstaining from adultery."
Hind said: "Is it possible that a free woman would commit adultery and
thus contaminate herself?" Though the Prophet was aware of her
character, he said nothing and only smiled.(19)(20)


**The Umayyads in pagan times**

Abu Sufyan was one of those who had joined hands to combat the Prophet.
Ibn Hisham As we saw Hind, Mu'awiyah's mother, was regarded as belonging
to the Umayyads. Her father was called 'Utbah and her uncle Shaybah,
both of whom were considered as nobles of the Quraysh in pagan times. At
the advent of Islam, 'Utbah and Shaybah did not abstain from hostility
to the Prophet, and in the battle of Badr they co-operated with other
members of the Quraysh.

It was in the same battle that in the early hours of the day these two
came forward in the battlefield to challenge warriors in the other army,
but their lot was to face the valiant and true warriors of Islam, namely
Imam 'Ali and Hamzah, had to be killed soon after.(21) Abu Sufyan,
Mu'awiyah's father was a stout, well-set and short man, and bore the
name of Hanzalah, like his eldest son, and his nickname was Abu
Hanzalah. He was one those who was killed by Imam 'Ali in the battle of
Badr.(22)

In pagan times Abu Sufyan was considered as a great man of the Quraysh,
and after the battle of Badr in which the Quraysh leaders were killed,
he assumed the position of the sole chief of Mecca and his own tribe.
Thenceforth all the Arab wars and hostilities against Islam were
conducted by him. Jewish and primitive tribes were mobilized against
Islam at his instigation, and the battles of Uhud and al-Khandaq, which
were considered the greatest anti-Islam line ups, were fought under his
leadership.

Muhammad ibn Habib, great historian, has regarded Abu Sufyan as one of
the eight Quraysh atheists.(23) According to Ibn Hisham during the life
of the Prophet, Ab3a Sufyan was one of the leaders of the groups opposed
to the Prophet, and he spared no effort to destroy him.(24) He is also
one of those who seeked to attach himself to Abu Thlib, the great
defender of Islam, seeking. to prevent him from supporting the
Prophet.(25) Moreover, there were some who got together in Dar an-Nudwah
the meeting center of the Quraysh tribe, to discuss the elimination of
the Prophet, and ended by concluding in agreement of collaboration to
carry out this great crime.(26)

Gradually the Quraysh and their chiefs such as Abu Jahl, Abu Sufyan Abu
Lahab and others put such a pressure on the Muslims in Mecca that life
became intolerable for them, and thus the decree was issued by the
Prophet for emigration to Medina. So the hard-pressed and suffering
Muslims departed from their city and land and cut off their ties with
their home, property and relations, and proceeded towards Medina by the
order of God in order to be delivered from the oppressors. Emigration
was continued until with the exception of the Prophet and a few others,
no Muslims remained in Mecca.

In the last few years of their stay, suppression was so tense and
hostile that the Prophet abstained from public propagation in Mecca and
confined his activity to inviting desert dwellers and pilgrims towards
God during the pilgrimage ceremonies only. As during these ceremonies
fighting and dispute were forbidden, and since, owing to the Quraysh's
social prestige, they could not molest the Prophet, they tried to render
his propagation ineffective.

Thus Abu Lahab would walk a few steps behind him and prevent the people
from having contact with the Prophet or listen to his words. He kept on
abusing and accusing him in order to check his mission. At last,
revelation descended ordering the emigration, thus delivering the
Prophet from the clutches of the Quraysh. He left Mecca, to be followed
soon by Imam 'Ali and only a few of the Muslims remained in captivity
and prison in that city. Now Abu Sufyan resorted to a fresh crime by
meanly usurping the houses vacated by the Muslims and putting them up
for sale.

**Abu Sufyan in the battle of Badr**

"Infidels freely offer their property to prevent people from joining
the way of God."

**The Holy Qur'an**

When the Muslims migrated to Medina, they were laxed from the
molestation's of the Quraysh, but they were faced with the deadly
hardship of poverty and indigence, for, the emigrants had left behind
all their property, houses and relatives and had taken refuge in the
city of Islam that is Medina.

Of course, the people of Medina, named Ansar (helpers), so far as they
were able, assisted these emigrants, but the people of those days were
not so well off as to provide themselves with a comfortable life,
especially as a group of them had no dwellings or financial means to
support themselves. Nevertheless, despite these shortcomings and
deficiencies the number of the followers of Islam increased every day,
and gradually they were able to present themselves as a new force in the
Arabian Peninsula, and show their strength.

In the second year of the Hijrah an event took place which produced the
first great battle of Islamic era. For many long years the Quraysh had
been engaged in trade travels and transport of goods to foreign lands,
and every year they regularly visited Yemen and once a year they took
their merchandise to ash-Sham. In the second year of the Hijrah, as
usual a big caravan headed by Abu Sufyan, father of Mu'awiyah, had left
for ash-Sham. On their return, the Prophet and a group of three hundred
confronted the caravan demanding the lost property of the Muslims in
Mecca.

When Abu Sufyan heard the news, he asked Mecca for help, and then tried
to choose another route to return. To help Abu Sufyan, the Quraysh
summoned a force of one thousand soldiers to fight the Prophet's army
who were small in number. Thus, started the battle of Badr, in an area
called the same. Occult aid and the self-sacrifice of Islamic warriors
brought them victory, while the other side lost seventy men and another
seventy were taken captive.

Of the sons of Abd Shams of the Umayyads eight men were killed in this
battle among them were Hanzalah Abu Sufyan's son, 'Utbah and Rabi'ah,
father and uncle of his wife Hind, and al- Walid ibn 'Utbah, uncle of
Mu'awiyah. Six members of the Hulafa' and their confederates, too, lost
their lives. Among the captives, too, were seven of the Umayyads
including 'Amr, another son of Abu Sufyan.(27) In retaliation for his
son's captivity, Ab]a Sufyan without any feasible excuse seized one of
the great men of Ansar who was on his way to Mecca for pilgrimage, and
imprisoned him, whereas before this battle, the Quraysh never molested a
pilgrim.

Consequently the Muslims were compelled to set their POW's free.(28)
After the battle of Badr in which the first-rank leaders of the Quraysh
lost their lives Abu Sufyan was able to seize the position of the
absolute master of Mecca and the leadership of the Quraysh in war and
peace. It was at this time that he vowed not to wash his head until he
took revenge from the Prophet.

After some time, Abu Sufyan, in order to fulfil his indecent vow,
proceeded to Medina accompanied by two hundred Quraysh horsemen and
stayed with the Jewish tribe of Banu an- Nadir. Then he began to make
inquiries about the city's conditions, and sent a number of his men to
set fire to the date palms of the people. These raiders, after carrying
out their mission, killed two innocent men of the city who were near by,
and then they all returned to Mecca.(29) Hind, mother of Mu'awiyah, was
greatly enraged after the battle of Badr for the death of her father and
uncle and other relatives of hers, and spent her time mourning for them,
and did her worst to rouse the Quraysh to avenge their blood.(30)

After the battle of Badr and the death of seventy men and captivity of
another seventy the Quraysh who were greatly distressed at the outcome
of that battle, earmarked their enormous trade profits of ash-Sham and
the goods carried by one thousand camels and valued at fifty thousand
dinars(31) to a fresh war with the Muslims. It was then that the
following verse of the Qur'an descended and reproached the infidels in a
sharp tone:

"Surely those who disbelieve spend their wealth to hinder people from
the way of Allah; so they shall spend it, then it shall be to them an
intense regret, then they shall be overcome; and those who disbelieve
shall be driven together to hell."(32)

**Abu Sufyan in the battle of Uhud**

We possess such a god as the al- 'Uzza idol, whereas you have no al-
'Uzza.

**Abu Sufyan**

Following the offensive raids of Abu Sufyan and the decision of the
Quraysh traders to supply money, for the war the infidels prepared
themselves for a war with the Prophet. Abu Sufyan held the command of
this army and took with him his wife and a number of Quraysh women.
Along the way between Mecca and Medina wherever Hind came across Wahshi
the slave of Jubayr ibn Mat'ani, she cried .out: "O Wahshi! Take my
revenge from the Prophet and heal my wounds if you wish to be set
free!"

In this way Abu Sufyan and Hind, parents of Mu'awiyah, started the
bloody and longed-for battle of Uhud, causing the bloodshed of many true
and striving devotees of Islam. On the day of the battle, Abu Sufyan
addressed the Quraysh banner-bearers who were of the Banu 'Abd ad- Dar,
and said: "O sons of 'Abd ad-Dar! In the battle of Badr you carried our
banners of war and we suffered so many disasters and calamities.

The matter of the military banner is so important that it leads either
to victory or defeat. Therefore, either protect the banner or abandon it
so that we ourselves may undertake this task."(33) They responded: "Do
you expect us to hand over the banner to you? This is impossible. When
the fire of the combat is aflame tomorrow, you will witness our courage
and self-sacrifice!"

This was what Abu Sufyan heartily desired, namely the defeat of Islam
and annihilation of the Prophet. The following day when the sun came up,
the two armies fell upon each other. Hind and other women, who had come
to encourage their men, emerged from their tents, and while they beat
their tambourine they chanted slogans to encourage their soldiers.

Hind started singing the following words:

"Forward, 0 sons of 'Abd ad-Dar!
Endeavour 0 protectors and vanguards of the army!
Deal blows with your sharp swords!

We girls are morning stars!
If you advance victoriously,
We open our arms to you and spread beds for you!
But if you turn your back to the combat
And submit to defeat,
We, too, turn our backs to you!
Then you will suffer such a separation

In which you will see no sign of love and loyalty."(34) During the
battle one of the Ansar fighters noticed Hind inciting the infidel army
to fight. So he attacked her with his drawn sword, but when he was about
to deal the blow, he realized that she was not a warrior, but a woman.
So he abstained from killing her and returned in chivalry. As we said,
this battle was a heavy blow for the newly founded Islam in which about
seventy of the best and devoutest sons of Islam lost their lives. One of
the most distinguished martyrs of this battle, who was killed through.
the efforts of Abu Sufyan and Hind was Hamzah, the noble uncle of the
Prophet, whose killer was Wahshi the slave of Jubayr ibn Mat'am.

The combat ended and the dead lay down in the battlefield covered with
blood. But the beastly spirit of savagery would not leave alone these
godless people of Mecca, and Hind leading a number of women entered the
field, each carrying a knife or other, and each looked for a dead
warrior to cut off his ear, nose or other parts of his body. The number
of the severed parts of the Muslims was so great that Hind was able to
make a necklace and bracelet of them for herself, and in return for
Wahshi's service in killing Hamzah, she offered her own gold ornaments.
Then she searched for the body of Hamzah, and tore open the side of that
lion of God, and cruelly pulling out his liver, took it to her mouth to
eat, but failing in it, she threw it down.(35) The nickname of
"Liver-eating Hind" had its origin in this savage and vengeful act. Then
she climbed on a rock and loudly sang the following lines: "We made
square for the battle of Badr!

War after war kindles a fire, I was never tranquil at 'Utbah 's
death,
Nor for my brother and his uncle Shaybah,
Nor for my son Hanzalah.
Now I have remedied the pain of my heart
And have fulfilled my vow.
Wahshi brought tranquility to my burning breast
And I shall ever be grateful to Wahshi
Until my bones decay in the grave and turn into dust."
A woman of Banu Hashim, named Hind, too daughter of Athathah ibn 'Ibad
ibn al-Mullalib
composed the following lines in response to Hind, wife of Abu Sufyan:
"In both the battle of Badr and the next one,
You were sunk in the cesspool of meanness!
O offspring of vilenesses and great infidelities!
May God bring you a day when you will face
The strong arms of Banu Hashim and their sharp swords.
Hamnzah was our courageous lion,
And 'Ali is our sharp-clawed hawk.
When your father and uncle intended to kill us,
Their throats were covered with blood!
What a wicked vow was that evil vow of yours!"
After the battle of Uhud Hulays who was the chief of an ally tribe of
the Quraysh, saw Abu
Sufyan in the battlefield standing over the dead body of Hamzah and
toying its face with the end of his spear saying: "Now taste the
bitterness of death for breaking your bond of kinship!" By this remark
he meant that Hamzah, by embracing Islam, had abandoned the Quraysh and
had risen to fight them. When Hulays(36) observed this mean act of Abu
Sufyan, he cried out: "O men of Kananah tribes! Look at this chief of
the Quraysh! See what he is doing with the lifeless body of the son of
his uncle spread on the earth!"(37)

Abu Sufyan answered: "Woe upon you! Don't say a word about what you saw
me doing! It was a mistake." Then he stood on the hillside and cried,
out loudly: "How well we have done! War always has two sides. Today as a
response to the battle of Badr!" Then he said: "High and exalted be the
idol Hubal!"(38) The Prophet ordered to respond him: "God is greater and
higher." Against this Godly words of the Muslims, Abu Sufyan shouted:
"We possess such a god as the al-'Uzza idol, whereas you have no
al-'Uzza!"

The Prophet ordered to give him this answer: "Great God, Allah, is our
Lord and Master, but you have no such lord!" Abu Sufyan walked off while
exclaiming: "Our next meeting by the wells of Badr, next year!" The
Prophet ordered one of his friends to answer: "Yes, Allah's army will
meet you then and there.."

Abu Sufyan together with the Quraysh army left the battle-scene. But
after a few days marching towards Mecca and thinking over the
comparatively weak position of the army and the Muslims he decided to
return and destroy the half-vanquished Muslims. But when he heard that
the Prophet had left the city with a number of Muslim warriors and was
ready to fight, he and his supporters were overcome with fear, and were
thus compelled to return to Mecca.
