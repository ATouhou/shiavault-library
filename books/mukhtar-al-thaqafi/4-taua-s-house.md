Taua's House
============

The spies found Muslim bin Aqeel in a house that belonged to a good old
woman called Taua.

Ubaidullah bin Ziyad sent the police to arrest Muslim bin Aqeel. When
the police asked him to surrender, he refused and began fighting alone.

Muslim bin Aqeel was badly wounded. The police promised to treat him
kindly. So, he handed over his sword. The police arrested him and took
him to the prince's palace.

Ubaidullah bin Ziyad was full of spite. He hated the Ahlul Bayt and
their supporters. So, he ordered his guard to kill Muslim bin Aqeel.
Besides he ordered them to kill one of his companions. The companion's
name was Hani bin Urwa. He was a leader in Kufa.

Ubaidullah bin Ziyad ordered his guards to throw Muslim bin Aqeel and
his companion down the palace.

Ubaidullah bin Ziyad began killing and imprisoning the people in Kufa
for any accusation. So, the people there were afraid.
