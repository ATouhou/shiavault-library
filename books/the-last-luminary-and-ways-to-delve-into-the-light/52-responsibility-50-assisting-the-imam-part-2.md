Responsibility 50: Assisting the Imam Part 2
============================================

In order to help Imam al-Zaman (ajtf) during his advent, we must have a
strong spiritual heart and be firm in our beliefs entering absolutely no
doubts or confusion in regards to him (and things related to him). In
this regards, Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad as-Sadiq (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ لَكُمْ ثَوَابَ مَنِ اسْتُشْهِدَ مَعَهُ بِنِيَّاتِكُمْ وَ إِنْ
مُتُّمْ عَلى فَرْشِكُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Indeed for you is a promised reward equivalent to becoming a martyr
with him (the Imam) which results from your intention - even if you die
on your beds.”[^1]

In another tradition from Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad as-Sadiq (as) it is
stated:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنِّي لاَ أُخْرِجُ نَفْسِي مِنْ شُهَدَاءِ الطُّفُوفِ وَ لاَ أَعُدُّ
ُثَوَابِي أَقَلَّ مِنْهُمْ لِأَنَّ مِنْ نِيَّتِـي النُّصْرَةَ لَوْ
شَهِدْتُ ذٌلِكَ الْيَوْمَ وَ كَذٌلِكَ شِيعَتُنَا هُمُ الشُّهَدَاءُ وَ
إِنْ مَاتُوا عَلـى فَرْشِهِمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“I do not think of myself as being out of the ranks of the martyrs of
al-Tufuf (Karbala), nor do I count myself as having a lesser reward than
them because it is from my intention to help if I had witnessed that
day. This is also the case with our Shi’a they too are martyrs even if
they die on their beds.”[^2]
