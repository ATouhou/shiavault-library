The Kufians Letters
===================

   
 While still in Mecca, al-Husayn (‘a) received the letters sent to him
by the people of Kufa. Some letters were written by single individuals,
others contained two, three, or four signatures, all requesting him to
go there because they did not have an Imam. They wrote saying that they
never prayed congregational or Friday prayers with al-Nu’man.

Many letters were delivered to him, so much so that he received a total
of as many as twelve thousand letters. He did not answer any of them.
The last letter he received was sent by Shabath Ibn Rab’i, Hijar Ibn
Abjar, Yazid Ibn al-Harith, ‘Izrah Ibn Qays, ‘Amr Ibn al-Hajjaj, and
Muhammad Ibn ‘Omayr Ibn ‘Utarid. The latter's letter stated the
following:

“The people are waiting for you. They accept no views other than yours;
so, hurry, O son of the Messenger of Allah, for the grass is green, the
fruits are ripe, and the trees are full of leaves. Come, if you will,
for you will be coming to hosts already recruited for you.”[^1]

As many as the seeds were the letters he did receive:

Saying: Come to Iraq, to those who connive and deceive;

Caliphate has neither guardian nor anyone worthy of it,

While you are the best of those who deserve it.

So he came with hardened men like lions,

Like the leopards in their forests,

Mounted were those whose faces were

Like the moons shining, glorious, virtuous.

He crossed the sierra, reaching al-*Taff* and

In their courtyards he did settle.

The horse stopped, so he said: Karbala’ is this,

Why did not your eyes avoid it at all?

Alight, for its flanks

Are cut only for our graves.

Descending, mending his sword

To cut the helmets on their heads,

As he looked around, he saw the flags

Of betrayal, of treachery.

Never for a moment did I believe it could or it might

A shining moon would in the desert be so bright,

And the sons of the blue woman would in its light

And in its halo receive the night.[^2]
