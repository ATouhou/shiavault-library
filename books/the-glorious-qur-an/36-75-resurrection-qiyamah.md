75: Resurrection (qiyamah)
==========================

This splendid chapter of 40 very early Meccan verses was revealed after
The Stunning [Blow] 101 and before The Gossipmonger 104. It tells us how
we should read the Qur'an (I) and describes man's stages as he is
reproduced or created (II), just as his spiritual stages are suggested
at the very beginning (I).

The last section moves very graphically.
