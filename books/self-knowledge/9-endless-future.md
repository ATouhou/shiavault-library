Endless future
==============

Every person lives in this universe for a limited time. Death is the
unquestionable end for this life. Nothing can save men from death:
***“Wherever you are, death will overtake you, though you are in lofty
towers.”*** (4:78)

After Barzakh those who enter heaven will be there forever: ***“Those
who are in awe of the Beneficent God in secret and come with a penitent
heart: Enter it in peace, that is the day of abiding”*** (50:33,34)

Those people who enter bell are of two kinds. Disbeliveers who are
against the truth will stay there forever. But those believers who will
enter hell for their bad deeds will finally enter heaven after they will
have been cleansed.

***“So as to those who are unhappy, they shall be in the fire; for them
shall be sighing and groaning in it, abiding therein so long as the
heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord please; surely your
Lord is the mighty doer of what He intends. And as to those who are made
happy, they shall be in the garden, abiding in it as long as the heavens
and the earth endure, except as your Lord please; which shall never be
cut off “(11:106-108)***

***“And (as to) those who disbelieve, their guardians are Shaytans who
take them out of the light into the darkness; they are the inmates of
the fire, in it they shall abide.” (2:257)***
