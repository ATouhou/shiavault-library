Allah - The Praise-Worthy
=========================

As we know, it is necessary to recite two surahs from the Holy Qur'an
during prayers. The name of the first such surah, is 'al-Hamd' or
'al-Fateha' and it reads as follows:

***Bismilla hir Rahmanir Rahim***

***Al hamdu lil lahi Rabbil Alamin. Ar Rahmanir Rahim.***

***Maliki yawmid Din. lyyaka na'budu wa iyyaka nasta'in.***

***Ihdinas Siratal mustaqim. Siratal ladhina an'amta 'alaihim***

***Ghairil maghdhubi 'alaihim waladh Dhaalin.***

The following is the meaning of the above surah:

***In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.***

***Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. The Beneficent, the
Merciful. Master of the Day of Judgement. You alone we worship, and You
alone we ask for help. Guide us on the right path - the path of those
whom You have favoured; not (the path) of those who earned Your wrath;
nor of those gone astray.***

After reciting this surah in our prayers, we must also recite another
surah. The other surah usually recited by people is surah 'al-Tawheed'
which is also called surah 'al-Ikhlas'.

Surah 'al-Hamd' tells us that all blessings are granted by Allah who has
created everything. We must praise (thank) Him. The reward and
punishment of the people is in His hands. We worship only Allah and ask
only Him to guide us to the right path.

Surah 'al-Hamd' being an essential part of prayers, we should try to
learn it by heart.
