The Author’s Foreword
=====================

Al-Sahib al-Jalil Isma’il ibn Abbad - May God be pleased with him - has
respectfully expressed greetings for Al-Reza (s) and said,

O you who intend to go and visit Toos,  
land of purity and sanctification,  
Recite my greetings to Al-Reza and stop by  
the most honorable grave of the best buried one.  
By God! By God! This is an oath, which is issued  
from a sincere one who is clinging to friendship!  
Verily, if I possessed my own need,  
I would reside at Toos, the inhabited.  
Verily, it is the place of the martyr wrapped in  
righteousness, famous for exaltedness and praise.  
O son of the Prophet through whom God broke  
the backs of the arrogant tyrants!  
O son of the Testamentary Trustee[[7]](footnotes.htm#b007) who was the
most  
meritorious of powerful men, attained perfect pride and  
naturally accompanied glory!  
In another short poem he has also said,  
O visitor who got up early, ran,  
and walked like lightning when it flashes,  
Recite my greetings to my master Al-Reza,  
Who is at Toos,  
The grandson of the chosen Prophet,  
son of al-Morteza, the Testamentary Trustee,  
Who attained firm exaltedness and built white glory!  
Say to him: (These greetings) are from a loyal one  
who regards friendship as obligatory!
