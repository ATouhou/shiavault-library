God answered the prayers of Jesus Christ
========================================

After Jesus made the above mentioned prayer he was answered by God
according to Hebrews 5:7***“Who in the days of his flesh, when he had
offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto
him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he
feared.”***

These words clearly show when Jesus was praying strongly to God, God
granted him his request. The words***“heard in that he feared”***
(Hebrews 5:7) mean that God granted him what he requested. So the above
verse shows when Jesus asked of God to***“let this cup pass from”***
(Matthew 26:39) him, God responded to his prayer and saved him from
death or crucifixion.
