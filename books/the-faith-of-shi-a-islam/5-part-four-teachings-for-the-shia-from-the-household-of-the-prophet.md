Part Four: Teachings For the Shia From the Household of the Prophet
===================================================================

**Introduction
**
The Imams of the Household knew that power would not return to them in
their own lifetimes, and that the Shi'a would remain under the rule of
others, and that they would be obliged to use force and violence to
struggle against this rule.

At the same time, it was natural for them to conceal their religion and
the way that they followed, as long as taqiyyah did not cause bloodshed
and did not bring harm to others or to Islam; thus they endeavoured to
stay in this sea of troubles, treachery, hatred and vengeance against
the Household.

It was necessary, because of this, for the Imams to devote their time
to teaching their followers the fundamentals of the Islamicshari'ah in a
special way, and to guide them in correct social behaviour so that they
might become examples of perfect, just Muslims.

The way of the Household as regards teaching cannot be explained in
this short book, and the famous books ofahadith can be consulted for
examples of their teachings on religious education. However, it is not a
bad idea to indicate here some of these teachings which can be gathered
together under the general heading of their doctrines concerning the
teaching of their followers. These concern their moral teachings dealing
with social behaviour and those things which may bring their followers
closer to Allah, how to cleanse the heart from unclean things, and how
to be honest. We have already mentioned, in the discussion oftaqiyyah,
some of the things about useful social behaviour, and in the following
pages we shall mention some further important matters.

**34. The Doctrine Concerning du'a'
**
The Prophet said:

Du'a' is a weapon for the believer, a pillar of din, and a light of the
heaven and the earth.

and here is truth. It became one of the peculiarities of the Shi'a by
which they are distinguished. They have written many books mentioning
its importance, and the correct way of performing these supplications,
and from thesead'iyah (pl. ofdu'a') which have been transmitted from the
Household, hundreds of books, large and small, have been written,
wherein are stored the aims of the Prophet and his Household, urging
their followers and encouraging them to recitedu'a'. From them have been
transmitted:

The best worship isdu'a'.
The most beloved action in the view of Allah on earth isdu'a'.
Du'a' can remove calamities and retribution (which would otherwise have
been ordained by Divine decree).
Du'a' is the cure for every sickness.

The first Imam, Amir al-Mu'minin 'Ali (A.S.), was much given todu'a',
and this is clear because he was the leader in monotheism (Sayyid
al-muwahhiddi) and the Chief among believers (Imam al-alihiyyin) and
hisad'iyah and sermons are masterpieces of Arabic eloquence: for
instance, thedu'a' of Kumayl ibn Ziyad al-Mashhur. And they contain
enough Divine and religious education to enable one to tread the right
path to being a perfect Muslim.

In fact, thead'iyah which are transmitted from the Prophet and his
Household are the best guidance for a Muslim. When he thinks deeply
about them, they will stimulate in him strength of faith and belief and
the spirit of sacrifice in the path of Allah, and will reveal to him the
mystery of worship, and the sweetness of praying to Allah and abandoning
everything but Him. They will teach him what is incumbent on a human
being to know about his religion, and what will bring him close to
Allah, and take him far from corruption, his desires and false
innovations. In short, in thesead'iyah have been stored the summary of
education as regards morality, training of the soul and Islamic beliefs;
but they are, at the same time, the most important source of
philosophical ideas for investigating theology and for the study of
ethics.

If people could follow the guidance contained in the elevated meanings
of thesead'iyah - but, alas, they will not be able to do so - no trace
of the corruption which fills the earth would be found, and those souls
which are bound by their sins could go to the Heaven of Truth freely.
But it is a near impossibility to pay attention to these reformers who
have called humanity to the way of Truth. So the word of Allah has
revealed to mankind:

Most surely (man's) soul is wont to command (him to do) evil. (11;53)

And most men will not believe though you desire it eagerly. (11;103)

The source of badness in man is self-deception and an ignorance of his
faults caused by denying their existence, thus making them seem good. So
he oppresses others, seizes their property, lies, flatters, obeys his
own desires, and then deceives himself that he is not really obeying his
desires, but that these things need to be done, so as to make his sins
seem very insignificant. The following transmitteddu'a', which takes its
strength from Divine revelation, influences man to withdraw himself and
to be alone with Allah, and shows him how to confess his sins and to
understand that he is an evil-doer, and that he must devote his time to
asking forgiveness from Allah, and reminding himself of his
self-deception. Thus the reciter supplicates Allah from thedu'a' of
Kumayl ibn Ziyad:

Would that I knew my Lord, my Master! How canst Thou bring down Fire on
faces who fall d own in prostration to Thy Greatness, or on tongues who
speak sincerely of Thy Unity and- thank Thee with their praises, or on
hearts who attest to Thy Divinity with certainty, or on minds who have
acquired knowledge of Thee to such an extent that they are humbled, or
on limbs who have travelled afar to worship Thee obediently and to show
their repentance through their submission to Thy Will. We cannot imagine
that Thou wilt deal with us thus; this is not what we have been taught
of Thy Generosity.

Repeat the recitation of this passage and reflect on the delicateness
of the remonstrance, its eloquence and the enchantment of its
exposition.

At the same time as it inspires the soul to confess its short-comings
and its servitude, it also instructs it not to despair of the Mercy and
Kindness of Allah. Then it speaks to the soul in a clever and subtle
manner, and instructs it in its highest duties, and makes incumbent upon
it the thorough performance of these duties. It teaches the soul how
man, through the performance of these duties, may deserve the granting
of forgiveness by Allah, and this is what causes man to listen to his
soul and to do what is necessary for him to do, when formerly he was not
carrying out his obligations. Then follows another style of remonstrance
from the samedu'a':

Answer me, O my God, my Master and my Lord!
I may endure Thy punishment, but how can I endure separation from
Thee?
O, answer me, my Lord!
I may endure the heat of Hell, but how can I endure not to look upon
Thy Munificence?

This is instruction for the soul in the necessity of taking pleasure in
the nearness of Allah, and observing His Kindness and His Power, and
loving and desiring what He possesses. Taking pleasure in nearness to
Him may reach such a degree that to be without it is worse for the soul
than punishment and the heat of Hell. It may be that man can endure the
fire of Hell, but he cannot endure to be abandoned. As these passages
lead us to understand, love and taking pleasure in closeness to Allah is
the best intercession for a guilty person, that Allah may forgive and
pardon him. The delicateness of this kind of wonder and adulation of
Allah Who accepts repentance and forgives sin will not remain unheard.

It would not be a bad thing to end this exposition with a shortdu'a'
which lists the highest virtues, and also tells us what is necessary in
order that every part and category of humanity may be endowed with the
best qualities.

O Lord! Give us steadfastness in obedience and keep us far from sin,
give us sincerity in intention, and knowledge of that which is
sacred;
bestow on us guidance and constancy,
seal our tongues with reason and wisdom,
fill our hearts with knowledge and learning,
keep us clean within from what is forbidden and
from those things of which we are uncertain,
keep our hands from oppression and stealing,
hide from our eyes immorality and treachery,
and close our ears to foolish talk and calumny.

Bestow on our'ulama' freedom from concupiscence
and the ability to give good counsel;
on our scholars, application and desire for their studies;
and on those who listen to them, obedience to their spiritual advice.
And on those Muslims who are sick, bestow comfort and cure;
and on our dead, compassion and mercy.

And on our aged, dignity and calm,
on our youth acceptance and the true faith and repentance.
And on women, modesty and chastity,
on the rich, humility and generosity,
and on the poor, patience and contentedness.
And on the fighters for Islam, victory and triumph,
on those who are prisoners of the enemy,
freedom and peace.
And on the rulers, justice and kindness,
and on the people they rule, fairness and good behaviour.
And help the pilgrims to Mecca and the Holy Shrines to be
charitable with their provisions
and their wealth, and help them to perform
what is proscribed for thehajj and the'umrah.
Grant this through Thy Overflowing Generosity and Thy Mercy,
O Merciful and Compassionate!

I recommend you, my brothers, the readers, not to miss the opportunity
of reciting thesead'iyah, paying attention to their meaning and their
purpose, and through presence of mind drawing near and listening to
Allah with humility, reading them as if they are speaking of oneself,
and following the rites that are proscribed with them by the Household
of the Prophet; because reading them mindlessly, merely mouthing the
words, will not increase man's knowledge, or cause him to draw near to
Allah, none of his troubles will be resolved, and hisdu'a' will not be
accepted.

Allah does not acceptdu'a' from a darkened heart, so when you recite
adu'a', draw near with your heart and do not doubt that it will be
accepted.
