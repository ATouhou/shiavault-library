30: the [east] Romans (room)
============================

This chapter was revealed after Splitting Open 84 and before the
previous chapter on The Spider 29. It Consists of six sections with 60
verses in all; 59 are Meccan. while one, V. 17 dates from Madina. The
term Ar-Rum refers to Europe in its imperialistic phase, even recently
in North Africa.

A clear consciousness of history is displayed here, as it was in the
previous chapter: the reference is to the current wars then being waged
between the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire and the Persian Empire in
the days of the Prophet.

The chapter also has some lyric passages on the glory of God (II) and
His signs (III). Marriage is discussed and also differences in speech
and race. Associates or partners must always be watched carefully we are
warned (IV).
