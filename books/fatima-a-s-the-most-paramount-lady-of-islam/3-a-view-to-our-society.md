A view to our society:
======================

We are living in a strange age and society; an age, having no similarity
with the other ones. The values and principles are mostly exposed to
doubt and question. There exists an excess of ignorance and sOmmetimes
aimlessness.

The samples are various and misleading. The occasions for manâ€™s leading
are rare; and, therefore; man in choosing the right (way) from the
various ones is irresolute.

Some persons do not yet know to be Eastern or Western, material or
spiritual, realist or idealist. Even some of our women do not yet know
to be the mothers of their children or the manageresses of offices,
responsible for educating their children or responsible for typing the
letters.

The theory of democracy and independence is set forth in discussions,
but their extends and dimensions are not well known. The borderlines
have not been specified, the side-takings are ambiguous, the ways are
paved with doubt, and the thoughts are not right and well-studied.

One-sidedness is raging, as if we have just learned to discern one side
of the premises and take not the other sides into consideration.
Besides, our problem is to consider just today while the life is not
irrelevant to yesterday and tomorrow.
