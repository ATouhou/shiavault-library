Lesson One Hundred Twenty Seven: Divine Chastisement
====================================================

Imam Al-Baqir (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ لِلّهِ عُقُوباتٌ فِى الْقُلُوبِ وَ الأَبْدان: ضَنْكٌ فِى
الْمَعيشَةِ وَ وَهْنٌ فِى الْعِبادَةِ وَ ما ضُرِبَ عَبْدٌ بِعُقُوبَة
أَعْظَمُ مِنْ قَسْوَةِ الْقَلْبِ!
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

God chastises man (for sins and disobedience) through the spirit and the
body: indigence in livelihood, indolence in worship, but God has not
punished any servant with something worse than hardheartedness.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Divine chastisements are indeed reflections of man’s actions as well as
the consequences of his sins. Sometimes they appear as an unpleasant
situation in material life and sometimes in spiritual matters such as
the lack of enthusiasm for worship and invocation to God. But the worst
punishment meted out is that of making a person hard-hearted. The heart
becomes devoid of humanitarian feelings, philanthropy and sympathy, and
leads to perpetration of cruelty and many other sins.
