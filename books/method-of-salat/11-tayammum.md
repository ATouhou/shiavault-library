( Tayammum )
============

If we can not find water, or there is very little time left to perform
Wudhu, or we arc sick and can not use water, then instead of Wudhu, we
must perform Tayammum. This is done on those things that we are allowed
to use for it, such as dirt or a rock.

##### In Tayammum, there are four things that are compulsory:

3. The palms of both hands must be rubbed on the forehead, and in both
directions where the hair of the head grows until the bottom of the
eyebrows and the tip of the nose.
