أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي
الْأَرْضِ مَا يَكُونُ مِن نَّجْوَى ثَلاًثَةٍ إلاَّ هُوَ رَابِعُهُمْ
وَلاَ خَمْسَةٍ إِلاَّ هُوَ سَادِسُهُمْ وَلاَ أَدْنَى مِن ذَلِكَ وَلاَ
أَكْثَرَ إِلاَّ هُوَ مَعَهُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كَانُوا ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم
بِمَا عَمِلُوا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ

“Do you not see that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and
whatever is in the earth? Nowhere is there a secret counsel between
three persons but He is the fourth of them, nor (between) five but He is
the sixth of them, nor less than that nor more but He is with them where
ever they are; then He will inform them of what they did on the day of
resurrection: surely Allah is Aware of all things.”

al-Qur’an · Surah Mujadilah · Ayah 7

**Rules Related to Speaking
Men Speaking to Non-Mahram Women**

172 – Rule: Men are allowed to speak to non-Mahram women as long as the
following two conditions are met:

1. It is not with the intention of lust.

2. The speaking does not lead either one of them to commit a sin.
BGKLMS

173 – Rule: It is Makruh to speak to non-Mahram women, unless it is in
the case of a necessity, especially if the one being spoken to is a
young woman. GKLM

174 – Rule: If a man knows that by speaking to a non-Mahram woman, he
will fall into sin, then he must not speak to her; whether the woman
speaks in such a way that she lures him into sin, or the topic is such
that the man falls into sin. BGKLMS

175 – Rule: It is haram for a man to speak to a non-Mahram woman with
the intention of making her fall into sin. ABGKS

Therefore: The conversations that are carried out with the intention of
making others fall into sin (lustful conversations), such as explaining
or describing sexual acts and scenes, are haram.

176 – Question: Is it allowed for a man to talk to a non-Mahram woman
who wants to speak to him in a lustful manner? (In the event that the
man knows that he will not fall into a sin?)

Answer: It is not allowed. GK

Answer: In the event that it helps or leads to a haram act, it must be
avoided. B

177 – Rule: If a man fears that by speaking to a non-Mahram woman, she
will make him fall into sin, then he must not speak to her. GKLM

178 – Rule: If a man knows that by speaking to a non-Mahram woman he
will fall into sin other than that of a sexual nature, then it is not
allowed for him to speak to her. BGKLMS

Therefore: If a man knows that by talking to a non-Mahram woman, he
will be compelled to lie, backbite, or put a false accusation on
somebody - whether she makes him fall into sin, or he himself by means
of talking to her falls into a sin, then it is not allowed to talk to
her.

179 – Question: If one fears that by talking to a certain non-Mahram
woman he will fall into sin, then is it allowed for him to talk to
her?

Answer: It is not allowed. G

180 – Question: What is the ruling for a man to talk in such a way in
that he imitates a woman’s voice, or vice versa?

Answer: It is not a problem if: it is not the voice of a specific woman
whom he knows and this causes her degradation or dishonor; and this
action of imitation does not stimulate him and it is not something vain
and futile, and the same applies the other way around (a woman imitating
the voice of a man). G

181 – Rule: It is not allowed to talk to someone about anything that is
related to sexual or intimate issues (except one’s spouse). AGKLMS

Note and warning: Sometimes, it can be seen that in the hearts of men,
the devil has become so firm that many of their social gatherings are
doubtful, and it can be seen that a man has more interest in mingling
with non-Mahram women than with his own Maharim. For example, there is a
situation in which he can ask something from a man, but instead, he asks
a non-Mahram woman; sometimes his conversation with non-Mahram women is
prolonged so as to be able to talk with them more; going to places of
amusement and on vacations with non-Mahram women is more attracting to
him; if there is a place where there are non-Mahram women, he desires to
be there more than other places; and when guests come over, he tries to
talk and socialize more with the non-Mahram women than the men. He likes
to stay in the presence of non-Mahram women more so than anywhere else.
In summary, he likes any action that non-Mahram women are participating
in more than any other work.

Men - especially our dear youth must stay away from these types of
things because this kind of socializing and speaking (with members of
the opposite sex) are usually associated with the intention of lust and
obtaining (sexual) pleasure and can lead to being haram, according to
Islam.


**Women Talking to Non-Mahram Men
**
182 – Rule: Women are permitted to speak to non-Mahram men if the
following conditions are met:

1. The speaking is not done with the intention of lust and seeking
(sexual) pleasure.
2. The woman does not make her voice soft and attractive.
3. There is no fear of falling into corruption. GKLMS

183 – Rule: It is Makruh for women to speak to men if it is not
necessary. GKLM

184 – Rule: It is not allowed for a woman to speak to a non-Mahram man
with the intention of making him fall into sin; whether she specifies
that the reason she is talking to him is to make him fall into sin, or
she talks about something that would make the non-Mahram man fall into a
sin - such as explaining stimulating and sensual scenes, or explaining
about things that would make the non-Mahram man become aroused upon
hearing them. ABGKLMS

Note: Just as was mentioned concerning men, sometimes it is possible
that women also become under the influence and tricks of the devil.
Thus, sometimes a woman will be so friendly to a non-Mahram man as if it
is her brother. Especially those women who are in more contact with
non-Mahram men more than others, such as nurses, or those women who
works in various businesses and companies, in sports and fitness clubs,
etc… must be extra cautious (when dealing with non-Mahram men).

Asking help from non-Mahram men for things that are not necessary;
asking non-Mahram men questions while it is possible to ask a Mahram the
same question; having discussions with men and putting one’s self
between a discussion; exposing one’s talents or virtues to a non-Mahram
and socializing with non-Mahram men more; having more of an affection to
work in an environment in which there are non-Mahram men – in summary,
all examples such as these in which there is a probability of falling
into sin, and interactions in such places which are commonly done with
the intention of deriving (sexual) pleasure, can lead to being be haram,
according to the Laws of Islam.

185 – Rule: When a woman is speaking to a man, she must not make her
voice pleasing and soft, such that if the person with whom she is
talking to has a sickness in his heart, he will become attracted to her,
even if she is talking to him about a general matter. AGKLMS

186 – Question: Is a woman allowed to speak to a non-Mahram man who
wants to talk with her in a lustful manner? (In the event that the woman
knows that she will not fall into sin?)

Answer: It is not allowed. G

187 – Question: Is it allowed for women to recite in a chorus in the
presence of non-Mahram men? What is the ruling for non-Mahram men to
hear such a thing?

Answer: If it leads to corruption, then it is not allowed. Rather,
normally, when women are singing or reciting in the presence of men and
men are listening to it, this leads to corruption and thus, it is not
allowed. B

Answer: As long as there is no intention of lust or corruption
involved, then women singing in a chorus and non-Mahram men listening to
them, is not a problem. L

188 – Question: Is it allowed for a man to listen to a woman singing
alone, if it does not lead to (sexual) excitement?

Answer: It is not allowed. L

Answer: If it leads to corruption, then it is not allowed. Rather,
normally, when women are singing or reciting in the presence of men and
men are listening to it, this leads to corruption, and thus, it is not
allowed. B

189 – Question: What is the ruling on listening to poems (read) with
emotion and feeling that the radio stations of the Islamic Republic of
Iran broadcast?

Answer: If it leads to corruption, then it is not allowed. B

Answer: If it is not in the category of Ghina and it is not
stimulating, then it is not a problem. L

190 – Rule: It is not a problem for women to recite Qur’an in front of
non-Mahram men, even if it is in a pleasing voice, with the condition
that it is not arousing nor does it cause corruption. KL

If it leads to corruption, then it is not permitted; rather, most
often, women reading (Qur’an) in the presence of men and men listening
to such a thing leads to corruption and thus, it is not allowed. B

Women and girls must not recite the Qur’an in a tone in the presence of
non-Mahram men, and similarly, if a man is reciting in a way that a
woman gets enjoyment (of a lustful type), then it is a problem. G

191 – Question: Is it allowed to read romance novels in which sexual
issues are being discussed? Also, is it allowed to print such books?

Answer: It is not allowed. G

192 – Question: What is the ruling for writing letters to non-Mahram
men and discussing romantic or lustful things in the letter?
