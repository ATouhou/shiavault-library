Dedication
==========

*To you; O the Prophet of humanity!*
*To you; O the hero of Islam!*[^1]
*To both of you, who are but one soul!*
*To your exaltedness, I offer this book,*
*Which is the least effort of him, who*
*Failed yet to support the religion… the*
*Religion to which you had devoted*
*Yourselves… the religion, to which the*
*History had been unfair… the religion,*
*Which the historians had wronged.*
*To you I offer it hoping to be near to*
*Allah and to you in a day where*
*Nothing will be of use except that who*
*Comes to Allah with a heart free from*
*Evil.*
