Bahlool and the Khalifa's Food
==============================

It is said that Haroun Rashid sent some food to Bahlool. His servant
brought the food to Bahlool, put it in front of him, and said, “This is
the Khalifa's special food, he has sent it to you to eat.”

Bahlool placed the food in front of the dog that was sitting in the
ruins of the place. The servant screamed, “Why did you give the
Khalifa's food to the dog!”

Bahlool said, “Be quiet! If the dog hears that the Khalifa sent this
food, it won't eat it either.”
