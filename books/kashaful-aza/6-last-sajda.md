Last Sajda
==========

Our scholars and zakireen explain the last sajda of Imam Hussain (as)
to make people cry. They do not understand its truth. If you ponder upon
this last sajda of Imam Hussain (as), then you will realize the whole of
Karbala was gathered in this brief sajda of Imam Hussain (as).

Just ponder upon this point. Why did Imam Hussain (as) do this sajda?
Why was it necessary? This wasn?t a sajda of prayer nor was it a sajda
of shukr. Then what was it? History tells us when my Mazloom Imam (as)
fell down from Zuljenah, His sacred body was not on the ground.

It was stuck upon the arrows. Just imagine when my Moula (as) had done
sajda, all the arrows would have gone through His whole body. May our
lives and the lives of our children be sacrificed on our Master (as).
That was such a scene which caused the heavens and earth to shake. All
of the prophets and angels were shocked. Their hearts were trembling
with great amazement. What was that last sajda? The reason is Imam
Hussain (as) completely showed His wilayat.

I swear by Allah if Imam Hussain (as) had not done this sajda, then
today there would be a statue of Imam Hussain (as) in every home and
every person would be worshipping Imam Hussain (as). This was the last
sajda of Imam Hussain (as) who is the savior of tawheed. This is the
reason one of the names of my Moula (as) is "Daleel ala al Tawheed"
(Proof of Oneness).

This was the reason Imam (as) stood against yazid (la). Imam Hussain
(as) sacrificed everything for Allah. Imam (as) kept nothing for
Himself. If the gaining of government was His purpose,

then Imam (as) would have taken an army and weapons with Him not
females and children. His only purpose was to save the tawheed of Allah
and wilayat of His Father (as). He achieved His goal.

Rules of Aza (mourning) The remembrance of Imam Hussain (as) is the
greatest act of worship one can do. When we remember Imam Hussain (as),
we also are remembering Allah, RasoolAllah (saw), Ameerul Momineen (as),
and all other Aimmah (as).

All other remembrances are alive because of the remembrance of Imam
Hussain (as). All of our acts of worship revolve around the remembrance
of Imam Hussain (as). Those people are very unlucky who have abandoned
this great act of worship in order to show off their prayers to
people.

Prayer is nothing without Imam Hussain (as). One who reads such a
useless prayer; there is no difference between his prayer and the
prayers of the army of yazid (la). Prayer is an act of worship of Allah
because of Imam Hussain (as). If you read prayer without Imam Hussain
(as) then your prayer becomes the worship of shaitan.

When you will give such great respect to the majalis of Imam Hussain
(as), then certainly you will also respect the rules of the majalis and
juloos. Unfortunately, we respect majalis of Imam Hussain (as) but we do
not respect the rules of majalis.

We have included such things in the majalis which are totally against
the spirit of azadari. One person is not responsible for this. The
majority of people, zakirs, scholars, and also the azadars (mourners) of
Imam Hussain (as) themselves are responsible for this. We are pointing
these things out so that you could remember them and hopefully will not
allow any of these worldly aspects to be included in the holy
remembrance of Imam Hussain (as).

**First Example**

Majalis of Imam Hussain (as) is coming to an end. The Zakir is reading
masaib (sufferings), azadars (mourners) are weeping profusely and
hitting their heads and chests, all of a sudden the zakir raises his
hands and makes this dua:

"O?my Lord! Those who are jobless amongst these azadars, bless them
with a job. Those who are childless, bless them with children. Those who
are in jail, bless them with freedom. O?our Lord! Increase our rizq
(sustenance)". He will also make many other duas like this. I assure you
this is like you are ignoring the sufferings Ahlul Bayt (as)
completely.

Just stop for a moment and think; then you will be able to understand
everything. When there is a death in one?s family, the dead body is
laying there. You go to visit and offer your condolences. You are also
crying with his relatives. Then suddenly you ask them, "I need 10,000
rupees. Please give me".

Tell me honestly, would you have the courage to ask them at that
moment? Never. You know this is not a suitable time for asking such
things.

If that person is very generous he may give you money, but he will
consider you to be a very selfish and cruel person. You will lose the
respect in his eyes forever. Now imagine. When you do this in majalis,
you are not respecting Ahlul Bayt (as) the way you would a common
person.

Don?t you know Syeda (sa) comes Herself to the majalis? She gathers the
tears of the azadars in Her Chadar. At that time, what do you prove by
asking for worldly things? The only purpose of your tears was to show
off in front of others.

For the sake of Allah, try to understand this. Whenever a zakir raises
his hands for dua after masaib, stop him and tell him what he is doing
is not good. If you want to ask, then ask on the 13th of Rajab.

Ask on 3rd, 4th, and 15th of Shabaan. The greatest occasion of
happiness is on the 18th of Zil Hajj. Ask on these occasions for any
worldly pleasures for yourself from Moula (as).
