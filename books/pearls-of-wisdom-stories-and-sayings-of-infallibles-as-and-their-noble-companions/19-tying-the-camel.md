The caravan had been traveling for few hours now. Signs of fatigue were
obvious on their faces. They arrived at a point and stopped. The Prophet
(S) who was also in the caravan, stopped and camel, and landed. Prior to
anything, they were in search of water to prepare for prayer.

The Prophet (S), also started searching for water. But soon, returned to
his camel, without saying anything to anyone. The campanions were
surprised that the Prophet had ordered stopping here, and now perhaps he
would like to move again? Eyes and ears were awaiting his order. But the
surprise of the group increased as they saw him approach his camel, and
tied its knees, and returned back in search of water.

Noises were raised from every corner: “ O Prophet of Allah! Why didn't
you order us to do this for you, and instead you put yourself in
discomfort? We would have proudly done that service for you.”

The Prophet (S) responded: “Never seek others' help in your affairs,
don't lean on others, even if it is a small piece of Miswak (the wood
used for brushing teeth).”[^1]
