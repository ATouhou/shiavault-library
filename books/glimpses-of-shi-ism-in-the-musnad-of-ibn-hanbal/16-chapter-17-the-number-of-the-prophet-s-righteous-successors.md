Chapter 17 : the Number of the Prophet’s Righteous Successors
=============================================================

Ibn Hanbal says:

A. Hasan bin Musa- has related to us from Hamma-d bin Zayd from
Muja-lid from Sha‘bi- from Masruq who says that in Kufa ‘Abdulla-h bin
Mas‘ud was giving us lessons from the Holy Qur’a-n when a person
asked:

O Aba- ‘Abd al-Rahma-n! Did you not ask the Prophet how many caliphs
would this ummah have?

‘Abdulla-h bin Mas‘ud said:

Since my coming to Iraq no one has posed me this question so far except
you.

Then he added:

Yes! We did ask the Messenger of Allah (S) about this matter and he
said:

“Ithna--‘Ashara ka ‘iddati nuqaba-’ Bani- Isra-’i-l (Twelve, equal to
the number of the Chieftans of Bani- Isra-’i-l).”[^62]

The isna-d of this hadith are sahi-h according to Ahmad Sha-kir.

Ibn Hanbal says:

B. Sufya-n bin ‘Uyaynah has related to us from ‘Abd al-Malik bin ‘Umayr
from Ja-bir bin Samrah al-Suwa-’i- who narrates that he heard the
Messenger of Allah (S) say:

“La- yaza-l ha-dha al-amr ma-ziyan hatta- yaqum ithna--‘ashara ami-ran
(This affair [religion] will continue until twelve leaders [Ami-r] will
rise).”

Then he mentioned something which I did not hear, so I asked my father
(who was sitting beside me), who said:

“All of whom will be from the Quraysh.”[^63]

This hadith has been recorded over 40 times in Ibn Hanbal’s Musnad[^64]
and in some versions the word Khali-fah is found instead of Amir.[^65]
The version which I have selected here has the shortest chain of
authority and reaches the Prophet through the medium of three narrators.
Sunni scholars and exegetes of hadith have rather been perplexed and
come up with unconvincing comments in their explanation of this
particular hadith of the Prophet. They have been unable to reconcile
with their beliefs the meaning of the figure of “twelve caliphs” as used
by the Prophet. As a result we find conflicting and self-contradictory
answers in their explanations.[^66]
