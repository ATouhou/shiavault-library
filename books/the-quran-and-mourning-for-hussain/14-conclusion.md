Conclusion
==========

In the light of the Quran, neither is crying and mourning an innovation,
nor is the respect given to places and objects associated with our
revered personalities an innovation. Further, kissing these symbols or
prostrating out of respect is not idolatrous or innovative. In fact I
would say that to raise a hue and cry about this is itself an
innovation. As the deceased Waqif Muradabadi wrote:

*Those who cry Idolatry and Innovation,*

*Those who render the remembrance of Hussain as disbelief,*

*If they do not prevent us thus then so much will be laid open,*

*They are very sensible, the household of Umayya!*
