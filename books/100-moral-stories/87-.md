BE PATIENT
A man came out of his home to admire his new truck.

To his puzzlement, his three-year-old son was happily hammering

dents into the shiny paint of the truck.

The man ran to his son, knocked him away, and hammered the little

boy’s hands into pulp as punishment.

When the father calmed down, he rushed his son to the hospital. Although
the doctor tried

desperately to save the crushed bones, he finally had to amputate
fingers from boy’s both hands.

When the boy woke up from the surgery and saw his bandaged stubs, he
innocently said, “Daddy,

I’m sorry about your truck.” Then he asked, “But when are my fingers
going to grow back?”

The father went home and committed suicide.

“O**ne who cannot benefit by patience will die**

of grief and excitement.” Imam Ali (AS)

Think about this story the next time someone

steps on your feet or you wish to take revenge.

Think first before you lose your patience with someone u love. Trucks
can be repaired. Broken

bones and hurt feelings often can’t.

Too often we fail to recognize the difference between the person and the
performance. We forget

that forgiveness is greater than revenge.

People make mistakes. We are allowed to make mistakes. But the actions
we take while in a rage

will haunt us forever. Pause and ponder. Think before you act. Be
patient. Forgive and forget.

Love one and all.
