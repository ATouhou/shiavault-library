Proximity To Allah
==================

**Proximity to Allah جار اللّه وجواره**

1. One who is close to Allah is safe, while [one who is] His enemy is
frightened.

> 1ـ جارُ اللّهِ سُبْحانَهُ آمِنٌ، وعَدُوُّهُ خائِفٌ.

2. Proximity to Allah is granted to those who obey Him and keep away
from disobedience to Him.

> 2ـ جِوارُ اللّهِ مَبْذُولٌ لِمَنْ أطاعَهُ وتَجَنَّبَ مُخالَفَتَهُ.
