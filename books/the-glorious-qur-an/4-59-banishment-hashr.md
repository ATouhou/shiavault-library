59: Banishment (hashr)
======================

This chapter of 24 verses which are arranged in three sections was
revealed at Madina after Evidence 98. It deals with the expulsion of the
Jewish clan called the Banu-Nadir who lived three miles outside of
Madina, and how to distribute the booty resulting from the campaign in
which they had been defeated (I). This incident occurred six months
after the battle of Uhud in the year 4 / 625.

In the final section (III), the description of how, if the Qur!an should
be delivered to a mountain. it would shudder at receiving such a burden
gives us a graphic picture, while the !0nc!ding passage forms a
beautiful doxology. in praise of the Deity.
