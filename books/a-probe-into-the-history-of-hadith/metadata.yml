description: |
  Sayyid Murtadha al-Askari, the renowned scholar, has very ably made a
  probe into the History of the delicate institution of Hadith and very
  ably unveiled the picture of the institution of Hadith in such a superb
  manner that every line and contour of its countenance becomes distinctly
  clear. His scholarly and unbiased analysis of the subject invites the
  attention of the Muslims all over the world to view the subject
  dispassionately and try to differentiate and dissociate the authentic
  from the unauthentic and fabricated Hadith. In this way it will be a
  great service to Islam to introduce it in its true colours and contours
  through the help of reliable and authentic Hadith.
