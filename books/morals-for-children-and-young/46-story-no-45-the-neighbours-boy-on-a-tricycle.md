Story no. 45: The neighbours boy on a tricycle
==============================================

Asad was a 5 year old boy.  
 Sometimes he went to the street and played with the children.  
 But one day when he came, he saw a boy of his own neighbourhood riding
a beautiful and shining tricycle.  
 He ran indoors to his mother and said “Mother, a father has bought a
tricycle for his son, I want one too”.  
 “When father comes home tonight, please ask him to buy a tricycle for
me”.  
 His mother said “I will not do such a thing. His salary is too less to
afford it”. “We must be content with whatever he buys us”.
