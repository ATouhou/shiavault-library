description: |
  Thaqalain tradition is a famous and well-known tradition that is
  reported by [both] Sunnites and Shiites. Hundreds of prominent narrators
  have narrated this tradition. Some self-interested figures have
  fabricated the tradition of adherence to Book (Quran) and Tradition
  (Prophet's Tradition) [instead of Quran and Prophet's Progeny] as two
  weighty things. This book studies this tradition and its reporters,
  critically examines them and shows the truth to those who seek it.
