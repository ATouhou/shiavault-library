Lesson Fifty Two: There is no incurable disease
===============================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ما أَنْزَلَ اللّهُ مِنْ داء إلاّ جَعَلَ لَهُ دَواء
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

God has not created any disease unless he has created a remedy for
it.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The world in which we live is a series of actions and reactions. For
every negative power there is a corresponding positive and corrective
power which should be found and used. Continuation of our life is the
effect of balance in these powers. There is neither an incurable
corporeal disease, nor is there any social problem that cannot be
solved. These who assume that certain complex problems have no solution
or that some diseases have no cure, neglect this important fact that in
essence there is no such thing as an incurable disease.

Therefore, one should not give up. One should persevere and keep on
working on the life’s intractable issues with patience and tenacity
until a solution is found.
