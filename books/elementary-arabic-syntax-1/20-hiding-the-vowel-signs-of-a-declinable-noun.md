Hiding the Vowel Signs of a Declinable Noun
===========================================

53. How many declinable nouns hide their vowel signs?  
 There are three types of declinable nouns that hide their vowel
signs:  
 • A compliment to a prefixed *yā'* personal pronoun.

• Nouns whose last letter is an *alif maqsūrah* (**ی**).

• Nouns whose last letter is a *ya'* preceded by a *kasrah*.

54. Which declinable nouns hide all of their vowel signs?  
 All of the vowels are hidden:  
 • if the noun is a compliment to a prefixed y*ā'* personal pronoun
because it would be difficult to pronounce the vowel. For example:
**إنّ** **مَذهني** **إکرامي** **لضَیفي** (Verily, my creed makes me
respect my guest. )

• if the noun's last letter is an *alif maqsūrah* because an *alif*
cannot take a vowel. For example:

**إنّ** **الهُدی** **هُدی** **اللهِ** (Verily guidance is Allah's
guidance.)

55. Which declinable nouns hide the *dummah* and *kasrah*?  
 The *dummah* and *kasrah* are hidden in nouns whose last letter is a
*ya'* preceded by a *kasrah* because of it being difficult to pronounce.
For example: **حَکَمَ** **القاضِي** **عَلَی** **الجَانِي** (The judge
sentenced the criminal.)
