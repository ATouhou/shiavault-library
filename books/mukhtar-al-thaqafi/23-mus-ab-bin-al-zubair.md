Mus'ab bin al-Zubair
====================

Abdullah bin al-Zubair thought about a new, strict ruler to appoint over
Basrah. He chose his brother Mus'ab to carry out the task. Mus'ab bin
al-Zubair arrived in Basrah and addressed its people:

*Some people have told me that you surname your rulers. Before you
surname me, I have surnamed myself al-Jazzar (butcher).*

Some persons killed innocent people. They escaped from Mukhtar's
justice. They began urging Mus'ab to fight Mukhtar.
