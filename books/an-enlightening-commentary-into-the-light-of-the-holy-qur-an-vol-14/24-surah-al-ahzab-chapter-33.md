***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

This Surah was revealed in Medina and contains seventy three verses.

In the fifth year of Hijrah the Jews of Medina, pagans of Mecca, and the
hypocrites hidden amongst the Muslims united to fight against the
Muslims. Then the Prophet (S) and his followers dug a deep ditch around
Medina to defend against their attack.

This battle was designed by different groups and thus it was called ‘The
Battle of Clans’, and since the Muslims dug a ditch in order to defend
themselves, this battle became known as ‘The Battle of Ditch’.

On the whole, seventeen verses of this Surah are about the Battle of
clans, and since in verses 20 and 22, the Arabic word ***/’ahzab/ (the
clans)*** is used for three times, this Surah was called Al-’Ahzab (the
clans).

In addition to the explanation concerning the Battle of Clans, there are
some other matter mentioned in this Surah about ‘injurious
assimilation’, divorce in the Age of Ignorance, the ordinances of
adoption (adopted son), the subject of veiling of women, and paying
attention to Resurrection.

The Virtue of Surah Al-’Ahzab
-----------------------------

All knowledgeable men of Islam believe that this Surah was revealed in
Medina, and, as we said before, the whole verses of it are seventy
three; and since a great part of this Surah refers to ‘The Battle of
Clans’, the name of Al-’Ahzab has been chosen for it.

Upon the virtue of this Surah, it is sufficient that the holy Prophet of
Islam (S) in a tradition said:

*“Whoever recites Surah Al-’Ahzab and teaches it to his family
members…will be secure from the chastisement of the grave.”*[^1]

Imam Sadiq (as) in a tradition said:

*“Whoever recites Surah Al-’Ahzab frequently, on the Hereafter Day, will
be in the neighbourhood of Muhammad (S) and his Ahlul Bayt (as).”*[^2]

We have repeatedly said that these kinds of virtues and honours are not
obtained by a mere recitation which is empty of any kind of
contemplation and action. A recitation is needed that is the origin of
contemplation, a contemplation that makes the horizon of man’s thought
so bright that the rays of which appear in his deeds.
