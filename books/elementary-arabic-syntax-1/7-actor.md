Actor
=====

18. What is an actor?  
 An actor is a noun that is preceded by a verb and denotes the person
who carried out that verb. For example: **لَعِبَ** **الصّغِیرُ** (The
child played). Here, child is the actor because it came after the verb
and denotes who played.

19. Does the verb remain in the same form if the actor is feminine?  
 If the actor is feminine the verb is placed into the feminine form by
adding a *tā*' to the end of a preterite tense verb or a *tā'* at the
beginning of an aorist tense verb. For example:  
**سافَرَت** **مَریَم** **و** **تُسافِرُ** **سَلمی** (Maryam traveled and
Salma is traveling.)

20. Does the verb remain in the same form or is it put into the plural
form if the actor is in the dual or plural form?  
 The verb remains in the single form even if the actor is in the dual or
plural form.
