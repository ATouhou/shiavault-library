Hajjaj
======

Hajjaj was the bloodthirsty governor of Iran and Iraq. Unlike the rest
of mankind, he refused to take mother's breast after being born. It is
said that Shaytan (satan) appeared in human form and said he should be
given the blood of animals and insects for four days. After this, Hajjaj
accepted his mother's breast. It was this incident which caused him to
become a mean and merciless man; indeed, for as long as he lived, he
never once stopped killing people.

For twenty years, he held the position of governor of Iraq and Iran. He
was appointed by the merciless tyrant-Kings of the Banu Umayyah family.
Hajjaj, like his masters, thirsted after the blood of his opponents
.Hajjaj ,this bestial tyrant was especially eager to kill the followers
of Ali (a.s) (peace be upon him) ,and his progeny. His most pleasurable
hours were spent torturing to death any of the friends and supporters of
Ali who were brought captive before him. He enjoyed watching his
innocent victims being dismembered and slowly bleeding to death before
his pitiless. During his rule, treachery ,plundering and killing became
so commonplace that one noted scholar has observed: If all the nations
of the world were to each select their most despicable and hated
criminals , either from modern times or past ages none would be baser ,
none more savage than Hajjaj.

Hajjaj was the enemy of mankind ,the enemy of all that is fine and
noble in man. He was a man who was appointed governor by those who
themselves had usurped the caliphate of the Muslims. He was the enemy of
Islam, the Prophet and especially Ali and his supporters.

He was the source of the treachery and bloodshed committed by all the
so-called Muslims rulers after him; and although he was, in reality ,the
bitterest enemy of the family of the Prophet, he tricked the people of
that time by going to the mosques ,giving advice to those present and
even praying in congregation and in the Friday (jum'ah) prayers.

His prison consisted of merely four walls -roofless and so, open to the
burning sun of summer or the bitter cold of winter. The innocent
prisoners, all Muslims ,Shi'ahs and supporters of the struggle to
establish Islam as a way of life were confined between these four walls
and forced to endure the rigours of the climate!

Even the surrounding rocks and hills trembled at their cries of pain
and anguish ; the hearts of Hajjaj and his tortures remained stonily
impassive .Whenever the prisoners tried to move out of the burning heat
of summer and seek the shelter of the shade cast by the walls, the
merciless guards stones and rocks at them or prevented them from
approaching by stabbing at their defenceless bodies with their spears.
The prisoners were fed on bread mixed with ashes. After torturing and
harassing the prisoners, most of whom were Muslims leading the struggle
to establish true Islam, he had them put to death in the most brutal
way. At the time of Hajjaj's death there were thirty -three thousand men
and women ,sixteen thousands od whom were naked without even a blanket
to cover themselves ,still in his prison. Hajjaj the tyrant-executioner
had so many spies within the Muslim community that no one dared to even
mention the name of Ali, (a.s) ,or the members of his family.

Like Mu'awiyah ,Yazid and the rest of the Banu Umayyah leaders, he was
extremely sensitive to the name of Ali .He reacted in like manner even
to the names of the important amongst the Shi'ah community .It was
Hajjaj who tortured and killed the dearest and closet companions of Ali
(a.s) ,such as Kumayl , Qanbar (the servant of Ali) and Sa'id to name,
but a few of the many hundred victims. From the very beginning ,the
government of Banu Umayyah retained their political power through
tyrannical oppression, torture ,killing corruption and plundering ;
their blueprint for government was based on the vilest desires and
ambitions of man.

As we have seen , the reason why they killed all the courageous Muslims
who were fighting in the way of Truth, was the latter's devoted
allegiance to Ali, (a.s).Hajjaj ,the governor of Kufah ,Sham (an area
roughly corresponding to present -day Syria ,Lebanon and Palestine) and
Iraq, like all the Banu Umayyah rulers were enraged at the mere mention
of Ali and his family.

Hajjaj despatched his spies and agents after Sa'id and others who were
still free to have them captured and brought before him. Sa'id took
refuge in the large cities of Iran, fleeing from place to place in an
attempt to throw off his pursuers.

At first, went to Isfahan; later hid in the city of Qum and then moved
to the province of Azarbayjan in the north-west of Iran. From there, he
went to Iraq and finally sought safety in Makkah (Mecca) .The governor
of Makkah ,like Hajjaj was a merciless ,stony -hearted man. As soon as
Sa'id and a number of noble Muslims tried to seek refuge in Makkah ,he
had them arrested and sent them in chains to the town of Kufah. All the
Muslims who were truly devoted to the cause of Islam hurried out to
greet Sa'id on his arrival.

The next day Sa'id , his hands and neck bound tight in chains , was
brought before the bloodthirsty Hajjaj. As soon as the enemy of Allah,
Hajjaj saw Sa'id ,fear struck his heart; summoning up his courage , he
shamelessly began to question Sa'id: What is your name?

Sa'id replied: Sa'id (that is ,the fortunate one). Hajjaj: No, your
name is Shaqiy ( meaning:

the unfortunate).

Sa'id: My mother, who gave me this name, must have known better.
Hajjaj: No, the name of both, you and your mother, is Shaqiy.
Sa'id: Only the Almighty Allah knows the secrets of the unseen.
Hajjaj: I will have you thrown into the fire of hell in this very
world.
Sa'id: If I thought that you were capable of that, I would call you
God.
Hajjaj: What are your beliefs concerning Muhammad (s.a.w.a)?
Sa'id: Muhammad (s.a.w.a) is the merciful Prophet of Allah.
Hajjaj: What kind of man was Ali (a.s)? Is he in Paradise or Gehenna?
Sa'id: If I were able to go to Paradise or Gehenna ,I would know who
was in Paradise and who was in Gehenna.
Hajjaj: What do you know about the three caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar and
Uthman)?

Sa'id: What business do you have with them? Are you their defender or
representative?
Hajjaj: Who do you love more, Ali (a.s) or the caliphs?
Sa'id: I love whomever Allah loves them most, whomever Allah chooses as
the more worthy.
Hajjaj: Which of the two is most loved by Allah?
Sa'id: Only the person who knows the secrets of the heart and that
which is normally hidden of man's nature can answer that.
Hajjaj: Why do you not speak clearly, why don't you answer my questions
in a straight -foreword manner?
Sa'id: I do not want to tell you a lie.
Hajjaj :Why don't you smile?
Sa'id: Why should anyone want to laugh when he knows he has been
created from dust and dust is burnt by fire.
Hajjaj: Then why do we laugh?

Sa'id: None of you have pure hearts :your hearts are dead and full of
darkness.
Hajjaj: Oh Sa'id! Know that whatever you say, I will finally kill
you.
Sa'id: In that case, I will indeed be fortunate ,and the name Sa'id
given to me by mother is appropriate.
Hajjaj: How would you like me to kill you?
Sa'id: Oh unfortunate one! Whichever way you like: your punishment
awaits you on the final day.

Hajjaj: Would you like me to forgive you and set you free?
Sa'id: If forgiveness is from Allah I desire it, if it is from you,
then, no.
Hajjaj had an executioner brought before him and gave the order that
the victims 's head be cut off-as usual under his pitiless gaze.
The executioner bound Sa'id's hands behind his back and cut off his
head as if he were a sheep. In his last moments alive, Sa'id said,
"Ashhadu an al ilaha illa Allah, Ashhadu anna Muhammad Rasul Allah", ( I
witness that there is no god but Allah, I witness that Muhammad is the
Messenger of Allah); then he turned to face the sky and said: "O Allah!
don't allow Hajjaj any further respite, don't give him the opportunity
to kill others".
It was at this very moment that the executioner severed the head from
the body of this noble man and so further increased the number of crimes
committed by Hajjaj. After this shahadah (a martyr's death in the way of
Allah), Hajjaj went into a stranger mood and finally became mad. He only
lived fifteen days more and during this period was unable to sleep.
His death was slow and painful. He would lose consciousness for a while
only to regain it and see before him form of Sa'id. Such is the fate of
the brutal tyrants of the world.
