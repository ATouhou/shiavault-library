Principle Three: Delegation of obedience
========================================

God, due to some benefits for us, may ask us to obey some people or
groups of people, e.g. our parents. We obey our parents because God has
asked us to obey them.28 As a result, if they want us to disobey God
then we would not obey them. The general rule (without exception)
is:***There is no obedience to the creature in the disobedience of the
Creator.*** Thus, when obeying the legitimate leader one first of all
obeys God and then the position of leadership and not the person per se.
Even the person who is a leader, he himself must respect the position of
leadership and act according to his commands as a leader.
