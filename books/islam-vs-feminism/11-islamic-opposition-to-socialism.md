Islamic Opposition to Socialism
===============================

Socialism calls for the destruction of tradition and its replacement by
a radically egalitarian system.

The Socialist distributive system is un-Islamic because it ignores
differentiation arising as a result of contract and trade, but considers
only the pattern of distribution.Socialist materialism is incompatible
with the anti- materialism of Islamic ideology.

The idea that the means of production must be in the hands of the
masses, or the party that represents them, is contrary to the idea of
hierarchical rule found in Islam, which, though it may be for the
benefit of the people, does not give the people any right to the means
of production.

More specifically, with regard to feminism, where socialism opposes the
family as an expression of exploitative class relations, Islam seeks to
support and encourage the building and maintenance of families. Family
ties are exceedingly important in Islam. So Islam and socialism are
diametrically opposed on this point.

All forms of feminism with socialist leanings are in agreement with the
aim of ultimate destruction of the family. All reject any sort of gender
differentiation and complementarity. As such, they are fundamentally
opposed to Islam.

Many of the forms of feminism that reject socialism, nevertheless retain
the absolute egalitarian and anti-family principles of the socialists,
and so Islam will oppose them no less than it does more orthodox forms
of socialism.
