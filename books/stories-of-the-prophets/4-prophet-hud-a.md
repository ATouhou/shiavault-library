Prophet Hud (a)
===============

A long time ago,

a great tribe lived in the

South of Arabia.

They were called Ad.

They were very clever and

could do many things.

They used the mountains

for their homes.

They carved out great mansions

with wonderful pillars.

They called their city Iram.

It was very famous.

As time went on,

the people of Ad

thought more about themselves

and less about Allah.

They thought they

didn't need Allah,

because they had

lots of money

and power.

They thought they were

being clever but really

they were foolish.

Before long they turned

to bad ways.

Gangs of them used to

rob and kill people

travelling by.

There was still one good man

among them.

His name was Hud.

He did not belong to any of

the gangs.

He did not agree

with the things they did.

He tried to tell them

to stop their bad ways

and told them

to follow Allah's ways.

Hud said Allah would punish

the bad ones but most of the

people still would not listen.

They thought they were

more clever than

the messenger of Allah.

Allah told Hud to take all the

good people into a big cave

near the city. The very next

day a terrible tornado

came and only the

good ones,

the ones who had

listened,

were saved.
