The Minor Occultation: After the martyrdom of Imam Hasan al-Askari
(a.s.), he assumed the responsibilities of Imamat. Immediately
thereafter in 260 A.H., with the permission of the Almighty, the Minor
Occultation started. This lasted for sixty nine years till 329 A.H. In
this period there were four special representatives who played the role
of intermediaries between him and the people.

The Major Occultation: It commenced in the year 329 A.H. With this, the
period of special representation ended and the era of general
representation began. The major occultation will continue so long as
Allah desires. Allah will make him reappear to fill this world with
justice whenever He so desires.
