Introduction
*In this eye opening text, Yasin T. al-Jibouri sheds light on the true
characteristics of one of the most famous narrators of traditions from
the Ahlu-Sunnah, Abu Hurayra. Whom was known to have supposedly reported
more traditions from the beloved lips of the Holy Prophet
(Salla-a-Allahu Alaihi Wa Alihi Wa Sallam) [Peace and Blessings Be Upon
Him and His Household] than any other narrator in the History of Islam.
Yet if one were to examine even in brief his life as has been done
throughout this short book - it would be clear to every person of
intellect how this man from whom reports are being widely taken and
attributed to the Prophet (Salla-a-Allahu Alaihi Wa Alihi Wa Sallam)
[Peace and Blessings Be Upon Him and His Household] are nothing more
than complete and utter fabrications told in falsehood for the purpose
of deviation to meet the order of the political agenda of the time. It
is a must read for all seekers of truth and knowledge.*
