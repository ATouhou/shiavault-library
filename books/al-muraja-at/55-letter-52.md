Rejecting the Rebuttal's Premises
---------------------------------

**Muharram 15, 1330**

We believe in the virtues of all posterity since the time of the
Muhajirun and the Ansar, may Allah be pleased with them and they with
Him, and these are beyond count or reckoning. Certain verses of the Book
(Qur'an), in addition to a few Sunni *sahih* books, must suffice you for
a testimony in this regard. We have scrutinized these, too. We have not
found them at all, and Allah knows best, to be in contradiction to the
texts that praise â€˜Ali (as), or even in any way eligible to disqualify
him [from caliphate].

Yes, our opponents may stand alone in narrating the *ahadith* which are
not authentic according to our sources. Their use of such *ahadith* to
disprove our views is rejected and is not expected from any unbiased
arbitrator. We by no means can take them into serious consideration. Do
you not see how we do not argue by quoting the texts narrated only by
our own sources?

On the contrary, we base our arguments on their own narrations regarding
events such as the Ghadir incident or the like. But we have scrutinized
the texts pertaining to these virtues recorded by their sources, and we
could not find any clues in them opposing such caliphate, nor do they
contain anything suggesting it; therefore, they have not been relied
upon by anyone to prove the legitimacy of the caliphate of the three
righteous caliphs, Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*Sh*
