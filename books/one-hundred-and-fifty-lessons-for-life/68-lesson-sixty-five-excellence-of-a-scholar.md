Lesson Sixty Five: Excellence of a Scholar
==========================================

Imam Musa ibn Ja’far (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَضْلُ الْفَقِيهِ عَلَى الْعابِدِ كَفَضْلِ الشَّمسِ عَلَى الْكَواكِبِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The excellence of a scholar over a votary is similar to excellence of
sun over the stars.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The stars in the sky are themselves luminous but fail to provide
luminosity to the Earth and to illuminate the path for us.

Sunlight and its bright and shiny rays, on the other hand, revive and
energize the Earth and also light up the path for all inhabitants of
planets in the solar system . The sun thus enables others to distinguish
the right path from the deviant one, the high road from crag. And it is
this that distinguishes a scholar from a devotee. The latter is
concerned only with saving himself whereas the former tries to also save
others from drowning.

Just as planets need sunlight, votaries need a scholar.
