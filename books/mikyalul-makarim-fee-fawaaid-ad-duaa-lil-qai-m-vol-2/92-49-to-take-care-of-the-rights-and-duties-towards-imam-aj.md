49: To Take Care Of The Rights And Duties Towards Imam (aj)
===========================================================

The rights of the Holy Prophet (S) and after him the Imams (as) have
precedence over the rights of all other people in the world. And Allah
has bestowed them this high station. He has selected them among all the
people and made them the medium of bestowing the mankind with every kind
of benefit.[^1] The Holy Imams (as) have said regarding their rights,
“The right of the Almighty Allah is for us.” Thus observing the rights
of Imam (as) is a medium of gaining Allah’s proximity. And to consider
his right unimportant is distancing oneself from Allah and earns His
anger, as mentioned by Imam Sajjad (as) in Dua Abu Hamza Thumali: Or may
be You found me considering Your right less important and distanced me
from You.[^2]
