Chapter 18: Science and Philosophy
==================================

Imam Jafar al-Sadiq (A.S) was not only a religious leader, but a
scientist, a philosopher and a man of letters. He used to teach
theology, philosopher, science and literature. He was the first scholar
in the world to have separated science and philosophy. No one before him
paid any attention to the important point that they are two different
subjects. He remarked, while pointing out the difference between the two
which shocked many philosophers. They can be divided in two parts.

The first part read as follows: "Science and philosophy are two
different subjects. Science gives us definite and exact results even if
they are small and insignificant. But philosophy serves no practical
purpose and gives no useful results."

The second part read as follows : "However, it is beyond the scope of
science to discover the ultimate truth; but it is within the domain of
philosophy to do that."

As the Imam was a religious leader he already knew the truth through
religion and did not want to find it through philosophy. However, it was
his firm conviction that philosophy would solve many problems. He was
therefore more interested in philosophy than in science because it
helped to recognise the Creator.

Imam Jafar al-Sadiq (A.S) was not a physician by profession, but he
introduced and formulated methods of diagnosis and treatment in the
field of medicine. Western scholars find it hard to believe how he could
have introduced certain diagnosis in that age and time.
