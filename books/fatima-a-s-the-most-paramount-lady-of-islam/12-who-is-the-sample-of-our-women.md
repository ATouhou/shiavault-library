Who is the sample of our women?
===============================

It is evident she, who is a Muslim and has adopted the Islamic Ideology,
cannot choose one as a mental leader except Fatima (peace be upon her)
and Zeineb. She would imitate Fezzah and Asma as well as somayeh and
Omme Salameh. There is no doubt that some persons introduce themselves
as the real followers of Fatima (peace be upon her), but simulation
cannot change the truth. Simulation is one thing, and acceptance of the
facts seriously something else. By adopting the life of Fatima (peace be
upon her) as sample, a Muslim woman tries to make her thought as Fatima
(peace be upon her), her morals as Zeineb, her views as Fezzah, and at
last, her speech according to Allah’s will. And this is achieved under
the protection of man’s want, practice and faith.
