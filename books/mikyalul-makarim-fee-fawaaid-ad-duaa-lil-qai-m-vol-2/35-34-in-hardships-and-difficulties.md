34. In Hardships And Difficulties
=================================

It is most appropriate to supplicate for the early reappearance of
Imam-e-Asr (as) at such moments for the following reasons:

**First**: It is the cause of his prayers (in our favor) as already
mentioned.

**Second**: It is the cause of the supplications of the angels because
they pray for one who prays for an absent believer and their prayers are
accepted, Inshallah.

**Third**: His (aj) command, “And pray more for the hastening of the
reappearance. For surely, this is your salvation.”

**Fourth**: Supplication is a medium to reach unto him (aj) and he, in
turn, is the best medium of safety from difficulties, trials and
tribulations.
