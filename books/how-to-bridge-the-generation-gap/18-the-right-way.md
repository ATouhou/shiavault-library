The Right Way
=============

The Father
----------

The illogical words, the inappropriate deeds of some people, and the
superstitions which have entered into religion, have no relationship to
Islam, and they ought not to be considered a part of it. One should not
accept them. Instead, one must fight against them. Rejecting such
things, is by no means for disbelief in the true religion. You must only
stick with the truths of the religion and get rid of all the fallacies.

The Child
---------

Although I do not have the wisdom to tell you what to do, but allow me
to say: when you find any fault with me, please try to explain it to me
in a manner that I have the capacity to understand. If I ask you a
question about the reasons why some act of worship is done in the way it
is, or if I question the philosophy behind some others, do not get upset
with me, and do not call me a disbelieving Kafir.

In School, I have studied mathematics and natural sciences and have
become mostly familiar with physical reasoning. But some religious
matters seem unacceptable and complex to my mind. I have to ask about
such matters. If you explain the answers to me in any easy to understand
language and in a nice and logical manner, I will be convinced and will
accept them. It would make me happy to feel that I have been able to
find the solutions. And probably, this will help me solve other problems
too. Therefore, you should be pleased with this line of my questioning,
since I am doing this only to search for and to find the truth.
