Abstract
========

*This essay examines the meaning, role and structure of that supreme
science of the Real which came to be known as al-tasawwuf al-'ilmi or
'irfan-i nazari in Islamic civilization. It then turns to the history of
this science beginning with Ibn 'Arabi and his immediate circle and then
considers each region of the Islamic world separately from Morocco to
the Malay world. Special attention is paid to the great masters of
'irfan-i nazari in Persia from the earliest teachers to those of the
present day. The relation of this science to philosophy, kalam, and
other intellectual disciplines is discussed and its spiritual
significance is studied in itself and in its relation to the operative
and practical aspects of Sufism. At the end of the essay a section is
devoted to the significance of 'irfan today and its role in providing
solutions for some of the most important intellectual and spiritual
issues facing the contemporary Islam world.*
