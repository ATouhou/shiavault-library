Knowledge and the Virtue of Teaching It
=======================================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Someone who possesses knowledge on a subject
but conceals it when he is asked will be bridled with reins of fire."
(Therefore, if a person possesses information that would help a
bewildered person and improve his situation but he remains silent, he
has surely committed a great sin.)

Al -'Ithna-'Ashariyyah, p. 11

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "The Qur’an is Allah's university; so, learn
as much as you can in this university."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 92, p.19

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Verily, what will continue to reach a
believer, after his death, from amongst his actions and good deeds are:
the knowledge which he taught and spread, the righteous child whom he
left behind, and the Holy script which he delivered as heritage
(transcribed, and made available)."

Sunan- Ibn-Majeh, vol. 1, p. 88

Abul-Hasan-ir-Ridha’ (as.), the eighth Imam, said: "May the Mercy of
Allah be upon the servant who keeps alive our commandment." Then the
person attending the Imam asked him (‘a) how their commandment could be
kept alive and he (‘a) replied: "He (can) learn our sciences and teach
them to people. In fact, if people knew (the merits and) the goodness of
our statements, surely they would follow us."
