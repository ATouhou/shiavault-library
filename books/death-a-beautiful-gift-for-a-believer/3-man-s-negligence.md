Man's Negligence
================

Old age is a completely new experience for a person. Life loses all its
meaning. One sees that one is about to plunge into an unknown world. One
longs for a ray of hope at this decisive time; but death catches one
unprepared. Suddenly one is robbed of all one's freedom. One enters a
world where one is helpless and forlorn.

Death haunts us all. We tend to forget about it in our youth, but
eventually the hand of fate holds sway. When our life on earth has run
its course we are taken to a world of darkness a world in which we will
be bewildered and confused because we had not prepared for it on
earth.

In the daytime name knows that night is coming. He organizes his day in
accordance with this knowledge. Then, when night falls, he is sure that
soon a new day will break. Yet few are conscious of the coming of the
hereafter. Few look forward to life death as one who travels by day
looks forward to the coming night. Even fewer realize that we will be
exposed to the raging fire of hell after death. Everyone seems to think
that death and hell are for others, not for himself.

**Ready or not, some day it will all come to an end:**

There will be no more sunrises, no minutes, hours or days. All the
things you collected, whether treasured or forgotten, will pass to
someone else. Your wealth, fame and temporal power will shrivel to
irrelevance. It will not matter what you owned or what you were owed.
Your grudges, resentments, frustrations, and jealousies will finally
disappear. So, too, your hopes, ambitions, plans, and to-do lists will
expire.

The wins and losses that once seemed so important will fade away. It
won't matter where you came from, or on what side of the tracks you
lived, at the end. It won't matter whether you were beautiful or
brilliant. Even your gender and skin color will be irrelevant.

So what will matter? How will the value of your days be measured? What
will matter is not what you bought, but what you built; not what you
got, but what you gave. What will matter is not your success, but your
significance. What will matter is not what you learned, but what you
taught. What will matter is every act of integrity, compassion, courage
or sacrifice that enriched, empowered or encouraged others to emulate
your example.

What will matter is not your competence, but your character. What will
matter is not how many people you knew, but how many will feel a lasting
loss when you're gone. What will matter are not your memories, but the
memories that live in those who loved you. What will matter is how long
you will be remembered, by whom and for what. Living a life that matters
doesn't happen by accident. It's not a matter of circumstance but of
choice. Choose to live a life that matters.

"We make a living by what we get; we make a life by what we give."


**How do we prepare for the journey of death?**

When one undertakes to travel in the world there are numerous
preparations to be made:

1. Tickets (means of travel)
2. Passport
3. Visas
4. Inoculations/Health certificates
5. Clothes (befitting the particular climate of the country of
destination)
6. Money (in the right currency or recognized changeable funds)
7. Ensure that all is settled at home e.g. bills paid and etc
8. Leave behind someone trustworthy to look after affairs.

The same criteria apply to the transitional journey of death. The only
difference being that we must be prepared all day, every day as the date
of travel is not known. Fortunately, the tickets are provided by
Almighty and we do not have to bear the cost.

Since there is a choice of destinations, the passport and visa
requirements vary. For the destination of the pleasure of Almighty
(Jannah/Heaven), the passport must confirm Bay'at to Almighty, his
Prophets and the infallibles (Aimma). It must also testify to oneness of
God (Tawheed), Justice (Adala) and Day of Judgment (Qiyama).

For the destination of hell (Jahannam), there is no need of a passport
at all. The visas for heaven are even more difficult to obtain. Numerous
qualifications are required amongst them truthfulness, patience, prayer
(Salaa), poor rate (Zakaa), invite towards good values (Amr Bil Maroof),
forbidding from Evil (Nahi Anal Munkar) and etc.

The clothes are simple and easily obtainable - A kafan (Shroud). The
Holy Prophet (pbuh) has said: "One of the qualities that purify the
heart is to acquire a Kafan."

Make sure all debts are paid or provisions made for them; be they in
monetary terms or in the form of

someone's feelings. Always keep a record of the dues to Almighty (Qadha
Wajibat).

The funds to spend there must be in the right currency. In the
hereafter, the only acceptable currency is rewards (Thawabs). Besides
daily obligatory (Wajibat) and good deeds it is essential to invest in
an investment that will yield constant return until Qiyama
(Thawab-e-Jariya). Leaving behind someone to look after your affairs can
be in the form of bringing up a righteous child and/or serving mankind
by giving Zakaa of time, wealth, knowledge, which will adopt this
role.

**Air Janaza:**

When we are leaving this world for the next one, it shall be like a
trip to another country.

Where details of that country won't be found in a glamorous travel
brochures, but in the Holy Qur'an and the Hadiths.

Where our plane won't be Indian Air Lines, British Airways, Gulf Air or
Emirates, but Air Janaza.

Where our luggage won't be the allowed 30 KGs, but our deeds no matter
how heavy they weigh. You don't pay for excess luggage. They are carried
free of charge, with your Creator's compliment.

Where our dress won't be a Pierre Cardin suit or the like, but the
white cotton shroud.

Where our perfume won't be Channel, Paco Rabane, but the Camphor and
Attar.

Where our passports won't be Indian, British, French or American but
Al-Islam.Where our visa won't be the six months leave to stay or else,
but, The "La Ilaha Illallah."

Where the air hostess won't be a gorgeous female, but Izraeel and its
like.

Where the in-flight services won't be 1st class or economy but a piece
ofbeautifully scented or foul smelling cloth.

Where our place of destination won't be Heathrow Terminal 1or Jeddah
International Terminal but the last Terminal Graveyard.

Where our waiting lounge won't be nice carpeted and air-conditioned
rooms but the 6 feet deep gloomy Grave (Qabr).

Where the Immigration Officer won't be His Majesty's officers, but
Munkar and Nakeer. They only check out whether you deserve the place you
yearn to go.

Where there is no need for Customs Officers or detectors.

Where the transit airport will be Al-Barzakh.

Where our final place of destination will be either the Garden under
which rivers flow or the Hellfire.

This trip does not come with a price tag. It is free of charge, so your
savings would not come handy.

This flight can never be hijacked so do not worry about terrorists.

allergies or whether the food is Halal or Haram?

things of the past.

Do not worry about delays. This flight is always punctual. It arrives
and leaves on time.

Do not worry about the in-flight entertainment program because you
would have lost all your sense of joy.

Do not worry about booking this trip, it has already been booked, the
day you became a fetus in your mother's womb.

Ah! At last good news! Do not worry about who will be sitting next to
you.

You will have the luxury of being the only passenger. So enjoy it while
you can. If only you can!One small snag though, this trip comes with no
warning.

Are you prepared ... you better be prepared!

Just close your eyes and Imagine:

Just close your eyes and imagine,
You have just one more day to live;
One more day to show Allah,
To you "Heaven" should he give?
To say goodbye to your family,
And all your closest friends;
To ask for forgiveness,
And try to make amends;

Just close your eyes and imagine,
Did you miss a prayer or two?
Did you please Allah, and do the things,
He asks every Muslim to do?

Just close your eyes and imagine,
Tomorrow you will be gone;
No more second chances,
To smell the mist of dawn;

Just close your eyes and imagine,
The angels are going to come,
To take your soul and ask,
In your life "what have you done?"

Just close your eyes and imagine,
The words you want to say;
Will not come out you may realize,
For all your deeds you'll pay;
You want to speak out, to cry out,
In Allah I believe;
But, silence beckons you,
No more can you deceive;

Just close your eyes and imagine,
Finally,
Your silence breaks away;
You tell the angels you believe in Allah,
And for him, you did pray;
You say as tears are pouring down,
Please, Allah, forgive me,
For the sins that I committed,
Have mercy is my plea!

Just close your eyes and imagine,
That the smell of musk surrounds you,
From your head down to your feet;
You realize Allah forgave you,
Hell fire you did defeat;

But we all know as Muslims,
When it's time for you to die;
You'll not be given a second chance,
To say a last goodbye;
So live each day as If it's your last,
And never forget to pray;
So when the angels come to ask,
You'll know the words to say.

Remember, you can try, but you can not bury the truth!!!

"It is Allah Who gives you life, then gives you death; then He will
gather you together for the Day of Judgment about which there is no
doubt": But most men do not understand. (Qur'an 45:26)

"Happy is the man who always kept the afterlife in his view, who
remembers the Day of Reckoning through his deeds, who led a contented
life and who was happy with the lot that Allah hath destined for him."
Imam Ali (pbuh)

"Wherever you are, Death will find you out"
This is the tale of an Average Man,
Who acts contrary to Allah's plan,
If you are reflected herein,
Then repent and commit no sin.

It was early in the morning at four,
When death knocked upon a bedroom door,
"Who is there?" The sleeping one cried,
"I am Izraeel, Let me come inside."

At once the man began to shiver,
As one sweating in deadly fever,
He shouted to his sleeping wife,
"Don't let him take away my life."

"Please go away, O Angel of Death!
Leave me alone; I'm not ready yet,
My family depends on me,
Give me a chance, O please perpend!

"The angel knocked again and again,
"Friend! I'll take your life without a pain,
It is your soul Allah requires,
I come not with my own desire."

Bewildered, the man began to cry,
"O Angel, I'm so afraid to die,
I'll give you Gold and be your Slave,
Don't send me to the unlit grave."

"Let me in, O Friend!" The Angel said,
"Open the door; get up from your bed,
If you do not allow me in,
I will walk through it, like a Jinn."

The man held a gun in his right hand,
Ready to defy the Angel's stand,
"I'll point my gun, towards your head,
You dare come in; I'll shoot you dead."

By now the Angel was in the room,
Saying, "O Friend! Prepare for your doom,
Foolish man, Angels never die,
Put down your gun and do not sigh."
"Why are you afraid? Tell me O man,
To die according to Allah's plan?
Come smile at me; do not be grim,
Be Happy to return to Him."

"O Angel! I bow my head in shame,
I had no time to take Allah's name,
From morning till dusk, I made my wealth,
Never even caring for my health."

"Allah's commands, I never obeyed,
Nor five times a day, I ever prayed,
A Ramadan came and a Ramadan went,
But no time had I to repent."

"The Hajj was already fard on me,
But I would not part with my money,
All charities, I did ignore,
Taking usury more and more."

"Sometimes I sipped my favorite wine,
With flirting women I sat to dine,
O Angel! I appeal to you,
Spare my life for a year or two."

"The Laws of Qur'an I will obey,
I'll begin Salaat this very day,
My Fast and Hajj, I will complete,
And keep away from self-conceit."

"I will refrain from usury,
And give all my wealth to charity,
Wine and wenches I will detest,
Allah's oneness I will attest."

We Angels do what Allah demands,
We cannot go against His commands,
Death is ordained for everyone,
Father, mother, daughter or son."

"I'm afraid, this moment is your last,
Now be reminded, more of your past,
I do understand your fears,
But it is now too late for tears."

"You lived in this world, two score and more,
Never did you, your people adore,
Your parents, you did not obey,
Hungry beggars, you turned away."

"Your two ill-gotten, female offspring's,
In nightclubs, for livelihood they sing,
Instead of making more Muslims,
You made your children non-Muslims."

"You ignored the Muezzin's Adhaan,
Nor did you read the Holy Qur'an,
Breaking promises all your life,
Backbiting friends, and causing strife."

"From hoarded goods, great profits you made,
And your poor workers, you underpaid,
Horses and cards were your leisure,
Money-making was your pleasure."

"You ate vitamins, and grew more fat,
With the very sick, you never sat,
A pint of blood, you never gave,
Which could a little baby save."

"O Human, you have done enough wrong,
You bought good properties for a song,
When the farmers appealed to you,
You did not have mercy, this is true."
The ending however, is very sad,
Eventually the man got very mad,
With a cry, he jumped out of bed,
And suddenly, he fell down dead.

O Reader, take a moral from here,
Never know, your end may be near.
Change your living and make amends,
For heaven on your deeds depends.

One of the famous saying of Imam Ali Al-Riza (pbuh) is as follows:

"This world is a prison for a believer"

This world is a prison for a believerand a paradise for the
unbeliever."and a paradise for the unbeliever."This means that a true
believer always aspires toleave this prison of his body and his Nafs
andRuh wants to get closer to the Almighty God, butthose who do not
believe have nothing furtherthan their mortal lives and they aspire to
make ita paradise. But in the process they create theirown hell on earth
for their aspirations are neverending desires for accumulating material
wealth.

Wherever you are, death will find you out; even you are in towers built
up strong and high! (Holy Qur'an 4:78)

What is the purpose of this life?
Money, holidays, a beautiful wife?
There is no point in us denying
Each heart beat brings us closer to dying
You'll breathe your last
Your life will have past
Don't pretend
Death's not the end
You will taste death, death never waited
Look around you, everything's created
It has a creator, it has a meaning
A mother gives birth and then comes it's weaning
The sun rises and gives us light
It sets, then falls, the blanket of night

The plants all grow, when falls the rain
They give fruits to man, and they too will wane
Why does man think that he will get away?
Spending life aimlessly, as if he's here to stay
A fixed time is appointed, everything will perish
Everything you hate, everything you relish
Except the Almighty Allah, He will remain
And then will come judgment, all on one plain
Allah will say, I gave you life
I gave you health, wealth and a wife
What did you do with your time?
What did you do in your prime?
Did you spread my message, did you spread Islam?
Why not? Did you not read the Qur'an?
My friends, we Muslims, we are so blessed
Allah gave us Islam to supercede all the rest
My non-Muslim friends, the Qur'an must be read
Read before it's too late and you're dead
You owe it to yourselves, it will make you cry
You'll know these words are from the Lord most High
Instructing mankind to the purpose of life
And the reward my friends is everlasting life
Our purpose is to worship our Lord most High
The reward is heaven where no one will die
You'll have anything you want, all the best dishes
And Almighty Allah will grant all of your wishes
This life my friends is just a cage

We should live by His orders, to be safe from His rage
You will understand when you read the Holy Qur'an
You'll know the religion of truth is Islam
Protect yourself and your families from hell
Embrace Islam and all will be well
For the deeds of this life, you'll pay the price
In the depths of Hell or in Paradise


**Do you know? What is Hell?**

01. Hell is so deep that if a stone were to be thrown into it, it
would travel for 70 years to reaching at the bottom.

02. The breadth of each of the four walls around Hell is equivalent
to a distance covered by a walking journey of 40 years.

03. Hell has seven (7) gates.

04. Hell had been lit for one thousand years until its flames
became red. Again it was heated for another thousand years till
its color became white. Still again it was burnt for further thousand
years and its white color flames turned pitch black.

05. Even the most fierce fire of this world is 70 fold cooler than the
fire of Hell.

06. The lightest punishment in Hell would be the wearing of fiery shoes
which would cause one's brain to boil.

07. Hell in infested with venomous snakes and scorpions of the size of
donkeys and if they were to bite a person then he or she will suffer
pain for 40 years.

08. For food, the dweller of Hell would be given (Zaqqum) which is a
prickly tree, so bitter, that even if a single molecule of it were to
spill onto this earth it would make all the foodstuff of the world
bitter and unpalatable.

09. For drinking, the denizen of Hell would be provided with hot,
boiling pus mixed with blood, matter, urine and tears etc. of the
dwellers of Hell. If a bucket of this foul liquid were to be splashed
over this earth, the entire world would be upset and disrupted by its
most foul stink.

10. Boiling water would be poured over Jahannami's head and this will
cause their internal organs to melt and leak out through their feet.

11. The inmates of Hell would be lashed with heavy clubs of iron.

12. The dwellers of Hell would be burnt daily for 70 thousand times.
Every time, after the skin and flesh is burnt; they would be restored to
life so that they can continuously taste this punishment.

13. All the haughty people will be gathered in the Hereafter and driven
towards Hell but their bodies would be reduced to the size of Ants and
they will be given to consume the excretions of the dwellers of Hell.

14. Some sinners would be made to climb "SAUD" which is a mountain of
fire in Hell, and then dropped from its peak and this process would
continue forever and ever.

15. The clothes of sinners in Hell would be highly inflammable.

16. Beside physical torture, the dwellers of Hell would also be
subjected to mental harassment through the taunting by the guardian of
Hell who will remind them of their misdeed on earth and remarks "Now
tastes the fire" etc.

17. The sinners and disbelievers would be humiliated to such an extent
that besides their revolting ugliness and pitch black faces, their upper
lips would be touching their foreheads and the lower lip dangling around
the navel.

18. The dwellers of Hell would weep so much and shed so much of tears
and blood that furrows would be formed on their cheeks.

19. The tongues of Hell-inmates would be so long and protruding from
there mouths that others would trample and step on them.

20. The dwellers of Hell would display their rage and fury on those who
led them astray.

21. The inhabitants of Hell would appeal to the guardians of Hell to
intercede on their behalf in the court of Almighty but their pleas would
be rejected. They would make direct supplication to Almighty but their
prayers would not be granted.

22. They will then abide forever in Hell, continuously lamenting and
braying like asses (jungle animals).

"O Allah! Save the compiler, his deceased parents and relatives as well
as the readers and their families and deceased relatives from the
punishment of Hell, and grant us all the high stations of Heaven without
reckoning." Elahi Ameen!

General Knowledge: Elephants may pay homage to dead relatives - The
elephants showed a strong preference towards an elephant skull (middle)
rather than the skulls of a buffalo or a rhino.
