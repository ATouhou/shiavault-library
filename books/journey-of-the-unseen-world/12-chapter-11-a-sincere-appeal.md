Chapter 11 - a Sincere Appeal
=============================

The original text ends here. The translation was not meant for scholars
who can benefit from the book in its original form, but for the public,
so that they may read and benefit by taking stock of their deeds and
actions1 and hopefully atoning, repenting and asking forgiveness, before
death overcomes. God is Most Merciful and if anyone truly repents, God
is willing to forgive completely. In order to maintain interest, at
places the text has been abridged, and lengthy references and
philosophical discourse avoided. Certain sentences footnotes and
explanations have been added to the original text by the translator.

The conditions of the Grave, the Lands of Lust, of Jealousy, of Greed
and Avarice, Satan and the Satanic Twin (Darky) and his destructive
activities, his inciting and misleading arguments wherever possible, the
punishment meted out to the sinners for their wrong deeds, the late of
pride, and good deeds going waste due to certain sins, all these are
occasions for awakening and contemplation. One should try to prepare and
stock deeds for the future because death is inevitable and it closes the
door of action forever. If we fail to do good for our selves ft is
indeed foolishness to expect that our children will act on our behalf
after our death.

We can only expect those deeds which we have managed to do, to come to
our rescue and help, and cannot be certain of anything else.


My God help every body to atone and do good.
All praise is for God.
Peace be upon Mohammed and his progeny.
