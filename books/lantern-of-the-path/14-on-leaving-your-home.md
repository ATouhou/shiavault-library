On Leaving your Home
====================

When you leave your home, do it as if you will never return. Leave only
for the sake of obedience to Allah or for the sake of the faith. Remain
tranquil and dignified in your bearing, and remember Allah both secretly
and openly.

One of the companions of Abu Dharr asked a member of Abu Dharr's
household where he was and she said, 'He has gone out.' When the man
asked when Abu Dharr would return, she replied, 'When he returns is in
the hands of someone else,' for he has no power on his own.

Learn from Allah's creation, both the pious and the deviants, wherever
you go. Ask Allah to place you among His sincere and truthful bondsmen,
and to join you to those of them who have passed on and to gather you in
their company. Praise Him, and give thanks for the appetites He has made
you avoid, and the ugly actions of the wrongdoers from which He has
protected you. Lower your gaze from carnal appetites and forbidden
things, and pursue the right course on your journey. Be vigilant,
fearing Allah at every step, as if you were crossing the straight path.
Do not be distracted. Offer a greeting to His people, both giving it
first and answering with it. Give help to those who ask for it in a
righteous cause, guide those who are lost and ignore the ignorant.

When you return to your home, enter it as a corpse enters the grave,
its only concern being to receive the mercy and forgiveness of Allah.
