====================

• The blind will get vision and the sick will be cured at the hands of
Imam az-Zamaan (a.t.f.s.).[^1]

• During that era, Allah, the Almighty, will dispel all illnesses from
the Shias. They will regain their power and strength.[^2]

• In that time, longevity will be commonplace, so much so that one
person will have a thousand sons. This is sufficient indication of the
long lives prevalent then. Perhaps, one person himself may have a
thousand sons or there will be a thousand sons from his descendants.[^3]
