Sometimes the act of implementing a will is ceremonial; in such cases it
does not make any difference whether the person for whom a will is drawn
will understand it or not. At other times, implementing a will is a
responsibility. The writer wishes to train the person; if he does not do
this action properly, the writer will be responsible.

In such a case, the writer is concerned with the comprehension of the
person. Imam ‘Ali (as) is one of those who is concerned. Thus, he orders
his son to understand it and will not bypass it. It is because this will
contains a sea of knowledge, ethics, and educational principles. Not
taking it seriously clashes with the writer's intention that he had in
making this will applicable and practical. Such negligence on the part
of the reader is not in keeping with the writer's intentions. Therefore,
Imam ‘Ali (as) emphasizes that his son should take this will seriously.
