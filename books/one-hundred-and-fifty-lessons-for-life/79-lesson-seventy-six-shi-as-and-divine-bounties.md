Lesson Seventy Six: Shi’as And Divine Bounties
==============================================

Imam Al-Baqir (a.s.) said to one of his companions

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَبْلِغْ شِيعَتَنا أَنَّهُ لا يُنالُ ما عِنْدَ اللّه إلاّ بِعَمَل.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Declare to our Shias that no one receives divine favors and bounties
except through action.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

This speech of Imam Al-Baqir (a.s.) is a reply to those who suppose that
they could reach the highest position before God only by adopting the
name of Shiism and expressing love to the household of the Prophet
(peace be upon him and his progeny), while we know that in Islam the
important thing is one’s actions . The word “Shiite” is derived from the
word ‘moshaieat’ meaning following somebody. Since the Shiites say that
they are the followers of the household of Prophet (peace be upon him
and his progeny), they must also follow the practices of the Imams in
their day to day life in order to be a true Shia and win divine
blessings.
