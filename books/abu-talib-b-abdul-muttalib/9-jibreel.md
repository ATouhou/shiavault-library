Jibreel
=======

The years passed. Abu Talib became seventy years of age. Our Master
Muhammad [s] was forty years of age. Muhammad went to Hira Cave every
day. In that year, Jibreel came down from the sky. Our Master Muhammad
[s] heard him saying:

*Read! Read! In the name of your Lord who created.*

*He created man from a clot.*

*Read and your Lord is most Honorable, who taught (to write) with the
pen, taught man what he knew not.*

Then Jibreel said:

Muhammad, you're Allah's Messenger and I'm Jibreel.

Muhammad came back from Hira Cave holding the Mission of the Heavens.

His wife, Khadijah, believed in him. His cousin Ali bin Abu Talib
believed in him, too.

One day, while our Master Muhammad [s] was praying and Ali was behind
him, Abu Talib came and said kindly:

*My nephew, what are you doing?*

The Prophet [s] said:

*We're praying to Allah according to the religion of Islam.*

Abu Talib said happily:

*There's no harm in what you're doing.*

Then he said to his son Ali:

*Ali, support your cousin. He does nothing but good.*
