------------------------------------------------------------------------

[^1] It is customary for Arabic Grammarians to commence their Naḥw works
with a treatment of Kalām. The main reason for this is that Kalām is the
goal that the study of Arabic Naḥw aspires to. In other words, by
following and applying the rules of Naḥw the Arabic learner is able to
produce Kalām in the same manner (naḥw) as the ancient Arabs produced
Kalām based on their natural and innate ability and competence. Naḥw,
then, is no more than the explication of rules which the ancient Arabs
used and applied implicitly and on a subconscious level to produce
Kalām. The primary motivation for the development of Naḥw was the
corruption of this very natural ability to produce grammatically
well-formed sentences in the wake of a mass influx of foreigners from
neighbouring countries. It was feared that if the Arabs lost this
ability or it died with them then it would be lost forever which meant
that the message and guidance of the Holy Qur’an would always be
inaccessible to its readers.

Another equally valid reason for commencing with Kalām is that Kalām
provides the context and creates the conditions for the occurrence of
I‘rāb (declinability) which forms the primary subject-matter of Naḥw. In
other words, Kalām, by virtue of it being a compound utterance, makes it
possible for one word to precede another such that the former is able to
change the ending of the latter. This very change that is effected at
the endings of words is what the Arabic Grammarians call I‘rāb. In fact,
Naḥw itself is occasionally referred to as ‘Ilm al-I‘rāb.

From the above it follows that Naḥw is no more than a study of:

I‘rāb, its types (Raf‘, Naṣb, Khafḍ and Jarr) as well as its opposite
Binā’ (indeclinability) and its types

the declinable (Mu‘rab) and indeclinable (Mabniyy) words that exist in
Arabic and the categories and classes into which they are divided

the various signs (‘Alāmāt) with which the Mu‘rab (in all its types) is
declined and the signs on which the Mabniyy is fixed and established,
and

the places (Mawāḍi‘) in which the Mu‘rab is so declined.

Furthermore, Naḥw, and hence this present work, does not deal with the
structure of the individual word and the changes (other than I‘rāb) that
affect its structure. This study of the word, instead, is treated under
Ṣarf (Morphology) which, according to the later Grammarians, is an
autonomous science independent of Naḥw. However, this does not rule out
the occasional treatment of Ṣarf in this work due to the fact that some
aspects of Naḥw are contingent on Ṣarf in that the latter furnishes the
requisite background information for an adequate understanding of these
aspects.

[^2] The word “compound” (Murakkab) refers to any utterance that is
composed of two or more words whether it conveys a complete sense or
not. The inclusion of Murakkab in the definition excludes the simple or
single utterance (Lafz Mufrad) from the concept of Kalām. In other
words, Kalām is not a simple or single utterance like:  زيد  (Zayd),
قامَ  (stood), etc.

[^3] The word “utterance” (Lafz) denotes any sound that consists of some
of the letters of the Alphabet whether it is actually used in Arabic
(Musta‘mal/Mauḍū‘) or not (Muhmal) and whether it is simple (Mufrad) or
compound (Murakkab). The inclusion of Lafz in the definition excludes
anything that is not uttered from the idea of Kalām like writing,
sign-language, etc. Thus, every form of communication that does not
involve speaking, or any non-verbal sign is excluded from the
definition.

[^4] The expression “that conveys a complete and self-contained meaning”
(Mufīd) excludes the compound utterance that does not convey a complete
and self-contained meaning (Murakkab Ghayr Mufīd) e.g.  هلْ زيدٌ  (Is
Zayd…?),  إِنْ قامَ زيدٌ  (If Zayd stands…), etc.

[^5] Bi al-Waḍ‘ has been variously interpreted to mean (a) according to
Arabic usage as opposed to Turkish, English or Persian usage, for
example, and (b) with the intention to communicate a message so as to
exclude the “talking” of parrots and sleep-talkers for in none of the
cases is there any intention to communicate a message.

[^6] The Ism is generally defined as a word that denotes a meaning that
is complete in and by itself without time forming a part of that
meaning. By “complete in and by itself” we mean that the meaning of the
Ism can be completely understood independently and without reference to
anything else. While Ism is equivalent to the Noun in English it is much
wider in scope. The Ism in Arabic, apart from including words signifying
concrete things such as people, animals, plants, inanimate objects, or
abstract things such as actions, states, qualities, also includes
English adjectives, adverbs, some prepositions, etc. This accounts for
the initial confusion experienced by Arabic beginners when they are told
that the following are nouns in Arabic:  جَميل  (beautiful),  قائمٌ  (is
standing),  معَ  (with),  أمامَ  (in front),  خَلْفَ  (behind),  عِنْدَ
(at, with), etc.

As will be seen in the discussion of the signs of the Ism, the Fi‘l and
the Ḥarf, what determines a word to be an Ism, Fi‘l or Ḥarf is the
presence or absence of particular signs in the word rather than the
meaning that it denotes. Thus, a word could have the meaning of a Fi‘l
but because it lacks the signs of the Fi‘l it is regarded as an Ism
instead. Likewise, a word could have the meaning of a Ḥarf but because
it displays the signs of a Fi‘l it is regarded as Fi‘l.

[^7] The Fi‘l is generally defined as a word that denotes a meaning (in
the form of an action, state or quality) that is complete in and by
itself with time being a part of it. Another way of defining the Fi‘l is
to say that it is a word signifying the occurrence of an action in one
of the three tenses (Past, Present and Future i.e. before, during and
after the time of speaking respectively).

[^8] The Ḥarf is generally defined as a word that denotes a meaning that
is not complete in and by itself such that its meaning cannot be
completely understood except with reference to an Ism or a Fi‘l. It
follows that the meaning of the Ḥarf is always relative such that it
cannot be comprehended except with reference to words other than itself.
The number of Ḥurūf that exist in Arabic is said to be eighty. The
following are some of the meanings and usages associated with the Ḥarf:

Nafy (negation), Jawāb (responding), Tafsīr (explaining), Sharṭ
(conditionality), Taḥḍīḍ (urgent request), ‘Arḍ (mild request), Tanbīh
(calling attention to something), Istiqbāl (marking the Future), Taukīd
(emphasis), Istifhām (interrogation), Tamannī (expressing a wish),
Tarajjī and Ishfāq (expressing hope and pity), Tashbīh (comparison),
Ta‘līl (causality), Rad‘ and Zajr (rebuke), Ta’nīţ (femininity), Sakt
(pausing), Nidā’ (calling by way of address), Ṭalab (request in
general), etc.

[^9] The reason for this qualification is to distinguish the word Ḥ arf
as a particle from the word Ḥarf as a letter of the Arabic alphabet. A
letter is not used to signify a meaning i.e. it has no Semantic value.
Instead, it is used as a unit in the construction of words. The two uses
of the word Ḥarf are clearly illustrated in the following expression:

<p dir="rtl">
"مِنْ"حرف مكوَّن منحرفين
</p>

[”Min” is a Ḥarf (particle) composed of two Ḥarfs (letters)]

[^10] Khafḍ, as will be mentioned in the Chapter on I‘rāb, is a
particular change at the end of a word in the form of a Kasrah, or one
of its substitute signs (the Fatḥah and Ya’), caused by an ‘Āmil. Khafḍ
occurs in three places viz:

when a declinable Ism is preceded by a Ḥarf Jarr e.g.

when it occurs as the Muḍāf ilayh e.g.

when it occurs as a Tābi‘ of one of the two previous cases e.g.

Each of these three places is illustrated in the Basmalah i.e. بسمِ
اللهِ الرحمنِ الرحيم

Thus, the noun اسمِ   ends in a Kasrah because it is preceded by a Ḥarf
Jarr, the Lafz al-Jalālah (i.e. the Expression of Majesty), viz. اللهِ
ends in a Kasrah because it is the Muḍāf ilayh and الرحمنِ   ends in a
Kasrah because it is the Tābi‘ of the Lafz al-Jalālah.

From the above it is clear that Khafḍ does not mean for a word to merely
have a Kasrah at the end but that such a Kasrah should, in addition, be
the result of an ‘Āmil such as a Ḥarf Jarr or Muḍāf ilayh. What this
means is that a word may have a Kasrah at its end but because that
Kasrah was not caused by an ‘Āmil, it cannot be said to be Khafḍ.

Similarly, a word may be preceded by an ‘Āmil of Khafḍ (such as the Ḥarf
Jarr or Muḍāf ilayh) but will not necessary be marked with a Kasrah at
its end (whether actually or hypothetically), due to the fact that the
word might be Mabniyy (indeclinable). It is for this reason that the
author mentions the Ḥurūf al-Khafḍ as an independent sign or marker of
the Ism since by virtue of it a number of Mabniyy words have been
classified under the category of Ism which might otherwise not have been
classified as such.

Furthermore, Khafḍ is equivalent to the more commonly used term Jarr.
The former is used by the Kufa school of Arabic grammar while the latter
is used by the Basran school of Arabic grammar. From this it appears
that the author inclines towards the Kufan school which is further
corroborated by him subscribing to other Kufan views as will be seen
later.

At this point it is in order to mention a brief note on the Arabic
grammar schools. These schools resemble the four Mađhabs in Fiqh but
rather than being named after particular personalities the Arabic
grammar schools have been named after the cities and countries in which
they operated and were dominant. Of these schools the Basrah and Kufah
schools have always dominated the Arabic grammar scene and of the two
schools the views of the Basran school seem to be more in vogue. The
famous Persian grammarian, Sībawayh, was Basran and his contemporary,
Al-Kisā’iyy, one of the Seven Qurrā’ (Readers), was a representative of
the Kufan Arabic school.

[^11] The Tanwīn is defined as a Nūn Sākinah (unvowelled Nūn) suffixed
to Asmā’ which even though it is pronounced as a Nūn Sākinah is not
written as one but rather as “the second of two Ḥarakahs” i.e. the
second of two Ḍammahs, two Fatḥahs or two Kasrahs e.g.

Rarulun - Rajulan - Rajulin

<p dir="rtl">
رجلٌ ، رجلاً ، رجلٍ
</p>

The use of the phrase “the second of two Ḥarakahs” to refer to the
Tanwīn is metaphorical since a Ḥarakah does not really and literally
give the sound of a Nūn Sākinah.

Moreover, it is commonly believed that the Tanwīn constitutes both
Ḥarakahs (vowel markings) but this belief is erroneous for the following
reasons:

Two Ḍammahs, two Fatḥahs or two Kasrahs are pronounced as un , an , or
in respectively, that is, a Ḥarakah (u, a, i) plus a Nūn Sākinah (n ),
whereas the Tanwīn is pronounced asn which is a Nūn Sākinah only.
Moreover, the way these two Ḥarakahs are pronounced is  أٌ   أً   and
إٍ  (i.e. ’un , ’an , and ’in ) in which case they do not consist merely
of a Ḥarakah (u, a, i) and a Nūn Sākinah (n ) but also a Hamzah (’). In
other words, not only is it erroneous to say that the Tanwīn constitutes
both Ḥarakahs but to pronounce the two Ḥarakahs as though they are borne
on a Hamzah is even more erroneous.

It is known that the Tanwīn is dropped from an Ism when the definite
article “al” is prefixed to it since the two cannot co-exist on one Ism.
However, when “al” is added only one of the two Ḥarakahs is dropped and
not both. For example, we say before the prefixing of “al”:  كتابٌ
(Kitābun ) and after its prefixing: الكتابُ  (al-Kitābu). Note that only
then is dropped and not un as a whole.

It is also known that the Tanwīn of the Muḍāf (annexed noun) is also
dropped such that the word  كتابُ  (Kitābu) in  كتابُ زيدٍ  (Kitābu
Zaydin) was  كتابٌ  (Kitābun ) prior to it becoming the Muḍāf. Again we
find that only then is dropped and not the un which attests to the
Tanwīn being only one of the two Ḥarakahs and not both.

The only time that the Tanwīn is dropped together with the Ḥarakah is
when a pause is made on a word. Thus, in the case of  كتابٌ  (Kitābun )
when we pause on it we say:  كتابْ  (Kitāb) such that not only is then
dropped but un as a whole. A possible reason for the belief that the
Tanwīn constitutes both Ḥarakahs is that the Tanwīn when it is
pronounced it is always pronounced with the particular Ḥarakah preceding
it In other words, while the preceding Ḥarakah can exist without the
Tanwīn the Tanwīn cannot exist without the preceding Ḥarakah.

What this amounts to is that a Ḥarakah cannot be a Tanwīn and give the
sound ofn except when it is written with another Ḥarakah, because if the
Tanwīn is distinguished by being the second of two Ḥarakahs it cannot be
the second without another Ḥarakah being the first. The moment a Ḥarakah
appears alone it always gives the sound of Ḥarakah in the real sense of
the word, i.e. a Ḍammah (u), Fatḥah (a) or Kasrah (i) and not that of
the Tanwīn. Since the “Ḥarakah” indicating the Tanwīn cannot appear
alone and must out of necessity appear with another Ḥarakah it is more
convenient – especially for beginners – to refer to both Ḥarakahs as the
Tanwīn. However, this is technically incorrect and has to be unlearnt
eventually as it will hamper a correct understanding of more advanced
Arabic concepts.

A final point on the Tanwīn is that when it is the second of two Fatḥahs
it is transformed into an Alif when pausing on the word such that the
sound of the Fatḥah is prolonged. This is the reason why a word with a
double Fatḥah is almost always written with an Alif at its end. Thus,
كتاباً  (Kitaban ) becomes كتاباَ (Kitabā) when a pause is performed. An
exception to this rule is the Ta’ Marbūṭah

[^12] A more detailed explanation of the Ḥurūf al-Khafḍ/al-Jarr will be
provided later in the Chapter on the Makhfūḍat al-Asmā’ (places of Khafḍ
in the Ism) since the author merely mentions them here as one of the
characteristics of the Ism such that when one of them precedes a word
directly then that word is an Ism. Thus, each of the underlined words in
the examples given above is an Ism because it is preceded by a Ḥarf
Khafḍ/Jarr.

[^13] The author does not give any examples for the Ḥurūf al-Jarr which
is why I thought it appropriate to give examples so as to clarify the
meanings and illustrate their operation and effect on the Ism. I have
placed the examples between brackets to indicate that they are not part
of the text.

[^14] The author mentions the Ḥurūf al-Qasam separately from the Ḥurūf
al-Khafḍ/Jarr even though they form part of the Ḥurūf al-Khafḍ/Jarr to
emphasise the point that only these three Ḥurūf are used to indicate
Qasam.

[^15] The function of this Tā’ is to indicate that the Fā‘il (and other
similar structures) to whose Fi‘l it is suffixed, is feminine.
Furthermore, the author’s qualification of “unvowelled” (الساكنة) is to
distinguished the تاء التأنيثالساكنة   from the تاء التأنيثالمتحركة
(“vowelled” Tā’ of Femininity) which is suffixed to the Ism in the form
of the Ta’ Marbūṭah (closed Tā’ or Tā’ whose ends are joined) e.g.
مدرّسة (a female teacher),  مُسلمة (a female Muslim). Even though the
تاء التأنيث الساكنة is unvowelled as its name indicates it nevertheless
becomes vowelled when the letter following it is also unvowelled. The
reason why it is vowelled in this case is to avoid the meeting of two
unvowelled letters which Arabs found difficult to pronounce e.g. جاءت ِ
المدرستان وجلست َا في الفصل  (“The two female teachers came and sat in
the classroom”). In the first case the Ta’ is followed by the unvowelled
Lam (since the Hamzah Wasl is to be ignored during continuous speech)
and in the second case it is followed an Alif (the Alif of Iţnatayn –
feminine dual) which is always unvowelled.

[^16] In other words, the Ḥarf does not feature any of the signs of the
Ism and the Fi‘l such that the absence of a nominal or verbal sign is
what marks and characterizes the Ḥarf and distinguishes it from the Ism
and Fi‘l. The Ḥarf can be equated with the letter ح which is
distinguished from the ج and the خ by the absence of a dot under or
above it.

[^17] The author uses I‘rāb here in the sense of declinability in
contrast to Binā‘ (indeclinability) which is when the ending of word
permanently exists in a particular state despite the entry of different
‘Awāmil. In short, the difference between I‘rāb and Binā‘ is that the
former is a process involving change and the latter a state involving
permanence and stability. Furthermore, while the author covers I‘rāb
quite extensively in this brief treatise, he does not deal with Binā’ at
all. The reason for this is that I‘rāb involves complex changes and
permutations affecting different word-types in different contexts and
environments all of which requires explanation and clarification. Binā’,
on the other hand, involves minimal change if any at all such that not
much can be said about it and can therefore be dispensed with as the
author has done here.

Moreover, as mentioned before, I‘rāb refers to a process of change and
Binā’ to a fixed state. On the other, the word whose ending is subject
to change is called Mu‘rab and the word whose ending occurs in a fixed
state is called Mabniyy. An example of a word that is Mu‘rab is the Ism
المدرس in the following three sentences:

جاء المدرسُ                 (The teacher came)

سألت المدرسَ                (I asked the teacher)

سلمت المدرسِ               (I greeted the teacher)

An example of a word that is Mabniyy is the Ism هؤلاءِ in the following
three sentences:

جاء هؤلاءِ                                            [These (people)
came]

سألت هؤلاءِ                         [I asked these (people)]

سلمت على هؤلاءِ                                [I greeted these
(people)]

Notice in the first set of examples how the ending of  المدرس    which
is the Sīn, first changes to a Ḍammah, then to a Fatḥah and then to a
Kasrah while in the second set of examples the ending of  هؤلاءِ
which is the second Hamzah, remains fixed with a Kasrah even though both
words occur in the exact same context and environment.

The term “I‘rāb” is also used to mean syntactic analysis (or parsing)
where a sentence is broken up into its constituent parts (the words) and
analysed according to word-type or word-class, place of I‘rāb, sign of
I‘rāb or Binā’, whether real (Ḍāhir) or hypothetical (Muqaddar), etc.
Once the constituent parts have been analysed the Mu‘rib (Syntactic
Analyst) moves on to the level of the sentence (Jumlah). Here he
isolates all the possible sentences and states whether or not they
occupy particular places of I‘rāb by standing in place of the Asmā’ and
Af‘āl that normally occupy those places.

[^18] The purpose of I‘rāb is to distinguish between different
grammatical functions and roles such as the Doer, Object, Subject,
Predicate, Adverb, etc., which come into existence with the production
of Kalām. In English these grammatical functions and roles are
determined from the word-order. English has an SVO word-order i.e.
Subject-Verb-Object word-order. Thus, in English you say “Zayd hit Bakr”
in this order to indicate that ‘Zayd’ is the Subject, ‘hit’ the Verb and
‘Bakr’ the Object. If we were to reverse the order and say “Bakr hit
Zayd” then ‘Bakr’ would be the Subject and ‘Zayd’ the Object. In Arabic
it does not matter in which order these three words occur the Subject
will always be the noun ending in a Ḍammah and the Object the noun
ending in a Fatḥah. Thus, in each of the following sentences ‘Zayd’ is
the Subject (whether of a verbal or nominal sentence) and ‘Bakr’ the
Object:

ضَرب زيدٌ بكراً   VSO                                        ضَرب بكراً
زيدٌ       VOS

زيدٌ ضَرب بكراً   SVO                                        بكراً ضَرب
زيدٌ       OVS

Hence, because of I‘rāb Arabic has a flexible word-order as can be seen
from the aforementioned examples while in English the word-order is
fixed.

[^19] I‘rāb only features in the Ism and the Fi‘l and not in the Ḥarf.
Moreover, in the case of the Ism it generally does not apply to the
Ḍamīr (personal pronoun), Ism al-Ishārah (demonstrative/indicative
pronoun), Ism Mauṣūl (relative pronoun), Ism Alistifhām (interrogative
pronoun), compound numbers from eleven until nineteen, some types of
Ḍarf (adverb), etc. As for the Fi‘l, I‘rāb does not feature in the Māḍī,
Amr and the Muḍāri‘ that has the Nūn an-Niswah/al-Ināţ (Nun of the
Feminine Plural) or the Nūn al-Taukīd (Nūn of Corroboration) suffixed to
it.

Furthermore, the author treats of I‘rāb generally i.e. he deals with the
I‘rāb of the Ism and the Fi‘l together rather than separately. The
advantage of this method from a didactic point of view is that the
learner does not have to wait for the completion of the I‘rāb of one
word-type like the Ism, for example, before he can proceed with the
I‘rāb of the Fi‘l, and so on. The disadvantage, however, is that the
learner has to deal with two distinct word-types/parts of speech at the
same time and this might be confusing to the beginner.

[^20] ‘Awāmil is the plural of ‘Āmil which refers to any word that
causes the ending of another word to change in the sense described
above. The word that undergoes the change is called the Ma‘mūl (fīhi)
and the change itself the ‘Amal (which is synonymous with I‘rāb). In the
examples mentioned in footnote(17) the wordsسأل ، جاء    and على
constitute the ‘Āmil and the words المدرس and هؤلاء  the Ma‘mūl and the
changes with the Ḍammah, the Fatḥah and the Kasrah at the end ofالمدرس
the ‘Amal. Even though هؤلاء does not feature any particular change at
its ending it is still regarded as a Ma‘mūl because the places that it
occupies, namely, the Fa‘il, Maf‘ūl bihī and Masbūq bi Ḥarf Jarr, are
governed by the ‘Awāmil such that their effect is distributed over
هؤلاء  as a whole without the change having to be noticeable. In other
words, it is not necessary for a word to undergo a change at its ending
in order for it to be a Ma‘mūl but that it is sufficient that it only
occupies a place governed by an ‘Āmil like  هؤلاء  .

[^21] Taqdīran simply means that there is a change at the ending of the
word but something prevents this change from being pronounced or uttered
like (a) when it is difficult (al-Tiqal) for the Ḍammah and Kasrah to be
pronounced on the Wāw or Yā’ or (b) when it is impossible (al-Ta‘aḍḍur)
for the Alif to be vowelled with any of the three vowels (Ḍammah, Fatḥah
and Kasrah) since the Alif is always unvowelled (i.e. it always bears a
Sukūn) or (c) when the Yā’ al-Mutakillim (the Yā’ of the first person
singular) forces a Kasrah on the letter before it due to correspondence
(al-Munāsabah) and thus preventing the appearance of the Ḥarakah of
I‘rāb on that letter.

Furthemore, some Grammarians add the stipulation Maḥallan to the present
definition to point to the fact that a Mabniyy word even though it does
not display any change at its ending whether Lafđan or Taqdīran, the
effect of I‘rāb is distributed over the whole word such that the whole
word occupies a particular Maḥall (place/location) of I‘rāb. Therefore,
in the case of I‘rāb Lafđan and Taqdīran the effect is confined to the
end of the word whereas in the case of I‘rāb Maḥallan the effect is
distributed over the word as a whole.

[^22] The Ism in Arabic from the perspective of number is of three
types: Mufrad (singular) Muţannā (dual i.e. two) and Jam‘ (plural i.e.
three and more). The Jam‘ is further divided into Jam‘ Taṣḥīḥ/Salāmah
(sound plural i.e. the singular form remains intact when the plural is
formed) and Jam‘ Taksīr (broken plural i.e. the singular form undergoes
a change when the plural is formed e.g. كتاب  → كُتُب  ). The former is,
furthermore, sub-divided into Jam‘ Muđakkar Sālim [sound masculine
plural i.e. the mere addition of       ـِيْنَ / ـُوْنَ (–ūna/–īna) at
the end of the singular form e.g.  مدرِّس → مدرِّسُوْن َ /مدرِّسِيْن َ ]
and Jam‘ Mu’annath Sālim [sound feminine plural i.e. the mere addition
ofـَاتٍ / ـَاتٌَ (–ātun /–ātin ) at the end of the singular form after
dropping the Tā’ Marbūṭah e.g. مدرِّسة   → مدرِّسَاتٌٍ   ]. In addition,
both the Mufrad and the Jam‘ Taksīr are either Munṣarif
(fully-declinable/triptote i.e. it is able to go from the Ḍammah to the
Kasrah in its declension from Raf‘ to Jarr) or Ghayr Munṣarif
(semi-declinable/diptote i.e. it only goes as far as the Fatḥah in its
declension such that the Fatḥah which is the regular sign of Naṣb is
retained and used as a sign of Jarr as well).

[^23] This refers to the Muḍāri‘ that does not have the following
appendages suffixed to them:

the Nūn al-Taukīd (Nūn of Corroboration), in which case it is Mabniyy on
the Fatḥah:

تكتبَنْ / تكتبَنَّ  and  يكتبَنْ / يكتبَنَّ

the Nūn al-Niswah/al-Ināţ (Nūn of the feminine plural), in which case it
is Mabniyy on a Sukūn: يكتبْنَ / تكتبْنَ

the Alif al-Iţnayn (Alif of duality), the Wāw al-Jamā-‘ah (Wāw of
masculine plural) and Yā’ al-Mukhāṭabah (Yā’ of the second person
feminine singular), in which case it is Mu‘rab with the fixing of the
in the case of Raf‘, and the dropping of the  in the case of Naṣb and
Jazm, and is referred to as the al-Amţilah/al-Af‘āl Khamsah (five
patterns/verbs):

<p dir="rtl">
يفعلـا ن، يفعلـا ن، يفعلو ن، يفعلو ن، يفعليـ ن
</p>

[^24] Some grammarians addهنو ك (yourthing ) as a sixth one, but the
more correct view is that it has the I‘rab (declension) of the Ism
Mufrad.

[^25] The term Nāṣib, even though it can refer to anything that can
serve as an ‘Āmil of Naṣb, its usage has nevertheless been restricted to
refer to a member of a set of particles that make the Fi‘l the Manṣūb
collectively called the Nawāṣib (sing. Nāîib). These particles are dealt
with in the Chapter of the Af‘āl.

[^26] The al-Ism allađī lā yanṣarifu – also referred to as the Mamnū‘
min al-Ṣarf and the Ism Ghayr Munṣarif – is an Ism Mufrad or Jam‘ Taksir
that is debarred from the Tanwīn in its normal state (i.e. when it does
not have the definite article  "ألْ"  prefixed to it). This is the case
in the following four categories of Ism:

Any ‘Alam (proper noun) when it is one of the following: (a) feminine
(عائشة، حمزة)  (b) foreign  (إبراهيم، يوسف)  (c) mixed compound
(حضرَموت، بيتَلحم)  (d) ends in additional Alif and Nūn  (عثمان، لقمان)
(e) occurs on a pattern specific to verbs  (أحمد، يعمُر)  and (f) occurs
on the pattern of  فُــعَـــل  (عُمَر، زُفَر)

Any Ṣifah (descriptive noun) when it is one of the following: (a) ends
in an additional Alif and Nūn  (عَطشان، جَوعان)  (b) occurs on a pattern
specific to the Fi‘l  (أحسَن، أحمَر)  and (c) occurs on the pattern of
فُــعَــال  or  مَــفْــعَــل  (مَثنى، ثُلاث، رُباع)

Any Ism ending with the Alif al-Ta’nīţ (Alif indicating femininity)
(حُسنى، حَسناء، مَرضى، عُلَماء)

Any Jam‘ whose third letter is an additional letter followed by either
two letters or three letters the middle one being a Ḥarf Madd and is
called the Ṣīghah Muntahā al-Jumū ‘ or al-Jam‘ al-Aqṣā (final/extreme
plural)  (مَساجِد، مَفاتيح، دراهم، دنانير، كُسالى، عَطايا)

[^27] The Sukūn, even though it is not a Ḥarakah, is nevertheless
included under the general term Ḥarakāt. Here the use of the word
Ḥarakāt to include the Sukūn is an instance of the use of a word that
signifies the majority (i.e. the Ḍammah, Fatḥah and Kasrah) to include
the minority (i.e. the Sukūn). Another reason that warrants the use of
the word Ḥarakāt in the afore mentioned sense is the fact that the Sukūn
is the opposite of Ḥarakah and is sometimes referred to as Ḥađf
al-Ḥarakah (the dropping of the Ḥarakah) so that the word Ḥarakāt
signifies the three Ḥarakāt as well as their opposite, the Sukūn.

[^28] These vowels are the Ḍammah, Fatḥah, Kasrah and Ḥazf al-Ḥarakah
(omission of the vowel) which is the Sukūn. Technically speaking the
Sukūn is not a vowel but because it stands for the absence of one it has
been included under the term Ḥarakāt in this case. Furthermore, these
Ḥarakāt are equivalent to your English short vowels.

[^29] These Ḥurūf are the Wāw, Alif, Yā’ and Nūn (its attachment and
detachment), the first three lengthening the Ḍammah, Fatḥah and Kasrah
respectively to correspond to your long vowels in English. Furthermore,
the Ya’ preceded by a Fatḥah in the Muţanna in the case of Naṣb and Jarr
corresponds to the English dipthong [ai]. A dipthong is a combination of
two vowels which in this case are the [a] and [i] as is clear from the
way in which it is represented, viz. [ai]. The opposite of a dipthong is
a monopthong which is a single vowel. On the other, the appropriateness
of the Nūn as a sign of declension together with the Wāw, Alif and Yā’
is the fact it is often interchanged with one of these letters
especially the Alif like when the Alif replaces the Nūn in the form of a
Tanwīn when pausing on a word ending in a Fatḥah Tanwīn.

[^30] In order for these Asmā’ to be declined with a Wāw for Raf‘, an
Alif for Naṣb and a Yā’ for Jarr the following conditions have to be
met:

they have to be Mufrad and not Muţannā or Jam‘

they have to be Mukabbar (i.e. non-diminutive) and not Muṣagh-ghar
(diminutive)

they have to be Muḍāf (annexed)

they have to be Muḍāf to other than the Yā’ al-Mutakallim (Yā’ of the
first person singular)

In addition to these four conditions,  (ذو)  has to have the meaning of
(صاحب)  (possessor/owner of) and not be a relative pronoun (Ism Mauṣūl)
according to the dialect of Tay’ and  (الفم)  has to have its Mīm
dropped.

[^31] What is meant by the “Five Verbs” is not that they consist of five
verbs only nor that they occur only on the scales of the five verbs
mentioned in the text but rather any Muḍāri‘ that has the Alif of the
Dual, the Wāw of the Masculine Plural or the Yā’ of the Second Person
Feminine Singular suffixed to it whether it occurs on the scales
mentioned in the text or not. Hence, the verb could be Mujarrad or
Mazīd, Ṣaḥīḥ (Strong) or Mu‘tall (Weak), Ma‘lūm (Active) or Majhūl
(Passive), etc.

[^32] The Yā’ that is preceded by a Fatḥah and followed by a Kasrah (as
opposed to the Yā’ of the Muţanna. See next footnote).

[^33] The Yā’ that is preceded by a Kasrah and followed by a Fatḥah (as
opposed to the Yā’ of the Jam‘ Muđakkar Sālim. See previous footnote).

[^34] Strictly speaking, the Fi‘l constitutes only the part highlighted
in red. It is therefore wrong to translate the Fi‘l  كَتَبَ  as “he
wrote” but rather as “wrote” or “writing in the past”. The reason for
this is that “he wrote” is the translation of a complete sentence
namely:  كَتَبَ (هُوَ)  i.e. the Fi‘l together with the Ḍamīr that is
normally dormant or latent in it when used in speech. Another reason is
that we have defined a Fi ‘l as a “word that signifies the occurrence of
an action in one of the three tenses” and nowhere is it mentioned that
the Ḍamīr is part of its meaning.

[^35] It does not matter whether the Fatḥah is Ḍāhirah (verbally
expressed) or Muqaddarah (conceived in the mind only) such that even if
the Fatḥah does not appear to be physically present in speech it is
nevertheless assumed to be present. This is the case when the Wāw
al-Jamā‘ah or Ḍamīr Raf‘ Mutaḥarrik are suffixed to the Fi‘l. In the
case of the Wāw al-Jamā‘ah the Fi‘l appears to be Mabniyy on a Ḍammah –
which is not really the case. The Ḍammah is merely there because of its
correspondence with the Wāw al-Jamā‘ah other wise the Fi‘l is still
Mabniyy on the Fatḥah which has only temporarily been driven and forced
out by the Ḍammah which is required by the Wāw al-Jamā‘ah for the sake
of correspondence. In the case of the Ḍamīr Raf‘ Mutaḥarrik the Fi‘l
appears to be Mabniyy on a Sukūn which is not actually the case. The
Sukūn is only there so as to break the sequence of four consecutive
vowelled letters in what is considered to be a single word since because
Arabic does not contain four-letter words all of which are vowelled. The
Fi‘l already consists of three vowelled letters and with the suffixing
of the Ḍamīr Raf‘ Mutaḥarrik – which together with the Fi‘l is regarded
as one word – it now consists of four vowelled letters each following in
succession. To break this succession of vowels the Fatḥah on the final
letter of the Fi‘l is dropped and replaced with a Sukūn. The Sukūn,
therefore, is merely there to break the succession of four consecutive
vowels otherwise the Fi‘l still remains Mabniyy on the Fatḥah which has
temporarily been dropped due to the aforementioned reason.

There is also the view – which is easier for beginners – that maintains
that the Fi‘l is actually Mabniyy on the Ḍammah or Sukūn in the case of
– for example – ضربُوا  and  ضربْتُ  respectively, and not on an implied
or assumed Fatḥah.

[^36] The view that the Amr is Majzūm is Kufan since the Basran view is
that it is Mabniyy (fixed) on the sign with which the Muḍāri‘ is Majzūm.
This, furthermore, reiterates the view that the author had certain Kufan
leanings. The Amr – based on this view – does not constitute a separate
category of the Fi‘l but instead is a Fi‘l Muḍāri‘ which is Majzūm with
the Lām al-Amr. Due to excessive use the Lām was then dropped and
likewise the Tā’ of al-Muḍāra‘ah (i.e. the Tā’ which causes the Fi‘l to
become Muḍāri‘). If the Fi‘l then commences with a Sākin (unvowelled
letter) a Hamzah al-Waṣl is introduced to enable the pronunciation of
the Sākin except the Fourth Form  أَفْعَلَ  in which case its original
Hamzah al-Qaṭ‘ is restored.

[^37] These letters are called the Aḥruf al-Muḍāra‘ah as they cause the
Fi‘l to become Muḍāri‘. Furthermore, they are vowelled with a Ḍammah if
the Fi‘l consists of four letters or it is in the Majhūl (passive) form
other wise they are vowelled with a Fatḥah. In addition, the Alif is
used for the first person singular, the Nūn for the first person plural
(or singular but used in the royal sense), the Yā’ for the third person
masculine (singular, dual and plural) and the third person feminine
plural and the Tā’ for the second person throughout (i.e. masculine and
feminine, singular, dual and plural) and the third person feminine
singular and dual.

[^38] The actual, Nawāṣib, according to the Basran school, are the first
four. The remaining six, according to the them, do not effect Naṣb by
themselves but rather via the particle  "أنْ"  that is assumed to be
hidden after them. The reason for this assumption is to maintain a
uniform and single function for these six particles such that if they
perform a particular function in one context then that function should
be maintained in other contexts for the purpose of uniformity and
simplicity. Thus, the two lams as well as Ḥattā function normally as
Ḥurūf al-Jarr and should therefore continue to do so even in this
context. It is not acceptable that they should perform the function of
Jarr in one context and then that of Naṣb in another context while at
the same the meaning in both contexts is also constant. Likewise the
Fā’, Wāw and Au function normally as Ḥurūf al-‘Aṭf and should therefore
retain this function even in this context.

The view that these particles effect Naṣb by themselves is the view of
the Kufans in which case the number of Nawāṣib of the Fi‘l is ten. This
furthermore attests to the author’s Kufan leanings on some issues of
Naḥw.

[^39]

[^40] For the Fi‘l to be Manṣūb after the Fā’ or the Wāw they have to be
preceded by Nafy (negation) or Ṭalab [a request which comprises the
following: Amr (command), Nahy (prohibition), Taḥḍīḍ (urgent request),
‘Arḍ (mild/gentle request), Du‘ā’ (supplication), Istifhām
(interrogation/questioning), Rajā’ (hoping) and Tamannī (wishing)]

[^41] For the Fi‘l to be Manṣūb after  أوْ  the latter has to covey the
meaning of either  إلى  (until) or  إلاّ  (except).

[^42] The author states that the Jawāzim are eighteen in number but yet
goes on to enumerate nineteen. The reason for this is that    – strictly
speaking – is not a Jāzim since it only effects Jazm in a particular
context, namely, that of poetry and the Jawāzim that the author meant
are those that effect Jazm in all contexts – whether poetry or prose. By
right  ألمْ  and  ألماّ  should not constitute two separate instruments
of Jazm since they – in reality – composed of  لمْ  and  لماّ  preceded
by the Hamzah alistifhām (Hamzah of interrogation) which brings the
total number of Jawāzim to sixteen instead of the original eighteen.
Furthermore, the Basrans do not count the  كيفما  as a Jāzim in which
the number of Jawāzim totals to fifteen.

In addition, the Jawāzim are of two groups. The first group only effects
Jāzm of one Fi‘l and comprises the following particles:   (لمْ، لمّا،
لام الأمر والدعاء، لا للنهي والدعاء) The second group effects Jazm of
two Fi‘ls, the first of which is called the Fi‘l al-Sharṭ (verb
signifying the condition) and the second the Jawāb al-Sharṭ (the
compliment/response to the condition) or Jazā’ al-Sharṭ (the
result/consequence of the condition), and constitutes the remaining
Adawāt (instruments). The reason for referring to the latter as Adawāt
is the fact that they comprise both Ḥurūf (particles) and Asmā’ (nouns).
The Ḥurūf are:  (إنْ، إذْما)  and the remaining words are Asmā’. The
Asmā’ can be identified by the fact that they denote a meaning over and
above mere al-Sharṭiyyah (conditionality), such as: rational or
non-rational beings, time, place, state, etc., in addition to having
Ḍamā’ir (personal pronouns) referring to them. Obviously, being Asmā’
one has to account for their places of al-I‘rāb in the sentence.

[^43] What the author means by Marfū‘āt al-Asmā’ are all those
categories of Asmā’ that are Marfū‘ whether Lafđan (verbally), Taqdīran
(hypothetically/conceptually) or Maḥallan (locally/place-wise). Lafđan
is where the particular sign of I‘rāb (which in this case is the Ḍammah,
Wāw or Alif) is verbally expressed, Taqdīran where it is not verbally
expressed but supposed in the mind, and Maḥallan where there is no sign
of I‘rab because the word is Mabniyy. In the latter case the particular
I‘rāb (which in this case is Raf‘) is distributed over the whole word as
it were in the form of the word occupying – as a whole – the particular
place of I‘rāb (and hence the term Maḥallan – place) which is here a
place of Raf‘ as the Fā‘il, Mubtada’, Khabar, etc. In the previous two
cases only the word-endings are involved whereas in this case the whole
word is involved.

It is customary for Grammarians to treat the Marfū‘āt al-Asmā’ first,
the Manṣūbāt al-Asmā’ second and the Makhfūḍāt al-Asmā’ last. The
rationale behind this order is that Marfū‘āt al-Asmā’ constitute the
essential and indispensable components or elements of Kalam (speech).
The Manṣūbāt al-Asmā’ are non-essential to Kalām and therefore
dispensable (with the exception of the Khabar of Kāna and Ism of Inna
and their sisters). As for the Makhfūḍāt al-Asmā’ they really belong to
the Manṣūbāt al-Asmā’ because they are Manṣūb from the point of view of
place (Maḥall). Thus, the Jārr and Majrūr-phrase (بالقلم ) in the
sentence  كتبْتُبالقلم   (I wrote with the pen) occupies the same
position as the Maf‘ūl bihī (الرسالة ) in the sentence  كتبْتُالرسالة
(I wrote the letter). Also, the Maf‘ūl bihī can be paraphrased as a Jārr
and Majrūr-phrase, namely:  فعلْتُ الكتابةبالرسالة   (I did writing to
the letter) which constitutes further proof of the resemblance of the
Makhfūḍāt al-Asmā’ to the Manṣūbāt al-Asmā’.In addition, the Jārr and
Majrūr-phrase takes the place of the Fa‘il after the latter has been
dropped just as the Maf‘ūl bihī does becoming the Nā’ib Fā‘il. This
would not have been the case if the Jārr and Majrūr-phrase did not
occupy a place of Naṣb.

[^44] The diversity of the examples used by the author here indicates
that the Fā‘il can be singular, dual or plural (sound or broken),
masculine or feminine, a noun with real or hypothetical declension. The
use of the Māḍī and Muḍāri‘ forms of the Fi‘l indicates that the Ḍāhir
is only used with these two verb types because the Ḍāhir falls in the
category of the third person and the Amr comprises the second person
only and therefore cannot have the Ḍāhir as its Fā ‘il.

[^45] These are only the Fā‘il-Ḍamā’ir for the Māḍī. If we include the
Muḍāri‘ and the Amr then the following Fā‘il-Ḍamā’ir can be added: the
Yā’ al-Mukhāṭabah in  (تضربي ن، اضربي )  and the three latent or hidden
Ḍamā’ir (i.e. Mustatirah) in  {أضرب (أنا )، نضرب (نحن )، تضرب (أنتَ )،
اضربْ (أنتَ )}  .

[^46] Notice that the Māḍī form  ضَرَبَتَا   [They (fem. dual) hit] is
not mentioned here because the author’s intention here is not to give
the conjugation of the Fi‘l (which falls under Sarf rather than Naḥw)
but merely to enumerate the Fā‘il in the form of Ḍamā’ir which so happen
to be suffixed to the Fi‘l. Now, since the Fā‘il in  ضَربَا   [They
(masc. dual) hit] which is the Alif is same (at least in form) as the
Fā‘il in ضَرَبَتَا   [They (fem. dual) hit], there is no sense in
repeating it if the one suffices. As for the Tā’ in  ضَرَبَتَا   it is
the unvowelled Tā’ of Femininity which has been vowelled with a Fatḥah
because of the Alif following it. This Tā’, therefore, is not part of
the Alif so as to make it different from the Alif in the masculine form
ضَربَا   such that they constitute two separate Fā‘ils and therefore
necessitating the inclusion of the feminine form  ضَرَبَتَا .

[^47] It is also called the Nā’ib Fā‘il (Deputy Doer/Agent of the Doer)
which is more preferred because the technical term used by the author
does not exclude the second of two Maf‘ūls when the first becomes the
Nā’ib Fā‘il for each of the two Maf‘ūls qualifies as a al-Maf‘ūl allađī
lam yusamma Fā‘iluhū. Yet the one Maf‘ūl is Marfū‘ and the other Manṣūb
and what the author means by this term is the one that is Marfū‘ on
taking the place of the dropped Fā‘il.

[^48] In fact, all vowelled letters before the penultimate letter are
marked with a Ḍammah and not only the first. Furthermore, if the Fi‘l is
Ajwaf (hollow) with the Alif as the middle weak letter then the Alif is
transformed into a Yā’ and the letter before it bears a Kasrah, e.g.
(قا ل – قِي ْل، با ع – بـِي ْع).

[^49] Not only is the letter before the final letter marked with a
Fatḥah but all vowelled letters before it. Furthermore, if the Fi‘l is
Ajwaf (hollow) with the Wāw or Yā’ as the weak middle, then the Wāw or
Yā’ is transformed into an Alif e.g.  (يقُو ْل – يُقَا ل، يبِي ْع –
يُبَا ع).

[^50] The Mubtada’ is Marfū‘ and as such it must be acted on by an ‘Āmil
that makes it Marfū‘ since every change in the form of I‘rāb is the
result of an ‘Āmil. However, since the Mubtada’ normally is the first
word in the nominal sentence it follows that its ‘Āmil cannot be
anything verbally expressed (Lafziyy) for there is nothing before the
Mubtada’. It is for this reason that some Grammarians maintain the
Mubtada’ is Marfū‘ precisely because it is not preceded by verbally
expressed ‘Awāmil which in itself constitutes an ‘Amil albeit an ‘Āmil
that is supposed or conceived in the mind (Ma‘nawiyy). This ‘Āmil is
called alibtidā’ (inception i.e. to be stripped of verbally expressed
‘Awāmil by virtue of it occurring at the beginning).

[^51]

[^52]

[^53] This definition of the Na‘t covers both the Na‘t Ḥaqīqiyy and Na‘t
Sababiyy. The Na‘t Ḥaqīqiyy is that which highlights a quality or
attribute in the Man‘ūt itself and further agrees with the Man‘ūt in
number and gender e.g.  هذا بستانٌجميلٌ   (This is a beautiful garden).
The Na‘t Sababiyy, on the other hand, highlights a quality or attribute
in something related to the Man‘ūt (called the Sabab) and not in the
actual Man‘ūt itself e.g.  هذا بستانٌجميلةٌ أزهارُها  (This is a garden
whose flowers are beautiful). Notice that in the first example جميلٌ
highlights the quality of beauty  (جَمال)  in the Man‘ūt  بستانٌ  and
furthermore agrees with it in Raf’, Tankīr, Ifrād and Taḍkīr. As for the
second example جميلةٌ   highlights the quality of beauty  (جَمال)  in
the Sabab  أزهارُها  (its flowers) which is related to the Man‘ūt بستانٌ
and only agrees with the Man‘ūt in Raf’ and Tankīr. As for gender and
number the Na‘t is Mu’annath because the Sabab is Mu’annath and is
always Mufrad.

[^54] The Mubham includes the Ism Mauṣūl (relative pronoun) e.g.   الذي
[who/that which (masc. sing.)],  التي  [who/that which fem. sing.)] and
الذينَ  [who/those whom (masc. pl.)].

[^55] Examples of this category are: كتاب ي  (my book), كتاب زيد
(Zayd’s book), كتاب هذا الطالب  (this student’s book) and كتاب الرجل
(the man’s book).

[^56] What is meant by “some places” is that  حتّى  is not a Ḥarf ‘Aṭf
in every context but that in some contexts it is a Ḥarf ‘Aṭf, in others
a Ḥarf Jarr and yet others a Ḥarf Ibtidā’ (particle of inception). The
following example illustrates the differences between the three types
of  حتى  :  (أكلتُ السمكةَ حتىرأسِ ها، رأسَ ها، رأسُ ها)  (I ate the
fish up to or up to including its head). If we read رأس ها  with Jarr
then  حتى  is a Ḥarf Jarr, with Naṣb it is a Ḥarf ‘Aṭf for then رأس ه
follows the same I‘rāb as  السمكةَ  , and with Raf‘ it is Ḥarf Ibtidā’
in which case رأس ه  is the Mubtada’ and its Khabar is dropped assumed
as:  مأكولٌ  (i.e. Even its head was eaten).

[^57] This example does not constitute a proper example of a Fi‘l Majzūm
conjoined to another Fi‘l Majzūm since the second is not much Majzūm by
virtue of it following the first or even by the ‘Āmil of the first but
rather it is Majzūm because of the negative particle of Jazm, Lām, that
immediately precedes it. To make it an example of a Majzām conjoined to
a Majzūm the second Lām should be dropped, like:  زيد لم يقمْ ويقعدْ   .

[^58] The term Taukīd here is a Maṣdar but it used in the sense of the
Ism Fā‘il (active participle) Mu’akkid meaning that which corroborates
or emphasises.

[^59] The substitute word follows the word for which it is substituted
in all the latter’s cases of I‘rāb.

[^60] It is also called Badal al-Kull min al-Kull (Substitute of the
whole for the whole) or Badal Muṭābiq (Concordant/congruous Badal)

[^61] Two other types are normally added so as to make the total number
six. These two are: Badal al-Nisyān (Badal due to forgetfulness) e.g.
جاء محمدٌزيدٌ   [Muhammad (or rather) Zayd came] and Badal al-Iḍrāb
(Badal of opting for the better alternative) e.g.  اِرْكَبْ
الحمارَالفرسَ   [Ride a donkey (even better) a horse].

[^62] This statement is supposed to read: You wanted to say: الفرس but
then you erred (by saying: زيداً) so you substitutedالفرس .  for it
(i.e.زيداً ).

[^63] Of these fifteen Manṣūbāt the Tamyīz, Mustathnā and Maf‘ūl min
ajlihī in particular, are not always Manṣūb in which case their names
are only significant for the respective meanings that they convey and
not as referring to particular places of Naṣb. As regards their I‘rāb
they will now be counted amongst the Marfū‘āt or Makhfūdāt.

[^64] The author states here that the Manṣūbāt are fifteen in number but
then only mentions fourteen.

[^65] The Nūn that is between the Fi‘l and the Yā’ al-Mutakallim is
called the Nūn al-Wiqāyah (the Nūn of Guarding) because it guards the
Fi‘l from taking the Kasrah that the Yā’ al-Mutakallim forces on the
letter before it by taking the Kasrah itself.

[^66] Here the actual Ḍamīr is the Kāf only. The Mīm is called the Ḥarf
al-‘Imād (particle of support) since it serves as a prop or support for
the Alif following it. The Alif itself is a Ḥarf denoting duality.

[^67] Here as with the previous one, the actual Ḍamīr is only the Kāf as
for the Mīm it is called the ‘Alāmah Jam‘ al-Đukūr (sign of masculine
plural).

[^68] The actual Ḍamīr is the Kāf only as for the Nūn Mushaddadah
(emphatic/doubled Nūn) it is called the ‘Alāmah Jam‘ al-Niswah/al-Ināţ
(sign of feminine plural).

[^69] The Ḍamīr proper according to the more correct view amongst the
Arabic Grammarians is the first part viz. "إيّا" where as the rest
constitutes number, gender and person markers. However, for the purpose
of simplicity we have decided to regard the whole expression as the
Ḍamīr.

[^70] The more correct term for this type of Manṣūb is Maf‘ūl Muṭlaq
(Absolute Object) i.e. the Maf‘ul proper since it signifies what is
actually done free from any reference to being done to something (bihī),
in something (fihī), out of or for the purpose of something (min-ajlihī)
or with or in the company of something (ma‘ahū). Therefore, Maf‘ūl, here
means “what is done” and Muṭlaq means “free from the aforementioned
references or stipulations”. This is clearly illustrated by means of the
following example which contains all five types of Maf‘ūl:  قَرَأَ محمدٌ
وسميراً الكتابَ اليومَ أمامَ المدرسِقراءةً جيدةًرغبةً في التقدُّم
[Muhammad read withSamir (or in his company)the book today in front of
the teacherwell (lit. a goodreading )out of a desire for progress].
Here, what was actually done is the act of  قراءةً  (reading) – being
done to  الكتابَ  (the book), with or in the company of  سميراً
(Samir), in the time of  اليومَ  (today) and the place of  أمامَ  (in
front), out of or for the purpose of  رغبةً  (desire).

[^71] These two forms of the Maṣdar constitute one of the three
functions of the Maf‘ūl Muṭlaq, namely: lil-Taukīd (for the purpose of
emphasis or corroboration). The other two functions are: li Bayān
an-Nau‘ (for the purpose of clarifying the type) e.g.  ضرب زيد
عمراًضرباً شديداً  (Zayd hit ‘Amr a severe hitting i.e. he hit him
severely) and li-Bayān al-‘Adad (for the purpose of clarifying the
number) e.g.  ضرب زيد عمراًضربةً   (Zayd hit ‘Amr one hitting i.e. he
hit him once).

[^72] It is for this reason that it is also called Maf‘ūl fīhi (what the
action is done in as regards time or place). Even the word Ẓarf has
connotations of “in-ness” because it means container or vessel as if
time and place are containers or vessels of the act that is being done
since every act has to be done in a time or a place (with exception of
Allah’s Acts).

[^73] When someone does an action or does it to someone or something
then each of these exists in a particular state or condition at the time
the action is done. Thus, if Zayd, for example, goes to school, then he
can do so walking, running, riding, feeling happy or sad, etc. These are
possible states/conditions in which Zayd can be at the time he goes to
school. However, we would not know which state or states Zayd is in
unless the speaker specifies it. The Ḥāl is what the speaker uses to
specify or clarify the particular state or states Zayd is in when he
goes to school.

[^74] In the first of the three examples the Ḥāl proceeds from the
Fā‘il  زيدٌ  , in the second it proceeds from the Maf‘ūl bihī  الفرسَ
and in the third example it proceeds from either the Fā‘il  زيدٌ  or the
Maf‘ūl bihī  عبدَالله  .

[^75] In other words, the Ḥāl is a Faḍlah (dispensable component of the
sentence) since what completes Kalām constitutes the ‘Umdahs
(indispensable components of the sentence). This means that one can only
determine an Ism to be Hal after one has already determined the
indispensable components comprising the sentences such that the Hal
normally occurs after a nominal or verbal sentence is complete.

[^76] The Ḥāl, Na‘t and Khabar have the following in common: They often
occur as a Waṣf or Mushtaqq (i.e. Ism Fā‘il, Ism Maf‘ūl, Ṣifah
Mushabbahah and Ism Tafḍīl) in which case there ought to be agreement
between them and the Ṣāḥib al-Ḥāl, Man‘ūt and Mubtada’ respectively, in
terms of gender and number.

[^77] The term Tamyīz here even though it is Maṣdar it is used in the
sense of the Ism Fā‘il (active participle) i.e. Mumayyiz (specifier).

[^78] The Tamyīz itself comprises two broad categories: Tamyīz al-Mufrad
and Tamyīz al-Nisbah/al-Jumlah. Tamyīz al-Mufrad consists of four types:

Tamyīz al-‘Adad e.g.  حضر عشرونطالباً   (Twenty students were
present/attended)

Tamyīz al-Wazn e.g.  معي رِطلٌ زيتاً  (With me is a ratl of oil)

Tamyīz al-Kayl e.g.  اشتريْتُ صاعاً تمراً  (I bought a sā‘ of dates)

Tamyīz al-Misāḥah e.g.  عندي قصبةٌ أرضاً  (I have a patch of land)

As for Tamyīz al-Nisbah/al-Jumlah it is that which clarifies the
ambiguity in the relation of the action. Thus, in the example:  حَسُنَ
زيدًٌ   (Zayd is good in character) it is not clear what of Zayd is good
or whether he is good as a whole. By adding خُلُق   so that the sentence
becomes حَسُنَ زيدٌخُلُقاً   (Zayd is good in character) it becomes
clear that it is Zayd’s character that is good.

[^79] The term Istithnā’ here could either be used in the original sense
of the Maṣdar meaning ‘exception’ or ‘exclusion’ or in the sense of the
Ism Maf‘ūl (passive participle) meaning the Mustathnā (i.e. the object
excepted/excluded)

[^80] Obviously, not all of these eight words are Ḥurūf, since  غير،
سِوى، سُوى، سواء  are Asmā’,  خلا، عدا، حاشا  can be Ḥurūf or Af‘āl. As
for  إلاّ  it is only used as a Ḥarf. However, the reason for the author
calling them all Ḥurūf is to show the dominance of  إلاّ  which is a
Ḥarf over the rest.

[^81] The Mustathnā minhu is the Ism in the form of a class or genus
from which the exception or exclusion is made like  الناس  and  القوم
in the examples that are cited.

[^82] In fact, there are five ways in which to say this statement:

رجل   is Mabniyy and امرأة   is Mabniyy:  لارجلَ في الدار ولاامرأةَ

رجل   is Mabniyy and امرأة   is Manṣūb:  لارجلَ في الدار ولاامرأةً

رجل   is Mabniyy and امرأة   is Marfū‘:  لارجلَ في الدار ولاامرأةٌ

رجل   is Marfu‘ and امرأة   is Marfu‘:  لارجلٌ في الدار ولاامرأةٌ

رجل   is Marfu‘ and امرأة   is Mabniyy:  لارجلٌ في الدار ولاامرأةَ

[^83] The Ism زيد   (Zayd) is an example of a Mufrad ‘Alam and the
Ism رجل   (man) is an example of a Nakirah Maqṣūdah.

[^84] Examples of these three are:

يارجلاً ، خذ بيدي  [Oman , take my hand (like when a blind man
requests any man in front of him)]

يارسولَ اللهِ  (OMessenger of Allah)

يارؤوفاً بالعباد  (OThou who art compassionate with the servants)

[^85] In order for an Ism to be Manṣūb as the Maf‘ūl min ajlihī the
following conditions have to be satisfied:

it has to be a Maṣdar

it has to be a Maṣdar Qalbiyy (i.e. a mental or emotional act)

the Maṣdar Qalbiyy has to proceed from the same person performing the
action

the Maṣdar Qalbiyy has to exist at the same time of the action being
performed

[^86] The author, even though he mentions the Tābi‘ of something that is
Makhfūḍ as a third category of the Makhfūḍāt al-Asmā’, he does not
actually discuss it in this section as he does with the two other
categories. The reason for this is that the author already dealt with
the Tābi‘ in general in the chapter on the Marfū‘āt al-Asmā’such that it
is not necessary to repeat it here.

[^89] (Allah is pleased with the believers) (Allah is pleased with them
and they are pleased with Him)

[^90] [On it (the cattle) and the ships you are carried]

[^91] (And in the heavens is your sustenance) [And in it (Paradise) is
that which the souls desire]

[^92] (Seldom I meet a pious man)

[^93] (Say: We believe in Allah) (Those are the one who believe in Him)

[^94] (Nothing is like unto Him)

[^95] (To Allah belong what is in the heavens and what is on earth) (For
them therein is an Abode of Eternity)

[^99] (Perhaps a night like the swell of the ocean lowering its drapes)

[^100] (I have not seen him since Friday) (I have not seen him today)

[^101] (I have not seen him since Friday) (I have not seen him today)

[^102] The more popular view is that Iḍāfah is of three types with the
addition of that which is implied by means of  في  e.g.  قيامالليلِ
(Standing upin the night ) or  صلاةالصبحِ    (prayingin the early
morning ).
