Story no. 36: Shamsi and rudeness to others
===========================================

Shamsi was a good girl.  
 But when she sat with others she was rude.  
 Her mother did not pay attention to this bad quality of hers.  
 One day she said, “Dear Shamsi! You are a good girl, everyone in the
house likes you, but you have only one fault, and that is that you
backbite others!”  
 Shamsi asked “Mamma, what is backbiting?”  
 Her mother replied “Backbiting is speaking ill of someone in his
absence which the God Almighty has strictly prohibited in the Holy
Quran. And it is better if instead of backbiting, we improve our *own*
actions.
