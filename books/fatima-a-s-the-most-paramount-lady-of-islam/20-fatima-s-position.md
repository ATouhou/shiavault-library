Fatima’s Position:
==================

The religious learned have called four women excellent in the history of
man’s life, including: Asieh, Holy Mary, Khadijeh and Fatima. Among
them, Fatima (peace be upon her) has got a gracious position so that no
one could know her except Mohammed and Ali (peace be upon him), and
there is no possibility of knowing her except by resorting to what they
have said about her. We will try to analyze her position through two
views:

1. According to the Holy Quran:
-------------------------------

She symbolizes Kauthar, and the following the Quran verse was revealed
about her:

<p dir="rtl">
أنّا أعطيناك الكوثر
</p>

[We have bestowed upon you Kauthar].

She stands for the word نسائنا*[our women]* in Mobaheleh verse. On the
other hand, Zahra is a woman, but includes all the gracious attributes
of the grand women in the world, and the roles, of which women must take
the responsibility, and try to achieve them.

She is the tenor of the verse:

<p dir="rtl">
قل لا اسئلكم عليه اجراً الا المودة في القربي
</p>

The one whom Tathir verse (being away from filth) was revealed about
her.

She is the symbol of

<p dir="rtl">
وجمع الشمس و القمر
</p>

She also symbolizes

<p dir="rtl">
والقمر اذا تلئها
</p>

in Shams Sura.

2. According to the Traditions:
-------------------------------

She is the Mistress of women, the inhabitant of heaven.

The heiress of the previous prophets’ glory and that of the famous women
of the world.

She is infallible and pure from sin.

She is a part of the Prophet’s body and soul. She is the incarnation of
the Prophet (peace be upon him and his descendants).

Allah’s heaven is incarnated in her, so that the Prophet (peace be upon
him and his descendants) smells the scent of heaven from her.

She is Ali’s peeress as well as his confidant.

She was one of the glad tidings of the Prophet (peace be upon him and
his descendants), as he said,

<p dir="rtl">
فان الله اصطفاك علي نسا العالمين
</p>

Her satisfaction is the Prophet’s satisfaction, and the Prophet’s
satisfaction is Allah’s satisfaction.

She is the cause of the survival and the continuation of the Prophethood
and Imamate.

And at last, she has got more honor than holy Mary, because she has
endowed with eleven Christlike (children).
