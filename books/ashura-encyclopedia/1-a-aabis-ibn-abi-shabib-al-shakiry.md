A - Aabis Ibn Abi Shabib Al-Shakiry
===================================

One of the bravest and most loyal men in the army of Imam Husayn in
Karbala. Aabis was so old that he had to tie a piece of cloth around his
forehead just to keep his eyebrows from falling on top of his eyes.

He was Muslim Ibn Aqeel's messenger to Imam Husayn telling him that the
people of Kufa had agreed to fight with Imam Husayn. His story is well
known on the day of Ashura’, when nobody would dare to fight him. When
Aabis realized that no one was going to come out to fight, he removed
all his armour until a man cried to him: "Have you gone mad?" Aabis
replied: "Yes, the love of Husayn has made me go mad". Finally, ‘Umar
Ibn Sa'ad shouted at his army saying: "What is the matter with you all,
throw stones at him".
