Use Of Analogy And Personal Opinion Are Not Shia Practices
==========================================================

Ahlul Sunnat object that Shias do not follow analogy and personal
opinion, but they resort to jurisprudence, whereas analogy and personal
opinion is the final jurisprudence. The reply to this is that Shaykh
Bahauddin Aamili writes in Zibdatul Usool, Shaykh Abul Qasim Hilli in
Maarijul Usool, and Allamah Hilli in Kashaful Haqq have considered
analogy invalid and say that analogy is the religion of Abu Hanifah and
not of Shias. Shias do not give legal rulings based on personal opinion.
Or in contravention of Islamic text (Nass), they do not prefer personal
opinion as the source as Abu Hanifah used to do.[^1]

Some Shia scholars, who have argued in favor of analogy, they mean by
analogy, preference, choice etc.; problems of lexicology, etymology,
diction, style, discussion upon the narrators, thinking upon different
traditions. It does not denote solving the problems from personal
opinion etc.

Tafseer Safi, Preface of Tafseer Majmaul Bayan, and Asaasul Usool,
Wasailush Shia, Risala Itteqadia of Ibn Babawayh.
