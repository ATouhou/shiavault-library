Chapter 19: Report Ibne Hawash al-Muqbil of Damascus
====================================================

Narrated to us my father (r.a.) that: Narrated to us Ali bin Ibrahim
from his father Ibrahim bin Hashim from Muhammad bin Abi Umair; and
Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Abi Nasr Bazanti all of them from Aban bin Uthman
al-Ahmar from Aban bin Taghlib from Ikramah from Ibne Abbas that he
said:

“When the Holy Prophet (S) got Kaab bin Asad of Bani Quraiza arrested
and wanted him to be executed, he said: O Kaab, did the advice of Ibne
Hawash the Rabbi not benefit you, who had come from Damascus and used to
say: I have given up wine and luxury, I have adopted abstemiousness and
started eating dates in anticipation of the prophet the time of whose
advent has arrived; he will migrate from Mecca and come to Medina. His
food will be dry bread and dates and he will ride a bare-backed mule.
There will be redness in his eyes and the mark of prophethood will be
embossed between his two shoulders.

He will carry his sword on his shoulders and not care for any enemy. His
dominion will extend to every place where the hooves of the horses can
reach. Kaab said: O Muhammad, it is so. If the Jews had not said that I
brought faith under the threat of death I would have indeed accepted
(your) faith. But I have lived on the Jewish faith so far and I shall
die on it. The Messenger of Allah (S) said: ‘Come and execute him.’ The
executioner stepped forward and cut off his head.”
