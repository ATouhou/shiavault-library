The Method of Reading Our Salat
===============================

When we are praying, we must pay attention and realize who we are
standing in front of, who we are speaking to, and that we are in the
presence of Allah (SWT). Our Salat, therefore, must be performed
correctly and in its entirety, and especially those eleven things which
are Wajib in the Salat, must be completely and properly performed. The ,
things which make our Salat void, such as eating, drinking, laughing,
speaking along with the other things must be avoided.

Since we are now acquainted with the etiquette of reading our Salat, we
will now give a summary of how to pray, step by step.

1. First of all, we must face the Qiblah, and after having made our
intention of which Salat we are about to perform, whether it be Fajr,
Zuhr, or... we specify that we are praying this Wajib Salat with the
intention of seeking nearness to Allah (SWT) and in compliance to His
order.

2. Then, we recite the Takbiratul Ihram in the following way, by raising
both the hands until they are parallel to our ears and then we say:

اَللهُ أكْبَرُ
</p>

***Allahu Akbar***

***(Allah is greater than anything else)***

<p dir="rtl">

</p>

***Allahu AkbarAllah is greater than anything else)***

3. We then lower our hands and rest them on our thighs and start by
reciting Surah al-Fatiha, followed by another Surah of the Holy Qur'an.
