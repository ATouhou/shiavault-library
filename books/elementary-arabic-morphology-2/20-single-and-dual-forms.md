146. A singular noun is a noun that indicates one person, one animal, or
one thing. For example: **نجَّار** (a carpenter).

147. A dual noun is a noun that indicates two people, two animals, or
two things. For example: **نحَّاران** (two carpenters).

148. A noun is put into the dual form by giving the last syllable a
*fathah* and adding the dual letters which are:

• An *alif* and *nūn* that has a *kasrah* if the noun is in the
nominative state. For example: **جاءَ** **وَلدَانِ** (two boys came)

• A *yā'* and *nūn* that has a *kasrah* if the noun is in the accusative
or genitive case. For example: **اسطدتُ** **عُصفرَینِ** (I hunted two
sparrows)

149. Yes, there are some exceptions to this rule. The exceptions are
*maqsūr* nouns and *mamdūd* nouns.

150. A *maqsūr* noun has two cases:

• If it ends in a straight *alif* - the *alif* should be changed to a
*wāw* and then the dual letters should be added. For example: **عصا**
(cane) becomes **عَصَو** which becomes **عَصَوانِ** (two canes).

• If it ends in an *alif maqsūrah* - the *alif* should be changed to a
*yā'* and then the dual letters should be added. For example: **فتیَ**
(young man) becomes **فَتي** which becomes **فَتَیَانِ** (two young
men).

151. A *mamdūd* noun has two cases:

• If the *hamzah* is a feminine *hamzah* - the *hamzah* should be
changed into a *wāw* with a *fathah* and then the dual letters should be
added. For example: **خَصراء** (green) becomes **خَضراوَ** which becomes
**خَضراوانِ**.

• If the *hamzah* is not a feminine *hamzah* - the *hamzah* can either
remain or be changed into a *wāw* with a *fathah* and then the dual
letters should be added. For example **سماء** (sky) becomes **سماء** or
**سَماوَ** which becomes **سَماءَانِ** or **سَماوَانِ** (two skies).
