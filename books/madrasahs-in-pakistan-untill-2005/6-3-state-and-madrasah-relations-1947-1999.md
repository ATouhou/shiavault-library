3- State And Madrasah Relations: 1947-1999
==========================================

As the previous chapter revealed, the dichotomy in the educational
system was inherited by Pakistan from colonial India. The
religious*madaris* were in the hands of conservative*ulema* who
suspected the introduction of reforms in any sector by the modernist
leadership as a conspiracy against Islam. Therefore, partly as a lack of
commitment of the government and, partly, because of the fear of
opposition from the conservative*ulema,* the government could not
undertake comprehensive measures to introduce a uniform system of
education in the country.

However, the efforts to introduce reforms in the*din-i-madaris* have
been underway since Ayub Khan’s regime. These efforts could not produce
fruitful results because of multiple socio-political reasons.[^126]

Madrasahs under Ayub Khan’s Regime
----------------------------------

The first-ever attempt to integrate*din-i-madaris* into the formal
educational system and to get their financial and administrative control
was made in 1961 through an ordinance to transfer the private endowments
to the state. These*waqf* endowments were the main source of finance
of*din-i-madaris* .[^127]

In 1961 a committee for revision of the curricula of the*Din-i-madras*
was formed for the first time. It consisted of eleven members in whom
only three members represented the traditional*din-i-madras* while six
were from universities and two were government representatives.[^128]
The composition of the committee indicates the government move to bring
about state sponsored reforms. The committee’s proposals for the reforms
of curricula also reflected this trend. The committee report covered
700*din-i-madaris* in which*Dars-i-Nizami* was taught and was financed
by the Asia Foundation, an American NGO.[^129]

The committee report of 1962 suggests that general educational
subjects should be introduced in*din-i-madaris* along with traditional
religious subjects to meet the challenges of the time. Active support of
the clergy was sought to realize this objective.[^130] It was made clear
that this would be possible only if certain unnecessary non-religious
subjects be replaced by subjects based upon undisputed sources of
knowledge.[^131] The committee agreed to introduce modern subjects to
prepare students for different professions. The National Education
Commission 1959 had already recommended these proposals.[^132] The
government intended to modernize the system of education reforming
the*maktabs* and*madaris* . Under this scheme the primary education as
approved by the department of education was to be compulsory for all the
students of affiliated*madaris.* [^133] It is to be noted that the
sphere of reform in the syllabus was limited to the non-religious
subjects as taught in*madaris.* The report recommended that logic and
philosophy be cut down which were considered essential for the religious
study in the past and formed part of*Dars-i-Nizami.* [^134] Great
emphasis was given to Quranic studies,*hadith,* and early Islamic
history.

Sources: Based on the Report of Committee set up by the Governor of West
Pakistan for recommending improved syllabus for the various
Dar-ul-Ulooms and Arabic*Madrasahs* in West Pakistan, in Malik,
Jamal,*Colonization of Islam* , 1996.

The changes in syllabus were aimed at reforming a system geared more
towards an effective and realistic education which would limit
the*Dars-i-Nizami* , fade out non- religious subjects and extend courses
to ten years preceded by five years of primary education.[^135] The term
non-religious remained disputed between the modernists and the
clergy.[^136] The proposed scheme made more space for new subjects aimed
at bringing about basic changes in religious education. The suggestion
for introduction of English, Urdu, mathematics, sports, and social
sciences points towards this objective.[^137] The proposed curricular
changes were justified for different reasons. Learning of English was
considered essential for handling modern life and for the mission of
Islam. The introduction of mathematics was justified for understanding
all modern sciences. The recommendation of Urdu as medium of instruction
at secondary level was justified on the basis that ordinary people can
understand it easily. The elimination of logic and medieval philosophy
was explained by its non-essential character for religious
education.[^138] In order to supervise the working of*din-i-madaris* a
directorate of religious education was proposed to be established within
the*Auquaf* Department. It was to monitor and evaluate the standard of
work of teachers and students.[^139] Special six months re-orientation
courses were to be arranged for the teachers of*din-i-madaris* in order
to equip them for learning new subjects.

The report of 1962 explains that it refers to religious learning (*deeni
uloom* ) and non-religious learning (*dunyavi uloom)* only as a
convenient expression and not to convey the impression that they are
opposite to each other. Yet repeated reference to “basic Islamic
studies” as strictly religious subjects and the need to expunge un-
necessary non-religious subjects from the existing syllabus contradict
the earlier explanation.[^140] The report did not propose to abolish the
dichotomy between religious and non-religious rather reinforced it. The
reforms meant only the replacement of non-essential, non-religious
disciplines by essential non-religious ones.[^141] The terms
non-essential, non-religious, however, remained disputed between the
modernists and traditional*ulema* .. For the modernists only the
undisputed sources were the religious in the true sense, but for
the*ulema* not just those sources but a broad spectrum of texts,
techniques and sciences that collectively in their evolution
cumulatively comprise the heritage with references to which they define
themselves were considered essential for religious education.[^142]

The report of 1962 begins by characterizing Islam as an all encompassing
religion which it takes to mean that religious education ought to cover
all aspects of human life. This contrasted the earlier claim of defining
and restricting the sphere of religion.[^143] As there was no dispute
over the claim that Islam regulates all aspects of life, therefore, it
provides strong justification for the reforms of the*madrasah* : for
reforms alone would enable the*ulema* to better participate in modern
life, to play an active role in matters of the world, as Isalm itself
enjoins upon them. These realities not only necessitated the
introduction of modern disciplines in*madrasahs* but the integration
of*madrasah* themselves into the general education system.[^144]

The overall response to the proposal of report was not satisfactory as
the clergy except Abul Ala Mawdudi took it as a conspiracy by government
to weaken their sphere of influence.[^145]

Madrasahs under Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto:
------------------------------------

With the overwhelming victory of secular forces in the election of 1970,
the clergy was sidelined for sometime.[^146] The nationalization policy
of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was also extended to the educational sector. To
counter this move the*Tanzim ul Madaris-al Arabiyyah* was reorganized in
1974, though*din-i-madarris* were not nationalized at first. However,
the constitution of 1973 made many concessions to the clergy almost to
their satisfaction.[^147] On the directive of the government the Council
of Islamic Ideology prepared a comprehensive report on the future
Islamic character of education in 1975/76.

The report of the sub-committee on the Islamic system of education
appointed by the Council of Islamic Ideology recommended the integration
of general education with*madrasah* education by introducing the study
of the*Holy Qur’an* and teaching of Islam in the curriculum of
institutions of general education. On the other hand, modern subjects
were proposed to be included in the curriculum of*madrasahs.* [^148] The
sub-committee also proposed the establishment of a*madrasah* education
board. The certificates and degrees issued by this board were to be
officially recognized. General science, mathematics and social sciences
were proposed to be included in the curriculum of the*madrasah* after
the primary level. It was suggested that the*madrasah* education board
should be completely sovereign.*Madrasahs* should be allowed to run on
public financial support and the expenditure of the board should be
borne by the affiliated*madarassas* .[^149] The overall character of
this report reveals that it was aiming at Islamization of general
education more than reforming*madrasah* education.[^150]

Towards the end of the Z. A. Bhutto era, the University Grants
Commission (UGC) recognized the higher degrees of*din-i-madaris* . The
National assembly put the certificate (*sanads* ) of*Wifaqul Madaris al
Arabia* on the same level as an M.A degree in*Islamiyat* provided the
student could qualify for B.A in English. The leaders of*madaris* could
not agree to this condition.[^151] The recognition of certificates
of*din-i-madaris* was aimed at playing an effective role by graduates
of*madaris* in the field of education. All of the universities did not
recognize the equivalence. Therefore, graduates of*madaris* faced
difficulties for admission to universities.

Madrasahs under Zia-ul-Haq
--------------------------

General Zia-ul-Haq took power in July 1977 as a result of Pakistan
National Alliance (PNA) Movement against the Bhutto government. The PNA
movement had derived great strength from the*din-i-madaris* and the
mosques. Since Zia-ul-Haq was convinced that the clergy could play a
crucial role in the political affairs of the country, he wanted to
establish close relationship with the clergy and the*din-i-madaris* .
This strategy proved crucial for his prolonged stay in power.

### The Sargodha Report

###

On 2nd September 1978, Zia-ul-Haq ordered the Ministry of Religious
Affairs to prepare a comprehensive report of*din-i-madaris* in Sargodha
District. After three weeks the report was presented to the president
which was known as the Sargodha Report.[^152] The report contains a
historical introduction and profile of*din-i-madaris* in Sargodha. The
DM education is reported to be spread over 9-10 years, subdivided into
following three phases.

Preparatory stage                3 years

Intermediate stage              2-3 years

Final stage                          4 years

It is stated that, after the examination of formal primary education,
students are sent to*madrasah* where they learn to read Arabic and
Persian. However, they are not taught how to write.[^153] It was
reported that the owners of*madaris* are responsible for collecting
donations. The staff is ill paid with no security of service. The
students mostly belong to poor families from rural areas.[^154] The
report identified the following sources of income of DMs:

Alms collections during Muslim festivities, such as*ids,* income from
properties (shops, houses, agriculture land, endowments, and income from
adjacent shrines).[^155] There followed a number of proposals about how
to improve the finances of the DMs and their curricula.

The report reveals that the problems of these institutions related to
the proprietary rights over lands on which they are situated, grants of
scholarships to the students and teachers for higher education and
recognition of their*sanads (* certificate*s)* for the purpose of
obtaining jobs in civil services. The committee also recommended that
the government should not deprive*din-i-madrasahs* of their autonomous
status.[^156]

The reforms in curriculum were sought by introducing science and
technology to integrate the*din-i-madaris* into formal system of
education. The first step towards this objective would be the
establishment of All Pakistan Education Advisory Board in order to
report on the DMs.[^157] For higher education (M.A and M.Phil) a
federal*Ulema* Academy or University was to be established and the
system of examination standardized.[^158] The Sargodha Report proved the
first step towards further developments in this sector and helped
government to identify the areas of special interests. The Ministry of
Religious Affairs had already informed the president that efforts to
unite*madaris* of all schools of thought under a single organization had
failed in the past. The strongest opposition to this policy came
from*Wafaq-ul-Madaris al Arabiya.* [^159]

The overall analysis of the Sargodha Report suggests that some of
the*ulema* were in favor of reforms in the*madaris* and that they had
expressed their dissatisfaction over the prevailing situation[^160] .
The*Deobondi* were, however, the only group who strongly favored the
status quo. This led to the failure of the reform program
within*madaris.* The awareness regarding the need of reforms
within*madaris* was helpful for the government to proceed with this
program in 1979, when the National Committee for*Din-i-Madaris* was
established in Islamabad on January 17, 1979. This was aimed at drawing
up proposals with reference to the Sargodha Report with the purpose of
extending the scope of*madaris* to transform them into an integral part
of formal education.[^161]

The committee had 27 members of which 15 were traditional*ulema* and,
therefore, was considered a legitimate body, acceptable both to the
clergy and the government at the same time. This committee was headed by
Dr A.W. J. Halepota, then Director of IRI (Islamic Research Institute)
and former member of CII (Council of Islamic Ideology). The
recommendation made by this committee is known as the Halepota Report.

### The Halepota Report

###

The comprehensive report expressed dissatisfaction at the overall
situation of*din-i-madaris* in Pakistan. According to the report both
the quality of education and the financial position of DMs are
lamentable.[^162] The curricula and system of examination lacked
uniformity and were not meeting the needs of the nation and that of the
modern age. The report recommended concrete and feasible measures to
improve the overall situation in*din-i-madaris* to bring them in
accordance to modern needs. Expanding higher education and employment
opportunities for the students of*din-i-madaris* by integrating them
into overall educational system in the country.[^163] The committee,
however, admitted that*din-i-madaris* were the transmitter of cultural
heritage of the society and that the student could boast of a motivation
for learning not known within formal educational system. It was also
proposed that DM should receive aid through governmental
institutions.[^164]

For the integration of both systems of education the committee proposed
that modern subjects should be added to the*Dars-i-Nizami* . For this
purpose Urdu, mathematics, social science and general science should be
introduced at the primary level. In the secondary stage general
mathematics, general science, Pakistan studies and English should be
included. At the graduation level two subjects from economics, political
science and English should be introduced. It was suggested that
one-third duration should be allowed for the instruction of modern
subjects.[^165] In order to bring uniformity between the two streams of
education at higher level, comparative religious sciences were to be
offered as optional subjects while History, Islamic economy, and Islam
and politics would be compulsory.

The following scheme of studies was proposed:

(A) *Darja Ibtidaya*                    (primary):
five years

*       Darja Muatawisita*             (middle):
three years

*       Darja Thaniya Aama*         (secondary):                     two
years

*       Darja Thaniya Khassa*       (higher secondary):          two
years

*Darja Aaliya                              (* graduation):
two years

*Darja Takhasus            * (post graduation):             two years

(B) *Tajwid wa Qir'at*          institution of artistic recitation of
Qur’an,

(Matric): five years duration.

(C)*  Deeni Ta'lim Barai khawateen* : Religious education for woman
(Matric):  five years duration

The representatives of the four schools of thought agreed to introduce
modern subjects in all the above mentioned categories of religious
educational institutions.[^166]

The committee further proposed the establishment of a National Institute
of*din-i-madaris* for better coordination among the organization of
different schools of thought. This institute would be responsible for
conducting examinations of*madrasahs* up to M.A level, publishing
results to award certificates and to compile curricula as well as to
revise them. This institute would also be responsible for the welfare
of*madaris,* teachers and the students.[^167] Balanced representation of
all schools of thought and government representatives would be ensured
in the proposed institution.

In order to make the system of examination effective the committee
proposed to hold final examinations. The proposed National Institute for
Religious*Madaris* would conduct the final examinations. This would help
to integrate religious institutions and enable their students to compete
for jobs with students of formal educational institutions.[^168] It was
stated that at the end of each stage of religious education an external
examination would be conducted by the National Institute of
Religious*Madaris* .[^169] Due to the absence of any rule relating to
the equivalence of degrees awarded by religious institutions and those
of mainstream educational institutions, the degree holders
of*din-i-madaris* faced great difficulties in finding jobs in government
departments. In order to overcome this problem the committee proposed
the equivalence of certificates of different stages of religious
educational institutions with those of formal educational
certificates.[^170]

Equivalence of the certificates awarded by Din-i-Madaris and formal
education is as follows:[^171]

*Darja* (stage)                                  S*anad* (certificate)
Equivalence

*Darja Ibtidaya                    Shadat ul Ibtidaya*
Primary

*Darja Muttawasita             Shahadat ul Muttawasita*
Middle

*Darja Thanviya amah                                Shahadat ul Thanviya
amah                 * Matric

*Darja Thanviya khassa      Shahadat ul Thanviya Khassa             *
F.A

*Darja  Aaliya                                  Shahadat ul Aaliya*
B.A (Bachelor)

*Darja Takhasus                  Shahadat ul Takhasus*
M.A (Master)

During the national survey it was revealed that most*din-i-madaris*
lacked basic facilities, i.e. proper buildings, furniture, teaching aids
and libraries. The teachers of DMs were found to be the lowest paid as
compared to teachers of government education department. In order to
improve the financial situation of*din-i-madaris* the government was
also asked to ensure the supply of water, gas, and electricity on
priority basis. Future housing schemes were to include the construction
of DMs. They were to be provided with furniture, books, teaching and
writing equipment. Similar to college and universities book banks would
be established with the help of the National Book Foundation. Libraries
of DM would be supported by the government.[^172] The DMs under the
umbrella of National Institute for DMs would not have to pay income tax
and the financial aid to those DMs should be provided unconditionally.
The financial aid is to be provided from Zakat funds.

Measures for the betterment of teacher’s economic and social conditions
were proposed. The discrimination against teachers and students of DMs
in public employment was to be reduced and they were to be helped to
establish themselves economically. The students of DMs were also to be
enabled to get better educational and employment opportunities. DM
student should be provided with scholarships for higher studies at home
as well as abroad. Government should enhance employment opportunities in
the state run institutions.[^173] However, it was not thoroughly probed
how employment opportunities could be created for such a large scale
production of students by DMs.

Neither the report of 1962 nor that of 1979 proposed that*madrasahs*
should cease to exist. But both recommended that religious education be
somewhat brought within and be regulated by concerns similar to those of
the general stream of state sponsored education. However, the extent of
expanding the sphere of modern subjects so that it become
indistinguishable from other areas of life and delimiting the influence
of clergy through DMs seemed unacceptable to religious elites. Even the
many conditions attached to the provision of incentives for agreeing
with the reform package were a challenge to their autonomy.[^174]

### Reaction of the Din-i-Madaris

###

At first, the report was received positively among the*ulema* and it was
termed the first step towards the unification of different types of
education which was the need of the time.[^175] Later on, the situation
changed and opposition came from the*ulema* of different schools of
thought. Sometimes the*ulema* of the same school of thought differ in
their reactions to the reform package. However, the most fervent
opposition came from the Deobandi. An important representative of
Deoband, Mohammad Yousaf Ludhianwi, was a great critic of the reform
committee. He termed the proposed reforms as a deep rooted conspiracy
against the autonomy of DMs. He was of the view that modern education
was aimed at destroying Muslim identity and culture, and the present
initiative would not only destroy Islamic education but Islam
itself.[^176] He believed that the reform committee was a representative
of state power and promotes its interests.

Ludianwi argued that*madrasahs* were the defenders of religious sciences
in society and their integration into formal educational system would
prevent them from performing their purely religious services and
subordinate them to worldly education. This opinion was, however, in
sharp contrast to the concept that Islam characterizes a system
encompassing life in its fullness: a major theme of the*ulema* ’s
religious discourse. His stand clearly vindicated that there is a
separate and independent sphere of religion and its preservation would
be ensured only through an independent and autonomous system
of*madrasahs* . He warned the government of the worst reaction ever
shown by DMs if it tried to proceed with the proposals of the reform
committee. As far as the matter of financial aid was concerned,
Ludlianwi believed that it was against the spirit of religious
institutions and the ego of*ulema* to accept conditional aid from the
rulers.[^177] He appealed to DMs to reject the proposals of the
committee entirely, to show that gaining of certificates and titles was
not the aim of the*ulema* .

This was followed by a campaign against the proposals which had assumed
an official character. The central organization of the*Wafaq-ul-Madaris*
expressed its disappointment with the proposals of the committee and
refused to co-operate with its chairman. The Deobandi were the main
source of strength behind this campaign as the main DMs in Pakistan were
under the influence of religious families affiliated with the Deobandi
school of thought[^178]

Maulana Mufti Mahmood, a leading Deobandi*alim* and leader
of*Jamiat-ul-Ulama-i-Islam,* who had mobilized masses against Bhutto
during the 1977 agitation, opposed any state interference in the
curricula of DMs. He declared the syllabus of the DMs to be perfect and
comprehensive.[^179]

The opposition to the report of 1979 was basically the question of
authority and identity of the traditional religious leaders. As the
mixed curriculum could undermine this sectarian identity and reduce the
unquestioned authority of the owners of DM, the*ulema* could not agree
to its implementation. The extent of opposition from different sects was
proportionate to the stakes involved for them in the proposed scheme as
the strongest opposition of the Deobandi school of thought indicates.
The introduction of modern sciences was not acceptable because it is a
threat to the separate identity of the religious sphere of
education.[^180] That in post-independence India these apprehensions
were expressed by DMs was quite natural. But the continued suspicion
shown by the*ulema* in Pakistan was astonishing as Muslim culture and
identity were not at stake in a Muslim majority state.

It is universally understood that reform is the essence of every social
order and Islam permits this by embodying the idea of*ijtihad.*
The*ulema,* however, failed to execute this important notion to the
benefit of Muslim community in any social sector, and the education
sector is no exception in this regard. All those who resisted the
reforms in DM argued that the experience in other countries was not
encouraging as*ulema* of eminence ceased to be produced there,
while*madrasahs* in the Subcontinent produce distinguished scholars by
adhering to the knowledge of the traditional religious sphere and
resisting all forms of reforms. They think that the existence of the
present system of*madrasahs* was necessary for the maintenance of
religion in society.[^181]

The response to reform of many other*ulema* was more or less the same as
that of Maulana Ludhianvi, and Maulana Mufti Mahmood. However, some of
the*ulema* had different opinions regarding the question of reforms.
Maulana Mohammad Yousaf Banuri, the founder of the*Jamiat-ul-Ulum al
Islamiya,* Karachi, was of the view that many texts studied
in*madarassa* are sometimes barely intelligible. He held such texts to
be obscure because they were written and introduced into*madrasahs*
during the period of Muslim intellectual decline in the late Middle
Ages. Yet he did not mean to subvert*madrasahs* rather to salvage them.
He wrote that some of the texts conventionally used in*madrasahs* ought
to be replaced by simpler, clearer, and more authoritative texts. We do
not want to do away with traditional sciences but seek only to create
greater competence in them through the introduction of better
books,[^182] said Banuri.

Banuri recognizes the need for the introduction of new subjects
in*madrasahs* too, but only in tandem with the strengthening and
deepening of the religious sphere.

Mohammad Taqi Uthmani, Vice President of the*Dar-ul-Ulum Madarassa* of
Karachi, tends to a similar conclusion, though based on a naïve approach
towards the history of*madarassa* education in the Subcontinent. He
observes that the*Dars-i-nizami* comprised religious and non-religious
sciences in colonial India, and Muslim students graduating from this
system of education were capable of fulfilling their responsibilities in
every sphere of practical life. This system has an added feature of
enabling a person to strengthen his religious belief and preparing a
student for taking up modern sciences at the same time.[^183]

He, however, showed willingness to adapt to change by incorporating
Western sciences and philosophy under Muslim rule. He contended that the
strong opposition of the*ulema* to this idea in the past was based on
the perceived policy of British colonialism of destroying their religion
in the Subcontinent carried out in the name of reforms.[^184] Yet
Uthmani considered*madrasahs* as purely religious institutions which can
guarantee the preservation of religion in society. As far as the process
of integration was concerned, he believed that mainstream institutions
need reforms as well to establish their Islamic character, and, until
the achievement of this objective, integration would be meaningless. As
far as the introduction of modern subjects was concerned he believed
that such incorporation should not affect the purely religious character
of*madrasah* education.[^185]

Although the extent and substance of reaction vary among different
groups of*ulema* and sometimes among different*ulema* of the same group,
the element of distrust and lack of confidence was common among all
the*ulema* regarding the government initiatives the essence of which was
deeply rooted in the colonial era.

In the prevailing situation the Ministry of Education on March 15, 1981
insisted to arrange a meeting with the*ulema* purely in the interest of
the nation. Dr Halepota confirmed that DMs were not to be nationalized
and that they were only to obtain financial support and that their
graduates would receive equal treatment.[^186]

On April 19, 1981 the Ministry of Religious Affairs which had borne the
cost for the DM committee wrote to the Islamic Research Institute whose
director was the chairman of the committee:

Since the*ulema* themselves do not want that Government should take any
initiative in this behalf and since the Government’s intentions have
been suspected quite unjustifiably, no further action will be taken in
this behalf, at least for the time being.

According to Dr. Halepota, Zia-ul-Haq, while expressing regret to
committee members later on, complained about the non-cooperation of
the*ulema.* [^187]

Din-i-madaris Comprehensive Report 1988
---------------------------------------

The National Education Policy 1976 had proposed that the state of
education in Pakistan should be improved. Therefore, a comprehensive
survey of*din-i-madaris* was conducted in the country. In the light of
this survey a comprehensive report of*din-i-madaris* was prepared by the
committee established for this purpose in 1988.[^188] The committee
agreed that the funds provided to the DMs were not sufficient for their
needs. Therefore, financial aid should be provided to the DMs to improve
their performance. The consent of DMs must be secured for this purpose.
The committee proposed the following measures for reforming the DMs in
Pakistan.

As a tradition the students of DMs belong to the poor segment of the
society. The well-off people usually do not study in the DMs. The lack
of employment opportunities and lower social status of DMs students are
responsible for this situation. Therefore, DM education should be made
attractive by providing various incentives to the DM students.

During the survey an overwhelming majority of the*Muntazemeen* of DMs
agreed to the changes in the curriculum, though it was not expected
earlier. The committee concluded that changes in the syllabus of the DMs
should be introduced to bring it in accordance with changing needs, if
uniform educational system was not possible at the moment. Thus, a
comprehensive study was made to ascertain the extent of changes to be
introduced in the existing curriculum.

The report of 1988 also proposed changes in the curriculum of the formal
education system. The committee was of the view that the people produced
by the formal education sector are usually deficient in knowledge on the
basis of which Pakistan came into being. This objective can be achieved
by reviewing the books of all subjects and should be based on the
Islamic concept of knowledge. In order to enhance the knowledge of the
students regarding Islam, the syllabus of*Islamiat* from primary to
graduation level should be reviewed so that repetition may be avoided
and each stage may prove a source of new information for the readers. It
was noted that the text books of*Islamiat* from primary to graduation
level lacked continuity.

Examination has a vital importance in education. Therefore, an effective
examination system can improve the efficiency of educational
institutions. It was revealed during the survey that most of
the*Muntazemeen* of DMs agreed to affiliate with the proposed board of
DMs. Therefore, an effective representation of*ulema* in this board must
be insured. The proposed board should have branches in all the four
provinces and Azad Kashmir so that an effective coordination between the
board and DMs may be maintained.

The committee for DMs came to the conclusion that the teachers of DMs
were facing financial hardships especially in old age. The committee
therefore recommended that the government create funds for the financial
support of the teachers of DMs so that they could lead an honorable
life. Medical expenses of those teachers and their spouses should be
borne by the government. The teachers of DMs should be sent for training
of*Hujjaj* so that they should have more exposure as well as the chance
of performing the*Haj* (pilgrimage). Special training for primary level
teachers may be arranged and the participants may be given special
allowances. Salaries of teachers may also be raised. In the housing
schemes a share for the DMs teachers should be earmarked. Scholarships
should be allowed to the DMs students and they should be encouraged for
foreign study on the same lines as those of the formal educational
institutions. Efforts should be made to get the help of Arab countries
in this regard.[^189]

The Din-i-madaris Regulation
----------------------------

Due to the resistance of the DMs Zia-ul-Haq was forced to postpone for
the time being the reform of DMs as proposed by Dr. Halepota.
A*Din-i-madaris* Regulation was introduced with immediate effect. It
projected an assimilation of the two systems while conserving the
autonomy of the DMs. At present a National Institute of*Din-i-madaris*
Pakistan (N I D M P) was to be established with two chambers.[^190]

The syndicate was to consist of the*ulema’* s representatives, of the
ministries and of institutions of education as well as of the provincial
governments. Out of 22 members 12 were to be*ulema* pertaining to
different schools of thought. The task of the syndicate included the
supervision of the DMs attached to the NIDMP. Furthermore, it was to be
responsible for improving the qualifications of the teachers, conduct
examination at the higher and intermediate stage, lay down conditions
for affiliation to the NIDMP, conduct admission tests, issue
certificates, levy and collect contributions, administer the funds of
the institute (NIDMP), present the annual budget, and take care of any
other administrative matters. The second chamber was the Academic
Council comprising 32 members with 20*ulema* and 12 administrative
experts and academicians. Its task was to advise the syndicate in all
matters of scientific and pedagogical nature, with special emphases on
matters of curricula and examinations. The chairman of the NIDMP had a
unique position by having the chairmanship of both chambers. Only the
president could substitute for him. The President of Pakistan was the
ultimate authority and the chairman was responsible to him. The working
languages of the institute were to be Urdu and Arabic. The institute was
to be financed from different sources: contributions of the DMs,
grants-in-aid by the state, and by different institutions,
scholarships,*awqaf* funds and other sources.[^191]

Recognition of sanads of DMs
----------------------------

The government efforts to pacify the clergy continued despite the
previous failed efforts of integrating traditional religious
institutions. An attempt to integrate the clergy through recognizing the
certificates of DM was another step in this direction. During the Bhutto
era such an attempt had failed because of disagreement between UGC
(University Grants Commission) and the universities regarding this
issue.

To take up this issue once again the UGC committee for the equal status
of DM certificates was established in 1980. Its proposals were finally
implemented an April 16, 1981.[^192]   The*Fawqaniyya* h certificate of
Islamiyat and Arabic was to be recognized by colleges and universities
on condition that the graduates of DM would have successfully passed two
more subjects which were compulsory for the B.A. examination. This was
the revival of the proposal made in 1976 on the equivalence of degree.
Later on, it was decided that for teachers of Arabic and Islamic
studies, parity of status with M.A in these subjects should be given to
the*Shahadat ul Fazila Sanad* of*wafaq-ul-madaris* (Deoband),
the*Shahadatul Faragha* of*Tanzimul Madaris* (*Barelvi* ) as well as to
the final certificates of the two other schools of thought, the*Shia*
and*Ahl-e-Hadith.* [^193]

Besides the formal recognition of their graduates the government wanted
to provide financial support to DMs because of their bad financial
position. It was proposed that financial support should be provided from
the*zakat* fund as*zakat* regulation had already declared DM students
eligible for the receipt of*zakat.* The CII supported the criteria of
the*zakat* regulation. It was, however, made clear that only the DM
student would be eligible for receipt of financial support and no one
else. To ascertain the other conditions for the receipt of*zakat* a 12
member committee was nominated by provincial*zakat* administration.
Others details were finalized by this committee.[^194]

Reaction of Clergy and Din-i-madaris to the Official Policies
-------------------------------------------------------------

Since the proposal of the DM committee of 1979 was not received well by
the Deobandi*Wafaq ul Madaris,* they successfully campaigned to win over
other schools of thought. They presented alternative curricula to that
of the DM committee comprising of 16 instead of usual of eight years of
instruction in accordance with the proposals of the National Committee
for*Din-i-madaris,* while the curriculum committee of the Halepota
Report had proposed a subdivision in four levels similar to the formal
education system (primary, Matric, B.A and M.A level, middle and F.A
having been dropped).

The*Wafaq* and the*Tanzim* preferred a stricter subdivision into six
levels. The religious scholars thus wanted to adapt their system of
education primarily to the colonial system of education. The English
denominations of the certificates received an Arabic nomenclature in DM
system thus opening the possibility of putting the formal secular
aspects of the DM curricula on a religious, traditional level. In the
course of instruction of*Wafaq ul Madaris* some innovation were added to
the*Dars-i-Nzami* . The curricula nevertheless were essentially
different from that proposed by the DM committee of 1979. It had been
the aim of the National Committee for*Din-i-madaris* to integrate new
disciplines into the traditional system of education of*madaris* . The
classical traditional curriculum would thus be simultaneously modernized
and legitimized in Islamic fundamentalist manner.[^195]

The enthusiasm of the members of the Halepota Report for integration was
based on the concept of knowledge which had been presented by Islamic
intellectuals in 1977 in Mecca in the first World Conference on Islamic
Education. This points to their unquestioned belief in technology.[^196]
The curriculum proposed by the DM committee was close to the one
advocated by Abul Ala Mawdudi and supported by a small section of
different schools of thought who favored modernization.

While the clergy by and large paid no heed to the proposal of the
Halepota Report for the curricula at the primary level, the proposal for
curricula of the*Wafaq* at middle level (grades 6 to 10) actually
included new subjects. The classical subjects of*Dars-i-nizami* were
part of it only towards the end of this level. The studies of Islamic
law were nevertheless still at the core of the curriculum in contrast to
the proposals of NCDM, in which modern as well as classical subjects
were compulsory. Still subjects such as English and Pakistan Studies and
general science were not taken into consideration in the proposals of
the*Wafaq* , while economics, comparative religious sciences as well as
communism and capitalism, social sciences and other new subjects were
offered as optional subjects.[^197] After several interactions with the
government*Wafaq-ul-Madaris* agreed to some adjustments with the
government proposals. A factor in this was also the fear of losing
teachers as the previous years witnessed a brain drain away
from*madaris* to the formal institutions and to foreign countries. The
decision in favor of a new curriculum was further facilitated by the
prospects of official recognition and financial support by the
government. The government accepted the sixteen years curriculum as it
apparently fulfilled the conditions for a formal recognition. There was,
however, no essential alteration of the classical DMs course of
instruction. The*ulema* had been able to profit by this alteration,
gaining official recognition. This showed the ability of the*ulema* to
meet the demands of innovation and pragmatism without acting against
their own interest. With the new curriculum they gained influence,
rather than losing it. They finally achieved formal recognition via
these curricula, and, on this basis, were now able to influence the
secular sector. The DMs thus evolved into alternatives to the secular,
official, or commercial systems of education.

To evaluate the situation correctly it is important to note that Zia ul
Haq, the bureaucracy, and the*ulema* had different objective in the
agenda of reforms. The president sought the acceptance of his leadership
by the*ulema* and thus Islamic legitimization of his rule. For the
bureaucracy, formalization of DM served as a means to bring them under
control and thus to neutralize them politically. The*ulema,* in
contrast, were aimed at escaping their backwardness and achieving social
recognition without giving up their tradition. On the other hand, the
appeasement of*ulema* was a pragmatic move of Zia ul Haq who managed to
isolate clergy from mainstream political parties during MRD
Movement.[^198]

Barelvi*Tanzim* was relatively more easily ready for accepting the
government agenda. The new curriculum of the Barelvi is characterized by
the additional eight years phase put in front of the old curriculum. The
innovations to the old curriculum are of no particular value.
Mathematics, history and geography are listed but not specified as to
their contents. The new subjects are said to cover only the classes up
to grade 10. There are almost no alternations to the classical DM course
of instruction. This is evident from a sentence contained in the
curriculum of the*Tanzim* in 1983.[^199]

A spectacular reaction of the*ulema* and of the DM against the official
measures of Islamization was the boycott of the*zakat* system. The most
important point of controversy between the state and the clergy was the
regulation that the institutions receiving*zakat* were to maintain an
account on the*zakat* funds received and this bookkeeping was to be
audited by the*zakat* administration. The bureaucracy would thus have
information on the budgets of DM, the*ulema* and ultimately of religious
political parties. The auditing personnel were to be nominated by the
chief administrator*zakat* . The Central z*akat* Administration (CZA)
was actually demanding from the*Mohtamins *  proof that the fund had
been spent according to the rules of*Sharia* as understood by the
Central z*akat* Administration (CZA). Reacting to this regulation the
DMs affiliated to the*wafaq ul* *madaris al Arabia* refused to
accept*zakat* from PZC as along as*muftis* did not agree on the
compatibility of the new regulation with the*sharia.* [^200] *Wafaq ul
Madaris* did not agree to some parts of the*zakat* regulation and,
therefore, they refused to accept*zakat.* [^201]

The*Wafaq ul Madaris* called upon all the DMs affiliated to it not to
accept any*zakat* funds from the*zakat* administration and even to
return the amounts already received. Maulana Mufti Mahmood, a
leading*Deosbandi* *alim* had issued a*fatwa* in this regard declaring
whole official*zakat* systems against the*Sharia* . However, the appeal
of boycott was not received unanimously because some the DM
accepted*zakat* .*Jamia Ashrafiyyah,* Lahore, was one of the
largest*Deobandi* DMs which accepted official*zakat* .

In contrast to the policy of the*Wafaq* the*Barelvi Tanzim* not only
accepted the official*zakat* but asked for it without any precondition.
The*Tanzim* rather asked for raising*zakat* fund to the DMs and making
the flow easy.[^202] Thus, while*Deobandi* were still claimed to
reject*zakat* from central*zakat* fund, the*Barelvi* proved to be main
beneficiary from this system. Besides*Barelvi* , the*Ahl-e-Hadith*
and*Jamaat-i-Islami* were the main beneficiaries. Though the*Shia* were
ideologically against the prevailing*zakat* system, some of its DMs
received*zakat* as well.[^203]

Madrasahs under Democracy, 1988-1999
------------------------------------

The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979) and the Iranian revolution
(1979) brought far-reaching implications for the whole region and
especially for Pakistan. The religious forces were most suited to be
anti-Soviet forces because the war against Soviet occupation in 1979 was
initiated in the name of Islam. General Zia-ul-Haq promoted*Sunni* Islam
in order to neutralize the influence of*Shiism* and to strengthen*jihad*
in Afghanistan at the same time. The defeat of the Russian army in
Afghanistan in 1989 was, therefore, considered to be the victory of
Islam. This development had far reaching impacts on Pakistani*Sunni*
religious circles as they had provided active support to the*jihadis.*
These forces started to visualize an Islamic revolution on the same
lines in Pakistan. Meanwhile, the international community ceased to take
further interest in the region after the Soviet withdrawal.

The instability in Afghanistan and the rising influence of religious
extremists were the main challenges for the successive democratic
governments in Pakistan from 1988 onwards.[^204] The main focus of the
governments during this period remained on appeasement of the extremist
religious forces rather than to contemplate their education system. The
establishment of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan encouraged the clergy
of Pakistan to demand Islamization of the society according to their
interpretation of the*Sharia* . Since the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan
had studied in the DMs in Pakistan, therefore, the links between
these*madaris* and the Taliban were further strengthened. With this, the
element of militancy for the realization of religious objectives was
incorporated into the minds of students of DMs.

The rise of the Islamic movements, the*Tehrik-i-Nifaz-e-Shariat-i-
Mohammadi* (TNSM) of Maulana Sufi Mohammad in Malakand Division (NWFP)
in November 1994 and of*Tanzeem-i-Ittehad-e-Ulam-i-Qabail* (TIUQ) Khyber
Agency (FATA) were initial manifestations of the*ulema* assertion for
political authority. This claim for political authority was justified on
the perceived failure of government to deliver social justice and
maintain law and order effectively.[^205] The TNSM in pursuit of its
goals rallied thousands of supporters in May 1994. They demonstrated in
Swat and blocked the Malakand Pass. In November of the same year another
rebellion took place in Swat in which the TNSM activists paralyzed
government institutions. In the ensuing violence government officials
were made hostages and a PPP MPA was killed while resisting being taken
prisoner. The movement spread to other parts of Malakand in several
days. Under heavy pressure of the movement the NWFP(=Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)
government announced the enforcement of*Sharia* in Malakand Division.
According to the*Nifaz-e-Sharia* Regulation 1994, session judges, civil
judges and magistrates were renamed as*Zila Qazi* ,*Ilaqa Qazi* and*Qazi
Faujdari,* respectively. However, normalcy could return to Swat only
after a long spell of violence claiming dozens of lives and loss of
property worth hundreds of millions.[^206] Soon after, the TNSM
leadership questioned the credentials of*Qazis* appointed by the
government for not fulfilling the requirements of the*Sharia* . The
mushroom growth of the*madrasahs\`* s influence and the increasing
number of F M radio stations run by local clerics is a post-1994
phenomena in Swat.[^207]

Parallel to the development in Malakand Division, a socio-religious
movement started in Khyber Agency (FATA). This was known
as*Tanzeem-i-Ittihahad-e-Ulama-i-Qabail* (TIUQ). The workers of
the*Tanzeem* challenged government authority by taking law and order
into their own hands. They imposed harsh punishments upon local people.
The government had no other option than to order several military
operations to establish its writ in the Khyber Agency, albeit
temporarily. A decisive operation in August 1995 against the tribesmen
resulted in the deaths of twenty-one people. Later on, the government
released several leaders of the TIUQ on the assurance that government
authority would not be challenged in the future.[^208]   Though both
TNSM and TIUQ are based on local motives, they draw strength from the
common slogan of S*haria* and the same segment of the society. The PPP
government confronted this situation until its dismissal in November
1996.

These religious movements and other extremist groups to raise important
concerns and politicize public opinions were unquantifiable contributors
to the provincial and national changes made by the caretaker government
after the dismissal of the PPP government at the center. After the
election of 1997 the provincial government of Pakistan Muslim League and
Awami National Party confronted the same situation that had been faced
by the previous government. In June 1997 the provincial government
lifted the ban on the TNSM and the activities of Sufi Mohammad. The
chief Minister promised that the establishment of*Qazi* courts would be
reviewed in Malakand Division.[^209] In spite of heavy electoral success
of Pakistan Muslim League and Awami National Party in the province,
neither rising extremism could be overcome nor could the issue of law
and order could be permanently resolved.

Many factors are said to be responsible for the failure of successive
democratic governments to overcome the menace of extremism. The Taliban
regime in Afghanistan is counted to be the main external factor in this
context. The Taliban being the product of DMs in Pakistan had deep
relations with the leadership of religious parties and most of the large
DMs in the NWFP and tribal areas. Among the internal factors the failure
of the judicial system to deliver speedy justice and the close links of
the Inter Services Intelligence Agency (ISI), an intelligence wing of
the Pakistan army, with the extremist religious groups along with local
issues are responsible for ever-increasing extremism and militancy in
Pakistani society.[^210]

Recommendations of Educational Policies and Council of Islamic Ideology
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The recommendations of the first Educational Conference (1947) and those
of all educational policies declared that a uniform educational system
should be introduced in the country. Similarly, the reforms in the
religious education were proposed to bring it at par with the formal
educational system in the country. The National Educational Policy
(1979) recommended utilizing mosques for the universalizing of primary
education. The*imams* (prayer leaders) of mosques should be employed in
such schools along with other teachers for this purpose.[^211] National
Educational Policy 1998-2010 proposed the establishment of
a*Din-i-madaris* Board for maintaining the standard of education
in*Din-i-madaris* through standardization of curricula and examination
system, equivalence of*asnad*   (certificate), award of scholarships,
grant-in-aid  and financial assistance by the government. The
willing*tanzeems* of independent*madaris* will be eligible for
affiliation by the board. Model*dar-ul-ulums* were to be established
through phased programs at divisional level throughout the country to
absorb the graduates of these*madaris* in the market for technical,
vocational and formal educational courses. A Proposal for removing the
three-tier system of education (English medium, Urdu medium
and*din-i-madaris* ) was recommended.[^212]

The Council of Islamic Ideology also recommended a comprehensive reforms
package for the educational system in the country. The recommendations
of the Council of Islamic Ideology 1975-76 stated that all the branches
of learning and education on study of sciences and religion belong to
Islamic educational system provided that the elements that are opposed
to Islamic ideals are removed. Hence, no educational institution should
be considered outside the ambit of Islamic educational system. The
deficiencies and gaps are filled up by adding the study of the*Holy
Qur’an* and teaching of Islam to the curriculum of the institutions of
general education. On the other hand, subjects helpful in modern times
are included in the curriculum of the institutions of religious
education. The essential atmosphere for preserving Islamic ideals of
character, morality and spiritual zeal is maintained in all the
institutions. It should be seen that the curriculum and general
atmosphere of all the institutions are conducive to the fundamental
ideals of Islamic unity, brotherhood, love for the country, and the
Islamic ideals for which Pakistan came into existence. Similar
recommendations, made in 1978 by the CII, were aimed at the
establishment of uniform educational system in the country (bringing all
the streams of educations into a single uniform system).[^213]

The foregoing discussion revealed that repeated efforts for integration
of the traditional educational sector with that of the formal education
system could not be realized since 1947. The main reasons in this regard
were the lack of commitment on the part of bureaucracy and
non-cooperation of the clergy. The*ulema* always considered such moves
as part of a direct threat to their influence and a challenge to their
authority. On the other hand, the governments, especially military
governments, tried to legitimize their claims to political power through
such measures and were not able to gain the confidence of*ulema* for
this purpose. Despite all these efforts the dichotomy in the educational
system was more visible after more than 50 years than it had been in
1947.
