Reluctance to Act
=================

   
 A person who feels reluctant to act falls short of what is correct,
even if he does right; while a person who acts voluntarily is correct,
even if he errs. The reluctant one obtains only contempt in the end, and
weariness, toil and misery while he is carrying out the action. The
outer being of a reluctant person is showing off, and his inner being is
hypocrisy: they are the wings with which he flies. The reluctant person
never has any of the qualities of the righteous nor any of the marks of
the believers, wherever he is. As Allah said to His Prophet (S),  
  

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْ مَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ
الْمُتَكَلِّفِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Say, I do not ask you for any reward for it; nor am I of those who
affect [i.e. act with reluctance].*** (38:87)

   
 The Holy Prophet said, 'we, the company of prophets, the fearfully
aware, the trusty, we disavow the reluctant.' So, fear Allah and do away
with reluctance, and it will mark you with the sign of belief. Do not be
occupied with something whose garment is affliction, with food which in
the end is emptiness, with an abode whose end is ruin, with wealth whose
end is to be inherited by others, with comrades whom in the end one must
take leave of, with glory which in the end is abasement, with loyalty
which in the end is abandonment, or with a life whose end is grief.
