Letter 39
=========

Requesting the Wilayat Verse
----------------------------

**Thul-Hijjah 30, 1329**

I testify that you are firm in your beliefs, sincere in your campaign,
forceful and unmatched in facing your debater, invincible in the field.
I am a believer in the ahadith according to the way which you have
suggested. Had I not been obliged to believe in the *sahabah*, I would
have accepted your judgement, but taking the word's meaning in the way
those *sahabah* have taken it is a must, following in the footsteps of
the good ancestors, may Allah be pleased with all of them.

But you have not acquainted us with the terse verse which you claim, at
the conclusion of Letter No. 36, that supports your view regarding the
interpretation of these ahadith. Recite it for us so that we may
comprehend its meaning by the Will of Allah Almighty, Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*S*
