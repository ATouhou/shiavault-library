Muslim dies a Martyr
====================

Amru bin al-Hajjaj began a big attack. Imam Husayn's companions faced
the attack and fought bravely.

Muslim bin Ausajah, a companion of the Imam's, was fighting with
enthusiasm. Then he was badly wounded and fell over the ground.

Imam Husayn [a] saw Muslim lying on the ground. He and Habib bin
Mudhahir attacked Yazeed's Army. They saved Muslim bin Ausajah from
them. Muslim was about to die.

Imam Husayn [a] sadly said:

*Muslim, may Allah have mercy upon you. I'm giving you good news about
the Paradise.*

Muslim answered faintly:

*May Allah give you good news!*

Habib said:

*I wish I could listen to your will, but I'll die after you.*

Muslim looked at Habib. Then he looked at Imam Husayn [a] and said:

*Habib, I ask you to die for Husayn!*

*By the Lord of Kaaba, I will!*
