7. Magic
========

**Q190: Is it permissible to use white magic which is employed for good
and is the opposite of black magic which is used by evil persons?**

A: Magic in all its shapes and forms is forbidden [even that which is
used to undo magic] unless the matter rests upon a greater benefit such
as saving the life of a respected person. (FM, pp. 417-18)

Inviting Souls
--------------

**Q191: Inviting the souls in order to ask them about their state and
the** ***barzakh*** **and other matters pertaining to the hereafter.**

A: It is prohibited to invite a respected soul whose summoning would
cause him harm. Other than these (respected souls), it is permissible.
(FM, p. 418)

Exploiting the Angels
---------------------

**Q192: Some of them claim that they exploit the angels.**

A: There is no basis to this claim. (FM, p. 418)

Asking for Intercession
-----------------------

**Q193: Is it permissible to ask for sustenance, a child, protection or
intercession directly from the infallible ones?**

Follow up: Let me ask you first. Do you seek this from them because they
create, or sustain, or protect?

Response: Certainly not. But rather because they are the means to Allah
(s.w.t.), the intercessors with Him in the disposal of affairs, and
because they cannot do anything but with the permission of Allah, the
Sublime and Exalted.

Follow up: You mean that they ask Allah the Exalted and He creates, and
they ask Him and He sustains, and they ask Him and He protects, and
because they are intercessors, whose pleas or supplications are not
rejected, because of their status with Allah, the Sublime, and for their
guardianship over us?

Response: Yes, I mean that.

A: This is permissible. Allah (s.w.t.) says: "...and seek means of
nearness to Him..." (Qur'an, 5:35) and they (a.s.) are your means of
approach to Allah (s.w.t.). This is permissible. (FM, p. 421)
