The Flimsy Supports Are Like Spider Web
=======================================

VERSE NO.41ِ44

Those who take protectors other than Allah have taken a very flimsy and
unreliable support. Their likeness is the like of a spider that span a
web and took it for a house, while the house of spider is relatively the
most infirm of houses.

The spider silk is strong enough from the point of relativity, but in
our actual world they are flimsy and infirm, and a breeze, a small flame
or a rain may ruin the whole construction. Each animal or insect may
have a house, but none of them are as flimsy as that of spider web. True
that it is a resting place, and a hunting snare, for the spider; but in
comparison to the other nests, like that of an ant or a bee, its far
weaker a place, and unreliable a support.

Those who rely on gods other than the true, and only one God, [ 634 ]
they have relied on the house of a spider which is limp, frail, and
unsubstantial.

Although the spider web has been a parable and proverb to show
something infirm, yet in itself it is one of the wonders of creation,
that studying it will remind us of the grandeure of our Lord.

It has been said that the silk of spider is made of viscous liquid
which is made in its abdomen; a small amount of which is span by the
spider to some five hundred meters of the silk. The silk is said to be
stronger than a thread of the same thickness made of iron. The form and
the structure of the web is also wonderful. It seems to be like the sun
which is surrounded by her rays. Scholars have recognized some 20
thousand kinds of spiders so far, all of them having their own
particularities.

In the next verse (NO-43) we read:-

And these similitudes we coin for people, but none understand them
except those with knowledge.'' This implies that without enough
knowledge, it is not easy to apprehend the wonders of creation that may
show us the Infinite Mercy, Grace, and Beauty of our Compassionate
Lord.

**THE SPIDER**

The SPIDER is one of the several types of small creatures with eight
thin legs, many of which spin webs to trap insects for food. Several
species of spiders have a venom that is dangerous to man. On the other
hand, most of them serve man unwittingly by destroying a vast number of
bothersome insects, roaches, mosquitoes, flies, and other harmful
creatures. The spiders are one of the most important and numerous groups
of the animal kingdom. All of them have jointed legs and a segmented
body encased in a stiff skeletons.

The supreme accomplishment of spiders perhaps is the art of spinning
silk made within their bodies. Most spiders have eight eyes; there are
also six eyed, four eyed and two eyed spiders among them. [ 635 ] All
spider are preying animals. They eat insects almost exclusively,
subduring them with venom. They cut and break the body of the prey, and
at the same time they bathe it with digestive liquids from glands
located near the mouth. In this way, the softer parts of the insect are
predigested and are then sucked into the spider's stomach by powerful
muscles. The prey is rolled and chewed until only a little ball of
indigestible matter remains, and this is finally cast aside. Several
hours are often required to suck an ordinary fly completely dry.

The male spider is rather short lived. It dies after a brief period of
intense activity. It is much smaller than the female.

Males are sometimes killed and eaten by their females. In many cases,
males and females live together very friendly. Spider can neither hear
nor smell, but it has other sensory organs called palpis.

Each spider begins its life as an egg. An spider may lay a great number
of eggs sometimes as many as two or three thousands in a single mass.
The spinning organs of spiders are finger like appendages usually
located near the rear of the abdomen. There are generally six of them
which from them may be spun several different kinds of silk. There are
more than 30 thousands kinds of spiders. Some of them are skilled
Engineers digging deep tunnels in the soil and covering the openings
with hinged trap doors. After preparing their burrows, they waterproof
the walls with saliva and soil, line them with silk and then cap the
entrance with a hinged trap door.

In some cases, the makers of the doors have a secret side burrow within
the main chamber into which they can retreat when menaced by enemies.
This burrow is closed with a second trap door.

QUOTED FROM THE BOOK OF POPULAR SCIENCE

VOL.2. AN ARTICLE BY WILLIS J. GERTSCH

**Translator's Note**

[ 636 ]

اتْلُ مَا أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَأَقِمِ الصَّلاَةَ إِنَّ
الصَّلاَةَ تَنْهَى عَنِ الْفَحْشَاءِ وَالْمُنْكَرِ وَلَذِكْرُ اللهِ
أَكْبَرُ وَاللهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَصْنَعُونَ(( 45 ))

45- RECITE THAT OF THE BOOK WHICH HAS BEEN REVEALED TO YOU, AND PERFORM
THE PRAYER, THAT THE PRAYER FORBIDS FROM INDECENCY AND EVIL; AND THE
REMEMBRANCE OF ALLAH IS GREATER. AND ALLAH KNOWS WHATEVER YOU
MANUFACTURE.

**THE COMMENTARY
PRAYER IS TO PREVENT OBSCENE ACTS**

VERSE NO.45

This verse is to tell our prophet and all the Muslims to read the Book
of Allah-Qura"n. Read and rehearse it to others, and see that whatever
you look for, of truth, you will find it in there:- Science, knowledge
of God, wisdom, Instructions, Historical event for lesson, Law, Right
and wrong, light and dark, and whatever is needed to illuminate man's
heart and lead him to prosperity in both lives, are inserted in Qura"n.
Then read it and follow. Read it and apply.

And perform the prayer with all its conditions, that it strictly
forbids indecency and evil deeds. He who performs the prayer will not
forget his Lord and the Final Judgement in the Resurrection Day. He will
know Allah to be the owner of that wonderful day. He who performs the
prayer, will repeatedly ask his God, to guide him to the Direct Path of
truth. To the way of those whom Allah has bestowed His Grace and Mercy
on them, not the way of those who incurred the wrath of God, and neither
the way of those who strayed from the path of truth.

[ 637 ]

He who performs the prayer is humble and has no pride. He prostrates
himself before the Lord of all creation and associates not any kind of a
partner with him. No prayer has ever been performed without having any
spiritual positive effect on the self and soul of the performer. Of
course, there are grades, stages, and steps, in the course of faith and
religion. All the believers are not alike. Some are higher in rank and
some are lower. As a matter of fact, there are as many ways to Allah as
there are Souls of men.

The prayer has to make the performer to avoid evil and obscene acts.
What of a man who performs his daily prayer and who will not stop
committing sins! That kind of prayer is far from being a true prayer.

The Book of God must be read, studied, meditated and well understood,
and when so, it merges into real prayer the immediate result of which is
getting nearer to beauty and goodnessِto the absolute goodness which is
God; and getting more and more a distance from badness and evil. The
prayer is a good mount to ride us from darkness to light.


THE END OF PART 20 OF QURA"N
[ 638 ]
THANKS FOR HELP

When his Holiness HAZRAT AYATULLAH-AL-OZMA", NASIR MAKARIM SHIRAZI, in
the MARCH 1999, ordered me to start translating an expressive summary of
his great work on the Glorious Qura"n, which is named as, \`\`THE
EXAMPLE COMMENTARY'' I took his order for the best of opportunities in
my life. I immediately resigned of my office, and got rid of all my
jobs, in order to use my full time and power, with love and pleasure, on
this sacred work. Now after three years of a full time work, I offer to
my dear readers the fourth volume of the whole work, which is to
complete in six volumes altogether.

Up to here, half of the whole Qura"n has been translated and published,
and it is also found on Internet too.

Whether I have been successful or failed, I have nothing to say. I only
know that I have done my best; and I leave the judgement to the Most
Merciful and Compassionate Lord, for whose sake and pleasure, and for
nothing else; I have done the work.

In the present attempt, I have to give my sincere thanks to the
following commentators, translators, and publishers, without whose help
I could not have reached the point that I have reached.

First of all, and in particular, I owe to make a mention of MOWLANA
ALLAMEH ABDULLAH YUSUF ALI, whose valuable work in translation and
commentary of QURA"N, has been the most intimate friend of mine, in the
past ten years. I have always had it a sacred duty incumbent upon me to
rehearse a few pages of his sacred work first time in the morning,
before I start doing anything else:

\`\`And those who came after them say:ِ \`\`Our Lord! Forgive us and
our brothers who came before us into faith, and leave not in our hearts
rancour against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed Full
of kindness Most Merciful.''

S 59:10

[ 639 ]

In this fourth volume of the work, I again owe alot to my dear
colleague, Miss Poora"n Pebdani, who earnestly did all the corrections,
the computer works and the layout of the book. Meanwhile I have had her
help in preparing the English version of our Grand Ayatullah's frequent
answers to Internet questions from all round the Globe.

Then I owe a lot of my present attempts to the following translators of
Qura"n, books, and publishers:ِ
