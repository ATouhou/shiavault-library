Publisher’s Preface
===================

**In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful**

Praise be to Allah and blessings on His chosen servants, Muhammad and
his progeny, which is the best of creations. This is the translation of
the second volume of *Hayat al-Qulub* a compilation of Allah’s most
humble servant, Muhammad Baqir bin Muhammad Taqi (May Allah pardon him),
and contains information about all events of the holy life of Allah’s
last prophet and the greatest of all messengers, Muhammad bin Abdullah;
and wars and struggles of Allah’s closest friend and so also about his
pious and religious ancestors.

By the Grace of the Almighty and under the guidance of Imam az-Zaman
(a.s.), Ja’fari Propagation Cen­tre is pleased to announce the new
translation of the second volume of Allamah Majlisi’s *Hayat al-Qu­lub.*

Under the aim of Islamic Propagation, this organization has translated,
printed, and published more than 100 titles on current issues in Islamic
studies in various languages and taken up distribution of books from
other organizations also by the blessings of Imam az-Zaman (a.s.); and
we hope that read­ers from India and all over the world will greatly
benefit from our literature.

Our publications include *Sahifa Alawiya, Mikyalul Makarim, Fatima the
Radiant, Sahifa al-Sajjadiya, Method of Salat* and there are many titles
