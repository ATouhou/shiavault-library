E. Conclusion
=============

Muhammadiyah has made great efforts both to modernize Indonesia and to
reform the interpretation of Islam in Indonesia. In the first part, it
has been relatively successful in establishing modern infrastructures
such as schools, hospitals, and banks, to mention a few. In the second
part, it is still not able to attract rural Moslem communities who
compose majority of Indonesian Moslems. The cause of this failure can be
traced back to the sociological background of its followers in the urban
area of Jogjakarta, which did not accommodate the religious thinking of
the rural areas.

Muhammadiyah’s slogan of anti-TBC (*Takhayul, Bid’ah,* Churafat) was to
confront to religious life in the rural area s and culminated in Sufi sm
Its modern religious interpretation focused on using ratio nality to
manage the worldly, and it did not accept the emotional relationship
with God. Its strong opposition to TBC changed as it needs spiritual
feeling recently because of the presence of such immense materialism. It
took a long time from 1912 to the 1990-s to see this dialectical
thinking from opposing Sufi sm into accepting Sufi sm to such extend
This process can be shortened if there existed a mutual dialogue with
other groups, or had there been comparative history studies with already
advanced societies in the West.
