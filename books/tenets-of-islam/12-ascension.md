Ascension
=========

The Holy Prophet's 'Ascension' with his physical body openly, not in a
sleeping state, is a true fact. The reports about this event are
continuous, clear and specific. Therefore anybody who denies it is
outside the pale of Islam. The Holy Prophet passed through the gates of
the heavens, so there was no question of their being torn and patched up
again. The flimsy arguments in this connection have been refuted at
their appropriate place.
