Responsibility 80: Giving Gifts and Presents to the Shi‘a
=========================================================

Another responsibility is to give gifts to the righteous Shi’a and
friends of the Imam from one’s wealth and whatever else one has in this
material world and this is something that has been mentioned in the
traditions which we will shortly review.

Not only does this act earn the pleasure of other believers, rather it
also has an impact on the society in general and as a result, the Shi’a
and friends of the Imam, through the exchange of gifts, actually help to
alleviate poverty amongst one another! This will, in turn, help them to
lift themselves up from their abject state through which, their lives
will improve and they will not fall victim to difficulties and
tribulations!

Imam Musa b. Ja’far al-Kadhim (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ مَنْ لَمْ يَقْدِرْ عَلـى صِلَتِنَا فَلْيَصِلْ صَالِحِي مَوَالِينَا
يُكْتَبُ لَهُ ثَوَابُ صِلَتِنَا
  </p>
</blockquote>

“A person who is not able to present us with a gift should give it to
the righteous ones from among our followers. It will be written for him
as a reward for presenting a gift to us!”[^1]
