The Preparatory Measures of Bin Ziad (O) for the Reception of the Rest of the Hussain Convoy
============================================================================================

When the news of the return of Bin Saadâ€™s army to Kufa reached Bin Ziad,
he ordered that no one shall carry weapons in Kufa. He also ordered ten
thousand knights to spread on the roads, markets and streets due to his
fear of people moving out of rage to what happened to Ahlu El-Bayt (R)3
, especially if they saw who is left of them in such miserable state of
captivity. Thus, the population of Kufa was at that time around three
hundred thousand. He ordered for the heads of the martyrs to be put
among the ladies and to make them walk the streets and roads in order to
inculcate fear in the hearts of the people. Bin Ziad also ordered for
the holy head to be put on top of a spear and to walk with it all the
streets of Kufa.

Thus the head of Imam Hussain (Q) was the first head to be put on a
spear.
