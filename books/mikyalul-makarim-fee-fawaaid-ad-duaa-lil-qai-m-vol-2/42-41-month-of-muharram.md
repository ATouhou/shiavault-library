41. Month Of Muharram
=====================

Whenever a believer see atrocities afflicted on the chosen Imams (as) by
their enemies, his faith in them, his love for them and his grief for
them, exhort him to avenge their blood and the oppression committed
against them. This is not possible in these times at all except by
praying for the reappearance of Hazrat Mahdi (may Allah hasten his
reappearance), as is evident.
