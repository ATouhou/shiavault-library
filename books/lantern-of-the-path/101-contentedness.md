Contentedness
=============

   
 If a man of contentedness were to swear that he would eventually be in
charge of his two abodes, Allah would confirm him in that, realizing his
hope through the immensity of his contentment. How can Allah's servant
not be content with what He has allotted him when He says,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُم مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***We distribute among them their livelihood between them in the life of
this world.*** (43:32)  
    
 Whoever yields to Allah, and is not heedless in affirming Him in what
He wishes and whenever He wishes, whoever has certainty of His lordship
ascribes of necessity the allotment of each man's provision directly to
Himself, and does not recognize the reality of causes. Whoever is
content with what is allotted is relieved of care, grief and fatigue.
Whenever he decreases in contentment, he increases in desire. Greed for
this world is the root of every evil; the person who has it is not saved
from the Fire unless he repents.  
    
 That is why the Holy Prophet said, 'Contentment is a kingdom which does
not vanish.' It is the ship of Allah's pleasure, bearing whoever is on
board it to His House. Have excellent trust in what you have not been
given, and pleasure in what you have been given. Be patient in what
befalls you, for this indeed is one of the greatest tasks.
