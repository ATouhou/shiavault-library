2. The Divine Sun
=================

He is the sun, presently concealed behind the clouds. That is, we have
relegated him behind the clouds... But the sun continues to shine and
will continue to do so. Its brilliant rays rip apart the dense veils of
the clouds, spreading throughout the universe. Have we ever reflected on
it?

But for the light and warmth of the sun, pitch darkness would have
enveloped the earth.

He is the sun, the sun of the entire universe. The sun of the solar
system is a mere shadow of his resplendence.

The day of the earth’s residents begins with the rising of the sun, even
if it is hidden behind the clouds. Similarly, can the day of a spiritual
and holy life commence without the illuminating rays of Allah’s proof?
Is it possible that one breathes in the world of spirituality, and is
needless of Allah’s representative..? No, it’s impossible[^1].
