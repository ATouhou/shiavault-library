***In The Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful***

Surah Yunus is the tenth Surah of the Holy Qur’an which was revealed
during the early days of the Prophet’s appointment in Mecca.

This Surah contains 109 verses, and its main topics are about
monotheism, the authenticity of the Qur’an, answers to those who deny
revelation, inspiring fear in the unbelievers, exposing the glory and
magnitude of the act of creation and of the Creator, the lack of
permanence of the world as well as calling the attentions of all peoples
to the world after death.

The former Surah, that is “Repentance”, dealt with the acts of the
hypocrites as well as their punishment, while this Surah refers to the
acts of polytheists.

As to the rewards accounted for reciting and reading this Surah, there
have been cited some traditions among which is the tradition narrated by
Imam Sadiq (as) who said: He who recites Surah Yunus every two or three
months may not be of the ignorant and will be of the near-stationed on
the Day of Resurrection. [^1]
