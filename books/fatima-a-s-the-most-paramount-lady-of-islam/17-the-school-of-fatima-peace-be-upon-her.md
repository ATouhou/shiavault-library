The School of Fatima (peace be upon her):
=========================================

Under the protection of Islamic ideology and her outlook, Fatima (peace
be upon her) built the thought foundation of a Divine and human school,
including principles, rules and beliefs; a hopeful and life-giving
school teaching us how to live and how to die. Fatima’s school, the
pearly-gates to the other world to us, inverts the last generation’s way
of life, and builds up a new world on the ruins. She rouses a new way of
thinking, teaching us how to look at the world and life.

Fatima’s school endeavors to make the human beings hopeful, teach them
the way of chastity and covering themselves, support the oppressed,
consider the most sensitive matters of man’s life, settle justice in the
society and not allow every one does what he wishes.

In this world that the people are victimized for feathering their nests,
and the people are ready to yield themselves in a mean form for
instantaneous pleasures, in this world that people, like imprisoned
birds which strike themselves against the cage and try to take pleasure,
Fatima’s school can be teachable and resolving.
