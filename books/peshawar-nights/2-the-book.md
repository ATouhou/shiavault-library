The Book
========

**Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim**

Sultanu'l-Wa’adhim Shirazi, an eminent scholar of Iran, visited India in
1927 A.D (1345 A.H.) when he was 30 years old. He was given a rousing
reception everywhere he went. People benefited from his knowledge of
tradition, history, and commentary on the Holy Qur'an.

He was persuaded to enter into a religious debate on 23rd Rajab, 1345
A.H., with people of another belief in Peshawar, in what was then India
and is today Pakistan. The discussion took place on ten successive
nights.

The two principal participants from the opposite side were renowned
scholars of Kabul, Hafiz Muhammad Rashid, and Sheikh Abdu's-Salam. Four
reporters recorded the discussions in the presence of approximately 200
people (Shi’as and Sunni Muslims).

Local newspapers published these accounts each following morning.
Sultanu'l-Wa’adhim Shirazi compiled thenewspaper accounts of the
discussions in a book in Persian, published in Teheran as
Shabhaye-Peshawar, or Peshawar Nights. The following is a translation of
that book.
