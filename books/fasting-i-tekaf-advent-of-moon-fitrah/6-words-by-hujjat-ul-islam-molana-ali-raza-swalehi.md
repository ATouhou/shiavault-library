Words By Hujjat-ul-Islam Molana Ali Raza Swalehi
================================================

**(TRANSLATION FROM URDU)**

*In the name of Allah*

I have gone through this booklet compiled by Maulana Muhammad Raza
Dawoodani. He has tried to present Fiqh rulings in a unique style. This
is a new trend in Urdu language. He has focused on following four
points:

1. To discuss the rulings which believers generally come across

2. To use friendly language spoken in daily life

3. To set a side the differences of interpretation and mention the
precautionary aspect where ever possible

4. To follow logical sequence without getting into the details.

There are always merits and demerits in innovations. So is the case with
this booklet. This booklet will be helpful to many brothers in faith in
solving their problems but since it explains the precautionary angle,
can cause extra physical and financial efforts. Generally, *Momineen*
refer to rulings for their practical needs. This booklet will be the
best assistant on any such occasion.

In the end, I pray for the acceptance of Agha Muhammad Raza Dawoodani's
this effort and hope this will please Imam-e-Zamana (AS.). May Allah
grant him further *Taufeeq* to work on other chapters of *Fiqh* in a
similar fashion.

Wassalam ...
