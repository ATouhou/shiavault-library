Q70: Is Magic Allowed?
======================

Is it allowed in Islam to practice magic, witchcraft or astrology? A.
There are scores of Ahadith condemning these practices and likening such
persons to a Kafir.

**Q71: FOLLOWING MAGICIAN'S ADVICE**

I have read in Kitabu cha Saumu that Uchawi (witchcraft) is Gunahe
Kabira. Some time back a magician published the following for persons
with certain stars or names starting with letter 'M' or names with
certain number of letters; He says that for such a person for good
luck,

(a) he recommends Olive-oil or palmoil;
(b) he recommends Rose or Jasmine perfume;
(c) he recommends Yellow or Near Yellow clothes.

Further, in times of trouble or illness or when meeting "big persons"
one should keep in pocket in cotton wool a garlic boiled in coconut oil
and should sleep with it under pillow and he should keep head tilted
towards east and when sleeping also.

Furthermore he recommends travelling to west and north and avoiding
east and south as far as possible.

I have tried these and they seem to work. To my knowledge none of the
proposals constitute any 'Haram' thing. Is this "Uchawi' and thus haram?
Should I stop this practice?

To my knowledge our religion actually encourages white and yellow
clothes and also perfumes. I pray daily and take deep interest in
Islam.

A. Now coming to your question about 'MAGIC', you better stop following
such things. Of course, it is Sunnat to use perfume. But it will bring
'thawab' (Reward) only if it is used because the Prophet or Imam told
you to do so. If you use it because a magician told you to do so, then
it bring you no 'thawab' and you will be guilty of following a
'Magician'.

It is not possible to write more details on this subject at present.
Suffice it to quote Hadhrat Ali (a.s.): "Anybody who listens to a man,
is worshipping him. Now, if that speaker tells the words of God then
this listener is worshipping God; and if the speaker is telling the
words of Satan, then the listener is worshipping Satan."

**Q72: WHAT ABOUT PALMISTRY, ISTIKHARAH, "SAAD" AND "NAHAS" DATES AND
QAMAR-DAR-AQRAB?**

What have you to say about Palmistry, Istikharah and Qur'anic
Consultation in the light of Sheriat? Some Shias check up the dates and
the year from calenders for "Saad", "Nahas" and "Qamar-Dar-Aqrab".
"Navroz" comes on 'hare'. Have all these things any religious
significance?

A. Palmistry is not recognized by the Sheriat. Some forms of Istikharah
with Qur'an or prayers are prescribed by our Imams.

Nawroz: It has one special "Aamaal" after Zohr prayer. This date had
coincided with 18th Zilhijja when the Prophet (s.a.w.) declared the
Khilafat of Hazrat Ali (a.s.) in Khum. But unfortunately, the Irani
Shias imported the Parsee rites and views which have no basis in
Sheriat, and are, in fact, against Islamic character.

Dates: "Sa'd" and 'Nahs' are sometimes "Qamar dar Aqrab". Many stars
usually cluster together in such a way that they appear to form outlines
of some pictures. There is 'Great Bear', 'Small Bear' etc. etc.
Likewise, there is a group which form the picture of a scorpion
('Aqrab).

The moon (Qamar). while rotating around the earth passes from that
group in 2Â½ days, that period is called "Qamar dar 'Aqrab" (Moon in the
Scorpion). According to traditions of our Imams, it is 'Makruh' (Not
desirable) to recite Nikah or start journey in that period.

Dates: "Sa'd" and "Nahs' are sometimes based on some Ahadith; sometimes
on historical events. The dates in which some good event took place for
any Ma'sum is called "Sa'd" (auspicious). The dates in which some
tragedy befell on them is called "Nahs" (inauspicious).

But they all are governed by the general principle, mentioned in
Ahadith, that if you want to do any work on a date or day which has been
declared as 'Nahas', you should give some "Sadaqa" and then go ahead. In
short, it is not meant to hinder your progress.

**Q73: TAKING OUT BLOOD**

I have also read that there are days (i.e. dates 14, 16, 30) when
taking out the blood is beneficial to body, mind, etc. On other Islamic
dates this is harmful. Now if we donate blood on "bad days', will it not
be harmful?

A. These things are meant as a general guidance. They should not be
taken as hard and fast rule. Every person has to decide for himself.
Also, it will be a good thing to consult an experienced doctor and to
give some "Sadaqa" before donating the blood on such days.

**Q74: IS 'EUTHANASIA- ALLOWED?**

Does Islam allow euthanasia (i.e. making it easy for a sick person to
die). A. It is not allowed. If the patient commits it himself it is
suicide; if some one else does so to him, it is murder.

**Q75: MERCY KILLING?**

If someone suffers from an incurable disease and he prefers to die
rather than continue living a painful life; such a patient requests a
doctor or physician to give him a medicine to end his life. Can the said
doctor or physician acceed to such request?

A. No. If he accedes to such request and administers the medicine by
his own hand, he will be guilty of murder If he gives the patient the
medicine and the patient takes the medicine by his own hands, it will be
suicide; and the doctor will be guilty of helping in the suicide.

**Q76: DEFORMED BABIES**

A few years ago, as a result of some medicines which women were taking
to prevent pregnancy, many children were born with some of their limbs
missing. Was it allowed to give such children some medicine to terminate
their lives, so that they would not suffer as a result of their freak
creation?

A. The reply of Question 75 applies here also.

**Q77: A PATIENT KEPT ALIVE BY ARTIFICIAL EQUIPMENTS**

If a patient is kept alive only with the help of some medical equipment
like artificial kidney; and if the doctor is sure that the patient can
never be cured, is it allowed for him to remove that equipment from the
patient so that he may die and be saved from pain?

A. The detailed answer may be understood from the answer to the
previous two questions.

**Q.78: CANNIBALISM IN SOUTH AMERICA**

I have sent you cuttings from 'Times' Newspaper on cannibalism that
took place in South America after an aircrash. Are we allowed, according
to Islamic Sheriat, to eat human flesh (dead or alive) when we are
starving (to death) as that happened with the Christians who were
involved in that crash?

A Muslim here in UK told me that we can even kill a weak person amongst
us and eat his flesh if we are stranded (as in the above case). Please,
comment on this.

A. In the situation under reference it is allowed to eat the dead body,
because saving human life is more important than saving a dead body. But
by the same reason, nobody is allowed to kill another person to eat his
flesh to save himself from starvation, because it will mean taking away
a life.

**Q79: ANIMAL SLAUGHTERED BY A JEW**

Is it halal or haram for Muslims to purchase, and eat meat of any kind
from a Jewish kosher market? Give me, please, Qur'anic verse about it.
When are we allowed to eat the meat of an animal killed by a
non-Muslim?

A. The conditions, by which the meat of a slaughtered animal becomes
halal, are as follows: -

1) The person who slaughters the animal must be a Muslim. There is no
exception to this rule.

2) It must be slaughtered by an instrument made of iron. In
emergencies, sharp glass or other metals may be used.

3) At the time of slaughter, the face, stomach and legs of the animal
must be facing towards Qibla, i.e., Kaaba or Mecca. Also, the person who
is slaughtering should face towards Qibla. This rule may be relaxed when
one does not know the direction of Qibla or it is difficult to make the
animal face the Qibla.

4) At the time of slaughter, the name of "Allah" (e.g. the words
"Bismillah") must be recited.

5) The animal, after the slaughter, must move its limbs; e.g. Moves its
feet or tail a little.'lt will prove that the animal died as a result of
the slaughter, not before, it. 6) Blood should come out In usual
quantity after the slaughter.

Now, in "Kosher" meats, conditions Nos. 1, 3 and 4 are not fulfilled.
And the first condition has no escaping clause.

As for ayat read the following "forbidden to you are dead meat, blood,
the flesh of swine, and that over which has been invoked the name of
other than Allah, and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a
violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored to death, and
that which has been partly eaten by a wild animal! (unless you are able
to slaughter it in due form), and that which has been sacrificed on
stone (altars); Forbidden also is the division of meat by raffling with
arrows; that is impiety". (Qur'an, 5:4).

The only time when you may be allowed to eat the meat Slaughtered by a
non-Muslim, is when you are on verge of death because of starvation. and
there is absolutely no other thing to eat and save your life. (So far.
as fish is concerned, the only things necessary and that it must have
"scales' and must die out of water. If these two conditions are
fulfilled, you may eat it.)
