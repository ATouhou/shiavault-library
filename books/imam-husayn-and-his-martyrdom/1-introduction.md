Introduction
============

The month of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar, brings
with it the memory of the sacrifice of Imam Husayn (a), the grandson of
Prophet Muhammad (s), and his noble family and friends.

This short text reflects the deep admiration of its author towards Imam
Husayn (a) and an insight into the tragedy of Karbala, its reasons and
its consequences.

It is presented with the hope that it will foster the Islamic unity and
the brotherly love that the author seeks in his preface.

*The author, of course, is none other than the well-known Sunni English
translator and commentator of the Qur'an, Abdullah Yusuf â€˜Ali, who died
in 1952 in England.*

Little would he have known that his English translation and commentary
of the Qur'an would become so popular in the West and East alike,
wherever English is read and understood.

And little would he have known that later editions of his Qur'an
translation and commentary would undergo tampering such that favorable
references to Imam Husayn (a) would be deleted, amongst other changes!1

Perhaps there are some out there who want to see the memory of Imam
Husayn (a) wiped out.

Perhaps Karbala is not quite over yet.
