Foreword
========

We thank God the Almighty for the opportunity granted to us to
undertake the preparation of IMAM REZA'S PILGRIMAGE PROCEDURES AND
PRAYERS. Imam Reza (MGB)1 is the eighth Immaculate Leader of Muslims
from the progeny of Muhammad the Prophet of God (MGB). Imam Ali ibn Musa
known as al-Reza was also known as Abal-Hassan. He was born in Medina on
Thursday, 11th Dhu'l Qi'dah 148 A.H. (765 A.D.). He was poisoned by
alMa'mun at the age of 55 in Mashhad on Tuesday, 7th Saffar 203 A.H.
(818 A.D.) and buried in Mashhad.

Imam Reza (MGB) was brought up under the holy guidance of his father
for 35 years. His own insight and brilliance in religious matters
combined with the excellent training and education given by his father
made him unique in his spiritual leadership. Imam Reza (MGB) was a
living example of the piety of the great Prophet Muhammad (MGB) and the
chivalry and generosity of Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB).

In this book we have presented several traditions regarding the
nobility of the pilgrimage to the Holy Shrine of Imam Reza (MGB) and two
authentic pilgrimage procedures and

prayers from Sheikh Sadooq's book Uyun Akhbar al-Reza, the first of
which was quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn al-Hassan - may God be
pleased with him. The second one was quoted on the authority of Imam
Reza (MGB). We have also included a third pilgrimage prayer called
Ziyarat-i-Jame'a Kabeere that is an authentic pilgrimage prayer recorded
by Sheikh Sadooq in his books Man La Yahzorohul Faqih and Uyoon Akhbar
al-Reza. Sheikh Toosi has also quoted it in his book Tahzibul Ahkam.
Concerning this pilgrimage prayer, Allamah Majlisi has said:
"Ziyarat-i-Jame'a is authentic from the aspect of the chain of
narrators. It is eloquent and has an expressive text that makes it the
best pilgrimage prayer."1 This pilgrimage prayer was taught by Imam Ali
Naqi (MGB) to his companion Musa ibn Imran an-Nakha'ee upon Musa's
personal request. We hope that the readers benefit from this book and
pray for our salvation.
