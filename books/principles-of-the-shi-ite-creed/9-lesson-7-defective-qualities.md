Lesson 7: Defective Qualities
=============================

Defective attributes are those whose presence in a person reveals his
deficiency and imperfection. And God is free from any quality that
presupposes shortcoming and need. To clarify this, we will examine some
of these.

a. God is not Material
----------------------

It is obvious that any material needs some space and if God were
material, it would take up some space and as we learned earlier, God is
needless because the needy and the dependent could not be Creator who
must be capable of meeting any need. Therefore, God is not material
because materials need space.

b. God is not Compounded
------------------------

God is not compounded because any compound needs its components. For
example, a compounded medicine or an alloyed metal which is made up of
certain parts needs those components and if one of the components were
missing, that medicine or metal would not be.

Similarly, if the nature of God were composed of a number of components,
it would be in need of its parts and as we earlier pointed out
dependence and necessity are not consistent with godhood which entails
absolute abundance and needlessness.

c. God could not be seen with eyes
----------------------------------

The quality of being seen is contingent upon certain conditions
including materiality and occupation of space. Unless these conditions
are met, the thing cannot be seen with eyes even with the help of
equipment. Having demonstrated the fact that God is not material and
neither does he occupy space, accordingly it is proven that it could not
be seen with eyes.

It could not be claimed that anything that could not be seen with eyes
does not exist. Just as there are certain things which are invisible but
nonetheless exist (like electric waves) and their existence could be
found out through their effects. Thus, every being should not be
necessarily seen and it could not be said that anything which is
invisible does not exist.

d. God does not need anything in any way
----------------------------------------

If God’s nature were needy and dependent, there would be no distinction
between Him and other creatures. That is, just as, every creature needs
another thing to fulfill his needs, if God were needy, this would be
true of Him as well, and He would need another god to fulfill His needs.
Therefore, it should be said that, basically necessity and need are not
compatible with “godhood”, because God is the one who meets all needs
and anything that is needy and dependant could not fulfill others’
needs. Concerning this, the Holy Qur’an says,

***“O man, you (and every creature) are in need of God and He is the
only one who is absolutely needless and abundant.”***[^1]
