Lesson Fifty Eight: Justice Among Children
==========================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِعْدِلُوا بَيْنَ أَوْلادِكُمْ كَما تُحِبُّونَ أَنْ يَعْدِلُوا
بَيْنَكُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Observe justice among your children just as you would like that they
render justice among you.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

One of the capital mistakes is discrimination in treatment of children.
Some people favour their older and so called senior child and others
favor their younger child. Sometimes they exceed the bounds and reserve
all of their kindness, property and affections for one of them, and
deprive the others totally.

This provokes the fire of malice and envy in the hearts of the ones left
out and in time this will develop into enmity among them and
vindictiveness towards their parents and they may even seek vengeance in
the society.
