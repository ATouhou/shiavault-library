81. أن
======

The most common subjunctive particle in Arabic is probably**أنْ** ,
which usually sits between two verbs referring to the same or a
different person, and thus, functioning something like the infinitive in
English. If you examine the sentence carefully, you will notice
that**أنْ**   introduces a subordinate clause which functions as an
object for the main verb.

<p dir="rtl">
**اُريدُ أنْ أذهَبَ إلی المصرفِ.**
</p>

I want to go to the bank.

**82.** It has been mentioned earlier that **ما**  can be used as a
question word and as a negation particle for the verb in past tense. In
addition, it can be used to be as a part of a nominalizer as in:

<p dir="rtl">
**قابلتـَهَ عندما سَکنَ في هذا البَيتِ.**
</p>

I met him when he lived in this house.
