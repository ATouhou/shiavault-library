**In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful**

The Noble Prophet (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family) has
said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ حَفِظَ عَـلـى أُمَّتِـي أَرْبَعِينَ حَدِيثًا يَـنْتَفِعُونَ بِهَا
بَعَـثَهُ اللهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَقِيهاً عَالِـماً.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“A person from my nation who memorizes forty traditions pertaining to
those issues of religion which one is in need of, will be resurrected by
Allah on the Day of Judgment as a person with deep insight into the
faith and as a scholar.”

In following the above *hadith*, the Islamic Education Board of The
World Federation of KSIMC (IEB ‑ WF) has decided to publish a series of
booklets of 40 *Ahadith* (traditions) on different subjects. The
*Ahadith* that have been selected from various sources are short and
simple and therefore easy to understand and memorize. It is envisaged
that the booklets will not only be useful for Zakireen, Madrasah
teachers and students, but will be of benefit to the Ummah at large.

The collection of the *Ahadith* and introduction of this present work
was done by Abdul-Rahim Mugahi in his compilation, *‘The Heart of
Hearts’*, while the translation in English was carried out by Shaykh
Saleem Bhimji.

IEB ‑ WF would like to thank Shaykh Saleem for his efforts in the
translation of this work. May Allah (Free from Imperfections and Exalted
is He) accept this work as a further attempt by IEB ‑ WF to propagate
Islam.
