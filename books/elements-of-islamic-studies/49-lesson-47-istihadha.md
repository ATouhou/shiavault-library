Lesson 47: Istihadha
====================

The blood which is not *haidh* or *nifas* is called *istihadha*.
*lstihadha* has been divided into 3 categories:

1. Istihadha qalila
-------------------

If the blood does not penetrate the cotton-pad used for protection, it
is called "*istihadha qalila*" (minor *istihadha*).  
 There is no *ghusl* for this category of *istihadha*; but she must do
*wudhu* for every prayer. She is not allowed to pray two prayers with
one *wudhu*.

2. Istihadha mutawassita
------------------------

If the blood penetrates the cotton-pad but does not exceed it, it is
called "*istihadha* *mutawassita*" (medium *istihadha*).  
 She should do one *wudhu* for every prayer and one *ghusl* daily. For
example, if she had seen this *istihadha* before Zuhr, she should do
*ghusl* before Zuhr and should pray Zuhr with that *ghusl* and one
*wudhu* as mentioned earlier. The 4 later prayers (up till the morning
prayer of the next day) should be prayed with one *wudhu* each.

3. Istihadha kathira
--------------------

If the blood exceeds the cotton-pad after soaking it, it is called
*istihadha* *kathira* (major *istihadha*). She should do separate
*wudhu* for each prayer, as mentioned earlier, and should do 3 *ghusl*s
daily: One for morning prayer, one for Zuhr and Asr and one for Maghrib
and Isha. She should pray Zuhr and Asr together and Maghrib and Isha
together.  
**Note:** In all cases it is emphasized that she should change the
cotton-pad before every *wudhu*.  
 2. If she is unable for any reason (described in lesson 48) to do
*ghusl* or *wudhu*, she should do *tayammum* in place of that *ghusl* or
*wudhu*.  
 3. If a woman observes the rules mentioned above, she should not think
herself as *najis*; she will be clean.
