Letter 36: To his brother 'Aqil ibn Abi Talib
=============================================

*To his brother 'Aqil ibn Abi Talib,* [^1] *in reply to his letter which
contained a reference to the army Amir al-mu'minin had sent to some
enemy.*

I had sent towards him a large army of Muslims. When he came to know of
it he fled away and retreated repenting. They met him on the way when
the sun was about to set. They grappled for a while like nothing. It was
about an hour and then he rescued himself half-dead as he had almost
been taken by the neck and only the last breath had remained in him. In
this way, he escaped in a panic.

فَسَرَّحْتُ إِلَيْهِ جَيْشاً كَثِيفاً مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ، فَلَمَّا
بَلَغَهُ ذلِكَ شَمَّرَ هَارباً، وَنَكَصَ نَادِماً، فَلَحِقُوهُ
بِبَعْضِ الطَّرِيقِ، وَقَدْ طَفَّلَتِ الشَّمْسُ لِلاْيَابِ،
فَاقْتَتَلُوا شَيْئاً كَلاَ وَلاَ، فَمَا كَانَ إِلاَّ كَمَوْقِفِ
سَاعَة حَتَّى نَجَا جَرِيضاً بَعْدَمَا أُخِذَ مِنْهُ بِالْـمُخَنَّقِ،
وَلَمْ يَبْقَ مِنْهُ غَيْرُ الرَّمَقِ، فَلَاْياً بِلَاْيٍ مَا نَجَا .

Leave the Quraysh in their rushing into misguidance, their galloping in
disunity and their leaping over destruction. They have joined together
to fight me as they had joined to fight the Messenger of Allah (S)
before me. I wish the Quraysh will get the reward of their treatment of
me. For they disregarded my kinship and deprived me of the power due to
me from the son of my mother (i.e. the Holy Prophet).

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَدَعْ عَنْكَ قُرَيشاً وَتَرْكَاضَهُمْ فِي الضَّلاَلِ، وَتَجْوَالَهُمْ
فِي الشِّقَاقِ، وَجِمَاحَهُمْ فِي التِّيهِ، فَإِنَّهُمْ قَدْ
أَجْمَعُوا عَلَى حَرْبِي كَإِجمَاعِهِمْ عَلَى حَرْبِ رَسوُلِ اللهِ
(صلى الله عليه وآله) قَبْلِي، فَجَزَتْ قُرَيْشاً عَنِّي الْجَوَازِي!
فَقَدْ قَطَعُوا رَحِمِي، وَسَلَبُونِي سُلْطَانَ ابْنِ أُمِّي.

As for your enquiry about my opinion on fighting, I am in favour of
fighting those who regard fighting as lawful until I die. The abundance
of men around me does not increase me in strength nor does their
dispersal from me cause any loneliness. Surely, do not consider the son
of your father as being weak or afraid, even though all people have
forsaken him, or bowing down submissively before injustice or handing
over his reins into the hand of the puller, or allowing his back to be
used by the rider to sit upon. But he is as the man of Banu Salim has
said:

If you enquire how I am, then listen that I am enduring and strong
against the vicissitudes of time.

I do not allow myself to be grieved lest the foe feels joyful and the
friend feels sorry.

[^1]: When after arbitration Mu'awiyah started a campaign of killing and
devastation, he sent a force of four thousand under ad-Dahhak ibn Qays
al-Fihri to attack Amir al-mu'minin's cities. When Amir al-mu'minin came
to know of his activities he roused the people of Kufah to put up a
defence, but they began to offer lame excuses. At last Hujr ibn 'Adi
al-Kindi rose with a.force of four thousand men and, chasing the enemy,
overtook him at Tadmur. The two parties had only a few grapplings when
darkness came in and ad-Dahhak fled away under its cover. This was the
time when 'Aqil ibn Abi Talib had come to Mecca for 'umrah. When he came
to know that after attacking al-Hirah, ad -Dahhak had escaped alive and
that the people of Kufah were afraid of war and all their activities had
come to a stop, he sent a letter to Amir al-mu'minin through 'Abd
ar-Rahman ibn 'Ubayd al-Azdi offering his help. In reply to that Amir
al-mu'minin wrote this Ietter wherein He complains of the behaviour of
the people of Kufah and mentions the flight of ad-Dahhak.
