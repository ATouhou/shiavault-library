5. Looking at Parents
=====================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ رَسُولُ اللٌّهِ (ص): مَا مِنْ وَلَدٍ بَارٍّ نَظَرَ إِلـى
أَبَوَيْهِ بِرَحْمَةٍ إِلاَّ كَانَ لَهُ بِكُلِّ نَظْرَةٍ حَجَّةٌ
مَبْرُورَةٌ. فَقَالُوا يَا رَسُولَ اللٌّهِ وَ إِنْ نَظَرَ فِي كُلِّ
يَوْمٍ مِائَةَ نَظْرَةٍ؟  قَالَ نَعَمْ. أَللٌّهُ أَكْبَرُ وَ أَطْيَبُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his family) said: “Every
righteous child who casts a look of mercy and affection upon his parents
shall be granted, for every look of his, rewards equivalent to that of
an accepted Hajj.”  Those around the Prophet questioned: “O’ Prophet of
Allah!  Even if he were to look at them a hundred times a day?”  The
Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his family) replied: “Indeed! 
Allah is the Greatest and Most Kind.”
