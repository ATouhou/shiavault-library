Donation & Pleasing The Believers
=================================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "When charity (alms) is delivered out of the
hand of its owner, it (the thing being given) says five things: 'At
first I was perishing and you gave me life; I was insignificant and you
made me great; I was an enemy and you turned me into a friend; you used
to protect me then but now I will protect you up to the Day of
Resurrection'."

Al-Ithna 'Ashariyyah, p.223

Imam Kazim, the seventh Imam, (‘a), said: "He who makes a Muslim
believer happy, then, he has initially pleased Allah, secondly the
Prophet and thirdly us (Ahlul Bayt)."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 74, p. 314

Imam Amir-ul-Mu'mineen (‘a) said: Allah, the Glorified, has fixed the
livelihood of the destitute in the wealth of the rich. Consequently,
whenever a destitute remains hungry it is because some rich persons have
denied him (his share)."

Nahjul Balagha, p. 533, saying No. 328

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "By Allah, he who withholds his wealth from
helping a needy believer will never taste the food of Heaven nor drink
from the drink sealed there."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 75, p. 314
