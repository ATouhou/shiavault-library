The Heart in Quran
==================

The phrase heart carries special importance and has been used
extensively in the Holy Qur’an and narrations. But what is meant with
this phrase is not the pine-shaped physical heart located in the left
side of the chest which supports the animal life system by continuously
pumping fresh blood into various parts of the body. Because, the Holy
Qur’an relates things to heart which are not comparable with this
pine-shaped heart. e.g.:

1. Reasoning and Comprehension
------------------------------

The Holy Qur’an said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ فَتَكُونَ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ يَعْقِلُونَ
بِهَا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Have they not traveled in the land and have they hearts wherewith to
feel and ears wherewith to hear.” (22:46)***

2. Un-comprehending and Reasoning
---------------------------------

The Holy Qur’an said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ لَّا يَفْقَهُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْيُنٌ لَّا
يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Having hearts wherewith they understand not, and having eyes
wherewith they see not.” (7:179)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَطُبِعَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لَا يَفْقَهُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And their hearts are sealed, so that they apprehend not.” (9:87)***

3. Faith
--------

The Holy Qur’an said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أُولَٰئِكَ كَتَبَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْإِيمَانَ وَأَيَّدَهُم بِرُوحٍ
مِّنْهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“These are they into whose hearts He has impressed faith and
strengthened them with a spirit from Him.” (58:22)***

4. Blasphemy and Disbelief
--------------------------

The Holy Qur’an said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَالَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْآخِرَةِ قُلُوبُهُم مُّنكِرَةٌ وَهُم
مُّسْتَكْبِرُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And as for those who believe not in the Hereafter there hearts
refuse to know, for they are proud.” (16:22)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ طَبَعَ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَسَمْعِهِمْ
وَأَبْصَارِهِمْ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْغَافِلُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Such are they whose hearts and ears and eyes God hath sealed. And
such are the heedless.”*** ***(16:108)***

5. Dissension
-------------

God-Almighty said in the Holy Qur’an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَحْذَرُ الْمُنَافِقُونَ أَن تُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْهِمْ سُورَةٌ تُنَبِّئُهُم
بِمَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“The Hypocrites fear lest a surah should be revealed concerning them,
proclaiming what is in their hearts.”*** ***(9: 64)***

6. To Receive Guidance
----------------------

God-Almighty said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَن يُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ يَهْدِ قَلْبَهُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ
عَلِيمٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And whosoever believeth in God, He guideth his heart. And God is
knower of all things.”*** ***(64:11)***

And God said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
شهيدوَهُوَ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَذِكْرَىٰ لِمَن كَانَ لَهُ قَلْبٌ أَوْ
أَلْقَى السَّمْعَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Most surely there is a reminder in this for him who has a heart or
he gives ear and is a witness.”*** ***(50: 37)***

7. Negligence
-------------

God-Almighty said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلَا تُطِعْ مَنْ أَغْفَلْنَا قَلْبَهُ عَن ذِكْرِنَا وَاتَّبَعَ
هَوَاهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And obey not him whose heart we have made heedless of Our
Remembrance, who followeth his own lust.”*** ***(18:28)***

8. Certainty and Tranquility
----------------------------

God-Almighty has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَلَا بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Verily in the remembrance of God do hearts find rest.” (13:28)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
هُوَ الَّذِي أَنزَلَ السَّكِينَةَ فِي قُلُوبِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ
لِيَزْدَادُوا إِيمَانًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“He it is who sent down peace of reassurance into the hearts of the
believers that they might add faith unto their faith.”*** ***(48:4)***

9. Anxiety and Conflict
-----------------------

God-Almighty has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّمَا يَسْتَأْذِنُكَ الَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ
وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَارْتَابَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ فَهُمْ فِي رَيْبِهِمْ
يَتَرَدَّدُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“They alone ask leave of thee who believe not in God and the Last
Day, and whose hearts feel doubt, so in their doubt they waver.”
(9:45)***

10. Blessing and Kindness
-------------------------

God-Almighty has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَجَعَلْنَا فِي قُلُوبِ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُ رَأْفَةً وَرَحْمَةً
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And places compassion and mercy in the hearts of those who followed
him.” (57:27)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 هُوَ الَّذِي أَيَّدَكَ بِنَصْرِهِ وَبِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ
قُلُوبِهِمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“He it is who supporteth thee with His Help and with the believers.
And (as for the believers) hath attuned their hearts.”*** ***(8:
62-63)***

11. Hot-temper and Cruelty
--------------------------

God-Almighty said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلَوْ كُنتَ فَظًّا غَلِيظَ الْقَلْبِ لَانفَضُّوا مِنْ حَوْلِكَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“If thou hadst been stern and fierce of heart they would have
dispersed from round about thee.”*** ***(3:159)***

Therefore, heart in the Holy Qur’an has been assigned the most important
privileged position, and various psychic tasks have been related to it,
namely: faith, blasphemy, hypocrisy, reasoning, understanding, not
understanding, acceptance of truth, unacceptance of truth, guidance,
deviation, sin, intention, purification, corruption, benevolence,
aggravation, love, invocation, negligence, fear, anger, doubt, conflict,
mercy, cruelty, regret, assurance, arrogance, jealousy, rebellion,
offense, and other similar acts.

Since the pine shaped piece of flesh called heart could not be the
origin of these effects, instead these effects are the consequences of
human self and spirit. Therefore, it could be said: What is meant with
heart is the same “Celestial Jewel” which controls the degree of
human-ness within a human being :

The heart possesses such exalted position in the Holy Qur’an that it is
mentioned when the topic of revelation i.e. communication between God
and men is discussed. God-Almighty said to Holy Prophet (S):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الْأَمِينُ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ لِتَكُونَ مِنَ
الْمُنذِرِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Which is the true spirit hath brought down, upon the heart, that
thou mayest be (one) of the warners.” (26:193-194)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْ مَن كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِّجِبْرِيلَ فَإِنَّهُ نَزَّلَهُ عَلَىٰ
قَلْبِكَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Say (O Muhammad, to mankind) who is enemy to Gabriel! For he it is
who hath revealed (this scripture) to thy heart by God's leave.”
(2:97)***

The heart's position is so eminent that it sees the revealing angel and
hears his voice. God-Almighty has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَأَوْحَىٰ إِلَىٰ عَبْدِهِ مَا أَوْحَىٰ مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا
رَأَىٰ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And He revealed unto His slave (Prophet Muhammad) that which he
revealed. The Heart lied not (in seeing the angel) what it saw.”
(53:10-11)***

Soundness and Sickness of Heart
-------------------------------

Our living depends upon spirit and heart because, they are the ones who
manage the bodies. All the parts of the body obey their command and all
deeds and action initiate from the heart. Therefore, the salvation and
cruelty of a person depends upon his hearts condition. It has been
inferred from the Holy Qur’an and narrations that like the human bodies
which are healthy and sick at different times, his heart's condition may
also follow the same cycle (i.e. some times it is healthy while at other
times it is sick).

God-Almighty in Holy Qur’an said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَوْمَ لَا يَنفَعُ مَالٌ وَلَا بَنُونَ إِلَّا مَنْ أَتَى اللَّهَ
بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“The day when wealth and sons avail not (any man). Save him who
bringeth unto God a whole heart“*** ***(26: 88-89)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَذِكْرَىٰ لِمَن كَانَ لَهُ قَلْبٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Lo! therein verily is a reminder for him who hath a heart”
(50:37)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَأُزْلِفَتِ الْجَنَّةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ غَيْرَ بَعِيدٍ هَٰذَا مَا
تُوعَدُونَ لِكُلِّ أَوَّابٍ حَفِيظٍ مَّنْ خَشِيَ الرَّحْمَٰنَ
بِالْغَيْبِ وَجَاءَ بِقَلْبٍ مُّنِيبٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And the Garden is brought nign for those who kept from evil, no
longer distant. (And it is said): that is that which ye were promised,
(it is) for every pertinent and heedful one, who feareth the Beneficent
in secret and cometh with a contrite heart.” (50: 31-33)***

Therefore, the above verses make it explicit that health of a person is
related to his heart's condition and his eternal salvation depends upon
his return to God-Almighty with a pure and humble heart. On the other
side the Holy Qur’an introduces some examples of hearts which are sick
as follows:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّهُ مَرَضًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“In their hearts is a disease, and God increaseth their disease.
(2:10)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْسًا إِلَىٰ
رِجْسِهِمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“But as for those in whose hearts is disease, it only addeth
wickedness to their wickedness. (9:125)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَإِذْ يَقُولُ الْمُنَافِقُونَ وَالَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ مَّا
وَعَدَنَا اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ إِلَّا غُرُورًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And when the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease were
saying: God and His Messenger promised us naught but delusion.
(33:12)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَتَرَى الَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ يُسَارِعُونَ فِيهِمْ
يَقُولُونَ نَخْشَىٰ أَن تُصِيبَنَا دَائِرَةٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And thou seest those in whose heart is a disease race towards them,
saying: We fear lest a change offortune befall us. (5: 52)***

In these verses the blasphemy, hypocrisy, and friendship with the pagans
have been introduced as heart's sicknesses. Similar verses and hundreds
of authentic traditions narrated by Holy Prophet (S) and infallible
Imams (a.s.) of his Holy Progeny had stated that human heart and soul
are susceptible to sickness like human bodies.

God-Almighty the Creator of heart and soul, the Holy Prophet (S), and
Infallible Imams (a.s.) who are the specialists of human beings and
their hearts had informed us about the sickness of some of the hearts.
Why should we ignore this reality?

The real human specialists after identifying the symptoms namely:
blasphemy, dissension, unacceptance of truth, arrogance, revenge, anger,
criticizing, slander, treason, self-conceit, fear, malevolence,
defamation, ill-speaking, back-biting, harshness, oppression, felony,
misery, avarice, fault-finding, lying, ambitiousness, hypocrisy, deceit,
suspicion, cruelty, self-weakness and many other indecent
characteristics, have introduced them as the sickness of heart and soul.

Therefore, those who leave this world with such contaminated hearts will
not be returning to God with a pure and sound heart to be worthy of the
verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَوْمَ لَا يَنفَعُ مَالٌ وَلَا بَنُونَ إِلَّا مَنْ أَتَى اللَّهَ
بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“The day when wealth and sons avail not (any man). Save him who
bringeth unto God a whole heart.”*** ***(26: 88-89)***

The sicknesses of heart and self could not be considered as small or
insignificant rather they are much more dangerous and incurable as
compared to bodily diseases. In case of bodily diseases the physical
order of the body looses its equilibrium thus, causing pain, discomfort,
and inflicting damage upon a specific part of the body.

But this is rather limited and in any case these effects cannot go on
beyond the physical life span of the inflicted person. However, the
sickness of heart and self are accompanied with continuous anguish,
torture, and eternal punishment; the pain and punishment which penetrate
until the very depths of heart engulfing the soul with eternal flames.

The heart which remained completely ignorant of God’s existence without
witnessing His signs by spending a life of disbelief, deviation, and
sins in reality is blind and dark, which will be raised on the Day of
Judgment with similar condition, and will have no other choice except to
be condemned into Hell to live a painful eternal life full of anguish
and torture. God-Almighty in Holy Qur’an said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكًا وَنَحْشُرُهُ
يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَعْمَىٰ قَالَ رَبِّ لِمَ حَشَرْتَنِي أَعْمَىٰ
وَقَدْ كُنتُ بَصِيرًا قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ أَتَتْكَ آيَاتُنَا فَنَسِيتَهَا
ۖ وَكَذَٰلِكَ الْيَوْمَ تُنسَىٰ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“But he who turneth away from remembrance” of Me, his will be a
narrow life, and I shall bring him blind to the assembly on the Day of
Resurrection. He will say: 'My Lord! wherefore hast thou gathered me
(hither) blind, when I was wont to see?' He will say: 'so (it must be)
our revelations come unto thee but thou didst forget them. In like
manner thou art forgotten this Day. (20:124-126)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَإِنَّهَا لَا تَعْمَى الْأَبْصَارُ وَلَٰكِن تَعْمَى أَفَلَمْ
يَسِيرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ فَتَكُونَ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ يَعْقِلُونَ بِهَا
أَوْ آذَانٌ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الْقُلُوبُ الَّتِي فِي الصُّدُورِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Have they not traveled in the land, and have they hearts where with
to feel and ears wherewith to hear ? For indeed it is not the eyes that
grow blind, but it is the hearts, which are within the bosoms, that grow
blind. (22:46)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَن كَانَ فِي هَٰذِهِ أَعْمَىٰ فَهُوَ فِي الْآخِرَةِ أَعْمَىٰ
وَأَضَلُّ سَبِيلًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Whoso is blind in here will be blind in the Hereafter, and yet
further from the road.”(17:22)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَن يَهْدِ اللَّهُ فَهُوَ الْمُهْتَدِ ۖ وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ
لَهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءَ مِن دُونِهِ ۖ وَنَحْشُرُهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ
عَلَىٰ وُجُوهِهِمْ عُمْيًا وَبُكْمًا وَصُمًّا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And he whom God guideth, he is led aright, while, as for him whom He
sendeth astray, for them thou wilt find no protecting friends beside
Him, and We shall assemble them on the Day of Resurrection on their
faces, blind, dumb, and deaf “ (17:97)***

May be you will find the above, something strange and may ask: How the
esoteric eyes will become blind on the Day of Judgment? Do we have eyes
and ears other than these apparent bodily eyes and ears? The reply is:
Yes! The Creator of human beings and Divine human doctors had informed
that human heart and also soul, have their own eyes, ears, and tongue
but of their own kind.

Human self is a mysterious existence possessing a special life in his
inner essence. Self has his own world in which there is light as well as
darkness, there is purity and cleanliness as well as indignation and
contamination, and there is seeing and hearing as well as blindness and
deafness.

But the light and darkness of that special world is not similar to the
light and darkness of this world, rather the belief in God-Almighty, Day
of Judgment, Prophethood, and the Holy Qur’an is the illumination for
self's world.

God-Almighty has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِهِ وَعَزَّرُوهُ وَنَصَرُوهُ وَاتَّبَعُوا
النُّورَالَّذِي أُنزِلَ مَعَهُ ۙ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Then those who believe in him (Muhammad) honor him, help him, and
follow the light which is sent down with him: They are the successful.
(7:157)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَدْ جَاءَكُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ نُورٌ وَكِتَابٌ مُّبِينٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Now hath come unto you light from God and a plain scripture.
(5:15)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَفَمَن شَرَحَ اللَّهُ صَدْرَهُ لِلْإِسْلَامِ فَهُوَ عَلَىٰ نُورٍ مِّن
رَّبِّهِ ۚ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلْقَاسِيَةِ قُلُوبُهُم مِّن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ
أُولَٰئِكَ فِي ضَلَالٍ مُّبِينٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Is he whose bosom God hath expanded for the surrender (unto Him), so
that he followeth a light from His Lord (as he who disbelieveth) ? Then
woe unto those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of God.
Such are in plain error. (39: 22)***

God-Almighty has informed that Islam, Qur’an, faith, and Divine
obligations are all illumination and their obedience makes the heart
enlightened; although, in reality this happens in this same world but
its final result is declared in the Next World. Also, He had informed us
that blasphemy, hypocrisy, sinning, non-acceptance of truth all are
darkness and make the heart dark and contaminated, which would certainly
become manifested in the Next World.

The Divine Prophets were dispatched by God-Almighty with the mission of
leading human beings out of darkness of blasphemy towards the
environment of illumination and belief.

God-Almighty has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ
إِلَى النُّورِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“We have revealed unto thee (Muhammad) that thereby thou mayst bring
forth mankind from darkness unto light. (14:1)***

The believers, by means of illumination of faith, self-purification,
good moral conducts, God's-Remembrance, and righteous deeds make their
heart and souls illuminated; witness the sublime realities through their
esoteric eyes and ears; and ascend toward God's Nearness through various
stages of perfection.

Such souls when leaving this world will turn into absolute illumination,
joy, cheerfulness, beauty, and in the Next World will be utilizing the
same illumination accumulated by them in this material world.
God-Almighty has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَوْمَ تَرَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ يَسْعَىٰ نُورُهُم بَيْنَ
أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَانِهِم بُشْرَاكُمُ الْيَوْمَ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي
مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ
الْعَظِيمُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“On the day when thou (Muhammad) wilt see the believers, men and
women, their light shining forth before them and on their right hands
(and will hear it said unto them): Glad news for you this day: Gardens
underneath which rivers flow, wherein ye are immortal. That is the
supreme triumph. (57:12)***

Yes! The illumination for the eternal world must be arranged in this
world, and it is because of this reason that the pagans and hypocrites
do not have illumination in the Next World. God-Almighty has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَوْمَ يَقُولُ الْمُنَافِقُونَ وَالْمُنَافِقَاتُ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا
انظُرُونَا نَقْتَبِسْ مِن نُّورِكُمْ قِيلَ ارْجِعُوا وَرَاءَكُمْ
فَالْتَمِسُوا نُورًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“On the Day when the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women will
say unto those who believe, look on us that we may borrow from your
light! It will be said: Go back and seek for light! (57:13)***

Heart in Traditions
-------------------

The pioneers of religion and real human specialists have left many
interesting narrations about the heart. Following are some of the
examples: In some of the narrations the hearts have been classified into
three categories:

Imam al-Baqir (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عن ابي جعفر عليه السلام قال: القلوب ثلاثة: قلب منكوس لايعثرعلى شيء من
الخير وهو قلب الكافر وقلب فيه نكتة سودا فالخير والشر يعتلجان, فما كان
منه أقوى غلب عليه, وقلب مفتوح فيه مصباح يزهر فلا يطفا نوره الى القيامة
وهو قلب المؤمن.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“There are three kinds of hearts:*

*a: First type: Reversed heart which lacks feelings for any sort of
righteous deeds. Such heart is the heart of a unbeliever.*

*b. Second Type: The heart which contains a black spot in which a war is
being waged between the truth and falsehood, and whichever becomes
victorious will take over the heart's control.*

*c. Third type: The conquered heart in which there is a lighted lamp
which is never going to be turned off. Such a heart is the heart of a
believer.”*[^1]

Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.) has quoted from his learned father:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عن ابي عبدالله عليه السلام قال: كان ابي يقول: ما من سيء افسد للقلب من
الخطيئة, ان القلب ليواقع الخطيئة فما تزال حتى تغلب عليه فيصير اسفله
اعلاه واعلاه أسفله.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“There is nothing worst than sinning for the heart. When the heart is
encountered with sin, it struggles against the sin until sin becomes
victorious thus, making the heart as a reversed heart.”*[^2]

Imam al-Sajjad (a.s.) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عن علي بن الحسين عليه السلام في حديث طويل يقول فيه: الاان للعبد اربع
اعين: عينان يبصر بهما امر دينه ودنياه, وعينان يبصر بهما امر آخرته.
فاذا أراد الله بعيد خيرا فتح له العينين اللتين في قلبه فابصر بهما
الغيب وامر آخرته واذا اراد به غيرذالك ترك القلب بما فيه.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“A man possesses four eyes, with two apparent eyes he sees the affairs
relevant to his world, and with two esoteric eyes sees the affairs
related to the Next World. Therefore, whenever God-Almighty desired the
good for a believer, He opens his heart's eyes to enable him to witness
the hidden world and its mysteries. But when He does not desire his
welfare, leaves the heart with his esoteric eyes closed.”*[^3]

Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عن ابي عبدالله عليه السلام قال: ان للقلب اذنين، روح الايمان يساره
بالخير والشيطان يساره بالشر فايهما ظهر على صاحبه غلبه.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The heart possesses two ears, the spirit of belief slowly invites him
towards righteous deeds, while the Satan slowly invites him towards evil
deeds. Therefore, whoever becomes victorious in this struggle takes over
heart's control.”*[^4]

Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.) quotes from the Holy Prophet (S)

*“The darkness of the heart is the worst kind of darkness.”*[^5]

Imam al-Baqir (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عن ابي جعفر عليه السلام قال: ما من عبد الاوفى قلبه نكتة بيضا فإذا أذنب
ذنبا خرج في النكتة نكتة سودا. فان تاب ذهب ذالك السواد، وان تمادى في

*“Initially there is a white spot and light within the heart of a human
being and as a result of his committing sin, a block spot appears. If
the person repents the black spot gets wiped out, but if he persisted in
sinning, the blackness gradually increases ultimately covering the
entire white spot, When this happens the owner of such heart will never
return towards goodness and become manifestation of the Qur’anic verse:*

***‘Nay, but that which they have earned is rust upon their
hearts.’**”*[^6]

The Commander of the Faithful Imam‘Ali (a.s.) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال على عليه السلام: ومن قل ورعه مات قلبه ومن مات قلبه دخل النار.

</blockquote>

*“Every one who lacks self restraint and piety will have a dead heart;
whoever have a dead heart will enter inside the Hell.”*[^7]

He further emphasized this matter in his last will addressing to his
son:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فيما اوصى به امير المؤمنين عليه السلام ابنه, قال: يا بني ان البلا
القاقة واشد من ذالك مرض البدن واشد من ذلك مرض القلب. وان من النعم سعة

  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Oh my son! The poverty is one of the most horrible calamity,. But
still severe than poverty is the bodily sickness; and the sickness of
soul is harsher than the bodily sickness. Plenty of wealth is one of the
God's blessing, but sound health is better than that, and the piety of
heart is even superior than sound health.”*[^8]

There is a narration quoted from Anas bin Malik from the Holy Prophet
(S) who said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
انس من مالك قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: ناجى داود ربه فقال
الهي لكل ملك خزانة فاين خزانتك؟ قال جل جلاله: لى خزينة اعظم من العرش
واوسع من الكرسى واطيب من الجنة وازين من الملكوت. ارضها المعرفة واسمأها
اليمان وشمسها الشوق وقمرها المح بة ونجومها الخواطروصاحبها العقل ومطرها
الرحمة واثمرها الطاعة وثمرها الحكمة. ولها اربعة ابواب: العلم والحلب
والصبر والرضا. والاوهى القلب.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The prophet David (a.s.) asked God; ‘Oh God! All the emperors possess
treasure then where is Your treasure ? God-Almighty replied: ‘I possess
a treasure which is greater than the sky; vaster than the Heaven's
firmaments; smells better than the perfumes of Paradise, and is
beautiful than the Celestial Kingdom.*

*Its earth is enlightenment; its sky is belief, its sun is enthusiasm;
its moon is love,. its stars are inspiration and attention towards Me;
its clouds are reason, its rain is blessing, its fruits are obedience;
and its yield is wisdom. My Treasure has four doors, the first one is
the door of knowledge, the second one is the door of reason, the third
one is the door of patience, and the fourth one is the door of
contentment. Know that My Treasure is -the heart of a believer'.”*[^9]

The Divine Heart Specialists have described many interesting topics in
these traditions. They have divided the hearts into following three
categories:

### 1) The Heart of an Unbeliever

These Divine Specialists have described that the heart of an infidel is
a reversed or over-turned heart which does not contain any goodness in
it. Such heart' is deviated from its primordial nature; does not look
towards the Upper-Heavens and keeps itself amused and preoccupied into
worldly affairs, therefore, it does not witness the existence of
God-Almighty and I. Eternal-World.

It lacks the proper imagination for goodness and righteous deeds,
because, the righteous deeds reach the perfection stage and
Gods-Nearness only in cases when they are performed with the intention
of attaining His pleasure. But since an infidel has reversed his heart,
he does not see God-Almighty any more, and therefore, does not have any
other aim except this world in all his affairs.

Such an heart in his primordial nature was blessed with esoteric eyes
which now have been blinded because, he cannot witness the most explicit
shinning realities i.e. the Creator of the Universe. He is blind and
will be raised as blind in the Next World too.

In this world he is attached to worldly affairs, and will be raised in
the Next World possessed with the same attachment, but since the
Eternal-World lacks these worldly amusements, he will burn with the fire
of separation. In such heart the light of faith has been extinguished
and therefore, it is totally filled with absolute darkness.

### 2) The Heart of a Believer

Just opposite to the heart of an unbeliever is the heart of a perfect
righteous believers; whose doors are open towards the Upper-Heaven and
Unseen-World; is illuminated with the light of faith which will never be
turned off; and through its two esoteric eyes witnesses the mysteries of
the Hidden-World. Such a heart continuously strives for achieving
absolute t perfection, beauty and salvation and seeks God's Pleasure and
Blessing.

Since he wants God-Almighty therefore, continuously strives to move in
His Direction by means of good moral conduct and righteous deeds. Such
heart is wider than the Celestial Sky and Divine Thrown, beautiful than
the Paradise, is the Divine Treasure and center of manifestation of
Heavenly Light; his earth is enlightenment, his sky is faith; his sun is
enthusiasm for God's countenance; his moon is God's love; where the
wisdom rules and absorbs the rain of Divine Blessings for producing the
fruits of worship and obedience; is filled with absolute light, joy,
cheerfulness, purity, and will be raised in the next world in the
similar state.

### 3) The Heart of a Believer- Occasionally Contaminated

The heart of a believer which occasionally gets contaminated with sin is
not dark and confined rather is illuminated with the light of faith and
remained open for receiving guidance and Divine Blessings. But as a
result of sinning it has developed a black spot and Satan has succeeded
to make an entry into it.

Although, the esoteric eyes are not quite yet blinded but because of
sinning have caught a disease which might render them blind. Both angels
as well as Satan have access within such heart. The angels enter through
the doors of faith and invite him towards goodness while the Satan
influences through the black spot inviting him towards evil.

In such a heart both Satan and angel are engaged in a continuous
confrontation. Angle wants to take over the control of entire heart
forcing Satan out through good deeds on the other side Satan through
seduction and sins makes the darker heart further darkest and strives to
take over the control of entire heart by forcing out the angel and
permanently closing the gateway of belief forever.

These two are permanently engaged in a continuous war until one of them
become victorious over his opponent, and what is the magnitude of
victory achieved. The esoteric life and eternal destination of human
being depends upon this struggle. It is here that the struggle with the
self becomes of crucial importance, which will be discussed later on in
the book.

Hard-heartedness
----------------

In his initial primordial nature the heart is bestowed upon with special
virtues such as purity, enlightenment, kindness, and blessing. He is
sensitive towards other people's difficulties and feels un-comfortable
while seeing others in pain even animals. He desires that others should
live a pleasant and comfortable life and takes pleasure in doing favors
towards them.

In accordance with his pure nature is inclined and pays attention
towards God-Almighty; takes pleasure in performing worship, prayer,
supplication, and other righteous deeds, while immediately feels ashamed
and offer repentance if commits sins.

In case the heart accepted invitation of his pure primordial nature and
acted accordingly, he becomes purest, kindest, sincerest, and
enlightened, because of the effects of worship and prayers his
enthusiasm and love for these things increases day by day. But if he
neglects and acts against his inner natural feelings and sentiments,
they gradually get subdued and eventually become completely silenced and
eventually annihilated.

If after seeing the horrible tragic scenes involving others does not
show any reaction, gradually becomes used to such things to the extent
that further repetition of such encounters will produce least reaction.

Also, it is possible that one may reach to a point where seeing the
poverty, hunger, and wretchedness involving others not only produce any
disturbance with in his conscience on the contrary while seeing the
painful scenes of imprisonment, torture, and murders feels happy and
pleased. [^10]

If someone commits a sin for the first time, he feels guilty and ashamed
about it, but having committed a sin for the first time, to repeat it
for the second and third time relatively becomes easier for him, and in
case of his persistence in sinning reaches to a point, where not only he
does not feel any sense of guilt and shame, on the contrary considers
himself victorious and feels happy.

The heart of such persons has become dark and reversed and in the words
of the Holy Qur’an and narrations has acquired hard-heartedness. Satan
has occupied these hearts forcing the God's Angels out, and the doors of
salvation have been closed permanently leaving no hope for repentance
and return towards God-Almighty.

God-Almighty said in the Holy Qur’an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَلَوْلَا إِذْ جَاءَهُم بَأْسُنَا تَضَرَّعُوا وَلَٰكِن قَسَتْ
قُلُوبُهُمْ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“If only, when our disaster came on them, they had been humble! But
their hearts were hardened and the devil made all that they used to do
seem fair unto them! (6:43)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أُولَٰئِكَ فِي ضَلَالٍ مُّبِينٍ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلْقَاسِيَةِ قُلُوبُهُم
مِّن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Then woe unto those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of
God. Such are in plain error. (39:22)***

Imam aI-Baqir (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عن ابي جعفرعليه السلام قال: ما من عبد مؤمن الاوفى قلبه نكتة بيضا فان
اذنب وثنى خرج من تلك النكتة سواد فان تمادى في الذنوب اتسع ذالك السواد
حتى يغطى البيضا فاذا غطى البيضا لم يرجع صاحبه الى خيرا بدا وهو قول
الله كلا بل ران على قلوبهم ما كانوا يكسبون.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“There is a white spot inside the heart of each believer. Once he
commits a sin or repeats it, a black spot appears inside the heart. In
case of persistence of sins, the black spot, increases, gradually in
size filling the entire heart with blackness. When this happens the
owner of such heart never returns towards goodness, and this, is what
God meant in the verse:*

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كلا بل ران على قلوبهم ما كانوا يكسبون.
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Nay, but that which they have earned is rust upon their
hearts.”***[^11]

The Commander of the Faithful Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال اميرالمؤمنين عليه السلام: ما جفت الدموع الالقسوة القلوب وما قست
القلوب الا لكثرة الذنوب.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The tears of eye never get dried but for the sake of hardheartedness,.
the heart never acquires hard-heartedness but for the sake of excess of
sins.”*[^12]

The Holy Prophet (S) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: من علامات الشفا: جمود العين وقسوة
القلب وشدة الحرص في طلب الرزق الاصرار على الذنب.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The following four things are the indicators of human cruelty:*

*1) Dryness of eyes (ii) Hard-heartedness (iii) Excessive greed for
earning a living (iv)And persistence of sins.”*[^13]

It was because of this reason that the Infallible Imams (a.s.) of
prophet's progeny in their supplications took shelter in God-Almighty
against hard-heartedness.

Imam al-Sajjad (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال علي بن الحسين (ع) في دعائه: الهى اليك أشكو قلبا قاسيا، مع الوسواس
متقلبا وبالرين الطبع متلبسا وعينا عن البكا من خوفك جامدة وإلى ما تسرها
طامحه.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Oh God! I do complain to you against hard-heartedness –the heart which
by means of whims and passions is in the state of continuous revolution
and has become contaminated. And I do complain to you against the
dryness of eye which does not cry and is not afraid of you, and instead
takes pleasure in looking towards whatever makes it pleased.”*[^14]

Therefore, a human being who desires his own prosperity and soundness of
heart must prevent himself from committing any sin however small it
might seems; should gradually motivate his self for performing righteous
deeds namely: worship, prayer, communications with God, sincerity,
kindness and help towards others, defense of oppressed and deprived,
benevolence, and cooperation for achieving social welfare and social
justice, so that it performs them as a matter of habit.

His inner purity and illumination continues striving for perfection and
purification fill his heart becomes a special center of God's favorite
angels.

Heart's Physicians
------------------

It has already been explained earlier that like human bodies, hearts
could also be healthy and sick, and the eternal prosperity or salvation
of a person depends upon his returning to the Next World with a pure and
sound heart. It is therefore, important for us to be knowledgeable about
the health and sickness of the heart; must identify the symptoms of the
disease; and should understand the causes and factors in order to
implement all the health care hygienic measures to prevent its spread.

Do we possess self-sufficiency in this matter or do we need the
prophets? There is absolutely no doubt that we lack sufficient knowledge
about the special creation of human-self and the secrets and mysteries
which have been incorporated by the Creator in this Celestial existence.

In fact we are ignorant about our psychological and esoteric life; do
not well recognize the factors and causes responsible for the self's
sickness; cannot properly diagnose the symptoms of the disease; and are
not well aware about various kinds of diseases, preventive measures
required against their spread, and the available methods of their
treatment. Therefore, the presence of Divine Prophets is really required
in order to provide guidance and lead us in solving the above mentioned
problems.

The prophets are the real physicians and specialists of the souls, who
through Divine Blessing and revelations understand very well about the
pain as well as the treatment of self. They have been educated and
trained in various disciplines dealing with human beings and their souls
in the school of revelation, and are thoroughly knowledgeable about the
secret and mysteries of this special celestial existence.

They understand the straight path of guidance and ascend towards
God-Almighty as well as the causes and factors of deviations, and
therefore, are in a position to help lead the human beings in following
the straight path and can prevent their deviations.

Yes! the prophets are God's physicians who have rendered most valuable
services for humanity throughout the history, which are relatively more
valuable than the services rendered by physicians of the human bodies.
The prophets were able to discover the mysterious abstract (i.e.
Celestial Spirit) for themselves, and by introducing this “Celestial
Jewel” to human beings succeeded in reviving their human personality.

They were the ones who introduced and enlightened human beings with
learning, spirituality, and moral ethics by showing them the path of
journey leading towards God's Nearness.

They are the ones who made the humanity familiar with the unseen world
and strived for self-purification, self-nourishment and self-refinement
of human beings. If there are marks of meaningness, sentiments, love,
moral ethics, and other virtues found among human beings it is all due
to the blessing of painstaking continuous efforts and endeavors of all
God's physicians and specially the Last Divine Messenger Prophet
Muhammad (S).

If the Divine Prophets would not have been dispatched for
human-guidance, certainly the conditions of human beings would have been
something different. Yes! The prophets are real distinguished
personalities of the humanity, and because of this distinction have been
called as physicians of self in the traditions.

The Commander of the Faithful Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said about the Holy
Prophet (S).

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
طبيب دوار بطبه قد احكم مرهمه واحمى مواسمه يضع من ذالك حيث الحاجة اليه,
من قلوب عمى وآذان صم والسنة بكم. متبع بد وائه مواضع الغفلة ومواطن
الحيرة لم يستضيئوا باضوا الحكمة ولم يقدحوا بزناد العلوم الثاقبة, فهم
فى ذالك كالانعام السائمة الصخورالقاسية.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Muhammad (S) was a traveling physician who continuously endeavored for
the treatment of souls. He had prepared ready-made ointments and
arranged other tools of surgery for the treatment of* *wounds and
disinfecting the diseases at suitable occasions. He cured the heart's
blindness, ear's deafness, tongue's dumbness, and prescribed medicine
for all those who were living in the state of confusion and wandering
because, they did not utilized the light of wisdom for abstraction of
realities and thus, were forced to live like grazing animals.”*[^15]

The Holy Qur’an has been described as a health-giving medicine for the
diseased hearts.

God-Almighty has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَدْ جَاءَتْكُم مَّوْعِظَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَشِفَاءٌ لِّمَا فِي
الصُّدُورِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“There hath come unto you an exhortation from your Lord. A balm for
that which is in the breasts. (10:57)***

And said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْآنِ مَا هُوَ شِفَاءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ
لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And We reveal of the Qur’an that which is a healing and a mercy for
believers. (17:82)***

The Commander of the Faithful Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said about the Holy
Qur’an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال على عليه السلام: وتعلموا القرآن فانه أحسن الحديث وتفقهوا فيه فانه
ربيع القلوب واستشفوا بنوره فانه شفا الصدور.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Learn the Holy Qur’an because, it is the best of learning; pay
attentions towards its verses because they are like the springs rain;
its recital revives the heart; and utilize the Qur’anic illumination for
the healing of your hearts.”*[^16]

At some other place he said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال على عليه السلام: واعلموا انه ليس على احد بعد القرآن من فاقة ولا
لاحد قبل القرآن من غنى فاستشفوه من ادوائكم واستعينوا به على لاوايكم
فان فيه شفا من اكبر الدا وهو الكفر والغى والضلال.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Know that anyone who possesses the Holy Qur’an would not require any
thing else, and whoever is deprived of it will never be free from want.
By means of the Holy Qur’an heal the sickness of your hearts and
strengthen yourself through it while confronting hardships. Because, it
contains the cure for the most severe diseases namely: blasphemy,
hypocrisy , and deviations.”*[^17]

Yes! the Prophet of Islam is the best physician of the souls. He
recognized well our pain and its treatment; brought the Holy Qur’an and
presented it to us which the best program of healing for our internal
pains. Apart from that various kind of psychic disease and their
treatments have been explained for us through the Holy Prophet (S) and
Infallible Imams (a.s.) of his Holy progeny Ahlul Bayt which have been
preserved for us in the form of traditions.

Therefore, if we are interested in the happiness and soundness of our
self, we must practice the hygienic measures for the psychic and
physical health of our self. We must identify these diseases within our
souls through Qur’anic verses and guidelines issued by the Holy Prophet
(S) and Infallible Imams (a.s.) and must seriously strive for their
treatments. Any negligence shown in this important and crucial task
would result in serious damage inflicted upon ourselves, which will
become manifested in the Next World.

Refinement and Perfection of Self
---------------------------------

It was already discussed that the self-building and self-nourishment are
the most important crucial tasks, because, the happiness and prosperity
of both worlds depends upon them. All of the God's Prophets were
dispatched for accomplishment of this aim. Self-building must be
undertaken into two stages:

The first stage of self-refinement consists of cleansing of heart from
indecent moral conduct and avoiding sins. This act is called refining
and evacuation.

The second stage of self-nourishment and perfection consists of
acquiring higher learning for abstraction of absolute truth, attaining
moral excellence in conduct, and undertaking of righteous deeds. This
act is called nourishment and perfection.

Both the above mentioned stages are necessary for achieving
self-building, because, unless and until the heart's ground is not
thoroughly cleansed from evilness, it would not be available for
acquiring higher learning, attaining moral excellence, and performance
of righteous deeds. A heart which is contaminated with Satan's presence,
how could become a center for the manifestation of Divine Light?

How can God's intimate angels enter into such a heart? On the other hand
if faith, enlightenment, moral excellence, and righteous deeds do not
exist, through, which means the human self will attain nourishment and
perfection?

Therefore, for self building both these stages must be attempted
simultaneously. On one side the heart must be thoroughly cleansed and
purified from all sort of impurities and falsies, and on the other side
it should be encouraged and motivated for performance of righteous and
virtuous deeds. Satan must be forced out and God's Intimate Angel should
be welcomed.

Any sort of foreign material other than God's should be thrown out from
it, and God's Blessing and Illumination must be absorbed. These two
stages are complimentary to each other. It is not possible to purify the
heart and let postpone the performance of righteous deeds for a later
opportunity, and likewise we can not ignore the heart's internal
impurities and evilness before undertaking the performance of righteous
deeds.

Therefore, it is necessary that both of these stages must be
coordinated, and should be undertaken simultaneously. Avoiding sins and
shameful moral deeds invites human being towards goodness, and similarly
performance of righteous and virtuous deeds result in his acquittal of
sins and obscene deeds. But in order to continue detailed discussion for
the both stages it would be better to divide them into separate chapter.
Firstly the stage of self-refinement will be discussed.
