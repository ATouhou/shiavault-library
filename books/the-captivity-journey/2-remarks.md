*"Indeed, if years made me late, and destiny prevented me from being
among your supporters, and if I was not a fighter to he who had fought
against you, and not an enemy to he who announced his enmity to you, I
shall moan you in the morning and at night, I shall weep you with blood
instead of tears, due to my heartbreaking and desolation for what
happened to you, and out of eagerness to die of the sorrow of the
calamity and the distress of the tragedy".* 1
