Conclusion
The three views of science presented here testify to the vibrancy of the
ongoing debate on science in the present world of Islam. Needless to
say, there are many aspects to this debate, and many borderline cases
and criss-crossings have to be admitted as part of the continuous
struggle of the Muslim world to come to terms with the problem of
science both in its traditional-Islamic and modern Western senses. It is
nevertheless certain that the growing awareness of the Islamic world
concerning its scientific tradition on the one hand, and the ways in
which it tries to cope with the challenges of modern Western science on
the other, are among the momentous events of the history of contemporary
Islam. It remains to be seen what kind of interaction will play out
between the three positions analyzed above. Be that as it may, the
future course of science debate in the Islamic world is more than likely
to be shaped by these positions with all of their ambitions and
promises.
