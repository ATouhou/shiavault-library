3. Allah Calls Mut’ah “A Good Thing”
====================================

We know already that Allah revealed the Verse of *al-Mut’ah* in His
Book:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فما استمتعتم به منهن فآتوهن أجورهن فريضة
  </p>
</blockquote>

Those of them with whom you contract *mut’ah*, give them their
prescribed dowries.[^1]

We also know that this *ayah* came down with some extra words included
in it:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فما استمعتم به منهن إلى أجل مسمى فآتوهن أجورهن فريضة
  </p>
</blockquote>

Those of them with whom you contract *mut’ah* for a specified period,
give them their prescribed dowries.

The underlined part, however, is not part of the verse. It is only
Allah’s Own *Tafsir* of it, and it belongs to the *Hikmah* revealed to
Prophet Muhammad, *sallallahu ‘alaihi wa alihi*. As we have discussed in
the first chapter, it is allowed to recite this extra phrase along with
the verse (as Ubayy b. Ka’b, Ibn ‘Abbas and some others from the *Salaf*
did), and it is equally allowed to remove it. The words “for a specified
period” make it impossible to twist the verse – in desperate attempts -
in favour of permanent marriages or concubine relationships. Only
*mut’ah* is conducted “for a specified period”, and the *ayah* is
definitely about it.

Meanwhile, the Verse of *al-Mut’ah* remains in force till today, and
will continue to do so till the Hour. Shaykh al-Kulayni (d. 329 H)
records:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
علي، عن أبيه، عن ابن أبي عمير، عن عمر بن أذينة، عن زرارة قال: جاء عبد
الله بن عمير الليثي إلى أبي جعفر عليه السلام فقال له: ما تقول في متعة
النساء؟ فقال: أحلها الله في كتابه وعلى لسان نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله
فهي حلال إلى يوم القيامة
  </p>
</blockquote>

‘Ali – his father – Ibn Abi ‘Umayr – ‘Umar b. Uzaynah – Zurarah:

‘Abd Allah b. ‘Umayr al-Laythi went to Abu Ja’far, peace be upon him,
and said to him, “What is your opinion of *mut’ah* with women?” So, he
(Abu Ja’far) said, “**Allah made it** ***halal*** **in His Book and upon
the tongue of His Prophet, peace be upon him and his family. Therefore,
it is** ***halal*** **till the Day of** ***al-Qiyamah***.”[^2]

‘Allamah al-Majlisi (d. 1111 H) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">

</blockquote>

*Hasan*[^3]

Ayatullah al-Ruhani also comments:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
صحيح
  </p>
</blockquote>

*Sahih*[^4]

The ace Sunni exegete, Imam Ibn Jarir al-Ṭabari (d. 310 H), also
documents:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا محمد بن المثنى، قال: ثنا محمد بن جعفر، قال: ثنا شعبة، عن الحكم،
قال: سألته عن هذه الآية} : والمحصنات من النساء إلا ما ملكت أيمانكم
{إلى هذا الموضع: }فما استمتعتم به منهن {أمنسوخة هي؟ قال: لا. قال
الحكم: قال علي رضي الله عنه: لولا أن عمر رضي الله عنه نهى عن المتعة ما
زنى إلا شقى.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Muhammad b. al-Muthanna – Muhammad b. Ja’far – Shu’bah:

I asked al-Hakam concerning this verse {Also [forbidden for marriage
are] women already married, except those whom your right hands possess}
up till {Those of them with whom you contract *mut’ah*} [4:24], “**Is it
abrogated?**” He said, “**NO**”.

Al-Hakam said: “ ‘Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: ‘If ‘Umar,
may Allah be pleased with him, had not forbidden *mut’ah*, none would
have committed *zina* except a wretched person.”[^5]

We already encountered this *sanad* in the first chapter. The chain is
*sahih* up to al-Hakam. As for al-Hakam himself, al-Hafiẓ states about
him:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الحكم بن عتيبة بالمثناة ثم الموحدة مصغرا أبو محمد الكندي الكوفي ثقة
ثبت فقيه إلا أنه ربما دلس
  </p>
</blockquote>

Al-Hakam b. ‘Utaybah, Abu Muhammad al-Kindi al-Kufi: ***Thiqah***
**(trustworthy),** ***thabt*** **(accurate), a jurist,** except that he
perhaps did *tadlis*.[^6]

Al-Hakam was without doubt a major jurist of the Ahl al-Sunnah, and this
is evident from the action of Shu’bah. He declared explicitly that the
Verse of *al-Mut’ah* was never abrogated. Moreover, by narrating the
*munqati’* *athar* of ‘Ali to Shu’bah, he made it absolutely clear to
him his understanding that the *ayah* was about *mut’ah*. Meanwhile, the
fact that the verse is unabrogated is further revealed in the general
attitude of the Sunni *‘ulama*. A lot of them interpret it as a
reference to intercourse in a permanent *nikah*[^7] – a submission that
contradicts the authentic *ahadith* quoted in our first chapter.

However, there is an alternative Sunni view, which insists that the
Verse of *al-Mut’ah* has been abrogated. For instance, Imam Ibn Hazm (d.
456 H) submits:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قوله تعالى}: فما استمتعتم به منهن فآتوهن أجورهن فريضة] {٢٤ / النساء /
٤[ فنسخت بقوله صلى الله عليه وسلم إني كنت أحللت هذه المتعة ألا وإن
الله ورسوله قد حرماها ألا فليبلغ الشاهد الغائب .
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ووقع ناسخها من القرآن موضع ذكر ميراث الزوجة الثمن والربع فلم يكن لها
في ذلك نصيب. وقال محمد بن إدريس الشافعي رحمة الله عليه موضع تحريمها في
سورة المؤمن وناسخها قوله تعالى} :والذين هم لفروجهم حافظون إلا على
أزواجهم أو ما ملكت أيمانهم] {... ٥ مكية / المؤمن / ٢٣ [وأجمعوا على
أنها ليست بزوجة ولا ملك يمين فنسخها الله بهذه الآية.
  </p>
</blockquote>

His Statement, the Most High: {Those of them with whom you contract
*mut’ah*, give them their prescribed dowries} [*Al-Nisa*, 4:24]. It has
been abrogated by his statement, peace be upon him: “I used to allow
this *mut’ah*. Verily, Allah and His Messenger have (now) made it
*haram*. Therefore, let those present inform those who are absent.”

Its abrogation also occurs in the Qur’an where the inheritance of the
wife is mentioned, eighth and fourths, and she (the woman in *mut’ah*)
has no share from that. Muhammad b. Idris al-Shafi’i, may the mercy of
Allah be upon him, also said that the place of its abrogation is in
*Surah al-Mumin*, and its abrogation is His Statement, the Most High:
{And those who guard their private parts, except from their wives or
what their right hands possess (i.e. slave-women)...} [Makkan,
*al-Mumin*, 23, verse 5]. And they agreed that she (i.e. the woman in
*mut’ah*) is not a wife, and not a slave-woman. Therefore, Allah
abrogated it with this verse.[^8]

Apparently, Ibn Hazm also believes that the verse was revealed about
*mut’ah*. His arguments against the temporary marriage are as follows:

(i) The *ahadith* against *mut’ah* have abrogated the Verse of
*al-Mut’ah*.

(ii) The verse about the inheritance of wives has abrogated the Verse of
*al-Mut’ah*.

(iii) A verse revealed in Makkah in *Surah al-Mumin* abrogated the Verse
of *al-Mut’ah*, which was revealed *later* in al-Madinah!

Well, only an *ayah* can abrogate an *ayah*, as Allah Himself declares:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ما ننسخ من آية أو ننسها نأت بخير منها أو مثلها
  </p>
</blockquote>

Whatever a verse We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, **We bring a
better one or one similar to it**.[^9]

We also read:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وإذا بدلنا آية مكان آية والله أعلم بما ينزل قالوا إنما أنت مفتر بل
أكثرهم لا يعلمون
  </p>
</blockquote>

**And when We change a verse in place of another verse**, and Allah
knows best of what He sends down, they say, “You are but a forger.” Nay,
but most of them know not.[^10]

Imam al-Shafi’i (d. 204 H) himself says about it:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ولا ينسخ كتاب الله إلا كتابه لقول الله} ما ننسخ من آية أو ننسها نأت
بخير منها أو مثلها {وقوله} وإذا بدلنا آية مكان آية والله أعلم بما ينزل
قالوا إنما أنت مفتر { فأبان أن نسخ القرآن لا يكون إلا بقرآن مثله
  </p>
</blockquote>

**The Book of Allah cannot be abrogated except by His Book**, due to the
Statement of Allah {Whatever a verse We abrogate or cause to be
forgotten, We bring a better one or one similar to it} and His Statement
{And when We change a verse in place of another verse, and Allah knows
best of what He sends down, they say, “You are but a forger”}. **So, it
is very clear that the abrogation of (a verse of) the Qur’an cannot
occur except through (another verse of) the Qur’an**.[^11]

Imam ‘Abd al-Razzaq (d. 211 H) has this too:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عبد الرزاق قال معمر وقال قتادة وأما قوله نأت بخير منها أو مثلها يقول
آية فيها تخفيف فيها رخصة فيها أمر فيها نهي
  </p>
</blockquote>

‘Abd al-Razzaq – Ma’mar – Qatadah:

As for His Statement {We bring **a better one or one similar** to it},
He says: “**A verse** in which there is relief, in which there is
permission, in which there is a command, in which there is a
prohibition.”[^12]

Prof. Ibn Yasin says about this *riwayah*:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وإسناده صحيح
  </p>
</blockquote>

Its chain is *sahih*.[^13]

Therefore, it is an *ayah* that abrogates or replaces another *ayah*. As
such, if indeed the Verse of *al-Mut’ah* has been abrogated, there
*must* be an explicit verse in the Qur’an revealed for that purpose.
Whoever is unable to provide an abrogating verse *must* accept the
validity of temporary marriage in the Book of Allah unconditionally.

Secondly, it is perfectly possible for the wife in a valid marriage not
to inherit her husband. For instance, Imam al-Bukhari (d. 256 H)
documents:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا أبو عاصم عن ابن جريج عن ابن شهاب عن علي بن حسين عن عمرو بن عثمان
عن أسامة بن زيد رضي الله عنهما : أن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم قال :لا
يرث المسلم الكافر ولا الكافر المسلم
  </p>
</blockquote>

Abu ‘Asim – Ibn Jurayj – Ibn Shihab – ‘Ali b. Husayn – ‘Amr b. ‘Uthman –
Usamah b. Zayd, may Allah be pleased with them both:

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “The Muslim does not inherit the
*kafir*, and the *kafir* does not inherit the Muslim.”[^14]

So, where a Muslim is married to a Jewish or Christian woman – and she
cannot inherit him – does this in any way affect the validity of their
*nikah*? Of course, it does not. In the same manner, the fact that the
spouses in a temporary marriage may not inherit each other – depending
upon their mutual agreement - does NOT in any way establish its
abrogation by any *ayah* or *hadith*, nor does it cancel the status of
the woman as a “wife”. *Mut’ah*, obviously, is an exception to the
general ruling in the Verse of Inheritance, just as the Muslim-*kafirah*
marriage is.

Finally, al-Shafi’i quotes this verse as the abrogator of temporary
marriage in the Qur’an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
والذين هم لفروجهم حافظون إلا على أزواجهم أو ما ملكت أيمانهم فإنهم غير
ملومين فمن ابتغى وراء ذلك فأولئك هم العادون
  </p>
</blockquote>

And those who guard their private parts, **except from their wives or
what their right hands possess (i.e. slave-women)**, for then, they are
free from blame. **But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the
transgressors**.[^15]

His argument is that the woman in *mut’ah* is neither a “wife” nor a
“slave-woman”; and, sexual intercourse is not allowed except with those
two. However, there are three fatal problems with the use of this noble
*ayah* against *mut’ah*. First, it was revealed in Makkah, while the
Verse of *al-Mut’ah* came *later* in al-Madinah. So, if anything, it
would be the later abrogating the former! Secondly, Prophet Muhammad
allowed and practised *mut’ah* during the Madinan era, long after the
revelation of both *Surah al-Muminun* and *Surah al-Ma’arij* in Makkah.
If we accepted the Sunni argument, it would mean that he was permitting
and indulging in illegal sex! May Allah protect us from such blasphemous
thoughts. Lastly, *mut’ah* is a form of *nikah* (marriage), which means
that both parties are husband and “wife”. Since those verses have
allowed sex with “wives”, then they have defended *mut’ah* as well!

So, as things stand, there is NO *ayah* in the entire Qur’an that has
abrogated the Verse of *al-Mut’ah*. Meanwhile, only a verse can abrogate
a verse. With that, then, nothing can abrogate the Verse of *al-Mut’ah*,
and it shall remain in force till the *Qiyamah*. By extension, *mut’ah*
itself is, on the strength of that verse, valid till the end of life on
earth.

This is the point of departure between the Shi’ah and the Sunnis. The
Ahl al-Sunnah accept the authenticity of *ahadith* which contradict the
Verse of *al-Mut’ah*, and use them to overturn it. By contrast, the
Shi’ah throw out any *riwayah* that disagrees with any verse of the
*Kitab*. So, naturally, all *ahadith* against *mut’ah* – whatsoever
their sources or chains – are fabrications (whether intentional or
accidental) by Shi’i standards. Al-Kulayni reports:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عدة من أصحابنا، عن أحمد بن محمد بن خالد، عن أبيه، عن النضر بن سويد، عن
يحيى الحلبي، عن أيوب بن الحر قال: سمعت أبا عبد الله عليه السلام يقول

  </p>
</blockquote>

A number of our companions – Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Khalid – his father –
al-Naḍar b. Suwayd – Yahya al-Halabi – Ayyub b. al-Hurr:

I heard Abu ‘Abd Allah, peace be upon him, saying: “Everything is
returned back to the Book and the *Sunnah*, **and EVERY** ***hadith***
**that does not agree with the Book of Allah is a vanity**.”[^16]

Muhammad b. Isma’il – al-Faḍl b. Shadhan – Ibn Abi ‘Umayr – Hisham b.
al-Hakam and others – Abu ‘Abd Allah, peace be upon him:

The Prophet, peace be upon him and his family, delivered a *khutbah* at
Muna and said, “O mankind! Whatsoever comes to you from me that agrees
with the Book of Allah, I truly said it. **But, whatsoever comes to you

Prof. ‘Ali Akbar al-Ghiffari also declares:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

  </p>
</blockquote>

A *sahih* chain[^21]

Our beloved teacher, Shaykh al-Saduq (d. 381 H), also thereby submits,
in line with the *sahih* *ahadith*:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وكل حديث لا يوافق كتاب الله فهو باطل
  </p>
</blockquote>

Every *hadith* that does not agree with the Book of Allah is a
fabrication.[^22]

Ayatullah Ja’far Subhani too says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أمر الأئمة عليهم السلام بعرض الأحاديث على الكتاب والسنة، وأن كل حديث
لا يوافق كتاب الله ولا سنة نبيه يضرب به عرض الجدار .وقد تواترت
الروايات على الترجيح بموافقة الكتاب والسنة
  </p>
</blockquote>

The Imams, peace be upon them, ordered that the *ahadith* must be
compared to the Book and the *Sunnah*, and that every single *hadith*
that does not agree with the Book of Allah or the *Sunnah* of His
Prophet must be thrown out. **There are** ***mutawatir*** **reports
about weighing (*****ahadith*****) on the basis of agreement with the
Book and the** ***Sunnah***.[^23]

Ayatullah Makarim al-Shirazi even applies this rule to reject a
*hadith*:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إن هذا الحديث لا ينسجم مع نص القرآن .ووفقا للقواعد الأصولية التي
عندنا، أن كل حديث لا يوافق كتاب الله ساقط عن الاعتبار، ولا يمكن
التعويل على أنه حديث شريف من أحاديث النبي أو المعصومين عليهم السلام.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Certainly, this *hadith* does not agree with the text of the Qur’an.
And, based on the principles of *usul* with us, **that every single**
***hadith*** **that does not agree with the Book of Allah is
unreliable**, and it is impossible to depend upon the fact that it is a
noble *hadith* from the *ahadith* of the Prophet or the infallibles,
peace be upon them.[^24]

So, since *mut’ah* is *halal* in the Qur’an, and there is no *ayah* that
has abrogated it, then every single *hadith* – wherever it comes from –
that suggests its illegitimacy is “a vanity”, a fabrication. The only
way a Sunni can make a valid argument against temporary marriage is to
quote a verse of the *Kitab* that truly repeals it. Anything short of
that is only a child’s play.

Anyway, there is a second *ayah* – apart from the Verse of *al-Mut’ah* –
which, though NOT revealed about temporary marriage, applies to it:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يا أيها الذين آمنوا لا تحرموا طيبات ما أحل الله لكم ولا تعتدوا إن الله
لا يحب المعتدين
  </p>
</blockquote>

O you who believe! **Do not make** ***haram*** **the good things which
Allah has made** ***halal*** **for you**; and do not exceed the limits;
surely Allah does not love those who exceed the limits.[^25]

In the last chapter, we see how Ibn Mas’ud considered *mut’ah* as one of
“the *good* things” mentioned in this verse. In this report of Imam
al-Bukhari, the reason is explicitly given:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا قتيبة بن سعيد حدثنا جرير عن إسماعيل عن قيس قال : قال عبد الله
كنا نغزو مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم وليس لنا شيء فقلنا ألا
نستخصي ؟ فنهانا عن ذلك ثم رخصلنا أن ننكح المرأة بالثوب ثم قرأ علينا }
يا أيها الذين أمنوا لا تحرموا طيبات ما أحل الله لكم ولا تعتدوا أن الله
لا يحب المعتدين {
  </p>
</blockquote>

Qutaybah b. Sa’id – Jarir – Isma’il – Qays – ‘Abd Allah (b. Mas’ud):

We were on an expedition with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him,
and we had nothing with us. So, we said, “Should we castrate ourselves?”
But, he forbade us to do that. Then, he permitted us to do *nikah*
(marriage) with the woman, giving her a garment (as the dowry). **Then,
he recited to us** {O you who believe! **Do not make** ***haram*** **the
good things which Allah has made** ***halal*** **for you**; and do not
exceed the limits; surely Allah does not love those who exceed the
limits}.[^26]

Yes, it was the Prophet himself who first quoted the verse in support of
*mut’ah*, and Ibn Mas’ud only followed this *Sunnah* later.

Imam Ahmad (d. 241 H) also documents:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا عبد الله حدثني أبي ثنا يحيى بن زكريا قال أخبرني إسماعيل عن قيس
عن بن مسعود قال كنا مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم ليس لنا نساء قلنا

‘Abd Allah (b. Ahmad) – my father (Ahmad b. Hanbal) – Yahya b. Zakariya
– Isma’il – Qays – Ibn Mas’ud:

We were with the Messenger of Allah. There were no women with us. So, we
said, “O Messenger of Allah, should we castrate ourselves?” **But, he
forbade us from doing that AND said** {O you who believe! **Do not
make** ***haram*** **the good things which Allah has made** ***halal***
**for you**}[^27]

about the character of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and
she said, “The Qur’an.”[^32]

Al-Arnauṭ states:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إسناده صحيح
  </p>
</blockquote>

Its chain is *sahih*[^33]

Apparently, nothing declared *halal* in *Surah al-Maidah* was ever
abrogated. Moreover, the verses of the *surah* came very late in
revelation, and were therefore very close to the time of the Prophet’s
death.

We are unsure about that exact military expedition which Ibn Mas’ud was
making reference to. However, we know that a lot – perhaps the
majority - of its Muslim soldiers were youths as stated by him. He
himself died during the rule of ‘Uthman in 32 H[^34] and his age was
sixty three then[^35]. This means that he was already 31 during the
*Hijrah* and had reached 33 by the time of the Battle of Badr – the
first battle in Islam. So, whenever that expedition was, Ibn Mas’ud was,
by all indications, already beyond youthfulness. Therefore, when he said
“and *we* were youths”, he was most probably referring only to the
*dominant* composition of the army.

It seems that this is also what explains the tone of the *ayah*. The
Verse of *al-Mut’ah* had been revealed before that expedition. So, when
these youthful Sahabah talked of castrating themselves instead of going
into *mut’ah*, it looked as though they had made it *haram* for
themselves. As a result, the Prophet quoted Qur’an 5:87 (which also had
been revealed before then) to declare that temporary marriage was one of
the good things mentioned in that *ayah*, that it was made *halal* by
Allah, and that the Muslims must not make it *haram* for themselves.
Then, he gave them a direct command. Imam Abu Ya’la (d. 307 H) records:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا أبو خيثمة حدثنا مروان بن معاوية الفزاري عن إسماعيل بن أبي خالد
عن قيس بن أبي حازم قال : سمعت عبد الله بن مسعود يقول كنا نغزو مع رسول
الله صلى الله عليه و سلم ليس لنا نساء فقلنا : يارسول الله ألا نستخصي ؟
فنهانا عن ذلك وأمرنا أن ننكح المرأة بالثوب ثم قرأ عبد الله : { يا أيها
الذين آمنوا لا تحرموا طيبات ما أحل الله }
  </p>
</blockquote>

Abu Khaythamah – Marwan b. Mu’awiyah al-Fazari – Isma’il b. Abi Khalid –
Qays b. Abi Hazim:

I heard ‘Abd Allah b. Mas’ud saying: “We were on an expedition with the
Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. There were no women with us. So,
we said, “O Messenger of Allah, should we castrate ourselves?” But, he
forbade us from doing that **AND HE ORDERED US to do** ***nikah***
**with the woman**, giving her the garment (as the dowry)”. Then, ‘Abd
Allah recited {O you who believe! **Do not make** ***haram*** **the good
things which Allah has made** ***halal*** **for you**}.[^36]

Shaykh Dr. Asad says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إسناده صحيح
  </p>
</blockquote>

Its chain is *sahih*[^37]

This order, in some other reports, is also termed a “permission” by Ibn
Mas’ud. Perhaps, he did this because the Messenger – being the field
commander – had the right to temporarily prohibit certain *halal* things
to his soldiers in order to maintain strict discipline, high morale and
strong energy. Normally, even if Ibn Mas’ud and the others had initially
considered *mut’ah* to be *halal*, they would nonetheless have needed
the Prophet’s permission to go ahead with it, as long as they were still
on the military expedition. Obviously, his order to them to perform
*mut’ah* contained two things together: a permission *and* a command.

Imam Ibn Hibban (d. 354 H) also documents:

Ahmad b. ‘Ali b. al-Muthanna - Abu Khaythamah – Marwan b. Mu’awiyah
al-Fazari – Isma’il b. Abi Khalid – Qays b. Abi Hazim:

I heard Ibn Mas’ud saying: “We were on an expedition with the Messenger
of Allah, peace be upon him. There were no women with us. So, we said,
“O Messenger of Allah, should we castrate ourselves?” But, he forbade us
from doing that **AND HE ORDERED US to do** ***nikah*** **with the
woman**, giving her the garment (as the dowry)”. Then, ‘Abd Allah
recited this verse {O you who believe! **Do not make** ***haram*** **the
good things which Allah has made** ***halal*** **for you**}.[^38]

‘Allamah al-Albani states:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
صحيح
  </p>
</blockquote>

*Sahih*[^39]

And Shaykh al-Arnauṭ concurs:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إسناده صحيح على شرط الشيخين
  </p>
</blockquote>

Its chain is *sahih* upon the standard of the two Shaykhs[^40]

The bottomline of all this is that the Prophet described *mut’ah* as one
of “the good things” which Allah has made *halal*, mentioned in a verse
in *Surah al-Maidah*. His companion, Ibn Mas’ud, followed him strictly
in this *Sunnah* as well, after him. Well, our brothers from the Ahl
al-Sunnah routinely describe *mut’ah* as “fornication and adultery”. So,
we ask: are fornication and adultery good, *halal* things?

Moreover, one of the *very* last *ayahs* of the Qur’an to be revealed
re-affirm the *halalness* of “the good things”:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اليوم أحل لكم الطيبات
  </p>
</blockquote>

Today, the good things are made *halal* to you.[^41]

Once more, this is from *al-Maidah* where nothing of *halal* and *haram*
has been abrogated. As such, this verse also re-declares *mut’ah* to be
*halal* since it is one of “the good things”, according to the Prophet
himself.

We equally read these verses:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يسألونك ماذا أحل لهم قل أحل لكم الطيبات
  </p>
</blockquote>

They ask you (O Muhammad) what is *halal* for them. Say: “The good
things are made *halal* for you.”[^42]

And:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الذين يتبعون الرسول النبي الأمي الذي يجدونه مكتوبا عندهم في التوراة
والإنجيل يأمرهم بالمعروف وينهاهم عن المنكر ويحل لهم الطيبات ويحرم
عليهم الخبائث ويضع عنهم إصرهم والأغلال التي كانت عليهم
  </p>
</blockquote>

Those who follow the Messenger, the *Ummi* Prophet, whom they find
written with them in *al-Tawrat* and *al-Injil*, **he orders them with
good deeds and forbids them from evil deeds, and he makes the good
things** ***halal*** **for them and makes the impure things**
***haram*** **to them**, and removes from them their burden and shackles
which they were upon.[^43]

We know that he “ordered” the performance of *mut’ah*. In that case, it
is one of the “good deeds”. We also know that he explicitly called
*mut’ah* one of “the good things”. This assures us that he always
declared it *halal* till his death, in line with the Qur’an of his Lord,
and never made it *haram* – not even for a split second.

Meanwhile, let us equally look at this from another angle. In one of the
Makkan *surahs*, Allah declares *haram* all forms of indecent
behaviours:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قل إنما حرم ربي الفواحش ما ظهر منها وما بطن والإثم والبغي بغير الحق
وأن تشركوا بالله ما لم ينزل به سلطانا وأن تقولوا على الله ما لا تعلمون
  </p>
</blockquote>

Say: “**My Lord has only made** ***haram*** **all indecencies, those of
them that are apparent as well as those that are concealed**, and sin
and rebellion without justice, and that you associate with Allah that
for which He has not sent down any authority, and that you say against
Allah what you do not know”.[^44]

So, fornication and adultery – both of which are indecencies – were
already made *haram* before the *Hijrah*. Our Sunni brothers say that
*mut’ah* also constitutes fornication and adultery. As such, by their
logic, it was banned during the Makkan era by Allah and His Messenger.
But then, on what basis was the Prophet practising *mut’ah* along with
his Sahabah *after* the *Hijrah*? On what basis was he also “allowing”
and “commanding” them to contract temporary marriages? Was he
contradicting his Lord? Was he declaring the *haram* to be *halal*? Was
he encouraging and enforcing fornication and adultery?

Even worse still for our Sunni brothers, this is what the *Kitab* has
said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قل إن الله لا يأمر بالفحشاء
  </p>
</blockquote>

Say: “Verily, Allah does NOT command indecencies.”[^45]

In fact, He *actually* forbids them:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إن الله يأمر بالعدل والإحسان وإيتاء ذي القربى وينهى عن الفحشاء والمنكر
والبغي
  </p>
</blockquote>

Verily, Allah commands justice, good deeds and the giving to the
kindred, **and He forbids indecencies**, and evil deeds and
rebellion.[^46]

So, we put this to the Ahl al-Sunnah: when Allah commands us to give
dowries to *mut’ah* wives in the Verse of *al-Mut’ah*, what has He done?
