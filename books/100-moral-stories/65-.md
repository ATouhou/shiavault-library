FINDERS KEEPERS
A wise woman who was traveling in the

mountains found a precious stone in a stream. The next day she met
another traveler

who was hungry, and the wise woman opened her bag to share her food. The
hungry

traveler saw the precious stone & asked the woman to give it to him. She
did so without hesitation.

The traveler left, rejoicing his good fortune. He knew the stone was
worth enough to give him

security for a lifetime. But a few days later he came back to return the
stone to the wise woman.

“I’ve been thinking,” He said, “I know how valuable the stone is, but I
give it back in the hope that

you can give me something even more precious: Give me what you have
within you that enabled

you to give me the stone.”

BANDAGE OF COMPLAINT!

Once a saint saw a man with a bandage tied round his head. “Why have you
tied the bandage?” he

asked. “Because my head aches,” the man replied. “How old are you?” he
demanded. “Thirty,” he

replied. “Have you been in pain and anguish the greater part of your
life?” he enquired. “No,” the

man answered. “For thirty years you have enjoyed good health,” he
remarked, “and you never tied

the bandage of thankfulness. Now because of this one night head ache,
that you have, you tie the

bandage of complaint!”
