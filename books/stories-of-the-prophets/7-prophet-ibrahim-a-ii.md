Prophet Ibrahim (a) II
======================

Ibrahim married a girl

called Sarah. They lived

very happily in Palestine.

They worked and had

plenty of everything.

Ibrahim became very

wealthy, but he was

a good man. He

always helped

other people too.

After many years Ibrahim

and Sarah still had no

children. This made

them very sad. They

both wanted a

child to share

their life with.

Sarah told Ibrahim

that he should marry

her servant Hajar too,

so that Ibrahim and

Hajar could make a

child together.
