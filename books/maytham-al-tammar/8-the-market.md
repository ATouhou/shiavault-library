The Market
==========

Ziyad bin Abeeh became a ruler over Kufa. He began killing Imam Ali's
companions. He carried out Mu'awiyah orders. Mu'awiyah was full of
spite. He ordered people to abuse Imam Ali [a].

The ruler appointed a man to look after the market. The man was unjust.
The people complained of his bad treatment. The people were afraid of
the man. Thus, they went to Maytham. They asked Maytham to go with them
to the Prince. They said to him:

*Maytham, come with us to the Prince.*

Maytham went with them. He met the Prince and told him about the rude
treatment in the market. A policeman in the Palace was displeased with
Maytham's words. He said to the Prince:

*Your Highness, the Prince, do you know this man?*

The Prince said:

*No!*

*He's a liar! The supporter of a liar!*

The policeman meant that Maytham was one of Imam Ali's companions.

Maytham said:

*Surely, I'm truthful! I'm the supporter of a truthful man. Really, he's
Amirul Mu'mineen! (the Commander of the Faithful)*
