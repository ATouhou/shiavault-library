Lesson 24 : More About the Shari‘a
==================================

The purpose of human life in this world is to successfully go through
the trials and tribulations in order to achieve salvation in the
hereafter. In the hereafter, life will have no end. God did not leave us
without any means of guidance.

He sent prophets, messengers and books to guide mankind towards the
right path. The last prophet and messenger was the Prophet of Islam, and
the final revelation was the Qur’an.

Islam is the ultimate means of guidance for mankind through the tests
and trials of this world. The Prophet was sent “to convey the
revelation; to purify spiritually and to teach the Qur’an and wisdom.”

Islam seeks to guide its followers by the legal system known as
“shari’a”. No aspect of our life is outside the jurisdiction of the
shari’a: legal and moral, personal and social, economic and politics,
all issues are directly or indirectly covered by the shari’a.

In this lesson you will learn more about the Islamic laws from
different perspectives.

**1. The Roots & Branches of Religion**

To differentiate between the matters of belief and the laws of shari’a,
the Shi’a scholars have coined two interesting terms: The matter of
beliefs (monotheism,

justice of God, prophethood, imamat and resurrection) are described as
“the Roots of Religion — Usul ad-Din” because they form the foundation
of our faith. The Shi’a scholars have also coined the term “the Branches
of Religion — Furu’ ad-Din” for the shari’a laws.

These terminologies actually reflect the connection between “belief and
“practice”. If the roots are strong, they will generate healthy
branches, green leaves, colourful flowers and delicious fruits; but if
the roots are weak, the tree will be considered useless.

Similarly, if a Muslim’s beliefs are strong, then it should show in the
practical life of that person. A non-practicing Muslim betrays the
weakness in his religious roots which are in need of further nurturing
through intellectual stimulation and spiritual guidance.

The items normally listed as “the Branches of Religion” are as
follows:

1. Prayers (salat).

2. Fasting in Ramadhan (sawm).

3. Pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj).

4. Tax on Wealth (zakdt).

5. Tax on Money (khums).

6. Spiritual as well as Physical Struggle for sake of Allah (jihad).

7. Promoting good in the family and society (amr bil ma’ruf).

8. Preventing evil in the family and society (nahi ‘anil munkar).

9. Loving and following the Prophet & his family (tawalla).

10. Disassociating from the enemies of the Prophet & his family
(tabarra). These ten teachings reflect the main framework of the Islamic
shari’a; otherwise, the entire corpus of Islamic shari’a falls under the
term ‘branches of religion’.

**2. The Classification of Shari’a Laws**

All the issues covered by the shari’a are traditionally classified into
four main groups. The classification was put in the final form by one of
the great Shi’a mujtahids of the 7th Islamic century, al- Muhaqqiq
al-Hilli (d. 676 AH).

His famous work of jurisprudence, Sharaya’u ‘l-Islam, is still one of
the main reference books for the scholars of Islamic laws. Al-Muhaqqiq
al-Hilli classified the laws into the following groups:

1. ‘Ibadat — the Acts of Worship like prayers, fasting, hajj, etc.

2. ‘Uqud — Mutual Contracts like business transaction, partnership,
trusts, power of attorney issues, and marriage.

3. lyqa’at — Unilateral Instigations like divorce, confessions in legal
matters, vows, etc.


4. Ahkam — Miscellaneous: anything which does not fit in the three
groups above like rules of eating and drinking, agriculture,
arbitration, testimony, etc.

Here I would like to present a modern classification of shari’a issues
done by the late Sayyid Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr. Ayatullah as-Sadr of
Najaf was a rising star among the new generation of mujtahids;
unfortunately the Shi’a world was deprived of his knowledge and
leadership when he was tortured and killed by Saddam’s regime in 1981.

Sadr also divides the shari’a laws into four groups but his
classification makes the issues more clear for the modern man unused to
classical texts.

1. ‘Ibadat — the Acts of Worship like prayers, fasting and hajj. 2.
Financial Laws:

(a) On Social Level: issues like Islamic taxes of various kinds.

(b) On Individual Level:

i. the laws pertaining to the means of possessions.

ii. the laws pertaining to the utilization of one’s possessions.

3. Personal Laws: issues like marriage and divorce, eating and
drinking, vows and oaths, hunting and slaughtering, bidding good and
forbidding evil, etc.

4. Social Laws: issues like the political system, judiciary, penal
code, jihad, etc.

**3. The Five Types of Decrees**

All Islamic injunctions fall within the five main categories of laws:
wajib, mustahab, ja’iz, makruh, and haram. There are other sub-divisions
within these five decrees.

1. Wajib: means obligatory, necessary, incumbent. An act which must be
performed. One will be punished for neglecting a wajib act, e.g., the
daily prayers.

Ihtiyat wajib: Sometimes you might see the term “ihtiyat wajib” in the
decrees of the mujtahids. It means “precautionarily obligatory and its
significance is the same as that of the wajib with one difference:
wherever the mujtahid says that “it is precautionarily obligatory,” you
have the option of leaving his opinion in that particular problem and
following the opinion of the second best mujtahid provided the second
mujtahid has a different opinion.

Wajib is also divided into two: ‘ayni and kifa’i:

Wajib ‘ayni means an obligation which is imposed on individual Muslims,
e.g., the daily prayers. No one can do this duty for someone else.

Whereas wajib kifa’i means an obligation which is imposed on the Muslim
community as a whole; and if it is fulfilled by one or more individuals,
then the rest of the community is no longer required to do that.

For example, a dead Muslim must be buried in the proper Islamic way.
This is a duty imposed on the Muslim community collectively; if some
people do that, then others are not responsible; but if no one does
that, then the entire community is answerable to God.

2. Mustahab, also known as sunnat, means recommended, desirable,
better. It refers to the acts which are recommended but not wajib. If
one neglects them, he will not be punished; however, if one performs
them, he will be rewarded.

3. Ja’iz means permitted, allowed, lawful. An act which is permitted
and lawful; there is no reward for performing it nor any punishment for
neglecting it, e.g., drinking tea.

Halal & Mubah: There are other words which reflect the same meaning as
ja’iz but with a different connotation: “Halal” also means permissible
acts or things, but it is used mostly for permissible things rather than
actions.

For example, the term “halal meat” is used for the meat whose
consumption is permissible in Islam. Similarly, “mubah” means
permissible, but it is exclusively used for things which are lawfully
yours or under your control as opposed to “ghasbi— usurped”.

4. Makruh means reprehensible, disliked, discouraged. An act which is
disliked by Islam but not haram. If one does a makruh act, he will not
be punished; however, if he refrains from it, then he will be
rewarded.

5. Haram means forbidden, prohibited. An act from which one must
abstain. If someone performs a haram act, he will be punished either by
the Islamic court or in the hereafter or both.
