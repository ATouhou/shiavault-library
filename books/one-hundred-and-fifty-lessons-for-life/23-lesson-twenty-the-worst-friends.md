Lesson Twenty: The Worst Friends
================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"شَرُّ إخْوانِكَ مَنْ داهَنَكَ فى نَفْسِكَ وَ ساتَرَكَ عَيْبَك"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Your worst friends are those who flatter and talk with you superficially
and conceal your faults.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Escaping the realities and concealing the truths neither solves any
problem nor is it a service to anyone. Therefore, friends who refrain
from constructive criticism and from urging corrective actions and,
instead, hide their friend’s faults for his false satisfaction, or
misrepresent it as a goodness, have failed to be faithful in friendship.
They have also committed a great treachery that may cause serious damage
to the prestige, reputation, honor and prosperity of their friend.
