Life After Death
================

Allah created man and fashioned him for set tasks. In the same manner He
created plants and animals. But if man or animals die, surely Allah is
able to give them life as surely as He created them in the first
instance.

Surely all men die, and just as surely Allah gives them life with His
ability, and judges them on their deeds and actions. We know Allah is
the Creator and can recreate us, because if one can do something he has
the ability to do it again.

For instance, if your teacher asks you to draw a picture on the
blackboard and colour it. Then if after you have drawn it with beautiful
colours, the teacher asks you to rub it out and do it again, could you
repeat the same drawing again?

Of course you would be able to repeat the picture. It is what you
created and are capable of doing again.

From this example, we can understand Allah is Able to give life to the
dead because it is He Who created them in the beginning. Allah can
surely give life to the dead. He judges them on their deeds. On
Resurrection Day He will re-create the dead for judgement, and then
allow the doer of good to enter paradise but cast the evil-doer into
hell.

As it is said: “Surely Allah gives life to the dead.”
