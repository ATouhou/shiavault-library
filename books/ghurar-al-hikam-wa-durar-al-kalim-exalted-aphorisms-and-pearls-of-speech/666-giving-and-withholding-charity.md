Giving And Withholding Charity
==============================

**Giving and withholding charity-الإنْفاق والإمساك**

1. Beware of withholding [charity], for indeed you are [only] a
treasurer for someone else in that which you withhold from what is in
excess of your daily requirement.

> 1ـ إيّاكَ والإمْساكَ فَإنَّ ما أمْسَكْتَهُ فَوْقَ قُوتِ يَوْمِكَ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كُنْتَ فيهِ خازِناً لِغَيْرِكَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

2. If you spend your wealth for the sake of Allah, then [know that]
indeed Allah is quick in recompense.

> 2ـ إنْ تَبْذُلُوا أمْوالَكُمْ في جَنْبِ اللّهِ فَإنَّ اللّهَ مُسْرِعُ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الخَلَفَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

3. When you are blessed with sustenance then give charity.

> 3ـ إذا رُزِقْتَ فَأنْفِقْ.

4. When you are blessed with sustenance then give generously.

> 4ـ إذا رُزِقْتَ فَأوْسِعْ.

5. Your garments are more lasting for you when worn by others rather
than yourself.

> 5ـ ثِيابُكَ عَلى غَيْرِكَ أبْقى لَكَ مِنْها عَلَيْكَ.

6. A dirham that benefits [others] is better than a dinar[^1] that
throws one into ruin.

> 6ـ دِرْهَمٌ يَنْفَعُ خَيْرٌ مِنْ دينار يَصْرَعُ.

7. The dirham of a poor man is purer in the sight of Allah than the
dinar of the rich.

> 7ـ دِرْهَمُ الفَقيرِ أزْكى عِنْدَ اللّهِ مِنْ دينارِ الغَنِيِّ.

8. Many a thing that is little grows and develops much more than that
which is plenty.

> 8ـ رُبَّ يَسير أنْمى مِنْ كَثير.

9. Little that belongs to you is better than plenty that belongs to
others.

> 9ـ قَلِيلٌ لَكَ خَيْرٌ مِنْ كَثير لِغَيْرِكَ.

10. Nobody gains anything from his worldly life except that which he
spends on others.

> 10ـ لَيْسَ لأَحَد مِنْ دُنْياهُ إلاّ ما أنْفَقَهُ عَلى أُخْراهُ.

11. One who gives with a short arm is given with a long arm.[^2]

> 11ـ مَنْ يُعْطِ بِاليَدِ القَصيرَةِ يُعْطَ بِاليَدِ الطَّويلَةِ.

12. Verily you are more in need of giving charity from what you have
earned than acquiring what you accumulate.

> 12ـ إنَّكُمْ إلى إنْفاقِ مَا اكْتَسَبْتُمْ أحْوَجُ مِنْكُمْ إلَى
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اكْتِسابِ ما تَجْمَعُونَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

[^1]: The dirham is a silver coin and the dinar is a gold coin (which is
typically valued as ten times as much as the dirham).

[^2]: Sayyid Raḍi (r) has explained the meaning of this aphorism thus:
it means the human being gets much reward for the little charity that he
gives. For the entire explanation refer to the commentary of Nahj
al-Balāgha, Hikma no. 232
