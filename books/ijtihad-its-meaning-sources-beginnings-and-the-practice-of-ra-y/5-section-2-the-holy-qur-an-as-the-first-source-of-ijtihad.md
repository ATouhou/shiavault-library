Section 2 : the Holy Qur'an As the First Source of Ijtihad
==========================================================

**The Holy Qur'an as the First Source of Ijtihad**

Jurisprudents of the various Islamic sects have expressed different
views concerning the sources of ijtihad. Before these are examined in
detail, their brief description will be in order.

1. The first view pertains to the majority of Imamiyyah jurispru­dents
of the Ja'fari school. They maintain that the Book, the Sunnah, ijma \`
(consensus), and \`aql (reason) constitute the sources of ijtihad.

2. However, some, like the Akhbaris, who follow Mulla Muhammad Amin
al-'Astarabadi (d. 1033/1623) accept only the Sunnah as the source for
derivation of ahkam.

3. Some, like the jurisprudents of the Hanafi school, regard the Book,
the mutawatir Sunnah, statements of the Companions, the Com­panions'
consensus, qiyas, istihsan and ‘urf (custom) as the sources of ijtihad -
as mentioned by Abu Zuhrah in his Ta'rikh al-madhahib al- 'arba\`ah.

4. Some others, like the \`ulama' of the Maliki school, followers of
Malik ibn Anas al-'Asbahi, believe these sources to be the Book, the
Sunnah, consensus of the jurists of Madinah, masalih mursalah (a kind of
qiyas), such statements of the Companions as are not based on ray, and
qiyas mansus al-illah. This is according to Dr. Subhi Mahmasani, in his
book entitled Falsafat al-tashri\` Al al-'Islam.

5. Another group, like the Shafi'i jurisprudents, followers of Muhammad
ibn Idris al-Shafi'i, regard the Book,the Sunnah, ijma\`, and qiyas
mustanbat al-illah as the sources of ijtihad. This too has been
men­tioned in Falsafat al-tashri\` fi al- Islam.

6. According to some others, like the \`ulama' of the Hanbali school,
followers of Ahmad ibn Hanbal al-Shaybani, the sources of ijtihad are:
the Book, the Sunnah and the fatwas of the Sahabah when these do not
contradict the Book and the Sunnah - even mursal and daif traditions.

7. Some others, like the \`ulama' of the Zahiri school, followers of
Dawud ibn 'All al-Zahiri al-Isfahani, restrict themselves to the Book,
the Sunnah, and ijma \`. Furthermore, they see no scope for ijma \`
after the era of the Caliphs. In the words of the second leader of this
school, Ibn Hazm al-'Andalusi al-Zahiri, anyone who claims ijma\` on
questions arising after the period of the Caliphs makes a false
statement.

It is notable that whatever has been mentioned above on the subject are
not the only viewpoints; there are many others as well. For example,
Ustadh Mubammad al-Dawalibi in his book al-Madkhal ila \`ilm usul
al-fiqh, describes the sources for inference of ahkam as: (1) the Book,
(2) the Sunnah, (3) ijma\` and (4) ijtihad. This view has been accepted
by Muhammad Rashid Rida, the renowned author of al-Wahy al-Muhammadi.
Furthermore, according to that which has been ascribed to Malik ibn Anas
al-'Asbahi the sources of ijtihad comprise: (1) the Book (2) the Sunnah
(3) ijma\` (4) qiyas, (5) istihsan (6) the principle of istislah, (7)
al-madhhab al-Sahabi, (8) sadd al-dhara’i (9) fath 'al-dhara’i, (10)
qanun al-salaf, (11) istishab, (12) istiqra' (13) bara'ah asliyyah, (14)
\`urf, (15) istidlal, etc.

However, we will confine ourselves to the above views, proceeding to
examine the impact of these different views of ijtihad and legal
deduction.

It is evident that the theoretical differences about the sources of
ijtihad should lead the jurisprudents, in the process of legal deduction
vis-a-vis new problems and developments, to adopt different courses
resulting in divergent fatawa. Hence we find different schools of
thought in the history of jurisprudence and ijtihad.

However, of the many schools of thought, only five came to be
officially recognized, namely, the Ja'fari, the Hanafi, the Maliki, the
Shafi'i, and the Hanbali. With the passage of time the others have been
abandoned and forgotten.

**The Sources of Ijtihad:**

We will now discuss and examine the sources of ijtihad, one by one, in
order to gain a better acquaintance with the basic sources for inferring
and deducing the ahkam. As indicated earlier in our discussion, the very
first source of ijtihad is the Book. Accordingly, the subject of
discussion in this article will be the Qur'an, held in common accord by
jurisprudents of all schools of thought in Islam (including, besides the
well-known five, the Zahiri, Jariri, Tamimi, Nakh\`i, Awza’i, Thawri,
Laythi, Kalbi, and other schools now extinct) as the primary source of
reference for identifying the ahkam of the Shari'ah.

If any occasional difference among the schools of thought is
dis­cernible concerning the Qur'an, it relates to opinions concerning
the interpretation of the verses, and other problems like naskh
(abrogation), tahr'if, the criteria of amr and nahy, \`amm, mutlaq, etc.
However, this procedural aspect does not affect the purpose of our
present discussion. The Holy Qur'an represents the primary source of
Divine laws and, as such, the Book has precedence over the other sources
to be consulted for obtaining the ahkam of the Shari'ah. The Qur'an has
been, and will remain - in addition to being the comprehensive source of
Divine laws - the criterion for judging traditions and ahadith.

It is on this very basis that from the time of the Holy Prophet (S)
till now and for ever, the Book remains the primary source of reference
for Islamic jurisprudents. The history of jurisprudence and ijtihad
testifies to this fact. However, when this basic source is examined from
the standpoint of ijtihad and legal deduction, certain noteworthy issues
arise. It is invariably essential to pay due attention to such matters
as fiqh al-Qur'an (juristic study of the Qur'an), the determination of
the Qur'anic verses having a bearing on legal deduction, the
determination of the muhkamat and the mutash­abihdt, the problem of
restriction (takhsis) of the general import (\`amm) of the verses by
khabar al-wahid, the legitimacy of interpreting the Qur'an in the light
of khabar al-wahid, etc. These are issues that simply cannot be ignored.
Their effect on the derivation of ahkam from the Qur'an, too, cannot be
overlooked.

**An Overview of the Ayat al 'Ahkam:**

A significant number of Qur'anic verses constitute ayat al-'ahkam
(legally relevant verses). These verses have been, and are, the basis
for deriving ahkam. Their number totals approximately five hundred.
These were gradually revealed on various occasions during the years
following the Prophet's Hijrah. Accordingly, the ayat al-'ahkam are to
be sought in the Madani verses. The ayat al-'ahkam lay down the Islamic
laws and rules concerning social, penal and economic matters. In
contrast, the Makkan verses mostly describe and prescribe doctrinal and
ethical principles.

Over the centuries, the great Islamic jurisprudents have painstak­ingly
carried out continuous research concerning the ayat al-'ahkam, and in
the course of their deductive endeavour have discovered many points of
juristic and scientific interest. Many of the results of their efforts
are now available to us.

**Initial Research Concerning the Ayat al-Ahkam:**

To know when and by whom the first investigation into the ayat
al-'ahkam was conducted is essential for familiarity with the history
and development of ijtihad. Although there is no consensus in this
regard, it is worthwhile that we recall what some scholars have opined
in this connection. 1. \`Allamah Sayyid Hasan al-Sadr, in his esteemed
work Ta'sis al. Shi'ah li al-\`ulum al-'Islamiyyah (p. 321), writes that
the first book con­cerning ayat al- ahkam was written by Muhammad ibn
Sa'ib al-Kalbi (d. 146/763). This view has been endorsed by Ibn al-Nadim
in his al-­Fihrist (p. 57), wherein he writes: "Al-Kalbi's Kitab ahkam
al-Quran has been narrated by \`Abbas ...."

2. According to some the first research in this regard was conducted by
Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi'i (d. 204/819), the founder of the Shafi\`i
school. \`Allamah Jalal al-Din \`Abd al-Rahman al-Suyuti (d.911/ 1505)
in his Kitab al- awa'il accepts this, and writes: "Al-'Imam al-­Shafi'i
was the first writer on the subject of ayat al-'ahkam."

3. According to Tabaqat al-nuhat, some scholars are of the view that
the first to write on ahkam al-Qur’an was \`Allamah al-Qasim ibn Asbagh
ibn Muhammad al-Bayyati al-Qurtubi al-'Andalusi (304/916).

Among the aforementioned claims, the one in regard to the great Shi'i
scholar Muhammad ibn Sa'ib al-Kalbi has greater validity, since his time
precedes that of al-Shafi'i and al-Qasim ibn Asbagh al-Bayyati. That
which has been claimed by al-Suyuti appears to signify his inten­tion to
mention the first Sunni writer on ayat al- ahkam. . From among the Sunni
\`ulama', 'Ali ibn Mush al-Qummi (d. 305/ 917) from the Hanafi school,
Abu Ishaq Isma'il ibn Ishaq (d. 282/895) from the Maliki, and Abu Ya\`la
Kabir (d. 458/1066) from the Hanbali, appear to be the first researchers
in this field.
