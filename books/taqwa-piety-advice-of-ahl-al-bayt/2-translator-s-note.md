Translatorâ€™s Note
=================

In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful.

All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. May the peace and
blessings of Allah be upon Muhammad and his pure progeny!

This book which discusses piety as introduced in the Holy Quran and the
Sunnah and recommended by Ahl al-Bayt (PBUT) was given to me for
translation into English by the honorable manager of Ansarian
publication, Mr. Hajj Muhammad Taqi Ansarian, a devotee of Ahl al-Bayt.
For this reason, I should really thank him for his good choice.

The translation of this book is dedicated to my dear daughter Aida as
well as my dear son Arya, for their love of Ahl al-Bayt (PBUT).
