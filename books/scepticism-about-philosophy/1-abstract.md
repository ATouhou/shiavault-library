Abstract
========

Suppose a person who is agnostic about most philosophical issues wishes
to have true philosophical beliefs but equally wishes to avoid false
philosophical beliefs.  I argue that this truth-seeking, error-avoiding
agnostic would not have good grounds for pursuing philosophy.
Widespread disagreement shows that pursuing philosophy is not a reliable
method of discovering true answers to philosophical questions.  More
likely than not, pursuing philosophy leads to false belief.  Many
attempts to rebut this sceptical argument fail.
