o Who needs to take this subject?

1. If you wish to take academic courses in Islam, especially in
analytical Fiqh, this is a must for you.

essays,
3. If you are seeking more insight about the second important source of
knowledge in Islam, i.e. Hadith.
o What are the prerequisites for this subject? Completion of
"Introduction to Islamic Studies 1" (Islam for Beginners) is compulsory
for enrolment of this course. That course -especially lessons 7 to 9-

this course. Completion of the "Sciences of the Quran"

We also strongly recommend the completion of the "Islamic Theology"

The course will be presented in English. However, as the original texts
of the Hadiths are in Arabic, basic Arabic literacy would help for a
better understanding of the Hadith's analysis.

**Chapter 2: Meeting 1 Definition, Signifigance, Branches**


Meeting 1: Definition, Significance, Branches Abstract:

Definition

'Hadith' literally means a new word or thing, the antonym of which is
'Qadim' meaning 'old'. The plural form of Hadith is 'Ahadith'. Thus, the
Holy Quran in this sense is a 'Hadith', nay 'the best Hadith'. The
Almighty Allah has referred to the Quran in several Ayaat as 'Hadith'.
[For instance see: 52:34, 53:59, 39:23]

'Hadith' in the expression of Muslims as well as in this study is the
quotation of the saying, the action or the confirmation of the Prophet
of Islam (P). The Shi'a extend the meaning of the 'Hadith' to include
that of Fatima al-Zahra (s.a) and the 12 Imams of Ahlul-Bayt (a.s).
Their sayings also include their verbal or written words. It also
includes all their words whether their addressees are people or God such
as their supplications. The Sunnis usually extend the meaning of the
Hadith to include the sayings of the Companions of the Prophet (P) as
well as the Companions of the Companions (Taabe'een).

Hadith is sometimes called 'Rewayah' (quoted), 'Khabar' (news), 'Sunna'
(tradition and the way of life) and 'Athar' (report). Hadith is usually
translated in English into 'narration'.

Hadith and Hadith Qodsi

Hadith is different from the Hadith Qodsi (Holy saying) in that Hadith
is the saying of the Ma'soom that he by divine inspiration or revelation
utters in explanation of the religious matters. Hadith Qodsi is the
Words of God that a Prophet quotes from the Almighty Allah. Hadith Qodsi
is free from the challenge of miracle and it is not part of the Quran.
The examples of Hadith Qodsi are quotation of Prophet David (a.s),
Prophet Moses (a.s) and Prophet Muhammad (P) from God. For instance, the
Prophet of Islam (P) said: "The Almighty Allah says: Fasting is mine and
I reward it (or I am the reward of it)."[^2]

Proofs for the Significance of Hadith in Islam

**1. Rational proof**

The holy Quran is the first and the most important source of knowledge
in Islam. Nonetheless, the holy Quran includes only the general
principles of the prosperity of man in here and in the hereafter. It is
for this reason that Muslim scholars whether Shia or Sunni asserted that
the complete denial of the Hadith and the claim of 'the Book of Allah
suffices us' will lead to nothing other than distortion of Islam and
denial of the necessary aspects of Islam. Therefore, to understand the
major portions of Islam one has no choice but to be well acquainted with
the Sunna of the Prophet (P) and the Imams of Ahlul-Bayt (a.s).

**2. Quranic Proofs**

To practice and adhere to the Quran necessitates referring to the
Hadith. The Almighty God in various Ayaat has referred the Muslims to
the Sunna of the Prophet (p). The following Ayaat are some examples in
which the explanations of the details of the religion is left to the
Prophet of Islam (p):

a. "Whatsoever the Messenger gives you take it and whatsoever he
forbids you abstain (from it)." 59:7
b. "Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is only a revelation
revealed." 53:3-4
c. "And We have sent down unto you that you may explain clearly to them
what is sent down to them and that they may give thought." 16:44
d. "Indeed in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example to
follow." 33:21
e. "Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and obey those of you who are in
authority (the Imams of Ahlul-Bayt)." 4:59
f. "Allah wishes only to remove all evil deeds from you O Family of the
Prophet and to purify you with a thorough purification." 33:33
3. Prophetic Recommendations for Protection and Memorization of the
Hadith:

The followings are some examples:

a. Recommendations for Narrations of Hadith: "Know the status of people
to us according to their narrations from us." Narrated from Imam Sadiq
(a.s).[^3]

Imam Sadiq (a.s) narrated from his father (Imam Baqir a.s), "My dear
son. Know the status of the Shi'a according to their narrations and
knowledge. For surely the knowledge is understanding of the Hadith and
by understanding the Hadith a believer will be elevated to the highest
level of faith." [^4]

The Prophet of Islam (p) on the day of Mina said, "May Allah bloom the
face of a slave of God who hears my words and understands them and pass
it those who did not hear it. So, how many people who transfer knowledge
without understating it, and how many people who transfer knowledge to
the one who is more learned than them." [^5]

Muawieh Bin Ammar said to Imam Sadiq (a.s), "There is a person who
narrates so many Hadith from you and spreads it among people. He makes
the hearts of your followers strong. On the other hand, there is another
worshipping person who is also one of your followers but does not
narrate that many Hadith from you. Which one is more virtuous? The Imam
replied, 'The one who narrates many of our Ahadith and distributes them
among people and strengthens the hearts of our followers is more
virtuous than one thousand worshippers."[^6]

b. Recommendations for the writing of the Hadith: The Prophet of Islam
(p) said, "Whoever writes from me a knowledge or a Hadith so far as that
knowledge or Hadith remains a reward will be written for him."[^7]

A man from Ansar (the habitants of Madina who helped the Migrants) used
to attend the sessions of the Prophet (p), listen to his sermons in awe,
yet he could never remember the sermons of the Prophet (p) after he
left. When he complained to the Prophet (p) the Prophet (p) said
pointing to the man's hand, "Seek the help of your hand i.e. write my
words down."[^8]

c.Recommendations for the Memorization of Forty Hadith: Imam Kadhem (p)
quoted from the Prophet of Islam (p): "Whoever Muslim memorizes forty
Hadith that Muslims need in the matter of the religion on the day of
Judgement the Almighty God will raise him as a learned scholar."[^9] The
Prophet of Islam (p) in his recommendations to Imam Ali (p) said, "O
Ali! Whoever from my Ummah memorizes forty Hadith seeking by that the
pleasure of the Almighty God and the Hereafter, the Almighty God will
associate him on the Day of Judgement with the Prophets and the truthful
and the witnesses and the righteous people, and how good associates are
they."[^10]

Such Ahadith have been the motivation of tens of scholars throughout
history to compile books named al-Arbaeen (Forty Hadith) such as the
Arbaeen of the Late Sheikh Bahaei and the Arbaeen of the Late Imam
Khomeini.

d.The tradition of the earlier learned Muslims: Jabbir Bin Abdullah
al-Ansari heard that Abdullah Bin Anis has heard a Hadith from the
Prophet (p) concerning being unfair to people, the Hadith that Jabbir
had no knowledge of. He purchased a camel and travelled for a month to
find Abdullah in Damascus only to hear the Hadith directly from Adbullah
and return home! It is narrated from Abu Qolabeh Basri (died in 104 AH)
that he resided in Madina for three years to hear a Hadith from the main
narrator of it.[^11]

As important as the Hadith is, unfortunately it has not always been
preserved in its immaculate origin. Thus, it has also become the source
of all sectarianism and divisions in Islam. This is a very controversial
topic with which we shall deal in the next lesson.
