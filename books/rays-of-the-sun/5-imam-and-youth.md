Imam and Youth

The importance of youth
-----------------------

* *  
 It was at the end of the Iranian year 1367, the beginning of *Sha’ban*,
that I went to see the Imam.  The *Mafatih* was in his hand and he
wanted to read the specific supplications for the month of *Sha’ban*. 
When I went to kiss his hand and get permission to leave, he said:
“Whatever work you want to do, do it in your youth.  In old age, you
will only sleep and moan.”[^1]  
    
*Hujjatul Islam Masih Burujurdi (Imam’s grandson)*

Service to the people in youth
------------------------------

   
 Sometimes when we went to see the Imam, we asked him: “If it’s possible
please give us advice.”  Usually Imam would give us this advice:  
    
 “As much as possible, serve the people in every way (and) perform all
acts of worship in your youth.  Know the value of youth because once you
reach my age, you will not be able to do any thing.  Like me who cannot
do anything.”[^2]  
    
*Imam Bahauddini az A’zaaye bayte*  
  

Youth and effort in Salaat-ul-Layl
----------------------------------

* *  
 In the days that I was with the Imam and had the opportunity of serving
him, he never left *Salaat-ul-Layl*.  Those who were with him before,
even those who were his peers and room mates, narrate that the Imam
endeavoured in *Salaat-ul-Layl* from the beginning of his youth when he
was busy in studies.[^3]  
    
*Ayatullah Ghulamridha Ridhwani*  
  

Whilst you are young
--------------------

   
 In the year 1965, one night in the days that Imam had recently been
dismissed from the hospital, I was sleeping next to the Imam.  He still
had the state of a convalescent; despite all this he got up for
*Salaat-ul-Layl*.  Whilst doing *wudu*, because he couldn’t perform
*masah* (wiping) of the feet as it was difficult for him, he leant on my
shoulder and said: “So-and-so.”  I said: “Yes.”  He said: “Worship Allah
whilst you are young.  When you become old, you will not be able to,
like me.”[^4]  
    
*Hujjatul Islam Tawassuli*  
  

Have some recreation
--------------------

* *  
 When Imam would see that I was busy studying on holidays, he would say:
“You will not get anywhere, because at the time of recreation, you must
be at leisure.”   
    
 He used to emphasize this to my son.  This narration is the promise of
Imam himself, which in my presence he repeatedly told my son: “I did not
substitute one hour of recreation for studies, nor one hour of studies
for recreation.”   
    
 He set aside time for specific things.  Imam advised my son to set
aside time for recreation.  If you don’t have recreation, you cannot
prepare yourself for studying.[^5]  
    
*Zahra Mustafavi (Imam's granddaughter)*  
  

We arranged social meetings
---------------------------

* *  
 Imam did not neglect social gatherings with friends, and considered a
social gathering to be the source of a type of help and training of the
mind and preparation of it.  One day, he himself said:  
    
 “During my youth, no Thursday or Friday would pass except that we would
arrange social gatherings with friends. We would leave Qom and mostly
head towards Jamkaran[^6].  When it snowed or rained, we busied
ourselves with social programs in my room and when we would hear the
sounds of the *mu’adhin*, all of us used to stand for prayers.[^7]
