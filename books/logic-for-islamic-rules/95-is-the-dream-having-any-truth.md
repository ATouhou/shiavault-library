Is the Dream Having Any Truth?
==============================

**Question:** Sometime dream scrolls are released by the caretakers of
the Prophets shrine. These scrolls prohibit people to commit sinful acts
and in addition to this it also informs about the progeny of the Prophet
(a.s.) that the reappearance of Imam-e-Zaman (a.s.) is going to be
within a year. Is there any truth about such publications?

**Answer:** Unfortunately the above evil act is being done by the
enemies of Islam since many years. Every year the caretakers of the
Prophets shrine see a new dream while they do not have any personal
merit. They issue a new date for the reappearance of Imam-e-Zaman
(a.s.). When the dream is proved wrong they see another dream.

Apparently these falsifiers of dreams, on the basis of their defective
beliefs intend to create doubts in the reappearance of Imam-e-Zaman
(a.s.) so that simple-minded people are influenced by this propaganda.
But they are ignorant of the fact that Muslims (however simple minded
people they may be) never pay attention to these concocted things. In
any case even if someone really has such dreams, it is certainly not
reliable from the religious point of view.
