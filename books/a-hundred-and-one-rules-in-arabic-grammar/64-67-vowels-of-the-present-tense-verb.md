67. Vowels of the Present Tense Verb
====================================

There are three important vowels you need to take note of when you
conjugate any Arabic verb from past tense to the present tense. These
include:

**1.** The Subject marker vowel, which is the first vowel of the verb;

**2.** The Stem Vowel, which is the vowel that goes on the second
radical/consonant of the root;

**3.** The Mood Marker Vowel, which is the last vowel of the verb.
