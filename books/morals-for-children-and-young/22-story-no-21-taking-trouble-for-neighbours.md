Story no. 21: Taking trouble for neighbours
===========================================

Mohsin said to his father and mother “I love playing with a ball. But
every time I combine my friends together to play at 2:00 after Zohr, our
neighbours say “Don’t play now, It’s resting time”. Mother, father, can
you tell our neighbours not to be a trouble for me?”.  
 His father, Aqa Ibrahim said “My dear son, the neighbours have the
right to rest after Zohr. In that case if you want to play, you can take
your friends to the park and play there”.  
 Mohsin replied “Thank you very much for your advice, father.”
