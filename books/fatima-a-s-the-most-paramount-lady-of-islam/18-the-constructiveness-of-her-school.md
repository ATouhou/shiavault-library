The Constructiveness of Her School:
===================================

Through studying the world of Fatima (peace be upon her) , we can build
up our character, and as a result, attain independence, grant values,
and high esteem. Fatima’s life and school are full of exaltation and
direction.

Fatima’s outlook, her divine and human character, perception and
knowledge, mission and responsibility are life-giving and wholly
constructive and instructive on the condition that her character and
picture be drawn well, and no mistakes occurs.

The power of this construction is so that it can set us free from
uselessness and hollowness, make up for our evident and concealed
fiasco, illustrate the way of victory and elevation, and grant us
happiness, moderation, tranquility, and peace of mind.
