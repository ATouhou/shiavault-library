Du'a on sighting the new moon of Ramadhan
=========================================

The new moon of Ramadhan is special to Muslims. It announces the start
of the holy month and the beginning of the blessings and mercy
associated with Ramadhan. According to the Holy Prophet (s) whoever sees
the new moon of Ramadhan should recite the following Du'a.[^1]

*In the name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful.*

My Lord and your Lord is Allah,

Lord of the worlds

O Allah let the new moon bring us,

peace and faith

safety and submission

and a hastening towards what you like

and are pleased with.

O Allah bless us in this month of ours,

and give us of its good,

and its assistance

Keep us away from its harm,

and its evil,

its difficulties,

and its trials.

Du'a on sighting the new moon of Ramadhan
-----------------------------------------

Allah has decreed that Muslims use the movement of the moon to determine
the passing of months and years. When the early Muslims were asked about
the new moon, Allah revealed a verse saying:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يسئلونك عن الأهلة قُل هى مواقيت للناس والحج
  </p>
</blockquote>

***They ask you concerning the new moons. Say; they are times appointed
for (the benefit of) people, and (for) pilgrimage. (2:189)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ربي وربُك الله
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
رب العالمين
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اللهم اهله علينا بالأمن والإيمان
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
والسلامة والإسلام
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
والمُسارعة إلى ما تُحب وترضى
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اللهم بارك لنا في شهرنا هذا وارزقنا خيره وعونه
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
واصرف عنا ضره وشره
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وبلائه وفتنته
  </p>
</blockquote>
