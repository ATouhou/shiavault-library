Main Pillars of the Islamic Code of Education
=============================================

The Islamic Message is composed of several parts which are
interrelated, complimentary to each other and in perfect harmony. These
parts are the covering concepts, legislations and directives.

In Islamic doctrine, concept is inseparable from legislative texts,
ethical values or worldly ideas and thoughts. It is composed of all
above-mentioned elements which are gathered and operate in fine
harmony.

Therefore, our subject Education In Islam' is interrelated with the
Islamic view of man, universe and life. Furthermore, it covers human
conducts, standards and goals. This is the starting point of exploring
the fundamental sources of Islamic knowledge and concepts, where the
main pillars and milestones of the Islamic education code and its policy
for human upbringing are defined. When it is preceded with such a study
exercise it would lead to the following deductions:

1. Islamic education code recognizes the fact that people possess pure
natural instincts, and have equal response to good and evil. This
reality is revealed in the following verse of the holy Qur'an:

"By the soul, and that which shaped it and inspired it to understand
sin and piety. (Indeed) successful is he who keeps it pure and ruined is
he who corrupts it."

Holy Qur'an (91:7-10) "So set thy face to the true religion, the nature
made by Allah in which He has made mankind; there is no altering of
Allah's creation; that is the right religion; but most people know it
not." Holy Qur'an (30:30)

A tradition from the Prophet (s.a.w.) says:

"Babies are born with their natural instincts, it is the parents who
turn them Fire-worshipers, Jews and Christians.
[ 8 ]

Imam Ali (a.s.) says in this regard:

"Certainly the heart of a youngster is similar to an empty land it
accepts (makes grow) whatever is strewn on it."1 2. Environment and
genes factors have positive and negative effects on people's
personalities and life, Allah, the Highest says:

"And Even so We did not send any Warner into a township but those who
led easy lives in it said: Indeed we found our fathers upon a course,
and we are following upon their footprints. " Holy Qur'an (43:23)

The Prophet (s.a.w.) pointing out the role of genes in the formation of
human characters said: "Be careful when choosing a wife, for (maternal)
uncles have bearing on babies' chararteristics."2 He also said:

"Offer for marriage those who are equivalent, get married of them, and
be selective when choosing a marriage partner."3

3. Basic motives and instincts exist within all people, but have
different magnitudes with respect to strength or weakness. Hence, it is
acknowledged that people possess various potentialities such as
intelligence, noble characters etc.... Islam takes this fact into
consideration in its education process and observes this reality when
shouldering people with responsibilities and duties.

[ 9 ]

4. Since every human being possesses the will and choice of selection,
he or she would be held responsible for his! Her actions. They would be
accounted for their deeds and would receive relevant reward or
punishment in the Hereafter, any person is able to correct his! Her
stands, triumph over carnal desires and overcome adverse conditions,
although, he! She would be free to indulge in evil doings and go
astray.

"and pointed out to him the two conspicious ways"
Holy Qur'an (90:10)

"Nay, man is evidence against himself, even though he puts, forth his
excuses." Holy Qur'an (75:14, 15)

Imam as-Sadiq says in this regard:

"No compulsion or (complete) freedom, it is a middle point (for man)
between these two extremes" 1 5. Education is a process of refining
human character and building a pleasing personality that would help
enhance good motives and uproot or curb negative manifestations.
Knowledge is a guiding light in life to do constructive work and in turn
educate others, while seeking knowledge solely for the purpose of its
possession is not encouraged by Islam. Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq (a.s.)
says:

"Knowledge is akin to practice, whoever learns would work and whoever
works gets learned; Knowledge calls for work, otherwise it goes away."
2

6. Furnishing a model practical code of Islamic values and ethics is an
important part of constructive Islamic education. Such an example would
provide the society with a visual portrait, add dynamism to thoughts and
concepts, induce people to be keen adherents, and encourage the mixing
of principles with concepts.

"Certainly you have in Allah's Apostle an excellent examplarâ€¦" Holy
Qur'an (33:21)

"These are they whom Allah has guided; so follow their guidance." Holy
Qur'an (6:90)

7. Learning lessons from other people's mistakes: Allah, the Highest
says:

"Have they not journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those
before them?" Holy Qur'an (12:109)

"Have they not journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those
before them? They were stronger than these in might and they dug up the
earth and built upon it more than these have built and there came to
them their apostles with clear signs; and (surely) Allah never wronged
them, but they wronged themselves." Holy Qur'an (30:9)

Imam Au (a.s.) says in this regard to one of his sons:

"So, I hastened to mould you properly before your heart hardened up and
your mind became preoccupied, so that you might be ready to accept
through your intelligence the result of the experience of others and be
saved from going through these (bitter) experiences yourself Now you can
very easily make use of all the knowledge which men have to acquire with
great care, trouble and patience. Things which were hidden from them and
which any experiments, experiences and sufferings could bring to light
are now made very conveniently and easily available to you (through
these advices)."1

8. Education is generally a personal and social responsibility:

"0 you who believe guard yourselves and your families against a fire
whose fuel is people and stones..." Holy Qur'an (66:6)

----------------------------------------------------
(1) Nahjul-Balagha: Letter 31, Imam Au's (a.s.) advice to one of his
Sons (Muhammad Hanafiya)

[ 11 ]

"And from among you there should be a party who invite to good and
enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and these it is that shall be
successful." Holy Qur'an (3-104)

The above mentioned are thus the most important pillars of the Islamic
education structure, from which planning and codes are inspired.


**Goals Of Islamic Education**


Islamic education aims at developing people's talents and inspiring
lofty ethical values in them. These goals are the main foundation on
which Islamic civilization, society and people's personalities are
built. Therefore, a constructive educational system and realizing it
through parents, teachers, schools, state, social reformers etc. is of
paramount importance in Islam. These goals can be summarized as
follows:

1. Making people discover their innate talents, so that they would
evaluate themselves, the universe and society in which they are living.
Hence, people would be conscious of their duties, rights, meaning of
existence and their relation to life and the universe.

2. Making people conscious of the Creator on a basis of rational
understanding, so that healthy relationships would flower, helping to
build believers' personalities and induce in them a correct vision of
life and the Hereafter.

3. Implanting in people a harmonious relationship with the universe and
strengthening human ties by developing aesthetic tastes. This would
breed the ability to differentiate between good and evil concepts, so
that the required effect, with respect to consciousness, behaviour and
positive stands, is achieved.

4. Creating a systematic Islamic thinking which leads people to conform
in every thought and deed, according to the Islamic code.

5. Building a balanced personality possessing within its domain
material, spiritual and conceptual elements on a harmonial basis.

[ 12 ]

6. Developing all human resources in order to be employed for the
betterment of mankind.

7. Guiding people to scientific methods of thinking, learning and
knowledge acquisition. Children and youth should be aided and encouraged
to acquire knowledge, expertise and specialization in various fields.

8. Mobilizing people to participate in building Islamic society and
life, and provide them the chance of living in the shade of an Islamic
system.

9. History of Muslim Ummah should be properly scrutinized, written in a
clear sincere style, freed of any political motives in order to make
known to the new generations, their exalted heritage. This would instill
in them good examples, self-respect and correct appreciation of our
grand culture.

10. Grooming children and youth and training them to take a lead in
various social activities in order to master specialized roles. Such
talents should be invested in calling people to the message of Allah,
the message of virtue and peace. 11. Developing fraternity and
brotherhood among Muslims and stressing on sincerity in belief,
community and the Islamic Urnmah in large.

These are the most outstanding goals of a scientific Islamic education.
Several institutions and parties participate, each according to their
ability and responsibility, to achieve the set aims.


**Islam's Concern For Education**

All heavenly messages have placed a special emphasis on people's
education in order to properly develop their natural instincts and
bestow on them happiness in this world and the Hereafter. Islam is the
final and greatest of all divine messages. Hence, its profound interest
in the upbringing of mankind.

"0' You who believe guard yourselves and your families against afire
whose fuel is men and stones, and over which are angels stern and strong
who disobey not Allah in what He commands them and do what they are
commanded." Holy Qur'an (66:6)

[ 13 ]

In the above mentioned verse, Allah, the Glorious, commands believers
to properly educate themselves and their families, so that there would
be virtuous people and families which constitute the Islamic society.

Naturally believers had responded and continue to respond and are
profoundly influenced by that call. It is narrated that Imam as-Sadiq
(a.s.) once said:

"When this verse 0 you who believe guard yourselves and your families
against a Fire.... was revealed, one of the believers sat weeping and
said, I was unable to cope with myself, and now I have been burdened
with my family.' " The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) replied:

"Command your family by whatever commands you follow and withhold from
your family whatever you withhold from yourselves."1 It is narrated that
Imam Ali (a.s.) when explaining the meaning of this verse, said: "Teach
yourselves and your families virtue and good conduct". 2

There are many traditions and directives which reveal Islam's concern
with the upbringing of children. "Once a man came to the Prophet (s.a.
w.) and said: "0

Messenger of Allah, what is my duty toward my son. He replied, "Give
him a fine name, good education and put him in a suitable place."3

It is also narrated from the Prophet (s.a.w.)

"Train your children in swimming and sharp-shooting"4

Imam Au (a.s.) gave one of his sons (Muhammad al-Hanafiya) some
valuable educational directives. These gems of advice are indeed guiding
lights for all Muslims in every age and era in bringing-up their
children.

[ 14 ]

Following we quote some parts of his lengthy advice, preserved in
Nahjul-Balagha:

"0 my son, when I noticed that I was getting old and when I felt
(bodily) weakness gradually creeping over me, I hastened to advice you
lest death overtakes me before I divulged to you what I have in my
heart, or lest weakness finds its way to my mind as was the case with my
body, or you fall a prey to inordinate desires and worldly deceits,
which may make you stubborn and untrained.

Certainly the heart of a youngster is similar to an empty land, it
accepts whatever is strewn on it. So I hastened to mould you properly
before your heart hardened up and your mind became preoccupied, so that
you might be ready to accept through your intelligence the result of the
experience of others and be saved from these (bitter) experiences
yourself Now you can very easily make use of all the knowledge which men
have to acquire with great care, trouble and patience.

Things which were hidden from them and which any experiments,
experiences and sufferings could bring to light are now made very
conveniently and easily available to you (through these advices)."

"0' my son, even though I have not reached the age which those before
me have, yet I carefully looked into their deeds and contemplated over
events of their lives. I walked among their relics and ruins till I was
as one of them. I felt as if I have lived with them from the first to
the last one. Therefore I know what brought them good and what brought
harm to them. Hence (in these pages) 1 have selected for you from every
subject its essence, the choicest, and kept away from you their useless
points.

Being a kind father I took care to educate you and develop a noble
character at an early age when you are entering a new stage of the
world, possessing upright intention and clean heart. I should begin
teaching you the Book of Allah (to whom belongs Might and Majesty) and
its interpretation, the laws of Islam and its commands, the lawful
matters and the unlawful matters (mentioned) in it."1

Imam Ali Zain-ul-Abideen (a.s.) the fourth infallible Imam of the
Prophet's Household says in one of his supplications:

----------------------------------------------
(1) Nahjul-Balagha. Letter No. 31.
"0 Lord bestow upon me safety of my children, reform their conduct for
my sake, and please me with their company. 0 Lord prolong their age for
me, increase periods of their destiny, bring up the young

[ 15 ]

ones, strengthen the weak among them and endow them with health, faith
and manners. Protect them, their souls, bodies, senses and every matter
of your concern and their interest."1

It is evident from the above statements that Islam has given great care
and attention to children's education. A child's education in Islam
starts even before its birth. It begins with parental ties and continues
along with the embyro in the mother's womb and when the baby is born it
gradually assumes practical shape, progressing through the stages of
childhood, youth, adolescence and finally maturity. It is the most
perfect education process ever, not found in any other system, school of
thought and religion. Islam endeavors to bring up normal children in a
healthy atmosphere and gives comprehensive supervision at all stages of
their development.

Family psychological atmosphere is given due attention in order to
create welcoming feelings for new babies and implant loving ties among
family members. Children are encouraged to love and respect their
parents while parents are incited to bear children and take
responsibility for their upbringing.

A narration from the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) says:

"One of the blessings for a man is to have a virtuous"2

It is also narrated from Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq (a.s.) that:

"Girls are good deeds while boys are grace to their parents, good deeds
deserve reward from Allah while grace requires thanks to Him."3

The eighth infallible Imam of the Prophet's Household, Imam Au bin Musa
al-Ridha (a.s.) says in this regard: "Blessed is he who sees his heir
before passing"4

[ 16 ]

Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (a.s.) the fifth Imam says:

"If you intend to bear a baby, then say when you cohabit with your
wife; 0 Allah, endow me with a pious child without any extra parts or
defects in his! her creation and endow him/ her a good destiny."1

Abu-Basir has narrated that Imam al-Baqir (a.s.) once asked:

"If any of you intend to get marry, do you know what to do?! replied in
the negative. Then he said: when you are getting married pray two
Rak'ah, then praise Allah, the Almighty, the Glorious and say; 0 Allah,
I want to get married, let my choice be the chastiest of women, who
safeguards herself and my wealth, be fortunate in life, and bears me a
good child who would be my heir in my life and after death."2

Therefore in light of the above traditions children's education in
Islam depends on the following:-

1. Virtuous mothers and nurses should be the base, because they are the
first source of inspiration and have a profound influence on children.

2. Children should have good psychological set up when they grow up in
a healthy family atmosphere, full of love, affection, warmth and
kindness.

3. Children's welfare with respect to their psychology, material needs,
belief, conduct should be properly taken care of, all along their
development till they reach maturity.

There are several traditions from the Prophet which provide guidance to
Muslims on how to educate and bring up their children, taking proper
care of all their aspects whether material, intellectual, psychological
or behavioral.

What a wonderful code of education Islam has! In Islam education
practically starts at childbirth when the Adhan (prayer call) and Iqamah
are pronounced in the right and left ears respectively of the newborn.

-----------------------------------------------
(1) al-Kulaini. al-Kafi, Vol. 6, p. 10.
(2) al-Kulaini. al-Kafi. Vol. 5. p. 501.

[ 17 ]

The first words a child's ears receive in this world are of Tawheed
(Monotheism), thus making its ties stronger with the Creator. The
Messenger of Allah himself performed the above-mentioned act when his
grandsons Hasan and Husain, were born to his daughter, Fatimah (a.s.).
The Prophet's example is followed to this day by Muslims all over the
world. Books of Tradition record the Prophet's statement as follows:

"He to whom a child is born should call adhan in the (newborn's) right
ear and Iqamah in the left ear for it is an insurance against the
(temptations) of Satan." 1

The moral and spiritual side of children's education is then given due
attention, helping them to develop their personalities, acquire
self-respect and pay heed to their values. A good name also has a
soothing effect on a child's budding personality. It is for this reason
the Prophet encouraged Muslims to choose the best names for their
babies.

It is narrated that a man once approached the Prophet (s.a.w.) and
said:

"0 Messenger of Allah, what is my duty toward my son. He (s.a. w.)
replied:

"Give him/her a fine name, good education and put him/ her in a
suitable place."2

Furthermore, mothers are encouraged to nurse their babies and give
suckle. Today science has proved that mothers' milk is the most suitable
food for infants which prevents disease from them and keeps them in good
health.

What science is finally beginning to acknowledge was testified 1400
years ago by Imam Ali (a.s.). He says:

"Mothers' milk is the safest and of greatest value for sucklings."3

Islamic teachings caution against entrusting children to the care of
sick and ill-mannered wet nurses, as a measure for protecting children
from contacting bad habits. The Messenger of Allah said:

--------------------------------------------
(1) al-Kulaini, al-Kafl, Vol. 5, p. 24.
(2) al-Kulaini. al-Kafi, Vol. 5, p. 48.
(3) al-Kulaini, al-Kafi, Vol. 5, p. 40.

[ 18 ]

"Do not entrust your child to a stupid wet-nurse, for milk is
infectious. Children tend to become imbalanced and foolish because of
stupid nurses."1

Imam All (a.s.) said:

"Look who nurses your children, for their milk would influence
children's personalities."2

Education continues with children as they progress from childhood to
adolescence. Imam Jaf'ar as-Sadiq (a.s.) says:

"Let your child play till he is seven years, teach him for the next
seven years, and closely supervise him for another seven years; He would
either be successful or leave him to his fate."3

Then he added:

"Converse with your children on Islamic subjects, otherwise deviated
ideas may find ways to their minds."4

Islam lays stress on psychological training, where it induces feelings
of security, love and affection toward children, so that they would not
fall prey to hatred and embitterment. For this reason, the Prophet said:
"Whoever kisses his child, Allah will write for him a good deed; whoever
pleases his child, Allah will please him on the Day of Resurrection; and
those who teach their child Qur'an, Allah will dress the parents (in the
Hereafter) in suits, whose brightness will light the faces of people in
Heaven."

He further said:

"Love children and be kind to them, fulfill promise to them; as they
consider you to be their sustainer."5

[ 19 ]

A saving from Imam as-Sadiq (a.s.) runs:

"Allah grant great mercy for a father who dearly loves his child." 1
Thus it is the parents who shoulder responsibility for their children's
Islamic education. Any neglect on their part in performing this duty
which may lead to children's deviation and going astray, is considered a
breach of parental duties.
