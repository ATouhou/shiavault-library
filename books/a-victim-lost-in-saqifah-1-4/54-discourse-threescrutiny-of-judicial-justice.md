Discourse Threescrutiny of Judicial Justice
===========================================

Double standards in judgment
----------------------------

### 1 – Two ways of dealing – with Zahra and Jabir bin Abdullah Ansaari

“Bukhari narrates in Sahih:

Ayesha says that Zahra demanded from Abu Bakr her inheritance – the
Fadak and the rest of the amount of Khums. But Abu Bakr refused to pay.
Zahra got angry and retired to her house. She never spoke to Abu Bakr
until she died.**[1]**

It is interesting that Bukhari writes:

After passing away of Prophet, Jabir bin Abdullah claimed that the
Prophet had promised him to give him certain amount.

Abu Bakr put his hand inside and gave to Jabir again and again. Each
time he gave five hundred dirhams and he did this thrice.**[2]**”**[3]**

This double policy of the Caliph is surprising: He did not accept the
claim of Zahra to inheritance, who is infallible according to the
testimony of verse of Quran and he asked her to present witnesses whom
also he rejected later, but he accepted the claim of Jabir bin Abdullah
Ansaari without asking for any witness regarding Prophet’s promise.

“Bukhari and Muslim have narrated from Jabir bin Abdullah Ansaari: When
revenue from Bahrain was brought to Abu Bakr I was present there. I said
to Abu Bakr: The Prophet had told me that when the revenue from Bahrain
came he would give me something from it.

Abu Bakr told Jabir to go and pick up what the Prophet had promised.

You see that the Prophet has passed away, Jabir claims that the Prophet
had promised him a certain amount from Bahrain revenue. After his death
the revenue comes. Abu Bakr has succeeded the Prophet. Jabir goes to Abu
Bakr and narrates a story to him. Abu Bakr believes him and pays him the
amount he wants.

Vol. 3, Pg. 104  
**[2]** Quoted from: *Sahih Bukhari,* Vol. 4, Tr. 889  
**[3]** Sayyid Muhammad Hasan Jawahiri: *Abu Bakr,* Pg. 53

Commentators of Bukhari and Muslim in their books justify the act of Abu
Bakr in his making the payment from public funds without a witness or
swearing.

The book Al-Kawakib al-Durari Fi Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari of Kermani, the
most reliable commentary on Bukhari, writes:

Abu Bakr believed the word of Jabir because of the Prophet. He had
warned that if anyone said a lie on his behalf he would have a seat of
fire in the next world. Therefore it was not possible for a companion of
Prophet to lie and accept fire for himself.**[1]** There was great
likelihood that Jabir told the truth. Well, why is such a possibility
not considered with regard to Zahra? She was the daughter of Prophet and
she was infallible. Her position was far greater than that of Jabir, who
was only a companion of the Prophet.

New let us see what Ibn Hajar Asqalani says in Fath al-Bari:

This tradition proves that the word of a just companion of the Prophet,
individually, should be accepted though it may be profitable to
him.**[2]**

For this reason, Abu Bakr did not demand a witness.

Zahra said that the Prophet had bestowed to her the Fadak. So why such
difference between the two claims – one his only daughter and another
only his companion among so many?

Ayini says in his book Umdat al-Qari Fi Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari: Jabir is
a just man according to the proof of Quran and traditions. Therefore Abu
Bakr did not demand a witness. It is not likely that a Muslim would lie
on the Prophet, what to say of a companion!**[3]**

How is it that Abu Bakr accepted the claim of Jabir but did not accept
the claim of Zahra?

Was she lesser than Jabir?

Would she lie about the Prophet? You do not presume that a Muslim would
attribute lie to the Prophet.

What is the difference between the two claims?

Why the claim of Zahra is rejected inspite of the rules and witnesses?

the claim of Jabir is accepted without any witness!!”**[1]**

### 2 – Double Standard Treatment between Son of Amr Aas and Ubadah bin Samit

With regard to justice of Umar it is said:

“Umar was so dignified that he could stop any insurgency. Muhammad son
of Amr Aas was a victor and governor of Egypt. During the governorship
of Amr Aas a horse race was held. In this race someone else was riding
the horse of Muhammad. In the race a horse resembling Muhammad’s won.
Muhammad was present there. He presumed his horse won the race. He said:
By the Lord of Kaaba my horse was ahead of all.

The real owner of the horse, an Egyptian, shouted: By God of Kaaba it
was my horse that won. Muhammad bin Amr Aas became angry and scourged
him with the lash he was holding and said: Take this. I am a noble. The
Egyptian went to Umar and complained. Umar called Amr Aas and his son to
Medina. Umar asked the Egyptian to take the lash and beat the noble’s
son. Then he asked Amr Aas why he treated people like slaves when they
were born free?”!**[2]**

It seems that Umar had forgotten the case of Ubadah bin Samit who had
beaten up a man and broken his head. The complaint went to Umar who took
the side of Ubadah and without obtaining the consent of plaintiff
ordered a penalty to be paid.

At that time Zaid bin Thabit was present who reminded him that he was
favoring of his slave to lash his own brother. Therefore he imposed
penalty instead of lashing.**[3]**

Still they claim:

“Umar always held justice in his view above everything. He executed
justice without any consideration.”**[4]**

The incidents narrated here show double standards and that justice
depended upon his policies.

“When he gave his lash to the Egyptian to scourge Muhammad bin Amr Aas,
he said: O, Amir! Are you satisfied now? Is your heart pleased now?

In this way he accused Umar of taking revenge from him and his father
for personal reasons.**[1]**”**[2]**

### 3 – Different Treatment between the Son of Amr Aas and Mughaira bin Shoba

Historical documents indicate that Mughaira was the first to address
Umar as Lord of Believers and he greeted**[3]** Umar with this title. He
was appointed by Umar as the governor of Basrah and he remained in this
post for a long time.

Abu Bakra**[4]** was from Thaqif tribe who had embraced Islam when
soldiers of Prophet surrounded Taif. Abu Bakra together with his two
brothers, Nafe and Ziyad from his mother deposed to Umar to stone
Mughaira for adultery. The fourth witness was a person named Shaml bin
Ma’bed.

All three gave evidence according to religious standard for Mughaira’s
sin, but Umar by some trick or other treated the case in such a way that
the evidence given by three Muslim was not established as authentic.
Thus he rescued him from death.

“When Ziyad arrived and entered the mosque, elders of Muhajireen and
Ansaar came and gathered around him. Umar saw Ziyad and said: God will
not belittle any man from Muhajireen by the tongue of Ziyad.**[5]**

[Ziyad got the message and gave evidence in a way, which exonerated
Mughaira.]

Mughaira was saved from death and Umar was glad**[6]** and shouted: God
 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[1]** [It was perhaps on the basis of this argument that Amr Aas said:
“Curse be on the time when I served as a governor of Umar.”](Najah Ata
at-Tai: *Saqifah,* Pgs. 100; quoting from: *Sharh Nahjul Balagha,* Vol.
1, Pg. 58)]  
 **[2]** Najah Ata at-Tai: *Nazaryaat al-Khaleefatain,* Vol. 2, Pgs.
208  
**[3]** Some are of the view that Amr Aas has used this appellation for
the Caliph (Najah Ata at-Tai: *Nazaryaat al-Khaleefatain,* Vol. 2, Pg.
240)  
**[4]** [Nofiya bin Harith]  
**[5]** Quoted from: *Wafayaat al-Ayaan,* Vol. 2, Pg. 406  
**[6]** [Umar’s dealing in this case shows that he had a hidden aim in
carrying out or not carrying out the death penalty. His insistence on
punishing Khalid bin Waleed in the case of Malik bin Nuwairah was not
obedience to religious rules but to obtain political power, which Umar
was after. He wanted to remove Khalid from the way as he

is greater. All shouted along with him. Then Umar scourged the three
witnesses but not Ziyad…**[1]**”**[2]**

Allamah Askari narrates from Ibn Abdul Barr that Umar admitted to
Mughaira during Hajj rituals:

“I swear by God I don’t think Abu Bakra had lied about you.”**[3]**

Yet Umar rescued him, which was against justice while Mughaira deserved
punishment according to religious law and God’s decree. Still they say:

“In Umar’s view the governor was an individual like others. He too is
subject to punishment as others according to God’s Rule.”**[4]**

“Although he was a ruler of a wide and extended country he was a shrewd,
astute and a clever man in executing justice in all cases.”**[5]**

“Umar bin Khattab used to mention this in public. He said: Now I am the
Caliph. I will be serious, severe, harsh and hard towards tyrants and
wrongdoers. With regard to good people and pious, I will be kind and
affectionate.”!**[6]**

Ignoring Calls of Oppressed
---------------------------

While it is claimed:

“He (Umar) made himself available to every victim, no matter however low
a station he was from.”!**[7]**

“In investigating disputes he was to the extreme extent particular.
Wherever one approached to him for justice he used to stand then and  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

considered him a strong rival.]**

thereon the spot and dispense justice.”!**[1]**

Historical documents show how inattentive Umar was in complying with
petitions calling on him for justice:

“Ahnaf bin Qais narrates: On the occasion of a great victory we went to
Umar to congratulate him.

Umar asked: Where have you lodged?

We told him such and such place. He got up and came with us to see the
place of our lodging. We rode our horses. The horses were too tired,
because they had run long.

Umar said: Why didn’t you fear God when you rode the horses? Don’t you
know that they have a right upon you? Why didn’t you show mercy to them?
Had you come alone they would have grazed.

We replied: We are returning from victory and we hurried to congratulate
you and Muslims.

Then he returned and we too accompanied him.

In the meantime, a man approached him and demanded justice from him as
he had become a victim of someone’s tyranny.

Umar immediately raised the cane and hit him on his head saying: When
Umar is at your disposal you have no business with him, but when he is
busy in attending Muslim affairs you come to him asking for justice.

The man went away angry…”**[2]**

Does this incident not show that Umar, who was so anxious about horses
that are animals, was not at all anxious about human beings – especially
the oppressed? Animal meant to him more than a man.

The judgment is upon you.

but the attitude of the Caliphs portrayed in history is against these
claims.
