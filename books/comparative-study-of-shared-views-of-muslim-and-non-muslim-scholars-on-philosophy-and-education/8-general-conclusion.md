General Conclusion
==================

A general glance at all of the chapters of this book and the
philosophical and educational ideas of Muslim and Non-Muslim scholars
investigated in this book revealed that any thinker, in any part of the
world, and at any time in history - after comprehensive and deep
contemplation over subjects such as ontology, anthropology,
epistemology, axiology, and other educational points - despite a few
differences, had reached similar conclusions.

These shared aspects could be considered and applied as a model or
pattern offered by some of the most important philosophers of the world
for everyone. These can be a real source of inspiration for the
formulation of new philosophical theories, and for affecting the
learning and behavior of the inhabitants of the world. Such an approach
would be surely be a source for achieving a scientific and intellectual
unity that would be a factor in preventing conflicts and differences
among different societies.
