Ayat no.  5-9
=============

***In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful***  
***A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful. That you may warn a people
whose fathers were not warned, so they are heedless. Certainly the word
has proved true of most of them, so they do not believe. Surely We have
placed chains on their necks, and these reach up to their chins, so they
have their heads raised aloft. And We have made before them a barrier
and a barrier behind them, then We have covered them over so that they
do not see. (36:5-9)***  
*** ***

Holy Prophet shown all ways and kingdoms
----------------------------------------

This Quran, which is full of intelligence and wisdom, is the Word of the
Lord of the Worlds Who is needless of His creation. But it is the demand
of His Mercifulness that he shows man the right and true path so that
man may fear his falling down (into Hell) from the Sirat Bridge (in the
Hereafter). “That you may warn a people…” So, O Prophet! Frighten by
this Quran those, whose forefathers were not warned, and hence they
remained unaware.

I have already said that it denotes the intervening period between two
prophets. For six hundred years before the arrival of the Holy Prophet
(‘s), they did not have any prophet to warn them.  
***…so they are heedless.***  
*** ***  
 But then God did a favor upon man and sent His Light or Radiance in the
form of Muhammad (‘s). God showed all the paths to Muhammad (‘s)
including this world and the Hereafter, the angels, the Dominion and
Paradise and Hell so that he may warn the creation. He showed the Divine
Kingdom to the Holy Prophet during the Night of Ascension so that he may
warn the people.

Meccan polytheists being people of hell, news from the unseen
-------------------------------------------------------------

   
***Certainly the word has proved true of most of them, so they do not
believe.***  
*** ***  
 That is, your truthfulness became indisputable. What is meant by this?
At the beginning of creation God addressed Satan:  
    
***Get out of this (state), despised, driven away; whoever of them will
follow you, I will certainly fill hell with you all. (7:18)***  
*** ***  
 This proved true in the case of most of them (People of Mecca) that
they would go to Hell. This verse is one of the Divine secrets or
prophecies from the unseen that, according to Quran, these polytheists
will not believe till their last and will not follow Muhammad (‘s).  
    
***…so they will not believe.***  
*** ***  
 That is they are not believers. How is it so? Let us read on and it
will soon become clear.

Yokes in necks and barriers both in front and behind
----------------------------------------------------

   
***Surely We have placed yokes on their necks, and these reach up to
their chins, so they have their heads raised aloft.***  
***And We have made before them a barrier and a barrier behind them,
then We have covered them over so that they do not see. (36:8-9)***  
*** ***  
 These verses either relate to Qiyamat or they are by way of example.
Despite all kinds of warnings, they did not fear and hence We gave this
punishment to them. This is the apparent meaning of these two verses. A
deeper pondering is needed here.

Most of the commentators have mentioned three reasons. One: That these
two verses pertain to the Hereafter. That it would happen thus in
Qiyamat. Another aspect is that it is by way of example; that it is a
parable; that nothing of this kind is actual but their condition is like
that of a man tied from neck to chin by chains and whose face is up in
the air, they cannot understand anything.

But the third aspect, which appears better, is like this: It is a truth
among practical truths. What has been mentioned will appear before us
with out present physical bodies. Yokes are placed around you. You
cannot comprehend anything.

Barriers are set before you eyes. Behind your back is another big
screen. This meaning is explained in another description as to what is a
“yoke?” If this word is understood, everyone will himself follow what it
denotes.

Passions and aspirations make one blind and deaf
------------------------------------------------

We have iron yokes around our necks. Thus we cannot see what is before
our feet, obviously. But this holy verse pertains to the truth and is
aimed at our soul and heart. One is unable to see in any direction as
the yokes have restricted his senses.

The yokes are, in a sense, fallen on our heart and soul in such a way
that it makes us raise our heads up in bewilderment. It can be said that
these yokes are our desires and aspirations, longings of passion and
love for material world, power, and lust. Wherever they arise they make
one blind as well as deaf.

Everyone whom his passions, desires and aspirations have blinded and
deafened does not see what is in front of him. In front of him is his
house in the grave; he sees everything except his grave “before them”.

Everyone who looks into himself and looks justly finds a similar rank in
himself. The ignorant and careless think about everything except their
own death. They are afraid of everything but a death of disbelief.

He also does not see what is behind him. He has forgotten all his
sins.  
 Most truly and appropriately, God owns up and says, *“We* did it.”  
    
***And We have made…***  
*** ***  
 We decided it, but it were you only who desired it. God gives
everything to you and you compromised the Hereafter for this world.

God releases water for Firaun also
----------------------------------

There is a narration in Majlisi’s *Hayat-ul-Quloob* regarding Firaun.
The people said, “You claim divinity since a long time. The waters of
Nile have dried up. Since you claim to be God, make the waters of this
river run again.” Firaun said, “All right, I will do so.”

He came out of the city with his army. In the desert, he told his
soldiers, “Remain in your place until I myself come out and make the
river flow.” Then he hastened to a remote place from where he could not
be seen by anyone and where no one was present.

He dismounted from his horse threw down his crown, fell on the ground
headlong and said, “O Lord of the Worlds! I know very well that I am a
liar. But I do not want the Hereafter. I desire only this worldly
kingdom. Do not disgrace me. My God! I know that everything is in Your
Power. I beg You make the waters of this river flow again.” Soon the
water began to flow.

Do not be amazed that He grants anyone his or her heartfelt desires.
Firaun himself said, “I want the world and I do not need the Hereafter”,
just as Satan did not want the Hereafter and desired that he should live
in this world till the Day of Judgment.

No one is dejected in His court
-------------------------------

Implicitly, no one should say that resumption of water was due to the
waywardness of man; it is not so. Common sense says that it is not the
work of human beings. God is extremely merciful. He does not deprive
even His enemies.

No one returns empty handed from His court. So one should say, “O God!
Who did not deprive even Firaun who claimed to be god, when he came to
Your Court bowing down before You, today we are your guests, observing
fasts and we have come to Your house (Mosque).

Please remove the yokes around our hearts. These yokes have dragged us
down and do not allow us to think about the Hereafter. Passions and
desires have chained us, but Thou art Merciful. Be kind to me! How will
you deprive the friends when You don’t even reject the foes?
