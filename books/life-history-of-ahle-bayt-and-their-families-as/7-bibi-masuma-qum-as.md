8th Imam, aunt of 9th Our Imam - great respect to this lady surrounded
by Imams.

**Imam Jafeer as-Sadiq (as), A Brief Look into his Life**

This is an account of the Imam who was in charge (al-qai'im) after Abu
Ja'far Muhammad b. Ali, peace be on them, (including) who his mother
was, the date of his birth, evidence for his Imamate, his age, the
period of his succession (to the Imamate), the time of his death, the
place of his grave, the number of his children, and a brief outline of
the reports about him.

Al-Sadiq Ja'far b. Muhammad b. Ali b. al-Husayn, peace be on them, was
out of all his brothers (the one who was) the successor (khailfa) of his
father, Muhammad b. Ali, peace be on them, his testamentary trustee
(was'i), who was in charge of the Imamate (al- qa'im bi-al-imama) after
him. He stood out among their group for his great merit (fadl); he was
the most celebrated, the greatest in rank and the most illustrious of
them in (the eyes) of both the non-Shia (al-amma) and the Shi'a
(al-khassa).

The people transmitted on his authority the religious sciences which
travellers carried with them (around many countries) and thus his fame
was spread throughout the lands.

The learned scholars have transmitted on the authority of no other
member of the House (ahl al-bayt) as much as they have transmitted on
his authority. None of them met as many of the reporters of traditions
(ahl al-athar wa-naqalat al-akhbar) as he did, nor did the latter
transmit on their authority to the same extent as they transmitted on
the authority of Ab-u Abd Allah (Ja'far b. Muhammad), peace be on him.

The specialists in tradition (ashab al- hadith) have gathered together
the names of those who narrated on his authority, who were reliable
despite differences in views and doctrines and they were four thousand
men. The clear evidence for his Imamate, peace be on him, was such that
it overcame (men's) hearts and silenced (the attempts of) an opponent to
denigrate it with doubts.

He was born in Medina in the year 83 A.H. (702) and he, peace be on
him, died in (the month of) Shawwal in the year 148 A.H. (765) at the
age of sixty-five. He was buried in (the cemetery of) al-Baqi' alongside
his father, his grandfather and his (great-great) uncle, al- Hasan,
peace be on them.

His mother was Umm Farwa, the daughter of al-Qasim b. Muhammad b. Abi
Bakr. His Imamate, peace be on him, lasted for thirty-four years. His
father, Abu Jafar (Muhammad b. Ali), peace be on him, clearly gave him
the trusteeship (of the Imamate) and gave him an explicit designation
(nass jali) for the Imamate.

It was five years after the Muslims had accompanied the Prophet
(PBUH&HF) and his family in the migration (Hijrah) to Medina, when the
Holy Prophet's daughter, Hadrat Fatima (AS), gave birth to a little
girl.'

When her father, Imam Ali (AS), saw his daughter for the first time
Imam Husayn (AS), who was then almost three years old, was with him. The
boy exclaimed in delight,

"O father, Allah has given me a sister."At those words Imam Ali (AS)
began to weep, and when Husayn (AS) asked why he was crying so, his
father answered that he would soon come to know.

Fatima (AS) and Ali (AS) did not name their child until a few days
after her birth, for they awaited the Prophet's return from a journey so
that he could propose the name. When finally the baby girl was brought
before him he held her in his lap and kissed her. The Angel Jibra'il
came to him and conveyed the name that was to be hers, and then he began
to weep. The Prophet (PBUH&HF) asked why Jibra'il wept and he
answered,

"O Prophet of Allah. From early on in life this girl will remain
entangled in tribulations and trials in this world. First she will weep
over your separation (from this world); thereafter she will bemoan the
loss of her mother, then her father, and then her brother Hasan. After
all this she will be confronted with the trials of the land of Karbala
and the tribulations of that lonely desert, as a result of which her
hair will turn grey and her back will be bent."

When the members of the family heard this prophecy they all broke down
in tears. Imam Husayn (AS) now understood why earlier his father had
also wept. Then the Prophet (PBUH&HF) named her Zaynab (AS).

When the news of Zaynab's birth reached Salman al-Farsi, he went to Ali
(AS) to congratulate him. But instead of seeing him happy and rejoicing
he saw Ali (AS) shed tears, and he too was apprised of the events of
Karbala and the hardships that were to befall Zaynab (AS).

One day, when Zaynab (AS) was about five years old, she had a strange
and terrible dream. A violent wind arose in the city and darkened the
earth and the sky. The little girl was tossed hither and thither, and
suddenly she found herself stuck in the branches- of a huge tree.
But-the wind was so strong that it uprooted the tree.

Zaynab (AS) caught hold of a branch but that broke. In a panic she
grabbed two twigs but these top gave way and she was left falling with
no support. Then she woke up. When she told her grand father, the
Prophet (PBUH&HF), about this dream he wept bitterly and said,

"O my daughter. that tree is me who is shortly going to leave this
world. The branches are your father Ali and your mother Fatima Zahra,
and the twigs are your brothers Hasan and Husayn. They will all depart
this world before you do, and you will suffer their separation and
loss."

Zaynab (AS) shared with-her brothers and sister the extraordinary
position of having such examples to look up to, emulate and learn from,
as her grand father, the Prophet of Allah (PBUH&HF) her mother Fatima
(AS), daughter of the Prophet, and he'r father Imam Ali (AS),
cousin-brother of the Prophet. In the pure environment that enveloped
her she absorbed the teachings of Islam that her grandfather imparted,
and after him her father. Here too she learnt to master all household
skills with great proficiency.

She had barely attained the tender age of seven when her beloved mother
passed away. Her mother's death had closely followed her cherished grand
father's passing away. Some time later Imam Ali (AS) married Umm
ul-Banin, whose devotion and piety encouraged Zaynab (AS) in her
learning.

Whilst still a young girl she was fully able to care for and be
responsible for the running of her father's household. As much as she
cared for the comforts and ease of her brothers and sisters, in her own
wants she was frugal and unstintingly generous to the poor, homeless and
parentless. After her marriage her husband is reported as having said,

"Zaynab is the best housewife."From very early on she developed an
unbreakable bond of attachment to her brother Imam Husayn (AS). At times
when as a baby in her mother's arms she could not be pacified and made
to stop crying, she would quieten down upon being held by her brother,
and there she would sit quietly gazing at his face. Before she would
pray she used to first cast a glance at the face of her beloved
brother.

One day Fatima (AS) mentioned the intensity of her daughter's love for
Imam Husayn (AS) to the Prophet (PBUH&HF). He breathed a deep sigh and
said with moistened eyes,

"My dear child. This child of mine Zaynab would be confronted with a
thousand and one calamities and face serious hardships in Karbala."

Zaynab (AS) grew into a fine statured young woman. Of her physical
appearance little is known. When the tragedy of Karbala befell her in
her midfifties she was forced to go out uncovered. It was then that some
people remarked that she appeared as a 'shining sun' and a 'piece of the
moon'.

In her character she reflected the best attributes of those who raised
her. In sobriety and serenity she was likened to Umm ul-Muminin Khadija,
her grandmother (AS); in chastity and modesty to her mother Fatima Zahra
(AS); in eloquence to her father Ali (AS); in forbearance and patience
to her brother Imam Hasan (AS); and in bravery and tranquility of the
heart to Imam Husayn (AS). Her face reflected her father's awe and her
grandfather's reverence.

When the time came for marriage, she was married in a simple ceremony
to her first cousin, Abdullah ibn Ja'far Tayyar. Abdullah had been
brought up under the direct care of the Prophet (PBUH&HF). After his
death, Imam Ali (AS) became his supporter and guardian until he came of
age. He grew up to be a handsome youth with pleasing manners and was
known for his sincere hospitality to guests and selfless generosity to
the poor and needy.

Together this young couple had five children, of whom four were sons,
Ali, Aun, Muhammad, and Abbas, and one daughter, Umm Kulthum.

In Medina it was Zaynab's practise to hold regular meetings for women
in which she shared her knowledge and taught them the precepts of the
Deen of Islam as laid out in the Holy Quran. Her gatherings were well
and regularly attended. She was able to impart the teachings with such
clarity and eloquence that she became known as Fasihah (skillfully
fluent) and Balighah (intensely eloquent).

In the thirty-seventh year A.H. (after Hijrah), Imam Ali (AS) moved to
Kufa to finally take up his rightful position as khalifah. He was
accompanied by his daughter Zaynab (AS) and her husband. Her reputation
as an inspiring teacher among the women had preceded her. There too
women would throng to her daily sittings where they all benefitted from
her erudition, wisdom and scholarship in the exegesis of the Qur'an.'

The depth and certainty of her knowledge earned her the name given to
her by her nephew, Imam Ali Zayn ul-Abidin (AS), of 'Alimah Ghayr
Mu'allamah, 'she who has knowledge without being taught'.

Zaynab (AS) was also nicknamed Zahidah (abstemious) and 'Abidah
(devoted) because of her abstemiousness and piety. She found little of
interest in wordly adornments, always preferring the bliss and comfort
of the Next World over that of this world. She used to say that for her
the life of this world was as a resting place to relieve fatigue along a
journey.

Humble and of high morals, her main concern was to strive to please
Allah and in doing so she avoided anything which was the least bit
doubtful.


**Janabe Fatema Zahra (as)**

This Great Lady was the only daughter of the Holy Prophet (saww) and
Hazrat Khadijah. She was born in Makkah on Friday, 20th Jamdi-ul-Akhar
in the 5th year after the declaration of Prophethood (615 AD).

She was married to the great personality, the 1st Imam, Imam Ali (as).
The marriage ceremony took place on Friday, 1st Zilhajj 2 AH. As a
daughter, she loved her parents very much. As a wife, she was very
devoted. As a mother, she cared for and brought up wonderful children
that they have left marks on the face of the world.

On Fasting She Said:Imam Sadiq (as) says on the authority of his
forefathers that J. Zahra (as) had said that: "The man who is observing
a fast would not gain anything, when his tongue, ears, and limbs are not
safe from sin."

House hold affairs:In the whole world, there was only one house that
was free from impurities and that house was of Imam Ali (as) and J.
Zahra (as). She being the leader of all the women of the world, she was
the torch bearer of the ideals and character of woman hood.

J Zahra (as) never used to take household duties as a chore for a
woman. In the performance of domestic duties, she had faced many
obstacles and hardships.

The Infallible daughter of the Holy Prophet (saww) was conscious of her
responsibilities and aware that a wife could shape the direction of her
husband's activities. Her thinking was that the home is the place of
refuge. A place of peace for a man, when he comes back tired from his
struggles and dealings with the outside world. A place to re-strengthen
his energy and also to gain in him fresh confidence and determination,
so that he could be able to tackle his duties.

Imam Musa Al Kadhim (as) says: "The crusade of a woman is to have
concern and regard for the husband."

**Bibi Sakina (as)**

Sakina was the youngest daughter of Imaam Hussain. She was a vivacious
child, full of love and happiness. Everyone loved Sakina. She was also a
very religious girl. She enjoyed reading the Holy Quraan and never
missed her prayers. From the age of two she took great care to make sure
that her head and face were properly covered when in public.

Sakina was Imaam Hussain's most beloved child. Our Imaam was often
heard to say, "A house without Sakina would not be worth living in!" She
always had a sweet and cheerful smile and a very friendly nature. Other
children sought her company as much as the grown ups did. She was very
generous and always shared whatever she had with others.

There was a special bond between Hazrat Abbas and Sakina. He loved her
more than he did his own children. If Sakina requested for anything,
Abbas would not rest until he satisfied her request. There was nothing
that Abbas would not do to make Sakina happy.

During the journey from Madina to Mecca and then Mecca to Kerbala,
Abbas was often seen riding up to the mehmil in which Sakina sat to make
sure that she had everything she wanted. Sakina loved her uncle just as
much. While in Madina she would, several times a day, visit the house in
which Hazrat Abbas lived with his family and his mother, Ummul Baneen.

Like any other four-five year old when Sakina went to bed at night she
wanted to spend some time with her father. Imaam Hussain would tell her
stories of the prophets and of the battles fought by her grand-father
Ali. She would rest her head on her father's chest and Hussain would not
move from her until she fell asleep.

When from the second of Muharram the armies of Yezid began to gather at
Kerbala, Hussain said to his sister Zainab, "The time has come for you
to get Sakina used to going to sleep without my being there !". Sakina
would follow her father at night and Hussain had to gently take her to
Zainab or Rubaab.

At Kerbala when from the seventh Muharram water became scarce Sakina
shared whatever little water she had with other children. When soon
there was no water at all, the thirsty children would look at Sakina
hopefully, and because she could not help them she would have tears in
her eyes. Sakina's lips were parched with thirst.

On the Ashura day, she gave her Mashk to Hazrat Abbas. He went to get
water for her. The children gathered round Sakina with their little
cups, knowing that as soon as Hazrat Abbas brought any water, Sakina
would first make sure that they had some before taking any herself. When
Sakina saw Imaam Hussain bringing the blood drenched 'alam she knew that
her uncle Abbas had been killed. From that day on Sakina never
complained of thirst.

Then came the time when the earth shook and Sakina became an orphan!
But even then she always thought of the others first. She would console
her mother on the death of Ali Asghar and when she saw any other lady or
child weeping Sakina would put her little arms around her.

Yes Sakina never again asked anyone for water. Bibi Zainab would
persuade her to take a few sips, but she herself would never ask for
water or complain of thirst!!!!

From the time when Imaam Hussain fell in the battle field, Sakina
forgot to smile! Kufa saw her as a sombre little girl lost in thought.
Quite often she would sit up at night. When asked if she wanted
anything, she would say, "I just heard a baby cry? Is it Asghar? He must
be calling out for me!"

Knowing that her weeping upset her mother, Sakina would cry silently
and quickly wipe away her tears! In the prison in Shaam she would stare
at the flock of birds flying to their nests at sunset and innocently ask
Bibi Zainab, "Will Sakina be going home like those birds flying to their
homes?"

Then one dreadful night Sakina went to bed on the cold floor of the
prison. For a long time she stared into the darkness! The time for the
morning prayers came. Sakina was still lying with her eyes wide open.
Her mother called out: "Wake up, Sakina! Wake up, it is time for
prayers, my child!" There was only the painful silence! Our fourth Imaam
walked up to where Sakina lay. He put his hand on her forehead. It was
cold! He put his hand near the mouth and the nose. Sakina had stopped
breathing. In between sobs Imaam Zain ul 'Abideen said:

"INNA LILLAHI WA INNA ILAYHI RAAJI'OON!"How was Sakina buried ? Zainab
held the still child as Imaam Zain ul 'Abideen dug a grave in the cell.
As the grave was being filled up after the burial the mother let out a
scream! How could anyone console Bibi Rubaab? What could they say? They
huddled around her, and the prison walls began to shake with the cry:
"YA SAKINA, YA MAZLOOMAH!!" Bibi Rubaab put her cheek on Sakina's grave
and cried out:

"Speak to me, Sakina! Only a word, my child! Speak to me!!"
