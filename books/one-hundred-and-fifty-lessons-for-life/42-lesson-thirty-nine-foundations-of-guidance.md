Lesson Thirty Nine: Foundations of Guidance
===========================================

Imam al-Jawad (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلْمُؤْمِنُ يَحْتاجُ إلى ثَلثِ خِصَال: توفيقٌ مِنَ اللّه، وَ وَاعِظٌ
مِنْ نَفْسِهِ، وَ قَبُولٌ مِمَّنْ يَنْصَحُهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The believers require three qualities: divine success, a preacher from
the heart and soul, and acceptance from advisers.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

In this life, man travels a path which has much acclivity and declivity
and faces innumerable dangers which threaten to derail him. To succeed
and become a useful and effective individual in the society, he firstly
needs a spiritual relation with God whereby he is supported by God’s
pure essence, and then an aware and informed conscience advising him
inwardly, and then hearing ears imbibing the thoughts, guidance, advice
and consultation of others.
