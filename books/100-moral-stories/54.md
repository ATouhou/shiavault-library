HOPE AND GREED
Caliph Haroon Rashid desired that any one who had seen the Holy

Prophet (SAW) in his lifetime be brought before him. After some time

a very old woman was brought before the Caliph. The Caliph asked the

old woman, “Did you see the Prophet yourself?” She said, “Yes! Sir.”

The Caliph then asked her if she remembered any narration from him.

She said yes and said, “When old age comes two things become young,

one is hope and the other is greed.” The Caliph thanked her and gave her

one hundred dinars. The woman thanked Caliph and she was taken back.

Half the way some thought passed through her mind and she desired

to be brought before the Caliph once more. When she was shown in, the

Caliph asked, “Well, why have you come back?” She said. “I just came to

inquire whether the monies you gave me were once for all or is it to
continue every year?”

The Caliph thought. “How true is the Prophet’s (SAW) word?” she has hope
of life even now and

she has greed for money too. The Caliph said, “Don’t worry; you will be
paid every year.”

She was taken back but on the way she breathed her last.
