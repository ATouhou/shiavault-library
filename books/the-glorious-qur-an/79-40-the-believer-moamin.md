40: the Believer (moamin)
=========================

This chapter was revealed after the previous one on Throngs 39, and
before the next, [Signs] Spelled Out 41. It initiates a fresh series of
seven chapters, each of which bears the initials H.M. as its opening.
Chapter 40 is laid out in nine sections arranged in 85 late Meccan
verses, except for VV. 56-57 (in section VI) which may be from Madina.
The title is derived from the believing man " in Pharaoh's court who
appears in VV. 28 ùóó 30 (IV) or alternately, from Forgiving, the first
word in V.3 (and last in V.41).
