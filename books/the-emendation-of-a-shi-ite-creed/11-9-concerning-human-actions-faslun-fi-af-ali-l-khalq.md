9. Concerning Human Actions (faslun fi af‘Ali 'L-khalq)
=======================================================

However, it is an established fact that the Book of Allah, the Exalted,
takes precedence over the traditions and reports. Hence it should be the
touchstone for determining the genuine reports and the fabrications. (If
this fact is admitted), then whatever the Qur’an approves is absolutely
true, and should be followed and that alone.

Now, the Almighty says:

***Who has created all things well, and He originated the creation of
man out of clay [32:7].***

So He declares that whatever He has created is good and far from being
abominable; had He created abomin- able actions, He would never have
characterized them as praise- worthy actions. Moreover, the affirmation
that what Allah has created is good refutes the assumption of those who
maintained that Allah is the Creator of base actions.

The Almighty also says:

***Thou seest not in the creation of the All-merciful any imperfection
[67:3],***

and since unbelief and falsehood are defects, so also is
self-contradictory speech; how, then, can they attribute human actions
to Allah, knowing that they are full of defects and contradictions, when
Allah Himself denounced and rejected such attributions, and affirmed
that: Thou seest not in the creation of the All-merciful any
imperfection.
