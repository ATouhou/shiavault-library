The Intercessor and Interceder
==============================

**The Intercessor and the Interceder-** **الشفيع والشافع**

1. The intercessor is the wing of the seeker [which helps him attain
what he seeks].

> 1ـ الشَّفيعُ جَناحُ الطّالِبِ.

2. The interceder of a criminal is his humility in seeking pardon.

> 2ـ شافِعُ الْمُجْرِمِ خُضُوعُهُ بِالْمَعْذِرَةِ.

3. The interceder of a sinner is his admission (of guilt), his
repentance and his apology.

> 3ـ شافِعُ الْمُذْنِبِ إقْرارُهُ، وتَوْبَتُهُ اِعْتِذارُهُ.

4. The interceder of mankind [on the Day of Reckoning] acting upon the
right and adhering to the truth.

> 4ـ شافِعُ الْخَلْقِ العَمَلُ بِالْحَقِّ، ولُزُومُ الصِّدْقِ.
