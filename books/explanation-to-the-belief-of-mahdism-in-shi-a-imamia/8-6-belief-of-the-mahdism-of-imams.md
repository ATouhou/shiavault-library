6. Belief of the Mahdism of Imams
=================================

The writer’s claim is groundless as he says that all the Imams since the
victory of Abbasids were regarded as Mahdi and that their death was not
taken for granted and that their return was held in a constant
expectation and a fervent anticipation. Yes, there was one incident in
which the seventh Imam, Musa Ibn Ja’far, died in prison where he was
being held by the orders of Haroon Al-Rasheed. Some refused to
acknowledge him dead. They consoled themselves by fancying Mahdism in
him, which naturally entailed a waiting for his reappearance.

In their grief they imagined that he would soon reappear. It is likely
that some mischievous elements might have injected such a pang into
their minds. There were very few who went wrong; and the wrong itself
was so evident that it could not deceive many more. The Shia believed in
the demise of the Imam, from Ali to the eleventh one Hasan Askari. Why
not take evidence from history.

Later those few who had believed in Imam Musa Ibn Ja’far’s reappearance
realized their mistake and acknowledged his death. In the case of the
sixth Imam Ja’far Al-Sadiq, he himself time and again declared that he
was not Mahdi the awaited one. The qualities of Mahdi he had repeatedly
disclosed.
