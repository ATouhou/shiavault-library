</blockquote>

Hadith n. 3
-----------

**3. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Miserliness is shame;
cowardice is a defect; poverty disables an intelligent man from arguing
his case; and a destitute person is a stranger in his home town.

Hadith n. 6
-----------

**6. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The bosom of the wise
is the safe of his secrets; cheerfulness is the bond of friendship;
effective forbearance is the grave of short-comings.

**It is narrated that Amir al-mu'minin said in expressing this meaning
that**: Mutual reconciliation is the covering for shortcomings; and he
who admires himself attracts many opponents against him. [^2]

> 6. وَ قَالَ عليه ‏السلام: صَدْرُ الْعَاقِلِ صُنْدُوقُ سِرِّهِ وَ

Hadith n. 9
-----------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَعَارَتْهُ مَحَاسِنَ غَيْرِهِ وَ إِذَا أَدْبَرَتْ عَنْهُ سَلَبَتْهُ

</blockquote>

Hadith n. 12
------------

**12.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The most helpless
of all men is he who cannot find a few brothers during his life, but
still more helpless. is he who finds such a brother but loses him. [^7]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اكْتِسَابِ الْإِخْوَانِ وَ أَعْجَزُ مِنْهُ مَنْ ضَيَّعَ مَنْ ظَفِرَ

cannot even be reproved. [^8]

Hadith n. 16
------------

**16. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** All matters are
subject to destiny, so much so that sometimes death results from effort.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَكُونَ الْحَتْفُ فِي التَّدْبِيرِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 17
------------

**17.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, was asked to explain the
saying of the Messenger of Allah:** Banish your old age (by hair-dye)
and do not acquire resemblance to the Jews.

**Amir al-mu'minin replied:**

The Prophet (S) said this at a time when the religion was confined to a
few, but now that its expanse has widened and it is firmly settled
everyone is free in his action. [^9]

> 17. وَ سُئِلَ عليه ‏السلام عَنْ قَوْلِ الرَّسُولِ ( صلى‏الله‏عليه
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
‏وآله ‏وسلم): غَيِّرُوا الشَّيْبَ وَ لَا تَشَبَّهُوا بِالْيَهُودِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَقَالَ عليه‏السلام: إِنَّمَا قَالَ (صلى‏الله‏عليه‏ وآله ‏وسلم) ذَلِكَ
وَ الدِّينُ قُلٌّ فَأَمَّا الْآنَ وَ قَدِ اتَّسَعَ نِطَاقُهُ وَ ضَرَبَ
بِجِرَانِهِ فَامْرُؤٌ وَ مَا اخْتَارَ .
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 18
------------

**18. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said about those who avoided
fighting on his side**: They abandoned right but did not support
wrong.[^10]

> 18. وقال عليه السلام في الذين اعتزلوا القتال معه: خَذَلُوا الْحَقَّ،
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلَمْ يَنْصُرُوا الْبَاطِلَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 19
------------

**19. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** He who gallops with
loose rein collides with death.

> 19. وقال عليه السلام : مَنْ جَرَى فِي عِنَانِ أَمَلِهِ عَثَرَ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بِأَجَلِهِ .
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 20
------------

**20. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Forgive the
shortcomings of people of virtue and honor because when they fall into
error Allah raises them up.

> 20. وقال عليه السلام : أَقِيلُوا ذَوِي الْمُرُوءَاتِ عَثَرَاتِهِمْ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَمَا يَعْثُرُ مِنْهُمْ عَاثِرٌ إِلاَّ وَيَدُهُ بِيَدِ اللهِ
يَرْفَعُهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 21
------------

**21.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The consequence
of fear is disappointment and of bashfulness is frustration. Opportunity
passes away like the cloud. Therefore, make use of good opportunities.
[^11]

> 21. وقال عليه السلام : قُرِنَتِ الْهَيْبَةُ بِالْخَيْبَةِ وَالْحَيَاءُ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بِالْحِرْمَانِ وَالْفُرْصَةُ تَمُرُّ مَرَّ السَّحَابِ، فَانْتَهِزُوا
فُرَصَ الْخَيْرِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 22
------------

**22. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said** We have a right. If it
is allowed to us well and good, otherwise, we will ride on the hind part
of the camel (like lowly people) even though the night journey may be
long.

> 22. وقال عليه السلام : لَنَا حَقٌّ، فَإِنْ أُعْطِينَاهُ، وَإِلاَّ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
رَكِبْنَا أَعْجَازَ الاْبِلِ، وَإِنْ طَالَ السُّرَى.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** This is a very fine and eloquent expression.
It means that if we are not allowed our right we will be regarded
humble. This sense comes out from this expression because on the rear
part of the camel only slaves, prisoners or other people of this type
used to ride. [^12]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال الرضي: و هذا من لطيف الكلام و فصيحه و معناه أنا إن لم نعط حقنا كنا
أذلاء و ذلك أن الرديف يركب عجز البعير كالعبد و الأسير و من يجري
مجراهما.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 23
------------

**23. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** He whose deeds accord
(him) a back position cannot be given a front position because of his
lineage.

> 23. وقال عليه السلام : مَنْ أَبْطَأَ بِهِ عَمَلُهُ لَمْ يُسْرِعْ بِهِ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حَسَبُهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 24
------------

**24. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Rendering relief to
the grief-stricken and providing comfort in hardship are among the means
of atonement for great sins.

> 24. وقال عليه السلام : مِنْ كَفَّارَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ الْعِظَامِ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِغَاثَةُ الْمَلْهُوفِ، وَالتَّنْفِيسُ عَنِ الْمكْرُوبِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 25
------------

**25. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** O son of Adam, when
you see that your Lord, the Glorified, bestows His favours on you while
you are disobeying Him, you should fear Him. [^13]

> 25. وقال عليه السلام : يَابْنَ آدَمَ، إِذَا رَأَيْتَ رَبَّكَ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
سُبْحَانَهُ يُتَابِعُ عَلَيْكَ نِعَمَهُ وَأَنْتَ تَعْصِيهِ
فَاحْذَرْهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 26
------------

**26. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Whenever a person
conceals a thing in his heart it manifests itself through unintentional
words from his tongue and (in) the expressions of his face. [^14]

> 26. وَ قَالَ عليه‏السلام: مَا أَضْمَرَ أَحَدٌ شَيْئاً إِلَّا ظَهَرَ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فِي فَلَتَاتِ لِسَانِهِ وَ صَفَحَاتِ وَجْهِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 27
------------

**27. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said**: Keep walking in your
sickness as long as you can. [^15]

> 27. وقال عليه السلام : امْشِ بِدَائِكَ مَا مَشَى بِكَ

Hadith n. 28
------------

**28. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The best
abstemiousness is to conceal it.

> 28. وقال عليه السلام : أَفْضَلُ الزُّهْدِ إِخْفَاءُ الزُّهْدِ.

Hadith n. 29
------------

**29. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** When you are running
away from the world and death is approaching, there is no question of
delay in the encounter.

> 29. وقال عليه السلام : إِذَا كُنْتَ فِي إِدْبَارٍ وَالْمَوْتُ فِي
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِقْبَالٍ فَمَا أسْرَعَ الْمُلْتَقَى.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 30
------------

**30. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Fear! Fear! By Allah,
He has hidden your sins so much so as though He has forgiven.

> 30. وقال عليه السلام: الْحَذَرَ الْحَذَرَ! فَوَاللهِ لَقَدْ سَتَرَ،
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حتَّى كَأَنَّهُ قَدْ غَفَرَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 31: Faith, Unbelief, Doubt And Their Supports
-------------------------------------------------------

31. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, was asked about faith. He said:

> 31. وسُئِلَ عليه السلام عَنِ الاْيمَانِ، فَقَالَ:

Faith stands on four supports: on endurance, conviction, justice and
jihad (fighting in the way of Allah).

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الاْيمَانُ عَلَى أَرْبَعِ دَعَائِمَ: عَلَى الصَّبْرِ، والْيَقِينِ،
وَالْعَدْلِ، وَالْجَهَادِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Endurance again has four aspects: eagerness, fear, abstention (from the
world) and anticipation (of death). So, whoever is eager for Paradise
will ignore the passions; whoever fears the Fire (of Hell) will refrain
from prohibited acts; whoever abstains from the world takes hardships
lightly; and whoever anticipates death will hasten towards good deeds.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَالصَّبْرُ مِنْهَا عَلَى أَربَعِ شُعَبٍ: عَلَى الشَّوْقِ، وَالشَّفَقِ
وَالزُّهْدِ، وَالتَّرَقُّبِ: فَمَنِ اشْتَاقَ إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ سَلاَ
عَنِ الشَّهَوَاتِ، وَمَنْ أشْفَقَ مِنَ النَّارِ اجْتَنَبَ
الْـمُحَرَّمَاتِ، وَمَنْ زَهِدَ فِي الدُّنْيَا اسْتَهَانَ
بِالْمُصِيبَاتِ، وَمَنِ ارْتَقَبَ الْمَوْتَ سَارَعَ فِي الْخَيْرَاتِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Conviction also has four aspects: prudent perception, intelligence and
understanding, drawing lessons from instructive things and following the
precedents of past people. So, whoever perceives with prudence, wise
knowledge will be manifest to him, and to whomsoever wise knowledge
becomes manifest he appreciates instructive objects, and whoever
appreciates instructive objects he is just like past people.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَالْيَقِينُ مِنْهَا عَلَى أَرْبَعِ شُعَبٍ: عَلَى تَبْصِرَةِ
الْفِطْنَةِ، وَتَأَوُّلِ الْحِكْمَةِ وَمَوْعِظَةِ الْعِبْرَةِ
وَسُنَّةِ الاْوَّلِينَ فَمَنْ تَبَصَّرَ فِي الْفِطْنَةِ تَبَيَّنَتْ
لَهُ الْحِكْمَةُ، وَمَنْ تَبَيَّنَتْ لَهُ الْحِكْمَةُ عَرَفَ
الْعِبْرَةَ، وَمَنْ عَرَفَ الْعِبْرَةَ فَكَأَنَّمَا كَانَ فِي
الاْوَّلِينَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Justice also has four aspects: keen understanding, deep knowledge, a
good power of decision and firm forbearance. Therefore, whoever
understands comes to acquire depth of knowledge; whoever acquires depth
of knowledge drinks from the spring of judgement; and whoever exercises
forbearance never commits evil actions in his affairs and leads a
praiseworthy life among the people.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَالْعَدْلُ مِنْهَا عَلَى أَرْبَعِ شُعَبٍ: عَلَى غائِصِ الْفَهْمِ،
وَغَوْرِ الْعِلْمِ وَزُهْرَةِ الْحُكْمِ،ِ، وَرَسَاخَةِ الْحِلْمِ:
فَمَنْ فَهِمَ عَلِمَ غَوْرَ الْعِلْمِ، و من عَلِمَ غَوْرَ الْعِلْمِ
صَدَرَ عَنْ شَرَائِعِ الْحُكْمِ وَمَنْ حَلُمَ لَمْ يُفَرِّطْ فِي
أَمْرِهِ وَعَاشَ فِي النَّاسِ حَمِيداً.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Jihad also has four aspects: to ask others to do good, to keep away
others from doing evil, to fight (in the way of Allah) sincerely and
firmly on all occasions, and to detest the vicious. So, whoever asks
others to do good provides strength to the believers; whoever desists
others from evil humiliates the unbelievers; whoever fights sincerely on
all occasions discharges all his obligations; and whoever detests the
vicious and becomes angry for the sake of Allah, then Allah will be
angry in favour of him and will keep him and will keep him pleased on
the Day of Judgement.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَالْجِهَادُ مِنْهَا عَلَى أَرْبَعِ شُعَبٍ: عَلَى الاْمْرِ
بالْمَعْرُوفِ، وَالنَّهْي عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ، وَالصِّدْقِ فِي
الْمَوَاطِنِ وَشَنَآنِ الْفَاسِقيِنَ: فَمَنْ أَمَرَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ
شَدَّ ظُهُورَ الْمُؤمِنِينَ، وَمَنْ نَهَى عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ أَرْغَمَ
أُنُوفَ الْكَافِرِينَ ،مَنْ صَدَقَ فِي الْمَوَاطِنِ قَضَى مَا
عَلَيْهِ، وَمَنْ شَنِىءَ الْفَاسِقِينَ وَغَضِبَ لله غَضِبَ اللهُ لَهُ
وَأَرْضَاهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Unbelief stands on four supports: hankering after whims, mutual
quarrelling, deviation from the truth, and dissension. So, whoever
hankers after whims does not incline towards right: whoever quarrels
much on account of ignorance remains permanently blinded from the right;
whoever deviates from truth, for him good becomes evil and evil becomes
good and he remains intoxicated with misguidance; and whoever makes a
breach (with Allah and His Messenger), his path becomes difficult, his
affairs become complicated and his way of escape becomes narrow.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَالْكُفْرُ عَلَى أَرْبَعِ دَعَائِمَ: عَلَى التَّعَمُّقِ
وَالتَّنَازُعِ، وَالزَّيْغِ وَالشِّقَاقِ فَمَنْ تَعَمَّقَ لَمْ
يُنِبْإِلَى الْحَقِّ، وَمَنْ كَثُرَ نِزَاعُهُ بِالْجَهْلِ دَامَ
عَمَاهُ عَنِ الْحَقِّ، وَمَنْ زَاغَ سَاءَتْ عِنْدَهُ الْحَسَنَةُ
وَحَسُنَتْ عِنْدَهُ السَّيِّئَةُ وَسَكِرَ سُكْرَ الضَّلاَلَةِ، وَمَنْ
شَاقَّ وَعُرَتْ عَلَيْهِ طُرُقُهُ وَأَعْضَلَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرُهُ وَضَاقَ
عَلَيْهِ مَخْرَجُهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Doubt has also four aspects: unreasonableness, fear, wavering and undue
submission to every thing. So, he who adopts unreasonableness as his
way, for him there is no dawn after the night; he who is afraid of what
befalls him has to run on his heels; he who wavers in doubt Satans
trample him under their feet and he who submits to the destruction of
this and tile next world succumbs to it.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَالشَّكُّ عَلَى أَرْبَعِ شُعَب: عَلَى الَّتمارِي وَالهَوْلِ
وَالتَّرَدُّدِ والاْسْتِسْلاَمِ فَمَنْ جَعَلَ الْمِرَاءَدَيْدَناًلَمْ
يُصْبِحْ لَيْلُهُ وَمَنْ هَالَهُ مَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ نَكَصَ عَلَى
عَقِبَيْهِ وَمَن تَرَدَّدَ فِي الرَّيْبِوَطِئَتْهُ يَدَيْهِ نَكَصَ
عَلَى عَقِبَيْهِ وَمَن تَرَدَّدَ فِي الرَّيْبِوَطِئَتْهُ سَنَابِكُ
الشَّيَاطِينِ وَمَنِ اسْتَسْلَمَ لِهَلَكَةِ الدُّنْيَا وَالاَْخِرَةِ
هَلَكَ فِيهِمَا.
  </p>
</blockquote>

better than the good itself, and the doer of evil is worse than the evil
itself.

Hadith n. 37
------------

**37. Once Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him,** was proceeding towards
Syria when the countrymen of a1-Anbar met him. Seeing him they began to
walk on foot and then ran in front of him. He enquired why they were
doing so and they replied that this was the way they respected their
chiefs. Then he said:

> 37. وقال عليه السلام وقد لقيه عند مسيره إلى الشام دهاقين الاَنبار
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فترجّلوا له واشتدّوابين يديه، فقال: مَا هذَا الَّذِي صَنَعْتُمُوهُ؟
فقالوا: خُلُقٌ مِنَّا نُعَظِّمُ بِهِ أُمَرَاءَنَا. فقال عليه السلام :
  </p>
</blockquote>

By Allah, this does not benefit your chiefs. You are belabouring
yourself in this world and earning misery for the next world by it. How
harmful is the labour in whose wake there is punishment and how
profitable is the case with which there is deliverance from the Fire (of
Hell).

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَاللهِ مَا يَنْتَفِعُ بِهذَا أُمَرَاؤُكُمْ! وَإِنَّكُمْ لَتَشُقُّونَ
عَلَى أَنْفُسِكْمْ فِي دُنْيَاكُمْ، وَتَشْقَوْنَ بِهِ فِي آخِرَتِكُمْ،

</blockquote>

Hadith n. 38
------------

**38. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said to his son al- Hasan:**

> 38. وقال عليه السلام : لابنه الحسن عليه السلام :

O my son, learn four things and (a further) four things from me. Nothing
will harm you if you practise them. That the richest of riches is
intelligence; the biggest destitution is foolishness; the wildest
wildness is vanity and the best achievement is goodness of the moral
character.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا بُنَيَّ، احْفَظْ عَنِّي أَرْبَعاً وَأَرْبَعاً، لاَ \_يَضُرَّكَ مَا
عَمِلْتَ مَعَهُنَّ: إِنَّ أَغْنَى الْغِنَىُ الْعَقْلُ، وَأَكْبَرَ
الْفَقْرِ الْحُمْقُ، وَأَوحَشَ الْوَحْشَةِ الْعُجْبُ وَأَكْرَمَ
الْحَسَبَ حُسْنُ الْخُلُقِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

O my son, you should avoid making friends with a fool because he may
intend to benefit you but may harm you; you should avoid making friends
with a miser because he will run away from you when you need him most;
you should avoid making friends with a sinful person because he will
sell you for nought; and you should avoid making friends with a liar
because he is like a mirage, making you feel far things near and near
things far.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا بُنَيَّ، إِيَّاكَ وَمُصَادَقَةَ الاْحْمَقِ، فَإِنَّهُ يُريِدُ أَنْ
يَنْفَعَكَ فَيَضُرَّكَ. وَإِيَّاكَ وَمُصَادَقَةَ الْبَخِيلِ، فَإِنَّهُ
يَقْعُدُ عَنْكَ أَحْوَجَ مَا تَكُونُ إِلَيْهِ. وَإِيَّاكَ
وَمُصَادَقَةَ الْفَاجِرِ، فَإِنَّهُ يَبِيعُكَ بِالتَّافِهِ وَإِيَّاكَ
وَمُصَادَقَةَ الْكَذَّابِ، فَإِنَّهُ كَالسَّرَابِ يُقَرِّبُ عَلَيْكَ
الْبَعِيدَ، وَيُبَعِّدُ عَلَيْكَ الْقَرِيبَ.

</blockquote>

Hadith n. 39
------------

**39. Amir al-mu'minin, peace he upon him, said:** Supererogatory
worship cannot bring about nearness to Allah if it hampers the
obligatory.

> 39. وقال عليه السلام : لاَ قُرْبَةَ بِالنَّوَافِلِ إِذَا أَضَرَّتْ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

Hadith n. 40
------------

**40. Amir a'-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The tongue of the
wise man is behind his heart, and the heart of the fool is behind his
tongue.

> 40. وقال عليه السلام : لِسَانُ الْعَاقِلِ وَرَاءَ قَلْبِهِ، وَقَلْبُ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الاْحْمَقِ وَرَاءَ لِسَانِهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** This sentence has a strange and beautiful
meaning. It means that the wise man does not speak with his tongue
except after consulting his mind and exercising his imagination, but the
fool quickly utters whatever comes to his tongue without thinking. In
this way, the tongue of the wise man follows his heart while the heart
of the fool follows his tongue.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال الرضي: و هذا من المعاني العجيبة الشريفة، والمراد به أنّ العاقل لا
يطلق لسانه إلاّ بعد مشاورة الرَّوِيّةِ ومؤامرة الفكرة، والاحمق تسبق
خذفاتُ لسانه وفلتاتُ كلامه مراجعةَ فكره ومماخضة رأيه، فكأن لسان العاقل
تابع لقلبه، وكأن قلب الاحمق تابع للسانه.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 41
------------

**41. This very sense has been related from Amir al-mu'minin, peace be
upon him, in a different version as follows:**

The heart of a fool is in his mouth while the tongue of the wise man is
in his heart.

The meaning of both the sayings (40 and 41) is the same.

> 41. وقد روي عنه عليه السلام هذا المعنى بلفظ آخر، وهو قوله: قَلبُ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الاْحْمَقِ فِي فِيهِ، وَلِسَانُ الْعَاقِلِ فِي قَلْبِهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ومعناهما واحد.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 42
------------

**42. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said to one of his companions
during his sickness:**

May Allah make your illness a means for writing off your sins, because
there is no reward for sickness but that it erases sins and makes them
fall like (dried) leaves. Reward lies in saying by the tongue and doing
something with the hands and feet. Certainly, Allah, the Glorified,
admits into Paradise by virtue of truthfulness of intention and chastity
of heart to whomsoever He wishes from among His creatures.

> 42. وقال عليه السلام لبعض أَصحابه في علّة اعتلّها: جَعَلَ اللهُ مَا
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كَانَ مِنْ شَكْوَاكَ حطّاً لِسَيِّئَاتِكَ، فَإِنَّ الْمَرَضَ لاَ
أَجْرَ فِيهِ، وَلكِنَّهُ يَحُطُّ السَّيِّئَاتِ، وَيَحُتُّهَا حَتَّ
الاْوْرَاقِ، وَإِنَّمَا الاْجْرُ فِي الْقَوْلِ بِالّلسَانِ،
وَالْعَمَلِ بِالاْيْدِي وَالاْقْدَامِ، وَإِنَّ اللهَ سُبْحَانَهُ
يُدْخِلُ بِصِدْقِ النِّيَّةِ وَالسَّرِيرَةِ الصَّالِحَةِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ
مِنْ عَبَادِهِ الْجَنَّةَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** Amir al-mu'minin is right in saying that
there is no reward for sickness as such because compensation is
admissible in respect of the acts of Allah, the Sublime, towards his
creatures such as grief, illness and the like, whereas reward and
recompense becomes admissible against actions by the creature. This is
the difference between the two and Amir al-mu'minin has clarified it
through his lustrous knowledge and sound view.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال الرضي: و أقول: صدق(عليه السلام)، «إنّ المرض لا أجر فيه»، لانه ليس
من قبيل ما يُستحَقّ عليه العوض، لان العوض يستحق على ما كان في مقابلة
فعل الله تعالى بالعبد، من الالام والامراض، وما يجري مجرى ذلك،الاجر
والثواب يستحقان على ما كان في مقابلة فعل العبد، فبينهما فرق قد
بينه(عليه السلام)، كما يقتضيه علمه الثاقب رأيه الصائب.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 43
------------

**43. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said about Khabbab ibn
al-Aratt :** [^16]

May Allah have mercy on Khabbab ibn al-Aratt since he accepted Islam
willingly, immigrated (from Mecca) obediently, remained content with
what sufficed him, was pleased with Allah and lived the life of a
mujahid (holy soldier).

> 43. وَ قَالَ عليه‏السلام فِي ذِكْرِ خَبَّابِ بْنِ الْأَرَتِّ: يَرْحَمُ

مُجَاهِداً .
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 44
------------

**44. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Blessed is the person
who kept in mind the next life, acted so as to be able to render
account, remained content with what sufficed him and remained pleased
with Allah.

> 44. وقال عليه السلام : طُوبَى لِمَنْ ذَكَرَ الْمَعَادَ، وَعَمِلَ

Hadith n. 45
------------

**45. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Even if I strike the
nose of a believer with this, my sword, for hating me he will not hate
me, and even if I pile all the wealth of the world before a hypocrite
(Muslim) for loving me he will not love me. This is because it is a
verdict pronounced by the tongue of the revered Prophet, may Allah bless
him and his descendants, as he said:

O \`Ali, a believer will never hate you arid a hypocrite (Muslim) will
never love you. [^17]

> 45. وَ قَالَ عليه‏السلام: لَوْ ضَرَبْتُ خَيْشُومَ الْمُؤْمِنِ

</blockquote>

Hadith n. 46
------------

**46. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The sin that
displeases you is better in the view of Allah than the virtue which
makes you proud. [^18]

> 46. وقال عليه السلام : سَيِّئَةٌ تَسُوءُكَ خَيْرٌ عِنْدَاللهِ مِنْ

Hadith n. 47
------------

**47. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The worth of a man is
according to his courage, his truthfulness is according to his balance
of temper, his valour is according to his self-respect and his
chasteness is according to his sense of shame.

> 47. وقال عليه السلام : قَدْرُ الرَّجُلِ عَلَى قَدْرِ هِمَّتِهِ،
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَصِدْقُهُ عَلَى قَدْرِ مُرُوءَتِهِ، وَشَجَاعَتُهُ عَلَى قَدْرِ

  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 48
------------

**48. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Victory is by
determination; determination is by the turning over of thoughts; and
thoughts are formed by guarding secrets.

Hadith n. 53
------------

Deceive some other person. I have no concern with you. I have divorced

Hadith n. 78: On Predestination
-------------------------------

**78. A Syrian enquired from Amir al-mu'minin:** **Was our going to
fight against the Syrians destined by Allah? Amir al-mu'minin, peace be
upon him, gave a detailed reply, a selection from which is hereunder:**

> 78. وَ مِنْ كَلَامٍ لَهُ عليه‏السلام لِلسَّائِلِ الشَّامِيِّ لَمَّا

  </p>
</blockquote>

Woe to you! You take it as a final and unavoidable destiny [^28]
(according to which we are bound to act). If it were so, there would
have been no question of reward or chastisement and there would have
been no sense in Allah's promises or warnings. (On the other hand)
Allah, the Glorified, has ordered ills people to act by free will and
has cautioned them and refrained them (from evil). He has placed easy
obligations on them and has not put heavy obligations. He gives them
much (reward) in return for little (action). He is disobeyed, not
because He is overpowered. He is obeyed but not under force. He did not
send prophets just for fun. He did not send down the Book for the people
without purpose. He did not create the skies, the earth and all that is
in between them in vain. *That is the imagination of those who
disbelieve; then woe to those who disbelieve - because of the fire.*
(Qur'an, 38:27)

Hadith n. 79
------------

**79. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Take wise points from

hypocrite it flutters in his bosom till it comes out and settles with
others of its own category in the bosom of the believer.

Hadith n. 82
------------

**82. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** I impart to you five
things which, if you ride your camels fast in search of them, you will
find them worth it.

No one of you should repose hope save in his Lord (Allah); no one of you
should fear anything save his sin; no one should feel ashamed of saying
"I do not know" when he is asked a matter which he does not know; no one
should feel ashamed of learning a thing that he does not know; and you
should practise endurance, because endurance is for belief what the head
is for the body, so that just as there is no good in a body without the
head there is no good in belief without endurance.

There are two sources of deliverance from the Allah's punishment, one of
which has been raised up, while the other is before you. You should
therefore adhere to it. The source of deliverance which has been raised
up is the Messenger of Allah (may He bless him and his descendants),
while the source of deliverance that remains is the seeking of
forgiveness. Allah, the Glorified, has said: *And Allah is not to
chastise them while you are among them, nor is Allah to chastise them
while yet they seek forgiveness*. (Qur'an, 8:33)

<blockquote dir="rtl">

Hadith n. 93
------------

**93. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** None of you should
say, "O Allah, I seek Your protection from trouble" because there is no
one who is not involved in trouble, but whoever seeks Allah's protection
he should seek it from misguiding troubles, because Allah, the
Glorified, says: *And know you that your wealth and your children are a
temptation!.* (Qur'an, 8:28) and its meaning is that He tries people
with wealth and progeny in order to distinguish one who is displeased
with his livelihood from the one who is happy with what he has been
given. Even though Allah, the Glorified, knows them more than they know
themselves yet He does so to let them perform actions with which they
earn reward or punishment because some of them like to have male
(children) and dislike to have female (children), and some like to amass
wealth, and dislike adversity.

Hadith n. 94

**94. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, was asked what is good and he
replied:** Good is not that your wealth and progeny should be much, but
good is that your knowledge should be much, your forbearance should be
great, and that you should vie with other people in worship of Allah. If
you do good deeds you thank Allah, but if you commit evil you seek
forgiveness of Allah. In this world good is for two persons only; the
man who commits sins but rectifies them by repentance; and the man who
hastens towards good actions.

Hadith n. 96
------------

**96. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The persons most
attached to the prophets are those who know most what the prophets have
brought. **Then Amir al-mu'minin recited the verse:** *Verily, of men
the nearest to Abraham are surely those who followed him and this (Our)
Prophet (Muhammad) and those who believe* (Qur'an, 3:68).

**Then he said:** The friend of Muhammad is he who obeys Allah, even

he who disobeys Allah even though he may have near kinship.

**Then he said:** Our saying *inna li'llah* (Verily we arc Allah's) is

know myself better than they do. O My God! Make us better than what they
think and forgive us what they do not know.

Hadith n. 101
-------------

**101. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Fulfilment of
(others') needs becomes a lasting virtue in three ways:-- regarding it
small so that it attains bigness, concealing it so that it may manifest
itself, and doing it quickly so that it becomes pleasant.

Hadith n. 102
-------------

**102. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Shortly a time will
come for people when high positions will be given only to those who
defame others, when vicious people will be regarded as witty and the
just will be regarded as weak. People will regard charity as a loss,
consideration for kinship as an obligation, and worship grounds for
claiming greatness among others. At this time, authority will be
exercised through the counsel of women, the posting of young boys in
high positions and the running of the administration by eunuchs.

Hadith n. 103
-------------

**103. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, was seen in worn-out clothes
with patches and when it was pointed out to him he said:** With it the
heart fears, the mind feels humble and the believers emulate it.
Certainly, this world and the next are two enemies against each other
and two paths in different directions. Whoever likes this world and
loves it hates the next arid is its enemy. These two are like East and
West. If the walker between them gets near to one, he gets farther from
the other. After all, they are like two fellow-wives.

Hadith n. 104
-------------

**104. It is related by Nawf al-Bikali that:** I saw that one night Amir
al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, came out from his bed and looked at the
stars, then he said to me: "O Nawf, are you awake or sleeping?" **I
said:** "I am awake, O Amir al-mu'minin." **Then he said:**

فَقُلْتُ بَلْ رَامِقٌ فقَال:
  </p>
</blockquote>

O Nawf! Blessed be those who abstain from this world and are eager for
the next world. They are the people who regard this earth as a floor;
its dust as their bed-cloth; and its water as their perfume; they recite
the Qur'an in low tones and supplicate in high tones and then they are
cut off from the world like 'Isa (Jesus).

<blockquote dir="rtl">

O Nawf! The prophet Dawud (David), peace be upon him, rose up at a
similar hour one night and said, "This is the hour when whatever a
person prays for is granted to him unless he is a tax-collector, an
intelligence man, a police officer, a lute player or a drummer.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** It is also said that “'artabah" means “tabl”
(drum) and "kubah" means 'lute'.

Hadith n. 105
-------------

**105. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Allah has placed on
you some obligations which you should not ignore, laid down for you
limits which you should not transgress and prohibited you from certain
things which you should not violate. He has kept silent about certain
things but has not left them out through forgetfulness, so do not burden
yourself with them.

Hadith n. 106
-------------

**106. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** If people give up
something relating to religion to set right their worldly affairs, Allah
will inflict upon them something more harmful than that.

Hadith n. 107
-------------

**107. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Often the ignorance
of a learned man ruins him while the knowledge he has does not avail
him.

Hadith n. 108
-------------

**108. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** In man there is a
piece of flesh attached to him with a vein and it is the strangest thing
in him. It is the heart. It has a store of wisdom and things contrary to
wisdom. If it sees a ray of hope, eagerness humiliates it and when
eagerness increases, greed ruins it. If disappointment overtakes it,
grief kills it. If anger rises in it, a serious rage develops. If it is
blessed with pleasure, it forgets to be cautious. If it becomes fearing,
it becomes heedless. If peace extends all round, it becomes neglectful.
If it earns wealth, freedom from care puts it in the wrong. If trouble
befalls it, impatience makes it humble. If it faces starvation, distress
overtakes it. If hunger attacks it, weakness makes it sit down. If its
eating increases, heaviness of stomach pains it. Thus, every shortness
is harmful to it and every excess is injurious to it.

> 108. وَ قَالَ عليه السلام: لَقَدْ عُلِّقَ بِنِيَاطِ هَذَا الْإِنْسَانِ

Hadith n. 109
-------------

**109. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** We (the members of
the Prophet's family) are like the pillow in the middle. He who lags
behind has to come forward to meet it while he who has exceeded the
bounds has to return to it.

Hadith n. 110
-------------

**110. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** No one can establish
the rule of Allah, the Glorified, except he who shows no relenting (in
the matter of right), who does not behave like wrong doers and who does
not run after objects of greed.

Hadith n. 111
-------------

**111. Sahl ibn Hunayf al-Ansari died at Kufah after his return from the
battle of Siffin and he was very much loved by Amir al-mu'minin, peace
be upon him. On this occasion Amir al-mu'minin said:** Even if a
mountain had loved me, it would have crumbled down.

> 111. وقال عليه السلام وقد توفي سهل بن حُنَيْفٍ الاَنصاري بالكوفة بعد

</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** The meaning of this is that since the trial
of the man who loves Amir al-mu'minin will be so, severe troubles would
leap towards him, and this is not the case except with the God-fearing,
the virtuous and select good. There is another similar saying of Amir
al-mu'minin's individuals, namely:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
معنى ذلك أن المحنة تغلظ عليه فتسرع المصائب إليه و لا يفعل ذلك إلا
بالأتقياء الأبرار و المصطفين الأخيار و هذا مثل قوله [عليه السلام]:

Hadith n. 112
-------------

**112.** Whoever loves us, members of the Household (of the Prophet),
should be prepared to face destitution.

Hadith n. 113
-------------

**113. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** No wealth is more
profitable than wisdom, no loneliness is more estranging than vanity, no
wisdom is as good as tact, no honour is like fear from Allah, no
companion is like the goodness of moral character, no inheritance is
like civility, no guide is like promptitude, no trade is like virtuous
acts, no profit is like Divine reward, no self- control is like inaction
in time of doubt, no abstention is like that (which is) from
prohibitions, no knowledge is like thinking, no worship is like the
discharge of obligation, no belief is like modesty and endurance, no
attainment is like humility, no honour is like knowledge, no power is
like forbearance, and no support is more reliable than consultation.

Hadith n. 114
-------------

**114. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** At a time when
virtue is in vogue in the world and among people, if a person entertains
an evil suspicion about another person from whom nothing evil has ever
been seen, then he has been unjust. And at a time when vice is in vogue
in the world and among people, if a man entertains a good idea about
another person he has flung himself in peril.

Hadith n. 115
-------------

**115. It was said to Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him:** How are
you, O Amir al-mu'minin? **and he replied:** How can he be whom life is
driving towards death, whose state of healthiness can change into
sickness any moment and who is to be caught (by death) from his place of
safety.

Hadith n. 116
-------------

**116. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** There are many
people who are given time (by Allah) through good treatment towards
them, and many who are deceived because their sinful activities are
veiled (by Allah), and many who are enamoured by good talk about
themselves. And Allah does not try anyone as seriously as He tries him
whom He allows time (to remain sinful).

Hadith n. 119
-------------

**119. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The example of the
world is like a serpent. It is soft to the touch but its inside is full

Hadith n. 120
-------------

**120. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, was asked about the Quraysh,
when he replied:** As for Banu Makhzum they are the blossoms of the
Quraysh. It is delightful to talk to their men and to marry their women.
As for Banu 'Abd Shams, they are farsighted and cautious about all that
is hidden from them. As for ourselves (Banu Hashim) we spend whatever we
get and are very generous in offering ourselves in death. Consequently,
those people are more numerous, more contriving and more ugly while we
are more eloquent, well-wishing and handsome.

**121. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** What a difference
there is between two kinds of actions: an act whose pleasure passes away

Hadith n. 122
-------------

**122. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, was accompanying a funeral
when he heard someone laugh. Then he said :** Is it that death has been
ordained only for others? Is it that right is obligatory only on others?
Is it that those whom we see departing on their journey of death will
come back to us? We lay them down in their graves and then enjoy their
estate (as if we will live for good after them). We have ignored every
preacher, man or woman, and have exposed ourselves to every catastrophe.

-------------

**123. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Blessed be lie who
humbles himself, whose livelihood is pure, whose heart is chaste, whose
habits are virtuous, who spends his savings (in the name of Allah), who
prevents his tongue from speaking nonsense, who keeps people safe from

**125. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** I am defining Islam

conviction, conviction is affirmation, affirmation is acknowledgement,
acknowledgement is discharge (of obligations), and discharge of
obligations is action.

Hadith n. 126
-------------

**126. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** I wonder at the
miser who is speeding towards the very destitution from which he wants
to run away and misses the very ease of life which he covets.
Consequently, he passes his life in this world like the destitute, but
will have to render an account in the next world like the rich.

I wonder at the proud man who was just a drop of semen the other day and
will turn into a corpse tomorrow. I wonder at the man who doubts Allah
although he sees His creations. I wonder at him who has forgotten death
although he sees people dying. I wonder at him who denies the second
life although he has seen the first life. I wonder at him who inhabits
this transient abode but ignores the everlasting abode.

Hadith n. 130
-------------

**130. When Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, returned from (the
battle of) Siffin and noticed the graves outside Kufah, he said:** O
residents of houses which give a sense of loneliness, of depopulated
areas and gloomy graves. O people of the dust, O victims of strangeness,
O people of loneliness and O people of desolateness! You have gone ahead
and preceded us while we are following you and will meet you. The houses
(you left) have been inhabited by others; the wives (you left) have been
married by others; the properties have been distributed (among heirs).
This is the news about those around us; what is the news about things
around you?

Hadith n. 131: About Those Who Falsely Accuse This World
--------------------------------------------------------

**131. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, heard a man abusing the
world and said:** O you who abuse the world, O you who have been
deceived by its deceit and cheated by its wrongs. Do you covet the world
and then abuse it? Do you accuse it or it should accuse you? When did it
bewilder you or deceive you whether by the decay and fall of your
forefathers, or by the sleeping places of your mothers under the ground?
How much you looked after them in their illness and nursed them during
sickness, desiring them to be cured and consulting physicians for them
in the morning when your medicine did not avail them and your wailing
for them did not benefit them. Your mourning over them did not prove
useful to them and you could not achieve your aims. You could not ward
off (death) from them with all your power. In fact, through the dying
man the world presented an illustration for you and showed you by the
example of his falling down how you would (also) fall.

Certainly, this world is a house of truth for him who appreciates it; a
place of safety for him who understands it; a house of riches for him
who collects provision from it (for the next world); and a house of
instructions for him who draws instruction from it. It is the place of
worship for the lovers of Allah; the place of praying for the angels of
Allah; the place where the revelation of Allah descends; and the
marketing place for those devoted to Allah. Herein they earned mercy and
herein they acquired Paradise by way of profit.

Therefore, who can abuse it when it has announced its departure and
called out that it would leave! It had given news of its own destruction
and the death of its people. By its hardship it set an example of their
hardships. By its pleasures it created eagerness for the pleasures (of
the next world). It brings ease in the evening and grief in the morning
by way of persuasion, dissuasion, alarm and warning. People abuse it on
the morning of their repentance but there are others who will praise it
on the Day of Judgement. The world recalled to them the next life and
they bore it in mind. It related to them (things of the next life) and
they acknowledged them. It preached to them and they took lesson
therefrom. [^33]

**135. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** He who is bestowed
four things is not disallowed four things: he who is allowed to pray is
not deprived of the response to it; he who is allowed to offer
repentance is not deprived of its acceptance; he who is allowed to seek
forgiveness is not deprived of forgiveness; and he who is allowed to be
grateful is not deprived of furtherance of favours.

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** This is confirmed by the Book of Allah.

or wrongs his own self and thereafter seeks pardon of Allah, shall find
Allah Oft-forgiving, Merciful"* (Qur'an, 4:110). About gratefulness He
says: *"If you be grateful I will increase (my favours) to you"*
(Qur'an, 14:7). About repentance He says: *"Verily, repentance
(acceptable) with Allah is only for those who do evil ignorantly and
then turn (to Allah) soon (after); these (are those) Allah will turn
(merciful) to them; and Allah is All-knowing, All-wise"* (Qur'an, 4:
17).

**136. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** For the God-fearing
prayers is a means of seeking nearness to Allah; and for the weak the
hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) is as good as jihad (fighting in the way of
Allah). For every thing there is a levy; and the levy of the body is
fasting. The jihad of a woman is to afford pleasant company to her
husband.

O Kumayl, knowledge is better than wealth. Knowledge guards you, while
you have to guard the wealth. Wealth decreases by spending, while
knowledge multiplies by spending, and the results of wealth die as
wealth decays.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا كُمَيْلُ، الْعِلْمُ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الْمَالِ: الْعِلْمُ يَحْرُسُكَ
وَأَنْتَ تَحْرُسُ المَالَ، وَالْمَالُ تَنْقُصُهُ النَّفَقَةُ،
وَالْعِلْمُ يَزْكُوعَلَى الاْنْفَاقِ، وَصَنِيعُ الْمَالِ يَزُولُ
بِزَوَالِهِ.

O Kumayl, knowledge is belief which is acted upon. With it man acquires
obedience during his life and a good name after his death. Knowledge is
the ruler while wealth is ruled upon.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

O Kumayl, those who amass wealth are dead even though they may be living
while those endowed with knowledge will remain as long as the world
lives. Their bodies are not available but their figures exist in the
hearts. Look, here is a heap of knowledge (and Amir al-mu'minin pointed
to his bosom). I wish I could get someone to bear it. Yes, I did find
(such a one); but either he was one who could not be relied upon. He
would exploit the religion for worldly gains, and by virtue of Allah's
favours on him he would domineer over the people and through Allah's
pleas he would lord over His devotees. Or he was one who was obedient to
the hearers of truth but {here was no intelligence in his bosom. At the
first appearance of doubt he would entertain misgivings in his heart.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا كُمَيْلُ هَلَكَ خُزَّانُ الْأَمْوَالِ وَ هُمْ أَحْيَاءٌ وَ

وَ أَمْثَالُهُمْ فِى الْقُلُوبِ مَوْجُودَةٌ هَا إِنَّ هَاهُنَا
لَعِلْماً جَمّاً وَ أَشَارَ بِيَدِهِ إِلَى صَدْرِهِ لَوْ أَصَبْتُ لَهُ

So, neither this nor that was good enough. Either the man is eager for
pleasures, easily led away by passions, or is covetous for collecting
and hoarding wealth. Neither of them has any regard for religion in any
matter. The nearest example of these is the loose cattle. This is the
way that knowledge dies away with the death of its bearers.

O My God! Yes; but the earth is never devoid of those who maintain
Allah's plea either openly and reputedly or, being afraid, as hidden in
order that Allah's pleas and proofs should not be rebutted. How many are
they and where are they? By Allah, they are few in number, but they are
great in esteem before Allah. Through them Allah guards His pleas and
proofs till they entrust them to others like themselves and sow the
seeds thereof in the hearts of those who are similar to them.

Knowledge has led them to real understanding and so they have associated
themselves with the spirit of conviction. They take easy what the
easygoing regard as hard. They endear what the ignorant take as strange.
They live in this world with their bodies here but their spirits resting
in the high above. They are the vicegerents of Allah on His earth and
callers to His religion.

Oh, oh, how I yearn to see them! Go away now, O Kumayl, wherever you
wish!

Hadith n. 150: On Preaching
---------------------------

**150. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said to a man who had
requested him to preach:**

> 150. وقال عليه السلام لرجلٍ سأَله أَن يعظه:

Do not be like him who hopes for (bliss in) the next life without
action, and delays repentance by lengthening desires, who utters words
like ascetics in this world but acts like those who are eager for it; if
he is allowed something from it he does not feel satisfied; if he is
denied he is not content; he is not grateful for what he gets and covets
for increase in whatever remains with him; he refrains others but not
himself; he commands others for what he himself does not do; he loves
the virtuous but does not behave like them; he hates the vicious but
himself is one of them; he dislikes death because of the excess of his
sins but adheres to that for which he is afraid of death.

If he falls ill he is remorseful; if he is healthy he feels secure and
indulges in amusements; when he recovers from illness he feels vain
about himself; when he is afflicted he loses hope; if distress befalls
him he prays like a bewildered man; when he finds ease of life he falls
into deceit and turns his face away; his heart overpowers him by means
of imaginary things while he cannot control his heart by his conviction;
for others he is afraid of small sins, but for himself he expects more
reward than his performance; if he becomes wealthy he becomes
self-conceited and falls into vice; if he becomes poor he despairs and
becomes weak; he falls short when doing a good thing but goes too far
when he is begging; when passion overtakes him he is quick in committing
sin but delays repentance; if hardship befalls him he goes beyond the
cannons of the (Islamic) community; he describes instructive events but
does not take instruction himself; he preaches at length but does not
accept any preaching for himself; he is tall in speaking but short in
action; he aspires for things that will perish and ignores things that
will last for good; he regards profit as loss and loss as profit; he
fears death but does nothing in its anticipation.

He regards the sins of others as big but considers the same things for
himself as small; if he does something in obedience to Allah he
considers it much but if others do the same he considers it small; he
therefore rebukes others but flatters himself; entertainment in the
company of the wealthy is dearer to him than remembrance (of Allah) with
the poor; he passes verdicts against others for his own interests and
does not do so against himself for others' interests; he guides others
but misguides himself; he is obeyed by others but he himself disobeys
(Allah); he seeks fulfilment (of obligations towards himself) but does
not fulfil his obligations (towards others); he fears the people (and
acts) for other than his Lord (Allah) and does not fear his Lord in his
dealings with the people.

**190. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** How strange? Could
the caliphate be through the (Prophet's) companionship but not through

Hadith n. 191
-------------

**191. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** In this world man is
the target towards which the arrows of death fly, and is like that
wealth whose destruction is quickened by hard ships. (In this world)
with every drink there is suffocation and with every morsel there is
choking. Here no one gets anything unless he loses something else, and
not a day of his age advances till a day passes out from his life. Thus,
we are helpers of death and our lives are the targets of mortality. How
then can we expect everlasting life since the night and day do not raise
anything high without quickly arranging for the destruction of whatever
they have built and for the splitting asunder of whatever they have
joined together.

> 191. وقال عليه السلام : إِنَّمَا الْمَرْءُ فِى الدُّنْيَا غَرَضٌ

**193. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Hearts are imbued

they are in a mood for advancing, because if hearts are forced (to do a
thing) they will be blinded.

-------------

said to me, "better you endure" or when I have power to take revenge and
it be said to me, "better forgive"?

Hadith n. 197
-------------

**197. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The hearts become

people:** These are the people who, when they assemble together, are
overwhelming but when they disperse they cannot be recognized.

> 199. وقال عليه السلام في صفة الْغوغاء هُمُ الَّذِينَ إِذَا اجْتَمَعُوا
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
غَلَبُوا، وَإِذَا تَفَرَّقُوا لَمْ يُعْرَفُوا
  </p>
</blockquote>

**It is related that instead of this Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon
him, said:** These are the people who when they assemble together cause
harm but when they disperse are beneficial. It was pointed out to him:
We know their harm at the time of their assembling but what is their
benefit at the time of their dispersal?

**Then he replied:** The workers return to their work and people get
benefit out of them, like the return of the mason to the building site,
that of the weaver to his loom, and that of the baker to his bakery.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وقيل: بل قال: هُمُ الَّذِينَ إِذَا اجْتَمَعُوا ضَرُّوا، وَإِذَا
تَفَرَّقُوا نَفَعُوا. فقيل: قد علمنا مضرة اجتماعهم، فما منفعة
افتراقهم؟ فقال: يَرْجِعُ أَصْحَابُ الْمِهَنِ إِلَى مِهَنِهِمْ،
فَيَنْتَفِعُ النَّاسُ بِهِمْ، كَرُجُوعِ الْبَنَّاءِ إِلَى بِنَائِهِ،

Hadith n. 201
-------------

**201. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** With every
individual there are two angels who protect him; when destiny approaches
they let it have its own way with him. Certainly, the appointed time is
a protective shield (against the events which occur before it).

Hadith n. 202

No, but you will have a share in strengthening (the caliphate) and in
affording assistance and you will both be helping me at the time of need
and hardship.

Hadith n. 203
-------------

**203. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** O people, fear Allah
Who is such that when you speak He hears and when you conceal (a secret)
He knows it. Prepare yourself to meet death which will overtake you even
if you run away, catch you even if you stay and remember you even if you
forget it.

Hadith n. 204
-------------

**204. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** If someone is not
grateful to you, that should not prevent you from good actions, because
(possibly) such a person will feel grateful about it who has not even
drawn any benefit from it, and his gratefulness will be more than the
ingratitude of the denier; ***And Allah loves those who do good*****.
(Qur'an, 3:134,148; 5:93)**

**206. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The first reward the

Hadith n. 207
-------------

**207. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** If you cannot
forbear, feign to do so because it is seldom that a man likens himself
to a group and does not become as one of them.[^47]

> 207. وقال عليه السلام : إِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ حَلِيماً فَتَحَلَّمْ،

</blockquote>

Hadith n. 208
-------------

**208. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Whoever takes
account of his self is benefited, and whoever remains neglectful of it
suffers. Whoever fears remains safe; whoever takes instruction (from
things around) perceives; and whoever perceives gains understanding, and
whoever gains understanding secures knowledge.

Hadith n. 209
-------------

**209. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him said:** The world will bend
towards us after having been refractory as the biting she-camel bends
towards its young. **Then Amir al-mu'minin recited the verse:**

***And intend We to bestow (Our) favour upon those who were considered
weak in the land, and to make them the Imams*** **(guides in
faith)*****, and to make them the heirs*****. (Qur'an, 28:5)** [^48]

Hadith n. 210
-------------

**210. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Fear Allah like the
one who prepares himself after extracting himself (from worldly affairs)
and after getting ready in this way makes effort; then he acts quickly
during the period of this life, hastens in view of the dangers (of
falling into error) and has his eye on proceeding towards the goal, on
the end of his journey and on the place of his (eventual) return.

Hadith n. 211
-------------

**211. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Generosity is the
protector of honour; forbearance is the bridle of the fool; forgiveness
is the levy of success; disregard is the punishment of him who betrays;
and consultation is the chief way of guidance. He who is content with
his own opinion faces danger. Endurance braves calamities while
impatience is a helper of the hardships of the world. The best
contentment is to give up desires. Many a slavish mind is subservient to
overpowering longings. Capability helps preservation of experience. Love
means well-utilized relationship. Do not trust one who is grieved.

-------------

**222. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The highest act of a

Hadith n. 224
-------------

**224. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Excess of silence
produces awe; justice results in more close friends; generosity
heightens position; with humility blessings abound in plenty; by facing
hardships leadership is achieved; by just behaviour the adversary is
overpowered; and with forbearance against a fool there is increase of
one's supporters against him.

Hadith n. 225
-------------

**225. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** It is strange that

(iman) when he said:** Belief means appreciation with the heart,
acknowledgement with the tongue, and action with the limbs.

</blockquote>

Hadith n. 228
-------------

**228. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** He who is sorrowful
for this world is in fact displeased with the dispensation of Allah. He
who complains of a calamity that befalls him complains of his Lord
(Allah). He who approaches a rich man and bends before him on account of
his riches then two-third of his religion is gone. If a man reads the
Qur'an and on dying goes to Hell then it means that he was among those
who treated Divine verses with mockery. If a man's heart gets attached
to the world, then it catches three things, namely worry that never
leaves him, greed that does not abandon him and desire which he never
fulfils.

> 228. وقال عليه السلام : مَنْ أَصْبَحَ عَلَى الدُّنْيَا حَزِيناً فَقَدْ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَصْبَحَ لِقَضَاءِ اللهِ سَاخِطاً، وَمَنْ أَصْبَحَ يَشَكُو مُصِيبَةً
نَزَلَتْ بِهِ فَقَدْ أَصْبَحَ يَشْكُو رَبَّهُ، وَمَنْ أَتى غَنِيَّاً
فَتَوَاضَعَ لِغِنَاهُ ذَهَبَ ثُلُثَا دِينِهِ، وَمَنْ قَرَأَ الْقُرْآنَ
فَمَاتَ فَدَخَلَ النَّارَ فَهُوَ مِمَّنْ كَانَ يَتَّخِذُ آيَاتِ اللهِ
هُزُواً، وَمَنْ لَهِجَ قَلْبُهُ بِحُبِّ الدُّنْيَا الْتَاطَ قَلْبُهُ
مِنْهَا بِثَلاَثٍ: هَمٍّ لاَ يُغِبُّهُ، وَحِرْصٍ لاَ يَتْرُكُه،
وَأَمَلٍ لاَ يُدْرِكُهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 229
-------------

**229. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Contentment is as
good as estate, and goodness of moral character is as good as a
blessing.

> 229. وقال عليه السلام : كَفَى بِالْقَنَاعَةِ مُلْكاً، وَبِحُسْنِ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الْخُلُقِ نَعِيماً.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, was asked about Allah's saying:**
(Whosoever did good, whether male or female, and he be a believer,
then); *We will certainly make him live a life good and pure* (and
certainly We will give them their return with the best of what they were
doing). (Qur'an, 16:97) **when he said:** that means (a life of)
contentment. [^55]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ سُئِلَ ع عَنْ قَوْلِهِ تَعَالَى( فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَياةً طَيِّبَةً

  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 230
-------------

**230. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Be a sharer with him
who has an abundant livelihood because he is more probable to get more
riches and likely to secure an increase of the share therein.

> 230. وقال عليه السلام : شَارِكُوا الَّذِي قَدْ أَقْبَلَ عَلَيْهِ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

الْحَظِّ عَلَيْهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 231
-------------

**231. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said about Allah's saying:**
*Verily, Allah enjoins justice ('adl) and benevolence (ihsan),* (Qur'an,
16:90). Here 'adl means equidistribution and ihsan means favour.

> 231. وقال عليه السلام في قول الله تعالى : ) إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بِالْعَدْلِ وَ الْإِحْسانِ) : الْعَدْلُ الاْنْصَافُ، وَالاْحْسَانُ
التَّفَضُّلُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 232
-------------

**232. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** He who gives with
his short hand is given by a long hand.

> 232. وقال عليه السلام : مَنْ يُعْطِ بِالْيَدِ الْقَصِيرَةِ يُعْطَ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بِالْيَدِ الطَّوِيلَةِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** The meaning of this saying is that even
though what a man spends in charity from his possessions may be small,
yet Allah, the Sublime, gives good reward for it. And the two hands
referred to, here means two favours. Thus, Amir al-mu'minin has
differentiated between the favour of man and the favour of the Lord
(Allah) -- exalted be the mention of His name -- since he has described
the first as small and the other as big. This is because the favours of
Allah are ever multiplied manifold to the favours of man since Allah's
favours are the basis of all favours in the sense that every other
favour springs from it and turns to it.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال الرضى و معنى ذلك أن ما ينفقه المرء من ماله فى سبيل الخير و البر و
إن كان يسيرا فإن الله تعالى يجعل الجزاء عليه عظيما كثيرا و اليدان
هاهنا عبارة عن النعمتين ففرق ع بين نعمة العبد و نعمة الرب تعالى ذكره
بالقصيرة و الطويلة فجعل تلك قصيرة و هذه طويلة لأن نعم الله أبدا تضعف
على نعم المخلوق أضعافا كثيرة إذ كانت نعم الله أصل النعم كلها فكل نعمة
إليها ترجع و منها تنزع .
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 233
-------------

**233. Amir al-mu'minin said to his son al-Hasan, peace be upon them
both:** Do not call out for fighting, but if you are called to it do
respond, because the caller to fighting is a rebel and the rebel
deserves destruction. [^56]

> 233. وَ قَالَ عليه السلام لِابْنِهِ الْحَسَنِ ع: لَا تَدْعُوَنَّ إِلَى

  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 234
-------------

**234. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The best traits of
women are those which are the worst traits of men, namely: vanity,
cowardice and miserliness. Thus, since the woman is vain, she will not
allow anyone access to herself; since she is miserly, she will preserve
her own property and the property of her husband; and since she is
weak-hearted, she will be frightened with everything that befalls her.

> 234. وقال عليه السلام : خِيَارُ خِصَالِ النِّسَاءِ شِرَارُ خِصَالِ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

جَبَانَةً فَرِقَتْ مِنْ كُلِّ شِيْءٍ يَعْرِضُ لَهَا.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 235
-------------

**235. It was said to Amir a'-mu'minin, peace be upon him:** Describe
the wise to us; **and he said:** The wise is one who places things in
their proper positions. **Then, he was asked:** Describe the ignorant to
us; and he said: I have already done so.

> 235. وقيل له عليه السلام : صف لنا العاقل. فقال عليه السلام : هُوَ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الِّذِي يَضَعُ الشَّيْءَ مَوَاضِعَهُ. قيل: فصف لنا الجاهل. قال: قَدْ
فَعَلْتُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** The meaning is that the ignorant is one who
does not place things in their proper positions. In this way, Amir
al-mu'minin's abstention from describing was a way of describing him
because the attributes of the ignorant are the opposite of the wise.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال الرضى: يعنى أن الجاهل هو الذى لا يضع الشي‏ء مواضعه فكأن ترك صفته
صفة له إذ كان بخلاف وصف العاقل .
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 236
-------------

**236. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** By Allah, this world
of yours is more lowly in my view than the (left over) bone of a pig in
the hand of a leper.

> 236. وقال عليه السلام : وَاللهِ لَدُنْيَاكُمْ هذِهِ أَهْوَنُ فِي

</blockquote>

Hadith n. 237
-------------

**237. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** A group of people
worshipped Allah out of desire for reward surely, this is the worship of
traders. Another group worshipped Allah out of fear; this is the worship
of slaves. Still another group worshipped Allah out of gratefulness;
this is the worship of free men.

> 237. وقال عليه السلام : إِنَّ قَوْماً عَبَدُوا اللهَ رَغْبَةً فَتِلْكَ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عِبَادَةُ التُّجَّارِ، وَإِنَّ قَوْماً عَبَدُوا اللهَ رَهْبَةً

Hadith n. 238
-------------

**238. Amir a'-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Woman is evil, all
in all; and the worst of it is that one cannot do without her.

Hadith n. 239
-------------

**239. Amir a'-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** He who is a sluggard
loses his rights and he who believes in the backbiter loses his friend.

Hadith n. 240
-------------

**240. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be. upon him, said:** One ill-gotten
piece of stone in a house is a guarantee for its ruin.

> 240. وقال عليه السلام : الْحَجَرُ الْغَصِيبُ فِي الدَّارِ رَهْنٌ عَلَى
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
خَرَابِهَا.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** In one tradition this saying is attributed
to the Prophet. It is no wonder that the two sayings should resemble
each other because they are driven from the same source and dispersed
through the same means.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال الرضى و يروى هذا الكلام عن النبى (ص) و لا عجب أن يشتبه الكلامان
لأن مستقاهما من قليب و مفرغهما من ذنوب .

-------------

**242. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Fear Allah to some

> 242. وقال عليه السلام : اتَّقِ اللهَ بَعْضَ التُّقَى وَإِنْ قَلَّ،

Hadith n. 243
-------------

**243. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** When replies are
numerous the correct point remains obscure. [^58]

> 243. وقال عليه السلام : إِذَا ازْدَحَمَ الْجَوَابُ خَفِيَ الصَّوَابُ.

Hadith n. 244
-------------

**244. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Surely in every
blessing there is a right of Allah. If one discharges that right Allah
increases the blessing, and if one falls short of doing so one stands in
danger of losing the blessing.

him it will come running like flowing water and drive away the hardship
as wild camels are driven away.

**I.** **A tradition related from Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him,
says:** When the situation is like this, then the head of the religion
will rise and people will gather around him as pieces of rainless cloud
collect during autumn.

> I. في حديثه عليه السلام : فَإِذَا كَانَ ذلِكَ ضَرَبَ يَعْسُوبُ

  </p>
</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** "Ya'sub" [^64] is the great chief who is in
charge of the people's affairs, and "quza\`" means the pieces of cloud
which have no rain.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

**II.** **A tradition of Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, says:** He
is a versatile speaker. [^65]

> II. وفي حديثه عليه السلام : هذَا الْخَطِيبُ الشَّحْشَحُ.

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** "shahshah" means one expert and free in
speech, and every one who is free in speech or walking is called
"shahshah", while in another sense this word means a miserly and
niggardly person.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يريد: الماهر بالخطبة الماضي فيها، وكل ماض في كلام أو سير فهو شحشح،
والشحشح في غير هذاالموضع: البخيل الممسك

</blockquote>

**III.** **A tradition from Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, says:**
Quarrels bring about ruin.

> III. وفي حديثه عليه السلام : إنَّ لِلْخُصُومَةِ قُحَماً.

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** "quhm" means ruin because quarrels often
drive men into ruin and grief. In the same way, it is said "quhmatu'l-A
'rab" which means the period (of drought) when the cattle owned by the
nomad desert Arabs are reduced to bones, and this is their being driven
to it. Another argument is also advanced in this matter; namely that the
situation drives them to green areas, in other words the hardship of the
desert life drives them to hadar (a civilized region with town and
villages and a settled population [as opposed to desert] ).

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

بلادَ الريف، أي تحوجهم إلى دخول الحضر عند مُحول البَدْوِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**IV.** **A tradition of Amir al-mu'niinin, peace be upon him, says:**
When girls reach the stage of (realizing) realities, relations on the
father's side are preferable.

> IV. وفي حديثه عليه السلام : إِذَا بَلَغَ النِّسَاءُ نَصَّ الْحِقَاقِ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَالْعَصَبَةُ أَوْلَى.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** Instead of "nassa'l-hiqaq "the combination
"nassa'l-haqa'iq" has also been related. "nass" means the last end of
things or their remotest limit, such as "an-nassi fi's sayr" means the
maximum a beast can walk. Or you say "nasastu'r-rajula 'ani'l-amri" when
you have questioned a man to the extreme to make him utter all he has.
Thus, "nassu'l-haqa'iq" means prudence because it is the last limit of
childhood and is the time when a child crosses childhood into majority,
and this is a very eloquent reference to the point, and strange too.
Amir al-mu'minin intends to say: When girls reach this stage their
relations on father's side have a better right than their mother,
provided they are those with whom marriage is prohibited like brothers
and uncles, to arrange for their marriages if they so desire. "al-hiqaq"
also means the quarrelling of the mother with a girl's paternal
relations. This quarrel is that everyone of them says he has a better
'right for her. That is why it is said "haqatuhu hiqaqan" on the lines
of "jadaltuhu jidalan". It has also been said that "nassu'l-hiqaq" means
acquiring understanding and this is prudence, because Amir al-mu'minin
refers to the stage when rights and duties become applicable. The person
who has related the word as "haqa'iq" intends to signify the plural of
"haqiqah" (reality).

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال: ويروى (نص الحقائق)، والنص منتهى الأشياء ومبلغ أقصاها كالنص في
السير لأنه أقصى ما تقدر عليه الدابة، ويقال نصصت الرجل عن الامر إذا

منتهى الصغر، والوقت الذي يخرج منه الصغير إلى حد الكبر، وهو من أفصح
الكنايات عن هذا الامر وأغربها، يقول فإذا بلغ النساء ذلك فالعصبة أولى
بالمرأة من أمها إذا كانوا محرما مثل الاخوة والأعمام، وبتزويجها إن
أرادوا ذلك.

السلام إنما أراد منتهى الامر الذي تجب به الحقوق والاحكام. قال: ومن
رواه (نص الحقائق) فإنما أراد جمع حقيقة،
  </p>
</blockquote>

The above is what Abu 'Ubayd al-Qasim ibn Sallam has stated (in Gharib
al-hadith, vol.3, pp.456 -458); but I think that the intention here by
the word "nassu'l-hiqaq " is a girl's reaching the stage when it is
possible to marry her and to allow her to dispose of her rights herself
on the analogy of "bil hiqaqi mina '1-ibili" (a camel's attaining
majority) wherein "hiqaq is the plural of "hiqqah" or "hiqq " and it
means completion of three years (of age) and entry into the fourth,
which is the time when it reaches the age when it is possible to ride on
its back and to exert it in walking. "haqa'iq" too is the plural of
"hiqqah". Thus, both the versions point to the same meaning, and this
interpretation is more in keeping with the way of the Arabs than the
other one stated earlier.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
هذا معنى ما ذكره أبو عبيد القاسم بن سلام. قال: والذي عندي أن المراد
بنص الحقاق هاهنا بلوغ المرأة إلى الحد الذي يجوز فيه تزويجها وتصرفها في
حقوقها، تشبيها بالحقاق من الإبل، وهي جمع حقة وحق، وهو الذي استكمل ثلاث
سنين ودخل في الرابعة، وعند ذلك يبلغ إلى الحد الذي يمكن فيه من ركوب
ظهره ونصه في سيره، والحقائق أيضا: جمع حقة، فالروايتان جميعا ترجعان إلى
مسمى واحد، وهذا أشبه بطريقة العرب من المعنى المذكور أولا.

</blockquote>

**V. A tradition of Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, says:** Faith
produces a "lumzah" in the heart. As faith develops, the "lumzah" also
increases.

> V. وفي حديثه عليه السلام : إنَّ الاْيمَانَ يَبْدُو لُمْظَةً فِي
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الْقَلْبِ، كُلَّمَا ازْدَاد الاْيمَانُ ازْدَادَتِ الُّلمْظَةُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** "lumzah" is a white spot or something like
that. On that analogy if a horse has a white spot on its lower lip it is
called "farusun almaz", that is, a white-spotted horse.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الُّلمْظَةُ مثل النكتة أو نحوها من البياض، ومنه قيل فرس ألمظ: إذا كان

**VI. A tradition of Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him) says:** If a
man has a "ad-daynu'z-zanun" (i.e. doubtful loan) it is his duty to pay
zakat thereon for all the past years when he recovers it.

> VI. وفي حديثه عليه السلام : إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ إِذَا كَانَ لَهُ الدَّيْنُ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الظَّنُونُ يَجِبُ عَلَيْهِ أَنْ يُزَكِّيَهُ لِمَا مَضَى إِذَا
قَبَضَهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**as-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** "az-zanun" is the loan about which the
lender does not know whether he will be able to recover it from the
borrower. He is like the one who hopes as well as loses hope. This is
the most eloquent way of expression. In this way everything about which
you do not know where you stand would be zanun. In the same strain poet
al-A' sha (Maymun ibn Qays al-Wa'ili [d. 7/629] )says:

The az-zanun well (i.e., the one that may or may not have water) which
is also deprived of the rain of the raining clouds cannot be compared to
the Euphrates whose waves are rising high and which is pushing away the
boat as well as the adept swimmer.

"Judd" means the well (situated in a wilderness), while zanun is that
about which it is not known whether or not it has water.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

**VII. A tradition of Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, relates that
he arranged a force for advancing for jihad and said**: i'dhibu (turn
away) from women so far as you can.

> VII. وفي حديثه عليه السلام أَنه شيّع جيشاً يغْزِيهِ فقال:
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اعْذِبُواعَنِ النِّسَاءِ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُمْ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** It (i'dhibu) means that "keep off" from
thoughts of women and from clinging your heart to them, and do not have
union with them; because all this produces weakness in enthusiasm,
affects the firmness of determination, weakens against the enemy and
prevents from exerting in fighting. Whatever prevents from something is
called " 'adhaba 'anhu" i.e., turned away from it. Thus, "al-'adhib" and
"al-'adhub" mean one who gives up eating and drinking.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
و معناه: اصدِفوا عن ذكر النساء وشُغُلِ القلب بهن، وامتنعُوا من
المقاربة لهنّ، لاَن ذلك يَفُتُّ في عضُد الحميّة، ويقدح في معاقد
العزيمة ويكسِر عن العَدْوِ، وَيلفِتُ عن الاِبعاد في الغزو، وكلُّ من
امتنع من شيء فقد أعْذَبَ عنه، والعاذبُ والعَذُوب: الممتنع من الاَكل

  </p>
</blockquote>

**VIII.** **A tradition of Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, says:**
Like the successful shooter (al-yasir al-falij) who looks forward to
achieving success at his first shot.

> VIII. وفي حديثه عليه السلام : كَالْيَاسِرِ الْفَالِجِ يَنْتَظِرُ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَوَّلَ فَوْزةٍ مِنْ قِدَاحِهِ..
  </p>
</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** "al-ya~sirun' (pl. of al-yasir) means those
who shoot with arrows on the slaughtered camel by way of gambling; while
"al-falij" means successful or victorious. For example, it is said:
'falaja 'alayhim" or 'falajahum" (that is, he got victory over them or
overpowered them). A poet has said by way of war recital:

When I noticed a successful person securing victory.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

**IX.** **A tradition of Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, runs:**
When the crisis became red-hot we sought refuge with the Messenger of
Allah (peace-be upon him and his descendants), arid none of us was
closer to the enemy than he himself.

> IX. وفي حديثه عليه السلام : كُنَّا إِذَا احْمَرَّ الْبَأْسُ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اتَّقَيْنَا بِرَسُولِ اللهِ صلى الله عليه وآله ، فَلَمْ يَكُنْ أَحَدٌ
مِنَّا أَقْرَبَ إِلَى الْعَدُوِّ مِنْهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**as-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** This means that when fear of the enemy
increased and fighting became serious, the Muslims would begin to think
that since the Messenger of Allah had taken up fighting himself, Allah
must give them victory through him and that therefore they would be safe
from all the dangers because of his existence.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ومعنى ذلك: أنه إذا عَظُم الخوفُ من العدو واشتد عِضَاضُ الحربِ فَزِعَ
المسلمون إلى قتال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بنفسه، فيُنزِلُ الله
تعالى النصر عليهم، ويأمنون ما كانوا يخافونه بمكانه.
  </p>
</blockquote>

And the words "idha'hmarra'l-ba'su" (when the crisis became red-hot)
refers to the seriousness of the matter. For this purpose several
expressions have been used out of which this is the best one, since Amir
al-mu'minin has likened war with fire which combines heat and redness
both in action as well as colour. This is confirmed by the words of the
Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his descendants) when on the
day of Hunayn he noticed people of Hawazin (tribe) fighting he said,
"Now ‘watis’ has heated up" and ‘watis’ is the place where fire is
lighted. In this way, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his
descendants) likened the seriousness of fighting by men to the
seriousness of the fire and its flames.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وقوله: (إذا احمر البأس): كناية عن اشتداد الامر، وقد قيل في ذلك أقوال،
أحسنها أنه شبه حمى الحرب بالنار التي تجمع الحرارة والحمرة بفعلها
ولونها، ومما يقوى ذلك قول الرسول صلى الله عليه وآله وقد رأى مجتلد
الناس يوم حنين وهي حرب هوازن: (الان حمى الوطيس)، والوطيس: مستوقد
النار، فشبه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ما استحر من جلاد القوم
باحتدام النار وشدة التهابها.

**261. When the news of the attack of Mu'awiyah's men on al-Anbar
reached Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, he himself came out walking
till he reached an-Nukhaylah, where people overtook him and said:** "O'

You cannot be enough for me against yourselves, so how can you be enough
for me against others? Before me the people used to complain of the
oppression of their rulers but now I have to complain of the wrongful
actions of my people; as though I am led by them and they are the
leaders or that I am the subject and they are the rulers.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

**The narrator says:** When Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, uttered
this during his long speech which we have included in the collection of
sermons (No.27), two men from his companions advanced towards him and
one of them said: *I rule no one except myself and my brother* (Qur'an,
5:25). So, order us with your command, O Amir al-mu'minin and we will
accomplish it. **Thereupon, Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:**
How can you two accomplish what I aim at?

al-Harith! You have seen below yourself but not above yourself, and so
you have been confused. Certainly, you have not known right, so that you
can recognize the righteous. And you have not known wrong, so that you
can recognize the people of wrong! **Then al-Harith said:** In that
case, I shall withdraw along with Sa'd ibn Malik and 'Abdullah: ibn
'Umar; **whereupon Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Verily,
Sa'd and 'Umar have neither sided with Right nor forsaken Wrong. [^66]

-------------

**266. Someone asked Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, to define
faith for him, so he said:** Come to me tomorrow so that I enlighten you
in the presence of all the people, so that if you forget what I say
others might retain it, because an utterance is like a fluttering prey
which may be grappled with by someone but missed by others.

> 266. وسأَله عليه السلام رجل أَن يعرّفه ما الاِيمان. فقال: إِذَا كَانَ

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** We have already stated in the earlier

**267. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** O son of Adam, do
not inflict the worry of the day that has not yet come on the day which

its livelihood also.

Hadith n. 268
-------------

**268. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Have love for your

enemy some day; and hate your enemy up to a limit for it is possible
that he may turn into your friend some day.

Hadith n. 269
-------------

**269. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** There are two kinds
of workers in the world. One is a person who works in this world for
this world and his work of this world keeps him unmindful of the next
world. He is afraid of destitution for those he will leave behind but
feels himself safe about it. So, he spends his life after the good of
others. The other is one who works in this world for what is to come
hereafter, and he secures his share of this world without effort. Thus,
he gets both the benefits together and becomes the owner of both the
houses together. In this way, he is prestigious before Allah. If he asks
Allah anything He does not deny him.

> 269. وقال عليه السلام : النَّاسُ فِي الدُّنْيَا عَامِلاَنِ: عَامِلٌ

نَفْسِهِ، فَيُفْنِي عُمُرَهُ فِي مَنْفَعَةِ غَيْرِهِ. وَعَامِلٌ عَمِلَ
فِي الدُّنْيَا لِمَا بَعْدَهَا، فَجَاءَهُ الَّذِي لَهُ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا

Hadith n. 270
-------------

**270. It is related that during the days of (Caliph) 'Umar ibn
al-Khattab, the question of the excess of the ornaments of the Ka'bah
was mentioned to him and some people suggested:** If you prepare with it
an army of Muslims that will be a matter of great reward; and what would
the Ka'bah do with the ornaments? **'Umar thought of doing so but asked
Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, who said:**

> 270. وروي أنه ذكر عند عمر بن الخطاب في أيامه حَلْي الكعبةِ وكثرتُهُ،
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فقال قوم: لو أخذته فجهزتَ به جيوش المسلمين كان أَعظم للاَجر، وما تصنع
الكعبةُ بالْحَلْي؟ فهمّ عمر بذلك، وسأل عنه أميرالمؤمنين عليه السلام .
  </p>
</blockquote>

When the Qur'an was descended on the Prophet, peace be upon him and his
descendants, there were four kinds of property. One, the property of
Muslim individuals which he distributed among the successors according
to fixed shares. Second, the tax (fay') which he distributed to those
for whom it was meant. Third, the one-fifth (khums) levy for which Allah
had fixed the ways of disposal. Fourth, amounts of charity (sadaqat)
whose disposal was also fixed by Allah. The ornaments of Ka'bah did
exist in those days but Allah left them as they were, but did not leave
them by omission, nor were they unknown to Him. Therefore, you retain
them where Allah and His Prophet placed them.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فقال: إِنَّ القُرْآنَ أُنْزِلَ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وآله
وَالاْمْوَالُ أَرْبَعَةٌ: أَمْوَالُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ فَقَسَّمَهَا بَيْنَ
الْوَرَثَةِ فِي الْفَرَائِضِ، وَالْفَيْءُ فَقَسَّمَهُ عَلَى

وَالصَّدَقَاتُ فَجَعَلَهَا اللهُ حَيْثُ جَعَلَهَا. وَكَانَ حَلْيُ
الْكَعْبَةِ فِيهَا يَوْمَئِذٍ، فَتَرَكَهُ اللهُ عَلَى حَالِهِ، وَلَمْ
يَتْرُكْهُ نِسْيَاناً، وَلَمْ يَخْفَ عَلَيْهِ مَكَاناً، فَأَقِرَّهُ
حَيْثُ أَقَرَّهُ اللهُ وَرَسُولُهُ.

**Thereupon, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said:** If you had not been here we
would have been humiliated; **and he left the ornaments as they were**.

Hadith n. 271
-------------

**271. It is related that two persons were brought to Amir al-mu'minin,
peace be upon him. They had committed theft of public property. One of
them was a slave purchased from public money and the other had been
purchased by someone among the people. Then Amir al-mu'minin said:** As
for this one who is the property of public money, there is no punishment
for him for it means one property of Allah having taken another property
of Allah. As for the other, he should get the punishment.
**Consequently, his hand was cut.**

> 271. وروي أنه عليه السلام رُفع إليه رجلان سرقا من مال الله، أحدهما عبد
<blockquote dir="rtl">

Hadith n. 273
-------------

**273. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Know with full
conviction that Allah has not fixed for any person more livelihood than
what has been ordained in the Book of Destiny, even though his means (of
seeking it) may be great, his craving for it intense and his efforts for
it acute; nor does the weakness of a person or the paucity of his means
stand in the way between what is ordained in the Book of Destiny and
himself. He who realizes it and acts upon it is the best of them all in
point of comfort and benefit; while he who disregards it arid doubts it
exceeds all men in disadvantages. Very often a favoured person is being
slowly driven (towards punishment) through those favours; and very often
an afflicted person is being done good through his affliction.
Therefore, O listener, increase your gratefulness, lessen your haste and
stay within the bounds of your livelihood.

Hadith n. 275
-------------

**275. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Greed takes a person
to the watering place but gets him back without letting him drink. It
undertakes responsibility but does not fulfil it. Often the drinker gets
choked before the quenching of his thirst. The greater the worth of a
thing yearned for the greater is the grief for its loss. Desires blind
the eyes of understanding. The destined share will reach him who does
not approach it.

Hadith n. 276
-------------

**276. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** O My God, I seek
Your protection from this that I may appear to be good in the eyes of
the people whilst my inward self may be sinful before You, and that I
may guard myself (from sins) only for show before the people although
You are aware of all about me. Thus, I appear before the people in good
shape although my evil deeds are placed before You. This means achieving
nearness to Your creatures but remoteness from Your pleasure.

**289. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** In the past I had a

world was humble in his eyes, the needs of the stomach did not have sway

would not ask for more; most of his time he was silent, if he spoke he
silenced the other speakers, he quenched the thirst of questioners, he
was weak and feeble but at the time of fighting he was like the lion of
the forest or the serpent of the valley, he would not put forth an
argument unless it was decisive.

He would not reproach anyone in an excusable matter unless he had heard
the excuse, he would not speak of any ailment except after its
disappearance, he would say what he would do, and would not say what he
would not do, even if he could be exceeded in speaking, he could not be
excelled in silence; he was more eager to listen than to speak and if
two things confronted him he would see which was more akin to the
longing of the heart and he would oppose it.

**291. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said in condoling Ash'ath
ibn Qays about (the death of) his son:** O Ash' ath, if you grieve over
your son, certainly it is the consequence of the blood relationship; but
if you endure, then Allah provides recompense for every affliction. O
Ash'ath, if you endure even then matters will move on as ordained by
Allah but in that case you will deserve reward; while if you lose
patience, matters will again move as ordained by Allah, but in this case
you will be bearing the burden (of sins). O Ash'ath, your son (when he
lived) gave you happiness while, at the same time, he was a trial and
hardship and (when he died) he grieved you while, at the same time, he
has proved a source of reward and mercy for you.

**331. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** When the disabled
fall short in performing acts of obedience to Allah, the Glorified, it
is a good opportunity given by Allah for the intelligent to perform such
acts.

watchman of Allah on earth.

Hadith n. 333
-------------

**333. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said describing a
believer:** A believer has a cheerful face, a sorrowful heart, a very
broad chest (full of generosity), and a very humble heart. He hates high
position and dislikes renown. His grief is long, his courage is
far-reaching, his silence is much and, his time is occupied. He is
grateful, enduring, buried in his thoughts, sparing in his friendship
(with others), of bright demeanour and of soft temperament. He is
stronger than stone but humbler than a slave.

see the end of (his) life and his final fate, he will begin hating
desires and their deception.

-------------

**337. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** He who prays but

Hadith n. 338
-------------

**338. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Knowledge is of two
kinds - that which is absorbed and that which is just heard. The one
that is heard does not give benefit unless it is absorbed.

Hadith n. 339
-------------

**339. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Correctness of
decision goes together with power. The one emerges with the other's
emergence and disappears when the other disappears. [^85]

Hadith n. 343
-------------

**343. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Utterances are
preserved and actions are to be tried. *Every soul, for what it earned,
is held in pledge!* (Qur'an, 74:38). People are to be made deficient (as
regards their bodies) and meddled with (as regards their minds) except
those whom Allah protects. The questioner among them aims at confusing
and the answerer creates hardship. It is possible that the man who has
the best views among them will be deviated from the soundness of his
thinking by pleasure or displeasure, and it is possible that a single
glance may affect even the man with the 'best wisdom among them or a
single expression may transform him.

> 343. وَ قَالَ عليه السلام: الْأَقَاوِيلُ مَحْفُوظَةٌ وَ السَّرَائِرُ

Hadith n. 344
-------------

**344. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** O groups of people,
fear Allah, for there is many a man who aspires for what he does not
get, many a builder of a house who does not live in it, and many a
collector of that which he shall just leave behind. Possibly he may have
collected it wrongfully or by denying a right. He acquired it unlawfully
and had to bear the weight of sins on account of it. Consequently, he
returned (from this world) with that weight and came before Allah with
sorrow and grief. ***Loses he both this world and (also) the hereafter;
that is a loss (which is) manifest.*** **(Qur'an, 22:11)**

> 344. وَ قَالَ عليه السلام: مَعَاشِرَ النَّاسِ اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ فَكَمْ
<blockquote dir="rtl">

فَبَاءَ بِوِزْرِهِ وَ قَدِمَ عَلَى رَبِّهِ آسِفاً لَاهِفاً (قَدْ
خَسِرَ الدُّنْيا وَ الْآخِرَةَ ذلِكَ هُوَ الْخُسْرانُ الْمُبِينُ ).
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 345
-------------

**345. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Lack of access to
sins is also a kind of chastity.

> 345. وقال عليه السلام : مِنَ الْعِصْمَةِ تَعَذُّرُ الْمَعَاصِي.

Hadith n. 346
-------------

**346. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The dignity of your
face is solid but begging dissolves it away: therefore, look carefully
before whom you dissolve it.

> 346. وقال عليه السلام : مَاءُ وَجْهِكَ جَامِدٌ يُقْطِرُهُ السُّؤَالُ،
<blockquote dir="rtl">

فَانْظُرْ عِنْدَ مَنْ تُقْطِرُهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 347
-------------

**347. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** To praise more than
what is due is sycophancy; to do it less is either because of inability
to speak or of envy.

> 347. وقال عليه السلام : الثَّنَاءُ بِأَكْثَرَ مِنَ الاْسْتِحْقَاقِ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَلَقٌ وَالتَّقْصِيرُ عَنِ الاْسْتِحْقَاقِ عِيٌّ أَوْ حَسَدٌ.

Hadith n. 348
-------------

**348. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The most serious sin
is that which the doer considers light. [^86]

> 348. وقال عليه السلام : أَشدُّ الذُّنُوبِ مَا اسْتَهَانَ بِهِ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
صَاحِبُهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 349
-------------

**349. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** He who sees his own
shortcomings abstains from looking into other's shortcomings. He who
feels happy with the livelihood with which Allah provides him does not
grieve over what he misses. He who draws out the sword of revolt gets
killed with it. He who strives without means perishes. He who enters the
depths gets drowned. He who visits places of ill-repute receives blame.

> 349. وقال عليه السلام : مَنْ نَظَرَ فِي عَيْبِ نَفْسِهِ اشْتَغَلَ عَنْ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَيْبِ غَيْرهِ، وَمَنْ رَضِيَ برِزْقِ اللهِ لَمْ يَحْزَنْ عَلَى مَا

الاْمُورَعَطِبَ وَمَنِ اقْتَحَمَ اللُّجَجَ غَرِقَ، وَمَنْ دَخَلَ
مَدَاخِلَ السُّوءِ اتُّهِمَ،
  </p>
</blockquote>

He who speaks more commits more errors. He who commits more errors
becomes shameless. He who is shameless will have less fear of Allah. He
whose fear of Allah is less, his heart dies. He whose heart dies enters
the Fire.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَنْ كَثُرَ كَلاَمُهُ كَثُرَ خَطَؤُهُ، وَمَنْ كَثُرَ خَطَؤُهُ قَلَّ
حَيَاؤُهُ، وَمَنْ قَلَّ حَيَاؤُهُ قَلَّ وَرَعُهُ،مَنْ قَلَّ وَرَعُهُ
مَاتَ قَلْبُهُ، وَمَنْ مَاتَ قَلْبُهُ دَخَلَ النَّارَ،
  </p>
</blockquote>

He who observes the shortcomings of others and disapproves of them and
then accepts them for himself is definitely a fool. Contentment is a
capital that does not dwindle. He who remembers death much is satisfied
with small favours in this world. He who knows that his speech is also a
part of his action speaks less except where he has some purpose.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَنْ نَظَرَ فِي عُيُوبِ النَّاسِ فَأَنْكَرَهَا ثُمَّ رَضِيَهَا

بِالْيَسيرِ، مَنْ عَلِمَ أَنَّ كَلاَمَهُ مِنْ عَمَلِهِ قَلَّ كَلاَمُهُ
إِلاَّ فِيَما يَعْنيِهِ.

Hadith n. 350
-------------

**350. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The oppressor among
the people has three signs: he oppresses his superior by disobeying him,
and his junior by imposing his authority and he supports other
oppressors.

> 350. وقال عليه السلام : لِلظَّالِمِ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ ثَلاَثُ

Hadith n. 351
-------------

**351. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** At the extremity of
hardship comes relief, and at the tightening of the chains of
tribulation comes ease.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

</blockquote>

Hadith n. 352
-------------

**352. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said to one of his
companions:** Do not devote much of your activity to your wife and your
children, because if your wife and children are lovers of Allah then He
will not leave His lovers uncared for, and if they be enemies of Allah
then why should you worry and keep yourself busy about the enemies of
Allah.

> 352. وقال عليه السلام لبعض أصحابه: لاَ تَجْعَلَنَّ أَكْثَرَ شُغُلِكَ

أَعْدَاءَ اللهِ، فَمَا هَمُّكَ وَشُغُلُكَ بأَعْدَاءِ اللهِ؟
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hadith n. 353
-------------

**353. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The greatest defect
is to regard that defect (in others) which is present in yourself. [^87]

Hadith n. 354
-------------

**354. Someone congratulated another person in the presence of Amir
al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, on the birth of a son saying:**
Congratulations for getting a rider of horses. **Then Amir al-mu'minin
said:** Do not say so; but say: You have occasion to be grateful to
Allah, the Giver, and be blessed with what you have been given. May he
attain full life and may you be blessed with his devotion.

> 354. وهنَّأَ بحضرته عليه السلام رجل رجلاً بغلام ولد له فقال له:

Hadith n. 355
-------------

**355. One of the officers of Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, built
a stately house, about which Amir al-mu'minin said:** This is silver
coins showing forth their faces. Certainly, this house speaks of your
riches.

Hadith n. 356

**356. It was said to Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him:** If a man is
left in his house and the door is closed, from where will his livelihood
reach him. And he replied: From whatever way his death reaches him.

Hadith n. 357
-------------

**357. Condoling with people among whom one had died, Amir al-mu'minin,
peace be upon him, said:** This thing has not started with you nor does
it end with you. This fellow of yours was used to journeying and
therefore it is better to think him still to be journeying. Either he

Hadith n. 358
-------------

**358. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** O people, let Allah
see you fearing at the time of happiness just as you fear Him at the
time of distress. Certainly, he who is given ease (of life) and does not
consider it as a means of slow approach towards tribulation (wrongly),
considers himself safe against what is to be feared while he who is
afflicted with straitened circumstances but does not perceive them to be
a trial loses the coveted reward.

Hadith n. 359
-------------

**359. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** O slaves of desires,
cut them short because he who leans on the world gets nothing out of it
except the pain of hardships. O people, take charge of the training of
your own souls and turn them away from the addiction to their habits.

expression uttered by any person as evil if you can find it capable of
bearing some good.

Hadith n. 361
-------------

**361. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** If you have a need
from Allah, the Glorified, then begin by seeking Allah's blessing on His
Messenger, may Allah bless him and his descendants, then ask your need,
because Allah is too generous to accept one (seeking His blessing on His
Messenger) of the two requests made to Him and deny the other.

**362. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** He who is jealous of
his esteem should keep from quarrelling.

**363. Amir a1-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** To make haste before
the proper time or to delay after a proper opportunity, in either case
is folly.

**364. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Do not ask about
things which may not happen because you have enough to worry about with
what happens.

Hadith n. 365
-------------

**365. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Imagination is a
clear mirror, and the taking of lessons (from things around) provides
warning and counsel. It is enough for improving yourself that you should
avoid what you consider bad in others.

</blockquote>

Hadith n. 366
-------------

**366. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Knowledge is
associated with action. Therefore, he who knows should act, because
knowledge calls for action; if there is a response well and good,
otherwise it (i.e., knowledge) departs from him.

Hadith n. 367
-------------

**367. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** O people, the wealth
of this world is broken orts that brings an epidemic; therefore keep off
this grazing land, leaving it is a greater favour than peacefully
staying in it, and its part enough for subsistence is more blissful than
its riches. Destitution has been ordained for those who are rich here,
while comfort has been destined for those who keep away from it. If a
person is attracted by its dazzle, it blinds both his eyes; and if a
person acquires eagerness towards it, then it fills his heart with
griefs which keep alternating in the black part of his heart, some grief
worrying him and another giving him pain. This goes on till the
suffocation of death overtakes him. He is flung onto the open ground
while both his arteries are severed. It is easy for Allah to cause him
to die and for his comrades to put him in the grave.

The believer sees the world with eyes that derive instruction, and takes
from it food enough for his barest needs. He hears in it with ears of
hatred and enmity. If it is said (about someone) that he has become
rich, it is also said that he has turned destitute; and if pleasure is
felt on one's living, grief is felt over his death. This is the
position, although the day has not yet approached when they will be
disheartened.

Hadith n. 369
-------------

**369. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** A time will come
when nothing will remain of the Qur'an except its writing, and nothing
of Islam except its name. The mosques in those days will be busy with
regards to construction but desolate with regard to guidance. Those
staying in them and those visiting them will be the worst of all on
earth. From them mischief will spring up and towards them all wrong will
turn. If anyone isolates himself from it (mischief) they will fling him
back to it and if anyone steps back from it they will push him towards
it. Says Allah, the Glorified, (in hadith qudsi -- i.e., the tradition
in which Allah- Himself speaks): I swear by Myself that I shall send
upon them an evil wherein the endurer would be bewildered, and He would
do so. We seek Allah's pardon from stumbling through neglect.

Hadith n. 370

**370. It is related that it was seldom that Amir al-mu'minin, peace be
upon him, ascended the pulpit and did not utter the following before his
sermon:** O people, fear Allah for man has not been created for naught
so that he may waste himself, nor has he been left uncared for so that
he may commit nonsensical acts. This world which appears beautiful to
him cannot be the replacement of the next world which appears bad in his
eyes, nor is the vain person who is successful in this world through his
high courage like him who is successful in the next world even to a
small extent.

**371. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** There is no
distinction higher than Islam; no honour more honourable than fear of
Allah; no asylum better than self restraint; no intercessor more
effective than repentance; no treasure more precious than contentment;
and no wealth is a bigger remover of destitution than being satisfied
with mere sustenance. He who confines himself to what is just enough for
maintenance achieves comfort and prepares abode in ease. Desire is the
key of grief and the conveyance of distress. Greed, vanity and jealousy
are incentives to falling into sins and evil-doing is the collection of
all bad habits.

Hadith n. 372
-------------

**372. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said to Jabir ibn 'Abdullah
al-Ansari':** O Jabir, the mainstay of religion and the world are four
persons: The scholar who acts on his knowledge; the ignorant who does
not feel ashamed of learning; the generous who is not niggardly in his
favours; and the destitute who does not sell his next life for his
worldly benefits. Consequently, when the scholar wastes his knowledge,
the ignorant feels shame in learning; and when the generous is niggardly
with his favours, the destitute sells his next life for the worldly
benefits.

> 372. وقال عليه السلام لجابر بن عبدالله الاَنصاري: يَا جَابِرُ، قِوَامُ

O Jabir, if favours of Allah abound on a person the people's needs
towards him also abound. Therefore, he who fulfils for Allah all that is
obligatory on him in this regard will preserve them (Allah's favours) in
continuance and perpetuity, while he who does not fulfil those
obligations will expose them to decay and destruction.

with ('Abd' ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad) Ibn al-Ash'ath to fight al-Hajjaj
(ibn Yusuf ath-Thaqafi), that he (Ibn Abi Layla) was exhorting people to
jihad by recalling:** On the occasion of encounter with the people of
Syria I heard Amir al-mu'minin, may Allah exalt his degree of rank among

O believers, whoever observes excesses being committed and people being
called towards evil and disapproves it with his heart is safe and free
from responsibility for it, and whoever disapproves of it with his
tongue would be rewarded and he is in a higher position than the former
but whoever disapproves it with his sword in order that the word of
Allah may remain superior and the word of the oppressors may remain
inferior, catches hold of the path of guidance and stands on the right
way, while his heart is lighted with conviction.

Hadith n. 374
-------------

**374. Another saying in the same strain runs as follows:** So, among
them (the Muslim community) there is he who disapproves evil with his
hand, tongue and heart. This man has perfectly attained the virtuous
habits. And among them there is he who disapproves evil with his tongue
and heart but not with his hand. This man has attained only two virtuous
habits but lacks one. And among them there is the third one who
disapproves evil with his heart but not with his tongue and hand. This
is the one who lacks the two better qualities out of three and holds
only one. Then, among them there is also he who does not disapprove evil
either with his tongue, heart or hand. He is just a dead man among the
living.

All the virtuous deeds including war in the way of Allah as compared to
the persuasion to good and dissuasion from evil are just like spitting
in the deep ocean. The persuasion for good and dissuasion from evil do
not bring death nearer nor do they lessen the livelihood. And better
than all this is to utter a just expression before a tyrannical ruler.

livelihood is of two kinds: the livelihood which you seek and the
livelihood which seeks you; if you do not reach it, it will come to you
Therefore, do not turn your one day's worry into a year's worry.
Whatever you get every day should be enough for you for the day. If you
have a whole year of your life even then Allah, the Sublime, will give
you every next day what He has destined as your share. If you do not
have a year in your life then why should you worry for what is not for
you. No seeker will reach your livelihood before you nor will anyone
overpower you in the matter of livelihood. Similarly, whatever has been
destined as your share will not be delayed for you.

**384. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Leaning towards this
world despite what you see of it, is folly, and lagging behind in good
deeds when you are convinced of good reward for them is obvious loss,

**387. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** That good is no good

destitution is a calamity, but worse than destitution is ailment of the
body, while worse than bodily ailment is the disease of the heart.
Beware that plenty of wealth is a blessing, but better than plenty of
wealth is the health of the body, while still better than the health of
the body is the chastity of heart.

has three periods: The period when he is in communion with Allah; the
period when he manages for his livelihood; and the period when he is
free to enjoy what is lawful and pleasant. It does not behove a wise
person to be away (from his house) save for three matters, namely for
purposes of earning, or going for something for the next life or for
enjoying what is not prohibited.

not humiliation. Let it be little but not through others. He who does

days one for you and the other against you. When the day is for you, do

-------------

**399. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The child has a
right on the .father while the father too has a right on the child. The
right of the father on the child is that the latter should obey the
former in every matter save in committing sins of Allah, the Glorified,
while the right of the child on the father is that he should give him a
beautiful name, give him good training and teach him the Qur'an.

Hadith n. 400
-------------

**400. Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Evil effect of sight
is right; charm is right; sorcery is right, and fa'l (auguring good) is
right, while tiyarah (auguring evil) [^89] is not right, and spreading
of a disease from one to the other is not right. Scent gives pleasure,
honey gives pleasure, riding gives pleasure and looking at greenery
gives pleasure.

Hadith n. 402
-------------

**402. Someone uttered an expression above his position, then Amir
al-mu’minin, peace be upon him, said to him:** You have started flying
soon after growing feathers (*shakir*) and commenced grumbling before
attaining youth (*saqb*).

**Sayyid ar-Razi says:** Here, “*shakir*” [in the original Arabic text]
means the first feathers that grow on a bird before it is strong enough
to fly. And “*saqb*” means the young camel who does not grumble unless
it becomes mature.

Hadith n. 404
-------------

**404.** **On being asked the meaning of the expression**: "*la hawla
wala quwwata illa bi'llah* " (there is no strength nor power but by
means of Allah) . **Amir al-mu’minin, peace be upon him, said :** We are
not master of anything along with Allah, and we are not master of
anything save what He makes us master of. So, when He makes us master of
anything of which He is a superior Master over us, He also assigns some
duties to us; and when He takes it away He will take away those duties
as well. [^90]

Hadith n. 405
-------------

**405.** **Amir al-mu’minin, peace be upon him, heard Ammar ibn Yasir
(may Allah have mercy on him) conversing with al- Mughirah ibn Shu'bah

involved himself in misgivings in order to adopt them as cover for his
shortcomings.

Hadith n. 406
-------------

**406.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** How good it is
for the rich to show humility before the poor to seek reward from Allah,
but better than that is the haughtiness of the poor towards the rich
with trust in Allah.

Hadith n. 415
-------------

**415.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him,** said about the world:
It deceives, it harms and it passes away. Allah, the Sublime, did not
approve it as a reward for His lovers nor as a punishment for His
enemies. In fact, the people of this world are like those riders that as
soon as they alighted the driver called out to them and they marched
off.

Hadith n. 416
-------------

**416.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said** **to his son
al-Hasan (peace be upon him):** O my son, do not leave anything of this
world behind you, because you will be leaving it for either of two sorts
of persons: Either a person who uses it in obeying Allah, in this case
he will acquire virtue through what was evil for you, or it will be a
person who uses it in disobeying Allah and in that case he will be
earning evil with what you collected for him, and so you will be
assisting him in his sinfulness; and neither of these two deserves to be
preferred by you over yourself.

> 416. وقال لابنه الحسن: يا بُنَيَّ لاَ تُخَلِّفَنَّ وَرَاءَكَ شَيْئاً

</blockquote>

**Sayyid ar-Razi says:** This saying is also related in another version
thus:

Whatever of this world is now with you was with others before you, and
it will pass to some others after you. Thus, you are collecting things
for either of two sorts of men: a man who uses whatever you collected in
obedience of Allah and thus acquired virtues with what was evil for you,
or a man who uses it in disobeying Allah, so you will be getting evil
for what you collected. Neither of these two is such that you should
prefer him over your own self, or you may burden yourself for his own
sake. Therefore, hope for the mercy of Allah for him who has passed away
and for Divine livelihood for him who survives.

Hadith n. 417

**417.** **Someone said before Amir al-mu’minin, peace be upon him:**
"*Astaghfiru'llah*" (I ask Allah's forgiveness), **then Amir
al-mu’minin, peace be upon him, said:** Your mother may lose you! Do you
know what "*istighfar*" (asking Allah's forgiveness) is? "*Istighfar*"
is meant for people of a high position. It is a word that stands on six
supports. The first is to repent over the past; the second is to make a
firm determination never to revert to it; the third is to discharge all
the rights of people so that you may meet Allah quite clean with nothing
to account for; the fourth is to fulfil every obligation which you
ignored (in the past) so that you may now do justice with it; the fifth
is to aim at the flesh grown as a result of unlawful earning, so that
you may melt it by grief (of repentance) till the skin touches the bone
and a new flesh grows between them; and the sixth is to make the body
taste the pain of obedience as you (previously) made it taste the
sweetness of disobedience. On such an occasion you may say
"*astaghfiru'llah*".

sitting with his companions when a beautiful woman passed by them and
they began to look at her whereupn Amir al-mu’minin, peace be upon him,

cause of their becoming covetous. Whenever anyone of you sees a woman

not regard any part of it small because its small is big and its little

are people of good and evil. When you would leave either of the two,
others will perform them.

**430.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The worst in

Hadith n. 431

**431.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Livelihood is of
two kinds: the seeker and the sought. Therefore, he who hankers after
this world death traces him till it turns him out of it; but he who
hankers after the next world, worldly ease itself seeks him till he
receives his livelihood from it.

Hadith n. 432
-------------

**432.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Lovers of Allah
are those who look at the inward side of the world while others look at
its outward side, they busy themselves with remoter benefits while
others busy themselves in immediate benefits. They kill those things
which they feared would have killed them, and leave here in this world
what they think would leave them. They took amassing of wealth by others
as a small matter and regarded it like losing.

They are enemies of things others love while love things which others
hate. Through them, Quran has been learnt and they have been given
knowledge through Quran. Through them Quran is established while through
the Quran they are established. They do not see any object of hope above
what they hope and no object of fear above what they fear.

Hadith n. 434
-------------

**434.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Try (a man) and

**As-Sayyid ar-Razi says:** Some people say that this saying is of the
Prophet (p.b.u.h.), but what confirms that it is the saying of Amir
al-mu’minin (p.b.u.h.) is the statement related by Tha‘lab from Ibn
al-Arabi, that (caliph) al-Ma’mun said, “If Ali had not said ‘ukhbur

takhbur’ (hate a man in order to try him).”

Hadith n. 435
-------------

**435.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** It is not such
that Allah, to Whom belongs Might and Majesty, keeps open the door of
gratitude for a person and closes the door of plenty upon him, or that
He opens the door of prayer to a person and closes the door of
acceptance upon him, or that He opens the door of repentance for a
person and closes the door of forgiveness upon him.

Hadith n. 437
-------------

**437.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him,** **was asked:** Which
of the two is better; justice or generosity? **Amir al-mu'minin, peace
be upon him,** **replied**: Justice puts things in their places while
generosity takes them out from their directions; justice is the general
caretaker while generosity is a particular benefit. Consequently,
justice is superior and more distinguished of the two.

Hadith n. 439
-------------

**439.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The whole of
asceticism is confined between two expressions of the Quran. Allah, the
Glorified says:

 ***Lest distress you yourselves for what escapes you, and be overjoyous
for what He has granted you (Quran, 57:23).***

Whoever does not grieve over what he misses and does not revel over what
comes to him acquires asceticism from both its sides.

Hadith n. 443
-------------

**443.** **When the news of the death of (Malik) al-Ashtar (may Allah

**he said:** Malik, what a man Malik was! By Allah, if he had been a
mountain he would have been a great one (*find*), and if he had been a

Hadith n. 464
-------------

**464. Amir al-mu’minin, peace be upon him, said:** The Banu Umayyah
(Umayyids) have a fixed period (*mirwad*) wherein they are having their
way. But when differences arise among them then even if the hyena
attacks them it will overpower them.

  </p>
</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** Herein *‘‘mirward’’* is a form derived from
*‘‘irwad’’* which means to allow time, to wait for. It is an extremely
eloquent and wonderful expression. It is as though Amir al-mu’minin,
peace be upon him, has likened the period of Banu Umayyah to a limited
area meant for the training of horses for racing where they are running
towards the limit, so that when they reach its extremity their
organization will be destroyed. [^97]

Hadith n. 466
-------------

**466.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** The eye is the
strap of the rear.

> 466. وقال عليه السلام : الْعَيْنُ وِكَاءُ السَّهِ.

**as-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** This is a wonderful metaphor, it is as
though Amir al-mu’minin has likened the rear part of the body with a bag
and the eye with a strap. When the strap is let loose the bag cannot
retain anything. According to the well-known and reputed view it is the
saying of the Prophet but some people have stated it to be of Amir
al-mu’minin. Al-Mubarrad has mentioned it in his book *al-Muqtadab*
under the chapter ‘Words of single letters’. We too have discussed this
metaphor in our book named *Majazat al-athar an-nabawiyyah.*

Hadith n. 468
-------------

**468.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** A severe time
will come upon people wherein the rich will seize possessions with their
teeth although not commanded to do so. Allah the Glorified, says:

 ***Forget not generosity among yourselves (Quran, 2:237).***

During this time wicked will rise up while virtuous will remain low and
purchases will be made from helpless although the Prophet (S) has
prohibited purchasing from the helpless. [^98]

Hadith n. 469
-------------

**469.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said:** Two types of
persons will fall into ruin over me: The one who loves exaggerates and
the other who lays false and baseless blames.

> 469. وقال عليه السلام : يَهْلِكُ فِيَّ رَجُلاَنِ: مُحِبٌّ مُفْرِطٌ،
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** This is on the lines of Amir al-mu’minin’s
own saying which runs as: ‘‘Two categories of persons will be ruined
over me: the one who loves exaggeratingly and the hater and
malice-bearer.’’ [^99]

Hadith n. 470
-------------

**470.** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him,** **was asked on the
Unity of Allah and His justice, when he replied:** Unity means that you
do not subject Him to the limitations of your imagination and justice
means that you do not lay any blame on Him. [^100]

Hadith n. 472
-------------

**472**. **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him, said** **in his prayer
for seeking rain:** O My God, send us rain by submissive clouds not by
unruly ones.

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi** **says:** This is an expression of wonderful
eloquence, because Amir al-mu’minin, peace be upon him, has likened the
cloud which is accompanied by thunder, lighting, wind and flashes with
unruly camels who throw away their saddles and throw down their riders,
and likened the clouds free from these terrible things to the submissive
camels which are easy to milk and obedient to ride.

**476.** **When** **Amir al-mu'minin, peace be upon him,** **put Ziyad
ibn Abih in place of Abdullah ibn Abbas over Fars (in Persia) and its
revenues, he had a long conversation with him in which he prohibited him
from advance recovery of revenue. Therein he said:** Act on justice and
keep aloof from violence and injustice because violence will lead them
to forsake their abodes while injustice will prompt them to take up
arms.

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi** **says:** It is said ‘‘*hashamahu’’* or
*‘‘ahshamahu’’* to mean ‘‘He enraged him’’. According to another view it
means ‘‘He humiliated him’’. While *‘‘ihtashamahu’’* means ‘‘He sought
these for him’’, and that is most likely to cause him to separate.

This is the end of our selection of the utterances of Amir al-mu’minin,
peace be upon him, We are praiseful to Allah, the Glorified, for having
enabled us to collect the scattered utterances from various sides and to
bring together from different places the material that was lying far
away. We intend, as we stipulated in the beginning, to leave some blank
pages at the end of every chapter for the insertion of whatever we may
get and the addition of whatever comes to us, for it is possible that
some material which is not in our view at present or which is not
available may become known to us and fall in our hands. We have no
ability save through Allah. In Him we trust, and He is Sufficient for
us. He is the best Supporter.

This book was completed in the month of *Rajab,* in the year 400 A.H.

May Allah send blessings on our master Muhammad the last of the prophets
who guided us towards the best path, and his chaste descendants and his
companions who are the stars of conviction.

[^1]: Labun" means a milch camel and "ibnu'l-labun" means its two year
old young. In this age the young is neither suitable for riding nor does
it has udders which could be milked. It is called "ibnu'l-labun" because
in this period of two years its mother bears another young and begins
yielding milk again. The intention is that during civil disturbance or
trouble a man should behave in such a manner that lie may be regarded of
no consequence and ignored. No need should be felt for his participation
in either party". This is because during mischief only dissociation can
save from molestation. Of course, when the clash is between right and
wrong it is not permissible to keep aloof nor can it be called civil
disturbance: but on such occasions it is obligatory to rise up for the
support of right and suppression of wrong. For example, (luring the
battles of jamal and Siffin it was obligatory to support the right and
to fight against the wrong.

[^2]: In the last phrase, Amir al-mu'minin has described the
consequences and effects resulting from self-admiration namely that it
creates the feeling of hatred and humiliation-against others. Thus, the
man who manifests his greatness by every pretext in order to make
himself conspicuous is never regarded with esteem. People begin to
despise him because of his mental condition in seeking self-conspicuity
and are not prepared to accord him the worth which he really has, much
less to regard him as he himself thinks to be.

[^3]: This saying comprises of two phrases:- The first sentence relates
to charity and Amir al-mu'minin has described it as an effective cure,
because when a man helps the poor and the destitute by alms they pray
for his health and recovery from the depth of their hearts and therefore
their prayer is granted and brings him cure. In this connection, there
is the saying of the Holy Prophet that, "Cure your sick by charity." The
second sentence relates to the disclosure of actions on the Day of
Judgement, namely that the good and bad deeds which a person performs in
this world cannot be perceived by human senses because of the veil of
material elements but on the Day of Judgement when material curtains
will be lifted they will so appear before the eyes that there will be no
possibility of denial by anyone. Thus, Allah has said: On that day shall
come out people (from their graves) in (scattered) groups, to be shown
their own deeds. Then he who has done an atom-weight of good shall see
it. And he who has done an atom-weight of evil shall see it. (Qur'an,
99:6-8)

[^4]: The meaning is that when a man's fortune is helpful and the world
is favourable to him then people describe his performances with
exaggeration and give credit to him for others' actions as well, while
if a man loses the favour of the world and the clouds of ill-luck and
misfortune engulf him, they ignore his virtues and do not at all
tolerate even to recall his name. They are friends of him whom the world
favours and the foes of him whom the world hits.

[^5]: To the person who behaves with others with benignity and
manner-liness, people extend their hand of cooperation, they honour and
respect him and shed tears after his death. Therefore, a person should
lead such an agreeable life that no one should have any complaint
against him, nor should any harm be caused by him to anyone so that
during life he should attract others and after death too he should be
remembered in good words

[^6]: The occasion for pardon and forgiveness is when there is power to
take revenge. But when there is no such power, then pardon is just the
result of helplessness, for which there is no credit. However, to
practise pardon despite having power and the ability to avenge is the
essence of human distinction and an expression of thanks to Allah for
bestowing this power, because the feeling of gratefulness necessitates
that man should bow before. Allah in humbleness and humiliation by which
the delicate feeling of pity and kindness will arise in his heart and
the rising flames of rage and anger will cool down after which there
will be no urge to take revenge under the effect of which he would use
his power and capability to satisfy his anger instead of using it
properly.

[^7]: It is not difficult to attract others by good manners and
cheerfulness and to befriend them by sweet speech because no physical
exertion or mental worry is required for this: and after making friends
it is still easier to maintain the friendship and good relations because
for making friends some effort or other is needed while for maintaining
it no difficulty is to be surmounted. Therefore, no one can be more
wretched than the man who cannot even retain a thing which could be
retained just by keeping away a frown from the face. The intention is
that a man should meet everyone with good manners and cheerfulness so
that people may like to associate with him and extend a hand of
friendship towards him.

[^8]: Amir al-mu'minin uttered this sentence when Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas,
Muhammad ibn Maslamah and 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar refused to support him
against the people of Jamal. He means to say that these people are so
against me that neither have my words any effect on them nor do I need
to reprove, rebuke or correct them.

[^9]: The intention is that since in the beginning of Islam the number
of Muslims was limited it was necessary to keep them distinct from the
Jews in order to maintain their collective entity, so the Prophet
ordered the use of hair-dye which was not in use among the Jews.
Besides, it was also the aim that when facing the enemy the people
should not appear old in age and weak.

[^10]: This saying is about those who claimed to be neutrals, such as
'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, Abu Musa al-Ash'ari, al-Ahnaf
ibn Qays, Muhammad ibn Maslamah, Usamah ibn Zayd and Anas ibn Malik,
etc. No doubt these people did not openly support wrong but not to
support right is also a kind of support of wrong. Therefore, they will
be counted among the opponents of right.

[^11]: However had a thing may be regarded among the people and
however it may be looked down upon, if it is not really bad then to feel
bashful about it is quite foolish, because it will often cause deprival
from things which are the source of successes and achievements in this
as well as the next world. For example, if a man fears lest people may
regard him to be ignorant and therefore feels bashful in asking an
important and necessary issue then this misplaced bashfulness would
result in his being deprived of knowledge. Therefore, no sane person
should feel bashful about making enquiries. Thus, an old man who was
learning despite old age was asked whether he did not feel ashamed of
learning in old age and he replied: "I do not feel shame for ignorance
during old age, then how can I feel shame for learning in old age." Of
course, to feel shame in doing things which are really bad and
mischievous is the essence of humanity and nobility; for instance, those
immoral acts which are bad according to religion, intelligence and
ethics. In any case, the first kind of bashfulness is bad and the second
one is good. In this connection, the Holy Prophet's saying is that:
Bashfulness is of two kinds, bashfulness of intelligence and bashfulness
of foolishness. The bashfulness of intelligence is knowledge whereas the
bashfulness of foolishness is ignorance.

[^12]: The sense of the interpretation written by as-Sayyid ar- Radi is
that Amir al-mu'minin intends to say that if our right, that lies with
others in our position, as with the Imam whom it is obligatory to obey,
is acknowledged and we are given the chance of worldly rule well and
good, otherwise, we will have to bear all sorts of hardships and
ignominies and we shall be compelled to live this life of ignominy and
humiliation for a long time. Some commentators have stated a different
meaning than this, namely that "If our position is belittled and put
aside, and others are given precedence over us, we shall bear it
patiently and agree to remain behind" and this is what is meant by
riding on the hind part of the camel, because the person who rides on
the hind part is on the rear while the person who sits on its back is in
the fore. Some people take it to mean that if we are allowed our right
we will accept it but if it is not given we shall not behave like the
rider who gives over the rein of his animal into the hands of some other
person who is free to take him wherever he likes but we shall stick to
our right even though a long time may elapse and not surrender to the
usurpers.

[^13]: When a person goes on receiving favours despite sinfulness he
develops the misunderstanding that Allah is pleased with him and that
this is the result of His pleasure, because increase in favours arises
out of gratefulness and in the event of ungratefulness the bestowal of
favours stops, as Allah says: And when declared your Lord: "If you be
grateful I will increase (My favours) to you, and if you be ungrateful,
verily My torment is indeed severe." (Qur'an, 14:7) Nevertheless,
continuous bestowal of favours, despite disobedience and ungratefulness,
cannot be the result of Allah's pleasure, nor can it he said that in
this way Allah has put him under the misconception that he should regard
this exuberance of favours as the result of Allah's pleasure because
when he knows that he is a sinner and disobedient and is commiting sins
and vices, knowing them to be sins and vices, then there are no grounds
for misconception on his part by assuming Allah 's pleasure and consent.
He should rather think that this is a sort of trial and respite for when
his sinfulness and high-handedness reaches its zenith he will be caught
all at once. Therefore, in such a case he should keep waiting as to when
Allah 's favours are taken away from him and he is punished with
deprival and discomfiture.

[^14]: The things which a man wants to conceal from others do come out
through his tongue sometime or another, and his effort at concealment is
unsuccessful. This is because although the far-sighted mind desires to
keep them concealed yet sometimes it gets entangled in some more
important matter and becomes careless on this score when the concealed
thing comes out in words through his tongue. When the mind becomes
attentive, it is not possible to undo the matter just as an arrow cannot
be got back after shooting. Even if this is not the case and mind is
fully cautious and attentive, the thing cannot remain concealed because
the lines of the face are indicative of mental feelings and reflect the
heart's emotions, and consequently redness of face can easily point out
to the sense of shame, and its yellowness fear.

[^15]: The intention is that as long as sickness does not become serious
do not give it importance, because by giving importance the feelings get
affected and the illness increases. Therefore, continued activity and
regarding oneself well dispels sickness and also prevents the power of
resistance from getting weak, and keeps up its psychological power,
while the psychological power curbs small ailments by itself, provided
it is not forced to give up resistance by the surrendering the
imagination to the ailment.

[^16]: Khabbab ibn al-Aratt was a distinguished companion of the Holy
Prophet and was one of the early muhajirun (immigrants). He suffered
various sorts of hardships at the hands of the Quraysh. He was made to
stand in the scorching sun, and to lie on fire but he did not for any
reason abandon the side of the Holy Prophet. He accompanied the Holy
Prophet in Badr and other battles. He supported Amir al-mu'minin in
Siffin and Nahrawan. He had left Medina and settled in Kufah. Thus, he
died here in 39 A.H. at the age of 73, Amir al-mu'minin led his funeral
prayer and he was buried outside Kufah. Amir al-mu'minin uttered these
mercy-invoking words standing on his grave.

[^17]: This is one of the authentic traditions (ahadith) of the Holy
Prophet whose authenticity the scholars of traditions had never doubted.
It was narrated by certain companions of the Holy Prophet such as
'Abdullah ibn al-'Abbas, 'Imran ibn al-Husayn, Umm al-mu'minin Umm
Salamah and others, such as Amir al-mu'minin himself, also narrated
that: By Him Who split the seed and created the soul, verily the
Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his progeny, gave me a promise
that no one but a (true) believer will love me, and none but a hypocrite
will hate me. (as-Sahih., Muslim, vol.1, p.60; [Muslim, in his book,
regards the love of 'Ali as an ingredient of iman or faith and one of
its signs; and the hatred of 'Ali as the sign of dissemblance] al-Jami'
as-sahih, vol.5, pp.635,643; as-Sunan, Ibn Majah, VOl.1, p.55; as-Sunan,
an-Nasa'i, vol.8, pp.115- 116,117; al-Musnad, Ah mad ibn Hanbal, vol.1,
pp.84,95,128; vol.6, p.292; ' Ilal al-hadith, Abu Hatim, vol.2, p.400;
Hilyah al-awlya', Abu Nu'aym, vol4, p.l85; Jami' al-usul, Ibn al-Athir,
vol.9, p.473; Majma' az-zawa'id, vol.9, p.133; Manaqib 'Ah ibn Abi
Talib, Ibn al-Maghazili, pp.190-195; al-Isti'ab, vol.3, p.1100; Usd
al-ghabah, vol.4, p.26; al-Isabah, vol.2, p.509: Tarikh Baghdad, vol.2,
p.255; vol.8, p.417; vol.14, p.426; at-Tarikh, Ibn Kathir, vol.7, p.354)
It was in this way that the companions of the Holy Prophet used to test
the faith (iman) or hypocrisy (nifaq) of the Muslims through their love
or hatred towards Amir al-mu'minin, as is related from Abu Dharr
al-Ghifari, Abu Sa\`id al-Khudri, 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud and Jabir ibn
'Abdullah that: We (the companions of the Holy prophet) used to
distinguish the hypocrites by their hatred of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib.
(at-Tirmidhi, vol.5, p.635; al-Mustadrak, vol.3, p. 129; Hilyah
al-awliya', vol.6, p.294; Majma' az-zawa'id, vol.9, pp.132 133; Jami'
al-usul, vol.9, p. p.473; ad-Durr al-manthur, vol.6, pp.66-67; Tarikh
Baghdad, vol.13, p. 153; ar-Riyad an-nadirah, vol. 2, pp.214, 215;
al-Isti'ab, vol.3, p. 1110; Usd al-ghabah, vol.4, pp.29-30)

[^18]: The person who feels ashamed and repentant after committing sin
and offers repentance before Allah remains safe from the penalty of that
sin and deserves the reward of repentance: while the person who after
doing a virtuous deed begins to feel superiority over others, and being
proud of his virtues thinks that he has no apprehension whatever,
destroys his virtue and remains deprived of the reward of the virtuous
deed. Obviously, he who has erased the blot of his sin by repentance
will be better than he who has ruined his action by being proud of it,
and having not repented of it either.

[^19]: The meaning is that a man of prestige and esteem never tolerates
humiliation or disgrace. If his honour is assailed he will leap like a
hungry lion and break away the shackles of humiliation. If a low and
narrow minded person is raised beyond his name he would not be able to
contain himself but, regarding himself very high, will assail other's
position.

[^20]: This saying confirms the theory that by nature human hearts love
wildness and that the feeling of love and affection in them is an
acquired attribute. Consequently, when the factors and causes of love
and affection crop up they get tamed hut when these factors disappear or
the feelings of hatred are created against them, the people return to
wildness, and thereafter they return to the path of love and affection
with great difficulty. Do not tease the heart because it is a wild bird.
If once it flies away from the roof it would come down with great
difficulty.

[^21]: A person who has wealth and riches will get friends and
acquaintances wherever he may be and therefore he will not feel strange
in a foreign land; but if he is poor and destitute he will have no
friends even in his homeland because people do not like to make friends
with the poor and the destitute, or to extend relations with them. He is
therefore, a stranger even at home and has no friends or well-wishers.
He who has no worldly successor remains unknown as a stranger even in
his homeland.

[^22]: Contentment means that a man should remain satisfied with what he
gets and should not complain if he gets less. if he is not so contented
he will try to satisfy his greed by committing social crimes like
misappropriation, cheating and deceiving others, because greed compels
one to satisfy one's wants by any means whatever. Then the satisfaction
0f one's want opens the way for another want and as a man's wants get
satisfied his craving increases and he can never get rid of his needs or
of dissatisfaction. This increasing dissatisfaction can be stopped only
by contentment which makes a man carefree from all wants except the most
essential ones. This is that everlasting wealth that gives satisfaction
for good.

[^23]: The shame that is faced in putting a request before an
inappropriate person gives more mental pain than the grief in not
obtaining its fulfilment. That is why non-fulfilment of a request can be
tolerated but the obligation to a low and base person is intolerable.
Every self-respecting person would therefore prefer deprivation to being
under obligation to an inappropriate man, and would not tolerate placing
his request before a low and base person.

[^24]: Talkativeness is the result of diffused thinking while diffusion
of thought is the result of the unripeness of wisdom. When wisdom
attains perfection and understanding ripens one's mind, and thoughts are
balanced, and wisdom acquires power and control over the tongue, as over
other parts of the body, the tongue does not act without thinking or
outside the dictates of wisdom. Obviously, uttering after thinking is
short and free from extras. As a man's intelligence increases his
speaking decreases and he does not speak save at the opportune moment.

[^25]: That is just as each step makes way for the other and this
exercise by steps is the means of nearing the goal, similarly every
breath of life serves as, death-knell for the previous one and carries
life towards death, as if the breath whose motion is regarded as a sign
of life is in fact the sign of the passing away of one moment of life
and a means of nearing the goal of death, because each breath is death
for the previous one, and life is the name of those very death -carrying
breaths. Every breath is the dead body of the life that passed by. Life
is the name of living by facing successive deaths.

[^26]: By looking at a seed a cultivator can say what plant will come
out of it, what fruits, flowers or leaves it will have and what will be
its expanse. In the same way, a guess can be made about the success of a
student by looking at his labour and effort or about the failure of some
other student by looking at his leisureliness and idleness, because the
beginning is indicative of the end and the premises of the conclusion.
Therefore, if the end of any matter is not visible then its beginning
should be looked at. If its beginning is bad the end too would be bad
and if tile beginning is good the end too would be good. An auspicious
river begins from the very spring.

[^27]: Dirar ibn Damrah was one of the companions of Amir al-mu'minin.
After the death of Amir al-mu'minin, he went to Syria (ash-Shim) where
he met Mu'awiyah. Mu'awiyah asked him, "Describe 'Ah to me." He replied,
"Would you please excuse me from answering this?" But Mu'awiyah
insisted, "You must describe him." Whereupon Dirar said: If there is no
alternative, then you should know that 'Ali was a man whose personality
knew no limits, terrible in power, his speech was decisive, his
judgements based on justice, his knowledge spread out in all directions
and wisdom was manifest in all his behaviour. Among the food he liked
most was the coarse kind and among the clothes, the short (and humble)
ones. By Allah, he was among us as one of us. He used to respond to our
questions and fulfil all our requests. By Allah, although be used to let
us get close to him and he himself was close to us, we did not dare
address him due to our feeling of awe towards him nor did we dare to
speak first due to his greatness in our hearts. His smile displayed a
row of pearls. He used to honour the pious; to be kind to the needy, to
feed the orphan, the near of kin or the needy man in misery on the day
of huuger; to clothe the bare ones and to help the undefended person. He
used to detest the world and its flowering. I stand witness that. . .
(and so forth, as quoted above by as-Sayyid ar-Radi). When Mu'awiyah
heard this from Dirar his eyes filled with tears and he said, "May Allah
have mercy on Abu'l-Hasan. He really was so." Then, turning to Dirar he
said, "How do you feel in his absence, O' Dirar!" Dirar replied, "My
grief is like that of a woman whose only child is butchered in her
arms." (al Isti'ib, vol.3, pp.1107-1108; Hilyah al-awlya', vol.2, p.84;
Sifatu's-Safwah, Ibn al-Jawzi, vol.1, p.121;aI-Amali; Abu 'Ali al-Qali,
vol.2. p.147: Zahr al-adab, al-Husri, vol.1, pp.40-41; Muruj adh-dhahab,
vol.2, p.42l: ar-Riyad an-nadirah, al-Muhibb at-Tabari, vol.2, p.212;
Ibn Abi'l-Hadid, vol.18, pp.225 -226)

[^28]: The' end of this story is that after this the man enquired, "What
kind of destiny it was by which we had to go?" and Amir al-mu'minin
said, "qada' (destiny)" means command of Allah. For example, He has
said, "wa qada rabbuka alla ta'budu illa iyyihu" (And commanded your
Lord has that you shall worship not [any one] but Him" [Qur'an, 17:
23]). Here "qada' " stands for commanded.

[^29]: The real value of a person is his knowledge (and perfection of
attainments), his worth and position would be in accordance with the
position of knowledge and attainment he holds. Eyes that are conscious
of real values do not look at the face, features, tallness of stature,
size or worldly pomp and position but look at the attainments of a
person and assess his worth according to these attainments. The
conclusion is that a man should strive to acquire distinction and
knowledge. The worth of every person is according to the extent of his
knowledge.

[^30]: As Allah says: . . ., Verily, Allah do accept (an offering only)
from those who guard (themselves against evil). (Qur'an, 5:27)

[^31]: Perhaps the other meaning of this saying is that: "Whoever loves
us should not hanker after worldly matters even though in consequence he
may have to face destitution and poverty; but he should rather remain
content and avoid seeking worldly benefits."

[^32]: During autumn, protection from cold is necessary because with the
change of weather the temperature of the body also changes and ailments
such as flue, catarrh, cough etc., occur. This is because bodies are
accustomed to hot weather and when suddenly cold comes on tissues become
contracted and cold dryness increases in the body. Thus, bathing with
cold water soon after bathing with hot water is harmful for this very
reason that with hot water the tissues expand and so they at once admit
the effect of cold water, and in consequence the natural heat of the
body is affected. On the other hand, there is no need of protection from
cold during spring season nor is it harmful for the health, because the
body is already accustomed to cold. Thus, the temperate cold of the
spring is not unpleasant to the body. Rather, with the decline of cold
there is an increase of heat and dampness in the body as a result of
which growth gets impetus, natural heat rises, the body grows, the
temperament feels pleasant and the spirit is joyful. Similarly, there is
the same effect in the plant world. Thus, during autumn due to the
prevalence of coldness and dryness, the leaves wither, the vegetative
power decreases, the freshness of the plants fades and there is a
death-like effect on the green areas. Spring brings the message of life
for them. Then with the blowing of healthy winds the blossoms begin to
sprout, plants become fresh and healthy, and forests and wildernesses
acquire a green hue.

[^33]: Every speaker and preacher manifests the force of his speaking in
subjects in which he is well-versed. If he has to change the subject
neither will his mind move nor will his tongue be able to speak out. But
he whose intellect has the capability of adaptation and whose mind has
the power of imagination can turn round his utterances in whatever
manner he likes, and can show the excellence of speaking on whatever
subject he desires. Consequently, when the tongue which had for so long
been abusing the world and unveiling its deceitfulness starts praising
the world it shows the same mastery of speaking and power of arguing
that had ever been its chief distinction And then, the use of
commendatory words does not alter the principle and although the ways
are different the object remains the same.

[^34]: Kumayl ibn Ziyad an-Nakha\`i was the holder of the secrets of the
Imamate and one of the chief companions of Amir al-mu'minin. He held a
great position in knowledge and attainment and a chief place in
abstinence and Godliness. He was Amir al-mu'minin's Governor of Hit for
sometime. He was killed by al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath-Thaqafi in the year
83 A.H. at the age of ninety years and was buried outside Kufah.

[^35]: The meaning is that a man's worth can be known by his speech
because the speech of every person is indicative of his mind and
manners, and by virtue of it his feelings and temperament can be very
easily assessed. Therefore, so long as he is silent his weaknesses as
well as attainments are concealed but when he speaks his real self
manifests itself. A man is hidden under his tongue; unless he speaks you
cannot know his worth and value.

[^36]: Just as Allah sent down a series of prophets by way of His
Justice and Mercy to guide and direct towards religion, in the same way
He laid down the system of the Imamate to protect religion from
alteration and change so that every Imam may in his time save the Divine
teachings from the onslaught of personal desires and give directions
about the correct precepts of Islam. And just as it is obligatory to
know the originator of the religion (i.e., the Prophet) in the same way
it is necessary to know the protector of the religion and lie who
remains ignorant of him cannot be excused because tile issue of Imamate
is supported by so many proofs and testimonies that no intelligent
person can find any way to deny it. Thus, the holy Prophet has said:
Whoever dies without knowing the Imam of his time dies a pre-Islamic
(jahiliyyah) death. (Sharh al-maqasid, at-Taftazini ash- Shafi'i, vol.
2, p.275; al-Jawahir al-mudiyyah, al-Khatib al-Hanafi, vol.2, pp.
457,509). It has also been narrated by \`Abdullah ibn 'Umar, Mu'awiyah
ibn Abi Sufyan and \`Abdullah ibn al-'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah,
peace be upon him and his descendants, said that: One who dies without
(knowing his) Imam and binding himself by an oath of allegiance to him
will die the death of one belonging to the days of jahiliyyah, and one
who withdraws his hand from obedience (to the Imam) will find no
argument (in his Defence) when he stands before Allah on the L)ay of
Judgement. (al-Musnad, at1'ayliisi, p.259; as-Sahih, Muslim, vol.6,
p.22; al-Musnad, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, vol.4, p.96; as-Sunan al-kubra,
al-Bayhaqi, vol.8, p.156; at-Tafsir, Ibn Kathir, vol. 1, p.517; Majma'
az-zawa'id, vol.5, pp.218, 224, 225) Ibn Abi'l-Hadid also agrees that
the personality about whom no one's ignorance can be excused is that of
Amir al-mu'minin. He also acknowledges the obligation to obey him and
holds that he who does not believe in the issue of Imamate will not
achieve deliverance. In this connection he writes: He who is ignorant of
the position of 'Ali, peace be upon him, as Imam and denies its veracity
or obligatory character would, according to our associates, remain in
Hell for ever, his fasting or prayers being of no avail to him, because
the knowledge of this matter is among the basic principles which
constitute the foundations of religion. However, we do not regard one
who denies his Imamate as an unbeliever but only a sinner, a
transgressor or a deviator, etc. (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah al-balaghah,
vol.18, p.373)

[^37]: If evil is done in return for evil, and abuse in return for
abuse, the door for animosity and quarrel is opened. But if an evil-doer
is met with kindness and gentleness he too would be compelled to change
his behaviour. Thus, once Imam Hasan was passing through the market
place of Medina when a Syrian noticing his majestic personality enquired
from the people who he was and on being told that he was Hasan son of
'Ali (peac0e be upon him) he was exasperated and coming close to him
began to abuse him. The Imam heard him quietly. When he finished the
Imam said, "You seem to be a stranger here". He acknowledged this and
the Imam continued, "Then you had better come with me and stay with me.
If you have any need I shall fulfil it, and if you need financial
assistance I shall render it." When he saw this kindness and fine
manners in return for his harsh and hard words he was extremely ashamed,
and admitting his fault sought his forgiveness. When he left the Imam,
he did not have better regard for anyone else on the surface of the
globe. (al-Kamil, al-Mubarrad, v61. 1, p.235; vol.2, p.63; Nihayah
al-irab, an-Nuwayri, vol.6, p.52; Matalib as-sa'ul, Ibn Talhah
ash-Shafi'i, vol. 2, pp.11 -12; al-Manaqib, Ibn Shahrashub, vol.4, p.19;
al-Bihar, al-Majlisi, vol.43, p.344) If you are a proper human being do
good to the evil-doer.

[^38]: A person who seeks perfection and believes that he is still in
need of it can be expected to attain the aim of perfection, but a person
who is under the illusion that he has reached the zenith of progress and
perfection will not feel the need to strive to attain it, but according
to his own view he has already traversed all the stages of perfection
and now he has no stage in sight to strive for. Thus, this vain and
illusioned man ill always remain deprived of perfection and this vanity
will end all possibility of his rise.

[^39]: It is not as difficult to keep aloof from sin the first time as
it is after becoming familiar with it and tasting it, because a man does
not feel difficulty in doing a thing to which he has become habituated,
but it is really hard to give it up. As habits become confirmed, the
conscience becomes weaker and difficulties crop up in the way of
repentance. To console the heart by postponing repentance is therefore
usually with out avail. Surely, when there is difficulty in keeping off
sin even in the beginning the lengthening of the period of sins will
make repentance still more difficult.

[^40]: This is a proverb which is used when a man runs after one
advantage so vehemently that he has to give up several other advantages,
like the man who eats too much or against his appetite and has to go
subsequently without several meals.

[^41]: A man attaches great importance to the science and art which he
knows and regards that science of no importance which he does not know,
and belittles it. This is because whenever such a matter is discussed he
is regarded not worthy of attention and is ignored, and thereby he feels
slighted. This slight pains him, and a man naturally dislikes a thing
that pains him and hates it. In this connection, Plato was asked, "What
is the reason that he who does not know hates him who does know, but he
who knows does not bear malice or hatred towards him who does not know?"
Here plied, "He who does not know realizes that he suffers from a defect
and thinks that he who knows must regard him low and humble on account
of this defect, so he hates him. On the other hand he who knows does not
have the idea that he who does not know should regard him low and so
there Is no reason why he should hate him."

[^42]: The person who rises to face wrong for the sake of Allah is
afforded support and assistance from Allah and, despite lack of power
and means, the forces of wrong cannot shake his determination or create
a tremor in his steady feet. But if there is a tinge of personal benefit
in his action he can be very easily prevented from his aim.

[^43]: This means. that the giving of full reward to the virtuous for
their good actions and appreciating them puts the evil-doers also on the
right path. This is more effective than ethical preaching, warning and
rebuke. This is because by temperament man inclines towards things from
which benefits accrue to him, and his ears (yearn to) resound with
eulogies in praise and admiration of him.

[^44]: This sentence can be interpreted in two ways. One is that if you
bear malice against anyone, he too will bear malice against you.
Therefore, destroy the malice from his heart by removing it from your
heart, since your heart is the index of other's heart. If your heart
will have no malice there will remain no malice in his heart too. That
is why a man assesses the purity of another person's heart by the purity
of his own heart. Thus, a man asked his friend, "How much do you love
me?" and the reply was: “your own heart." That is, "I love you as much
as you love me." The second interpretation is that if you want to
dissuade another person from evil, first you should refrain yourself
from that evil. In this way, your advice can be effective on others,
otherwise it will remain ineffective.

[^45]: Ibn Abi'l-Hadid ( 'Izzu'd-Din 'Abd al-Hamid ibn Hibatul'llah
al-Mu'tazili [586/1190-655/1257]) says: "The saying of Amir al-mu'minin
in the form of prose and poetry was intended for Abu Bakr and 'Umar. In
his prose he addressed 'Umar, because when Abu Bakr asked 'Umar (on the
day of Saqifah): 'Give me your hand so that I may swear allegiance to
you.' 'Umar replied, 'You are the companion of the Messenger of Allah in
all circumstances -- comfort and hardship. So, give me your hand.'
"'Ali, peace be upon him, says (with regard to the claim of 'Umar) that:
If you give arguments in favour of the Abu Bakr's deserving the
caliphate on the basis of his being the companion of the Holy Prophet in
all circumstances, then why did you not hand over the caliphate to one
(i.e., Amir al-mu'minin) who shares with him (Abu Bakr) in this matter,
and who had superiority over him by having a relation of kinship with
the Holy Prophet? "In his poetry, Amir al-mu'minin addressed Abu Bakr,
because he argued with the ansar at Saqifah saying; "We (the Quraysh)
are the kin of the Messenger of Allah and the seed from which he sprung,
(therefore, we are the most deserving people to succeed him).' "After
allegiance was sworn to Abu Bakr (by a small group at Saqifah) he used
to argue with the Muslims that they must accept his caliphate since it
had been accepted by the ahlu'1-halli Wa'1-'aqd (the group who can tie
and untie a matter -- i.e., those who were present at Saqifah). "'Ali,
peace be upon him, says (with regard to the claim of Abu Bakr) that:
Regarding your argument with the ansar that you are from the seed from
which the Messenger of Allah sprung, and one of his tribe, there is
other one (i.e. Amir al-mu'minin himself) who ha" the nearest relation
of kinship to the Holy Prophet. And concerning your argument that you
have been accepted by the consultation of the com panions of the Holy
Prophet (whom you mean by ahlu'l-halli wa'1-\`agd), how did it happen
that most of the companions were absent (on the day of Saqifah) and did
not swear allegiance to you.''(Sharh Nahjul Balaghah al-balaghah,
vol.18, p.416)

[^46]: The person who gains a lesson and experience by spending money
and wealth should not lament its loss but should deem the experience
more valuable than the wealth because wealth is in any case wasted away
while the experience will protect him against the dangers of the future.
Thus, a scholar who had become destitute after having been wealthy was
asked what had happened to his wealth and he replied: "I have purchased
experiences with it and they have proved more useful than the wealth.
After losing all that I had, I have not been in the loss."

[^47]: It means that if a person is not temperamentally forbearing he
should try to be so in the sense that he should put up a show of
forbearance against his temperament. Although he may feel some
difficulty in curbing his temperament, the result will be that by and by
forbearance will become his temperamental trait and then no need to
feign will remain, because habit slowly develops into second nature.

[^48]: This saying is about the awaited Imam who is the last of the
series of Imams. On his emergence all states and governments will come
to an end, and the complete picture referred to in the verse will appear
before the eyes. Whoever wants to may rule in this world but in the end
the rule will be in the hands of the descendants of 'Ali (peace be upon
them).

[^49]: It means that just as an envious person cannot appreciate any
good in him whom he envies, similarly, vanity cannot tolerate the
emergence of intelligence or the prominence of good qualities as a
result of which the envious person remains devoid of those qualities
which are deemed to be good by human intellect.

[^50]: Every individual has some shortcomings or other. If a person
keeps aloof from others because of their faults and weakness, he will,
by and by, lose all his friends and become lonely and forlorn in this
world and thus his life will become bitter and his worries will
multiply. At such a moment he should realize that in this society he
cannot get angels with whom he may never have any cause of complaint,
that he has to live among these very people and to pass his life with
them. Therefore, as far as possible he should ignore their shortcomings
and pay no regard to the troubles inflicted by them.

[^51]: The person who is haughty and ill-tempered can never succeed in
making his surroundings pleasant. His acquaintances will feel wretched
and sick of him. But if a person is good-tempered and sweet-tongued
people will like to get close to him and befriend him. At the time of
need they will prove to be his helpers and supporters whereby he can
make his life a success.

[^52]: When a man falls into greed and avarice, he gets entangled in
evils like bribery, theft, misappropriation, usury and other immoral
acts of this type, while the mind is so dazzled with the brilliance of
the evil desires that it fails to see the ill effects and consequences
of those bad deeds and to prevent him from them or awaken him from his
slumber of unmindfulness. Nevertheless, when he prepares to depart from
this world and finds that whatever he had amassed was for this world
only and that he cannot take it with him, then, and only then his eyes
get opened.

[^53]: If a person adorns himself with the quality of modesty then it
prevents him from committing evil acts. Therefore, he has no evil for
the people to find in him. Even if a bad act is ever committed by him he
does not commit it openly because of his feeling of modesty lest the
people notice him.

[^54]: A jealous person feels jealous of the property and position of
others but not of their health and physical power, although this
blessing is the best of all others. The reason is that the effects of
wealth and riches remain before the eyes through external pageantry and
means of ease and comfort, whereas health is the victim of disregard for
being a routine matter, and it is regarded so unimportant that a jealous
person does not consider it worth his feeling of jealousy. Thus, if he
sees a labourer carrying a burden on his head all day he does not feel
envious, as if health and energy is not an object of envy. Nevertheless,
when he himself falls ill he realizes the value and worth of
healthiness. It is now that he realizes that it was this health which
till now carried no importance in his eyes but was the most deserving of
envy. The intention is that one should regard health as a highly
valuable blessing and remain attentive towards its protection and care.

[^55]: The reason for calling goodness of moral character a blessing is
that just as blessing brings forth pleasure, in the same way a man can
make his environment pleasant by endearing others' hearts through
goodness of moral character and can thus succeed in procuring ways for
his happiness and ease. And contentment has been regarded as capital and
estate for the reason that just as the estate and area under sway
dispels need in the same way when a man adopts contentment and feels
happy over his livelihood he becomes free of turning to others in the
time of need. Whoever is contented with the morsel he gets, dry or wet,
is the king of all the land and sea.

[^56]: The meaning of this is that if the enemy aims at fighting and
takes the initiative in it, then one should advance to face him, but one
should not initiate the attack because this would be clear
high-handedness and excess, and whoever commits high-handedness and
excess will be disgracefully vanquished and thrown down. That is why
Amir al-mu'minin always entered the battlefield on being challenged by
the enemy. He never offered the challenge from his side. In this
connection, Ibn Abil'l-Hadid writes: We have never heard that Amir
al-mu'minin ever challenged anyone for confrontation. Rather, when
either he was particularly challenged or the enemy flung a general
challenge, then alone he would go out to meet the enemy and would kill
him. (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah al-balaghah, vol.19, p.60)

[^57]: It is easy to bear oppression in this world hut it is not easy to
face its punishment in the next world, because the period of hearing
oppression even though life-long is after all limited; but the
punishment for oppression is Hell whose most fearful aspect is that life
there will last for ever and death will not save from punishment. That
is why, if an oppressor kills someone then with that killing the
oppression comes to an end, and there is no further scope for any
further oppression on the same person; but its punishment is that he is
thrown in Hell where he suffers his punishment. The Persian couplet
says: The effect of the oppression on us has passed away, but it will
ever remain on the oppressor.

[^58]: If replies to a question begin to be given from all sides, every
reply will raise another question and thus open the door for arguing,
and as the number of replies will further necessitate search for the
real truth, detection of the correct reply will become more and more
arduous, because everyone will try to have his reply accepted as correct
as a result of which he will try to collect arguments from here and
there to have his reply accepted as correct as a result of which the
whole matter will become confused and this dream will turn into an
aimless one because of the multiplicity of interpretations.

[^59]: The breaking of determinations and losing of courage can
be argued to prove the existence of Allah in this way that, for example,
a man determines to do a thing hut before the determination is
transformed into action, it changes and some other idea takes its place.
This alteration of ideas and determinations and the emergence of change
therein is a proof that there is some higher controlling power over us
which has the capacity to bring them from non-existence to existence and
again from existence into non-existence, and this is what is beyond
human power. Therefore, it is necessary to acknowledge a super authority
who effects change and alteration in determinations.

[^60]: Before describing some of the aims and good points of the
commands of the shari'ah (i.e., religious law), Amir al-mu'minin has
began with the aims and objects of Belief (iman), because iman serves as
the basis of religious commands, and without it no need is felt for any
religious code or jurisprudence. iman is the name of acknowledging the
existence 6f the Creator and admission of His Singularity. When this
iman takes root in the heart of a man then he does not agree to bow
before any other being, nor is he over-awed or affected by any p9wer or
authority. Rather, getting mentally freed of all ties he regards himself
a devotee of Allah and the result of this adherence to the Unity is that
he is saved from the pollution of polytheism. Prayer (salat) is the most
important of all forms of worship. It consists of standing, sitting,
bending and prostration, and these postures are a successful way of
destroying the feeling of vanity and pride, erasing self-conceit and
egotism and creating humility and submissiveness, because the actions
and movements of a vain person produce pride and haughtiness while
humble actions engender the quality of submissiveness and humbleness in
the mind. With the exercise of these acts a man, by and by, acquires a
humble temperament. This is how the Arabs who were so vain that if their
whip fell off during riding they would not bend down to pick it up or if
the strap of the shoe gave way they thought it insulting to bend down to
mend it, began to rub their faces on dust during prostration in prayers,
and place their foreheads in the position of others' feet during the
congregational prayer, and in this way acquired the true spirit of Islam
after abandoning the pre-Islamic vanity and partisanship. Zakat, namely
that a person who is able to do so should pay annually out of his money
or property a fixed share for those who are either destitute or do not
have means of livelihood for a year, is an obligatory command of Islam,
the purpose behind which is that no individual in the community should
remain poor and they should remain safe from the evils that result from
need and poverty. Besides, another objective is that wealth should keep
rotating from one individual to another and should not be centred in a
few persons. Fasting (siyam) is a form of worship in which there is not
an iota of show, and no motive is active in it except that of pure
intention. As a result, even in seclusion when hunger perturbs a man or
thirst makes him uneasy he does not extend his hand for eating, nor does
the longing for water make him lose his control although if something is
eaten or drunk no one is to peep into his stomach, but the purity of
conscience prevents his will from deflecting. This is the greatest good
of fasting that it engenders purity of will in action. The purpose of
hajj (pilgrimage to the House of Allah) is that Muslims from all corners
of the globe should assemble at one place so that this world assembly
should prove to be an occasion for the manifestation of Islam's
greatness, the renewal of the passion for worship and the creation of
bonds of mutual brotherhood. The purpose of jihad (fighting in the way
of Allah) is to fight with all possible 'flight those forces which
oppose Islam, so that Islam may achieve stability and progress. Although
there are dangers for life in this course and difficulties crop up at
every step, yet the tidings for eternal ease and everlasting life
produce the courage to bear all these hardships. The persuasion for good
and dissuasion from evil are effective ways of showing others the
correct path and preventing them from wrong; If a community has no
persons to perform these duties nothing can save it from ruin and it
falls to an extreme depth morally and socially. That is why Islam has
laid great stress on it as compared to other matters, and held disregard
to it as an unpardonable sin. Doing good for kinship means that a man
should do favours to his relatives and at least should not stop mutual
accosting and speaking with them so that spirits may become clean and
family ties may develop, and the scattered individuals may render
strength to one another. Seeking vengeance is a right given to the
survivors of the person killed. They can demand a life for a life so
that for fear of punishment no one would dare kill any person, and at
the same time the survivor's passion for revenge should not result in
the killing of more than one person. No doubt forgiveness or pardon does
carry weight in its own place but where it means trampling of an
individual's right or a danger to world peace it cannot be regarded as
good. Rather, on such an occasion revenge is the sole way of stopping
bloodshed and killing for the safety of human life. Thus, Allah says:
And for you there is (security of) Retaliation O' you men of
understanding, so that you may guard yourself (against evil). (Qur'an,
2:179) The purpose behind the awarding of penalties is to make the
offender appreciate the seriousness of violating the prohibitions of
Allah so that he may keep off the prohibitions for fear of punishments.
Wine causes diffusion of thinking, dispersion of senses and weakness of
understanding. As a result, a man commits such actions which would not
be expected of him in the state of being in his senses. Besides, it
ruins health and renders the body liable to catch infectious diseases
while, sleeplessness, nervous weakness and rheumatism are its chief
effects. The shari'ah has prohibited it in view of these ill-effects.
Theft, that is, taking over someone else's property is an evil habit
which is produced by the sway of greed and evil passions and since
bringing down evil passions from the position of excess to the bounds of
moderation means chastity the abstinence from theft by curbing greed and
evil passions would produce chastity. Adultery and sodomy have been
prohibited in order that lineage may be regulated and the human race may
continue and prosper, because the issues by adultery are not regarded
legitimate for the purposes of lineage and consequently they are not
entitled to inheritance, while there is no question of issues in the
case of unnatural practices. Besides, as a consequence of these evil
practices one contracts such diseases which cause ruination of life in
addition to discontinuity of progeny. The law of evidence is needed
because if one party denies the right of another party the latter may
establish it through evidence and safeguard it thereby. Abstention from
lies and falsehood has been commanded so that the standing and
importance of its contrary namely truth may become prominent and in
observing the benefits and advantages of truth the moral weakness of
falsehood may be avoided. Salam means peace and peace-loving and it is
obvious that peaceful attitude is a successful way of protection from
dangers and prevention of war and fighting. Generally, commentators have
taken the word salam to mean mutual greetings and well-wishing but the
context and the fact that it has been mentioned in the series of
obligations does not support this interpretation. However, according to
this interpretation salam is a means of safety from dangers because it
is regarded as a way of peace and peace-loving. When two Muslims meet
each other they offer salam one to the other, it means that they
announce the wishes of each for the welfare of the other whereafter each
feels safe with the other. Imamate (imamah): This word has appeared in
the same form in the correct copies of Nahjul Balaghah al-balaghah as
well as in its commentaries like Ibn Abi'l-Hadid, vol.19, p.90; Ibn
Maytham, vol.5, pp.367-368; Minhaj al-Bara'ah, vol.21, p.318; and other
sources besides Nahjul Balaghah al-balaghah such as Nihayah al-irab by
an-Nuwayri ash-Shafi'i, vol.8, p.183 and al-Bihar by al-Majlisi, vol.6,
p.111. In fact, this word of "imamah" has been distorted to "amanah"
(trust) or "amanat" (trusts) in some copies such as those printed in
Egypt. It is very surprising to note that the. word has appeared as
amanah in the text of Nahjul Balaghah al-balaghah printed with the
commentary of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid in Egypt in the. first edition vol.4,
p.350 as well as in the second edition edited by Muhammad Abu'l-Fadl
Ibrahim, vol.19, p.86; while he himself (Ibn Abi'l-Hadid) based his
commentary on its correct reading namely imamah as did other
commentators. However, in explanation of this sentence, "Imamate for the
orderliness of the community," as the theological scholars say: Whoever
has known dark experiences and has examined political principles knows,
of necessity, that whenever men have among them a chief and a guide whom
they obey, who restrains the oppressor from his oppression and the
unjust man from his injustice and avenges the oppressed of his
oppressor, and along with that leads them to rational principles and
religious duties, and restrains them from the corruptions which cause
the destruction of order in their worldly affairs, and from the evils
which result in wretchedness in the world to come, so that every
individual might fear that punishment, then because of this they will
draw near to soundness and depart from corruption. (al-Babu'l-hadi
'ashar, EngI. transl. p. 63) The institution of Imamate is intended to
cater for the unification of the nation and to protect the commandments
of Islam from alteration and change, because if there is no head of the
nation and no protector of religion neither can the order of the nation
be maintained nor can the commandments of Islam remain safe from
interference by others. This object can he achieved only when obedience
to him is obligatory on the people, because if he is not obeyed and
followed as an obligation he will neither be able to maintain justice
and equity, nor secure the rights of the oppressed from the oppressor,
nor issue and enforce the laws of the shari'ah and consequently the
extinction of evil and mischief from the world cannot be expected.

[^61]: It is narrated that someone levied some charges against Imam
Ja'far as-Sadiq before the 'Abbaside Caliph 'Abdullah ibn Muhammad
al-Mansur. al-Mansur sent for the Imam and told him that such and such a
person had told him such and such about him. The Imam said it was all
wrong and there was not an iota of truth therein, and desired the man to
he sent for and questioned before him. Consequently, he was sent for and
questioned. He said that whatever he had said was true and correct. The
Imam said to him, "if you are speaking the truth then you swear as I ask
you to swear." Thereafter, the Imam made him swear by saying, "I am out
of Allah's might and power and I rely on my own might and power." Soon
after swearing like this he got an attack of paralysis and he became
motionless. The Imam, returned with full honour and prestige. (al-Kafi,
al-Kulayni, vol.6, pp. 445--446; al-Bihar, vol.47, pp.164 -- 165,
172-175, 203 -- 204; al-Fusul al-muhimmah, Ibn as-Sabbagh al-Maliki,
pp.225 --226; as-sawa\`iq al-muhriqah, Ibn Hajar ash-Shafi'i, p. 120;
Jami' karamat al-awliya', an-Nabhani ash-Shafi'i, vol.2, p.4). Such an
event took place again during the reign of Harun ar-Rashid (149/766 -
193/809 - the grandson of al-Mansur) when 'Abdullah ibn Mus'ab (the
grandson of 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr -- the well-known enemy of
Ahlu'1-bayt of the Holy Prophet) slandered Yahya ibn 'Abdillah ibn
al-Hasan ibn (al-Imam) al-Hasan ibn 'Ali ibn Abi Talib before Harun
ar-Rashid by saying that he was plotting a revolution against him
(Harun). Then, Yahya made 'Abdullah swear before Harun in the same
manner as the Imam had done. When 'Abdullah swore as he was required to,
the symptom of leprosy soon appeared in him in the presence of Harun and
he died after three days, while every part of his flesh cracked open and
all the hair of his body fell out. After this, Harun used to say, "How
soon Allah took revenge on 'Abdullah for Yahya!" (Maqatil at-talibiyyin,
Abu'l-Faraj al-Isfahani, pp.472-478; Muruj adh-dhahab, al-Mas'udi,
vol.3, pp.340-- 342; Tarikh Baghdad, al-Khatib, vol.14, pp.110-112; Ibn
Abi'l-Hadid, vol.19, pp.91-94; at- Tarikh, Ibn Kathir, vol.10,
pp.167-168; Tarikh al-khulafa', as-Suyuti:, p.287).

[^62]: The meaning of it is that if a person desires that after his
death a portion of his property should be spent on charity, he should
not wait for his death but spend it wherever he desires even during his
lifetime; for it is possible that after his death his successors may not
act upon his will or he may not get an opportunity to will. A Persian
couplet says: Give away money and property while you are living as after
you it would be out of your control.

[^63]: Envy produces such a poisonous matter in the body which destroys
the natural heat of the body as a result of which the body weakens and
the spirit withers. That is why an envious person never prospers and
melts away in the heat of envy

[^64]: "Ya'sub" is the name given to the queen bee, and the saying of
Amir al-mu'minin is: "fa idha kana dhalika daraba ya'sub u'd-din bi
dhanabihi". The word "daraba" means to beat, strike, hit, etc.; "ya'sub
u'd-din" means "the head of religion and the shari'ah", and
"dhanab"means tail, end, adherent or flower. In this sentence
"ya'subu'd-u 'd-din" stands for the present Imam (al-Imam al-Mahdi).
Although this title was given by the Holy Prophet to Amir al-mu'minin
specially, as he said: O' \`Ali, you are the ya'sub (bead) of the
believers while wealth is the ya'sub of the hypocrites. (al-Isti\`ab,
vol. 4, p. 1744; Usd al-ghabah, vol.5, p.287; al-Isabah, vol.4, p.17l;
ar-Riyad an-nadirah, vol.2, p.155; Majma' az-zawa'id, vol.9, p.102; Ibn
Abi'l-Hadid, vol.1, p. 12; vol.19, p.224). Also the Holy Prophet said to
'Ali: You are the ya'sub of the religion. (ar-Riyad an-nadirah, vol.2,
p. 177; Taj al-'arus, vol.1, p.381; Ibn Abi'l-Hadid, vol.1, p. 12;
vol.19, p.224) Also the Holy Prophet said to 'Ali: You are the ya'sub of
the Muslims (Yanabi' al-mawaddah, al-Qunduzi, p.62) Again the Holy
Prophet said: You are the ya'sub of the Quraysh (al-Maqasid al-hasanah,
as-Sakhawi, p.94).  Therefore, the reason for giving the Imam this name
is that just as the queen bee is pure alone and in the society of other
bees, and she collects her nectar from the blossoms and flowers keeping
away from pollution, in the same way the present Imam is free from all
pollutions and is perfectly clean and pure. This saying has been
interpreted in several ways: Firstly, it means that "when the present
Imam settles at his seat after his tour and rotation round the world
people will gather around him." Secondly, it means that "when the Imam
moves about on the earth along with his friends and associates..." In
this case the word "daraba" would mean moving about and the word "dhanab
"would mean helpers and associates. Thirdly, it means that "when the
Imam rises with a sword in hand ." In this case the word "dhanab" would
mean stinging by the bee. Fourthly, it means that "when the Imam rises
for the propagation of true faith with full fervour. . ." In this case
the sentence is suggestive of the state of anger and the posture for
attack.

[^65]: The reference by the versatile speaker is to Sa'sa'ah ibn Suhan
al-'Abdi who was among the chief companions of Amir al-mu'minin. This
saying throws light on the greatness of his speaking quality and the
force of his utterances. In this connection, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has
written: It is enough for Sa'sa'ah's greatness that a personality like
'Ali, peace be upon him, has praised him for versatility and eloquence
of speech. (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah al-balaghah, vol.19, p.106)

[^66]: Sa'd ibn Malik (i.e. Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, the father of 'Umar ibn
Sa'd who killed Imam Husayn) and 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar were among those
who were keeping themselves away from Amir al-mu'minin's help and
support. As for Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, after the killing of 'Uthman he
retired to some wilderness and passed his life there, but did not agree
to swear allegiance to Amir al-mu'minin (as Caliph). But after the death
of Amir al-mu'minin he used to express his repentance, saying, "I held
an opinion but it was a wrong opinion." (al-Mustadrak, al-Hakim, vol.3,
p. 116). And when Mu\`awiyah blamed him for not supporting him in his
fight with Amir al-mu'minin, Sa'd said: I only repent for not having
fought against the rebellious group (i.e. Mu'awiyah and his people).
(Ahkam al-Qur'an, al-Jassas al-Hanafi, vol.2, pp.224,225; al-Furu', Ibn
Muflih al-Hanbali, vol.3, p.542) As for \`Abdullah ibn 'Umar, although
he had sworn allegiance, he refused to help Amir al-mu'minin in the
battles putting forth the excuse: "I have sought seclusion to devote
myself to worship and do not therefore want to involve myself in war and
fighting." A Persian couplet says: Intelligence regards such excuses
worse than the offence itself. Abdullah ibn 'Umar also frequently used
to express his repentance, even up to the last moments of his life,
saying: I do not find anything in myself to be distressed about in this
world, except my not having fought alongside Ali ibn Abi Talib against
the rebellious group as Allah, to Whom belongs Might and Majesty, had
commanded me. (al-Mustadrak, vol.3, pp.115 - 116; as-Sunan al-kubra,
al-Bayhaqi, vol.8, p.172; at-Tabaqat, Ibn Sa'd, vol.4, part l, pp.136,
137; aljst1.'ab, vol.3, p.953; Usd al-ghabah, vol.3, p.229; vol.4, p.33;
Majma' az-zawa'id, vol.3, p.182; vol.7, p.242; al-Furu', vol.3, p.543;
Ruh al-ma'ani; al-Alusi, vol.26, p.151).

[^67]: The intention is that if a person holds high position in the
royal court people look at his rank and position and honour and prestige
with envy, but he himself has always the fear lest the royal pleasure
turns against him and he falls in the pit of disgrace and dishonour or
death and destruction, like the rider on a lion with by whom people are
awed, but he himself is ever facing the danger lest the lion devours
him, or throws him in some fatal pit.

[^68]: The group of the learned and reformers is responsible for
improvement as well as deterioration because the common people are under
their influence, and regard their words and action as correct and
standard, rely on them and act upon them. In this way, If their teaching
caters for improvement then thousands of individuals will acquire
improvement and betterment thereby; but if there be evil in it then
thousands of individuals will get involved in misguidance and get
astrayed. That is why it is said: "When a scholar gets into evil the
whole world gets into evil."

[^69]: Among the first three Caliphs, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab often used to
call upon Amir al-mu'minin for the solution of many unsolved problems
and so as to benefit from his vast knowledge. But Abu Bakr, due to the
short period of his caliphate, and 'Uthman, due to the special
circumstances of his caliphate and his entourage, seldom used to call on
Amir al-mu'minin and benefit from his advice. 'Umar used to praise Amir
al-mu'minin very much for his vast knowledge, saying: The most
knowledgeable person among us in jurisprudence and judgement is 'Ali.
(as-Sahih, al-Bukhari, vol.6, p.23; al-Musnad, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, vol.5,
p.113; al-Mustadrak, al-Hakim, vol.3, p.305; at- Tabaqat, Ibn Sa'd,
vol.2, part 2, p.102; al-Isti'ab, vol.3, p.1102) Certainly, there is no
need for the evidence of 'Umar and others in this field when 'Umar
himself and a group of the Companions confess that the Holy Prophet used
to say: 'Ali is the most knowledgeable in jurisprudence and judgement
among my ummah (Muslim community). (Akhbar al-qudat, Waki', vol.1, p.78;
Masabih, as-sunnah, al-Baghawi, vol.2, p.203; al-Isti\`ab, vol. 1,
pp.16- 17: vol.3, p.1102; ar-Riyad-an-nadirah, vol.2, p.108; as-Sunan,
Ibn Majah, vol.1, p.55) In this connection, Ahmad ibn Hanbal narrates
from Abu Hazim that a certain man approached Mu'awiyah and put to him
some questions on religion. Mu'awiyah said, "Refer this question to 'All
who possesses better knowledge." The man said, "But I would rather have
your reply than that of \`Ali." Mu'awiyah silenced him and said, "It is
the worst thing I have heard from you. You have expressed hate towards
the person whom the Messenger of Allah' used to coach and tutor as a
mother bird feeds a nestling by putting grain after grain into the mouth
of the nestling with its beak and to whom the Messenger of Allah said:
You hold the same position in relation to me as Harun held in relation
to Musa except that there shall, in all certainty, be no prophet after
me; and to whom 'Umar used to turn for the solution of unsolved
problems." (Fayd al-qadir, al-Munawi, vol.3, p.46; ar-Riyad, an-nadirah,
vol.2, p.l95: as-Sawa\`iq al-muhriqah, p. 107; Fath al-bari, vol.17,
p.105) Also 'Umar used to say frequently: Women lack. the ability to
give birth to such as 'Ali ibn Abi Talib. Had it not been for 'Ali,
'Umar would have been finished. (Ta'wil mukhtalaf al-hadith, Ibn
Qutaybah, p.202; al-Isti'ab, vol.3, p.1103; Qudat al-Undulus, al-Maliqi,
p.73; ar-Riyad an-nadirah, vol.2, p. 194; al-Manaqib, al-Khwarazmi,
p.39; Yanabi' al-mawaddah, pp.75, 373: Fayd al-qadir, vol.4, p.356) He
also used to say: I seek the protection of Allah from the problems in
which Abu'l-Hasan ('Ali) is not present! (al-Isti'ab, vol.3,
pp.1102-1103; a;-Tabaqat, vol.2, part 2, p.102; Sifatu 's-safwah, Ibn
al-Jawzi, vol.1, p.121; Usd al-ghabah, vol.4, pp.22-23; al-Isabah,
vol.2, p.509: at-Tarikh, Ibn Kathir, vol.7, p.360) 'Umar often addressed
Amir al-mu'minin, thus: O Abu'l-Hasan, I seek the protection of Allah
from being in a community among which you are not found. (al-Mustadrak,
vol.1, pp. 457-458; at-Tafsir, Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi, vol.32, p.10;
ad-Durr al-manthur, as-Suyuti, vol.3, p.144; ar-Riyad an-nadirah, vol.2,
p. 197; Fayd al-qadir, vol.3, p.46; vol.4, p. 356; as-Sawa'iq
al-muhriqah, p. 107) Above all these confessions is the acknowledgement
by the Holy Prophet of Amir al-mu'minin as narrated by 'Umar ibn
al-Khatib himself, Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and Mu'adh ibn Jabal that the
Holy Prophet said: O 'Ali, I have exceeded you in prophethood, for there
will be no prophet after me, and you exceed others in seven noble
qualities. You are: i) the first who believed in Allah, ii) the best
fulfiller of the promise made to Allah, iii) the best adherer to the
commandments of Allah, iv) the most equitable distributor among the
people, v) the best dispenser of justice (or the most clement) to the
(Muslims) subjects, vi) the one who has the best insight into
controversial cases, (or the most learned in judgement), and vii) the
most conspicuous in virtue and honour before Allah. (Hilyah al-awliya',
vol.1, pp.65, 66; ar-Riayd an-nadirah, vol.2, p.198; al-Manaqib,
al-Khwarazmi, p.61; Kanz al-'ummal vol.12, p.214; Ibn Abi'l-Hadid,
vol.13, p.230) It is also narrated by Amir al-mu'minin, Abu Ayyub
al-Ansari, Ma'qil ibn Yasir and Buraydah ibn Husayb that the Messenger
of Allah (p.b.u.h.a. h.p.) said to Fatimah (p.b.u.h.) that: Are you not
satisfied? Surely, I have married you to the foremost of my ummah who
believes in Islam, and the most knowledgeable among them and superior
among them in clemency. (al-Musnad, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, vol.5,
p.26;al-Musannaf, as -San'ani, vol.5, p.490; al-Isti'ab, vol.3, p.1099;
Usd al-ghabah, vol.5, p.520;Kanzal-'ummal vol .12, p.205; vol.15, p.99;
Majma' az-zawa'id, vol.9, pp.101, 114; as-Sirah al-halabiyyah, vol.1,
p.285) After we read the following saying of the Holy Prophet, it is no
surprise for us to note that the above acknowledgements of the vast
knowledge of Amir al-mu'minin and his efficiency in the field of
jurisprudence and judgement were made. I am the city of knowledge and
'Ali is its gate; he who wants to acquire (my) knowledge must come
through the gate. (al-Mustadrak, vol.3, pp.l26,127; al-Isti'ab, vol.3,
p.1l02; Usd al-ghabah, vol.4, p.22; Tahdhib at-tahdhib, vol.6,
pp.320-32l; vol.7, p.337; Majma' az-zawa'id, vol.9, p.114; Kanz
al-'ummal, vol.12, pp.201, 212; vol.15, pp.l29-130) Also, the Holy
Prophet said: I am the store-house of wisdom and 'Ali is its gate. He
who wants to acquire wisdom must come through the gate. (al-Jami'
as-sahih, at- Tirmidhi, vol.5, pp.637-638; Hilyah al-awliya', vol-i,
p-64; Masabih. as-sunnah, al-Baghawi, vol.2, p.275; ar-Riyad an-nadirah,
vol.2, p.193; Kanz al-'ummal, vol.12, p.201)

[^70]: It cannot be denied that after the Prophet of Islam changes came
into existence in the religion when some people acting upon their
imagination, amended or altered the commands of the shari'ah, although
no one has the right to make alteration in the shari'ah, namely to
ignore the clear commands of the Qur'an and the sunnah and enforce
commands produced by his own imagination and thinking. Thus, the Qur'an
contains this clear method of divorce that "(Revokable) Divorce (i.e.
divorce in which resumption of conjugal relations is permissible without
a marriage to another man taking place) may be twice" (Qur'an, 2:229).
But in view of certain supposed advantages the Caliph 'Umar ordered
three divorces to be pronounced on a single occasion. Similarly, he
introduced the system of 'awl in inheritance and introduced four takbir
in the funeral prayer. In the same way the Caliph 'Uthman added an adhan
to the Friday prayer, ordered the offering of full prayers in place of
qasr (shortened) ones, and allowed the sermon to precede the 'id prayer.
In fact, hundreds of commands of this type were fabricated, as a result
of which even correct commands got mixed with the wrong ones and lost
their authenticity. (For changes made see: al-Ghadir, al-Amini [by Abu
Bakr], vol.7, pp.74-236; [by 'Umar], vol.6, pp.83- 325; [by 'Uthman],
vol.8, pp.98-387; an-Nass wa'l-ijtihad, Sharafu'd-Din [by Abu Bakr],
pp.76-154; [by 'Umar], pp.155-276. [by 'Uth man], pp.284-289. See also
Muqaddamah mir'atu 'l-'uqul, al-'Askari,vol.1 & 2). Amir al-mu'minin,
who was the greatest scholar of the shari'ah, used to protest against
these commands and had his own views as against the Companions. In this
connection, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid writes: There is no possibility for us to
deny that Amir al-mu'minin had views on the commands of the shari'ah and
opinions at variance with those of the Companions. (Sharh Nahjul
Balaghah al-balaghah, vol.19, p.161) When Amir al-mu'minin assumed
charge of the formal caliphate, revolts soon cropped up on all sides and
he did not get rid of these troubles up to the last moment.
Consequently, the altered commands could not be fully corrected and many
wrong or doubtful commands gained currency in areas far removed from the
centre. Nevertheless, the group of people who were associated with Amir
al-mu'minin used to enquire about the commands of the shad 'ah from him
and recorded them, as a result of which the correct commands did not
disappear and the wrong ones did not become unanimously accepted.

[^71]: Knowledge and conviction require that they should be acted upon.
If they are not acted upon they cannot be called knowledge and
conviction. Consequently, if a man says he knows the dangers that exist
on particular path but he adopts that very path for his journey instead
of the path that has no dangers, then who can say that this man had full
certainty about the dangers of that path, because the consequence of
such certainty should have been that he would have avoided going on that
path. Similarly, the person who has belief in the resurrection and
revival of life or in chastisement and reward cannot be overpowered by
those things of this world that make a man neglectful to the extent of
disregarding the next life, nor can he fall short in good actions for
fear of chastisement and evil consequences.

[^72]: As-Sayyid ar-Radi has not written what it was that did not
happen, leaving us only with the first part of the sentence.

[^73]: The man whom Amir al-mu'minin has referred to as his brother and
whose qualities he has stated, has been taken by some commentators to be
Abu Dharr al-Ghifari by some 'Uthman ibn Maz'un al-Jumahi and by some
al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad al-Kindi; but it is not unlikely that no
particular individual is referred to at all, because it is customary
with Arabs for them to speak of a brother or a comrade although. they
have no particular individual in mind.

[^74]: A fool considers his ways of action appropriate, and wants his
friend also to adopt the same ways, so that he should become as he
himself is. This does not mean that he desires that his friend should
become as foolish as he is. He cannot be thinking like this, because he
does not consider himself foolish. If he in fact considered himself
foolish, then he would not have been foolish. Instead, he considers his
ways of action as correct, and desires his friend to be equally "wise".
That is why he presents his view before him in an embellished form and
desires him to act upon it. It is possible his friend may be influenced
by his advice and tread on the. same path. Therefore, it is better to
keep away from him.

[^75]: If the vicissitudes and changes of this world are observed, the
circumstances and condition of the people attended to and their
histories noted, then from every comer edifying stories can be heard
which are fully capable of arousing the mind out of its forgetful
slumber, of providing instruction and of imparting teaching and clear
mindedness. Thus, the creation and dissolution of every thing in this
world, the blossoming of flowers and their withering, the thriving of
vegetation and its withering away and the subjugation of every atom to
change are such instructive lessons that they are enough to curb any
hope of attaining eternity in this deceitful life as long as the eyes
and ears are not closed to these instructive events. A Persian couplet
says: The world is full of stories of folk gone by, but unless one lends
an ear to it, its call is weak.

[^76]: The idea here is that lighting may flash a hundred thousand
times, tempests may rise, the earth may quake and mountains may collide
with each other, but as long as the fixed period of life has yet to run
its course no occurrence can cause any harm, nor the typhoon of death
put out the flame of life; for there is a fixed hour for death, and
nothing can cut it short before that time. In this way, obviously death
itself is the watchman and guardian of life. The hemistich of a verse
says: What is known as death is the watchman of life.

[^77]: The occasion and circumstances surrounding this saying as related
by as-Sayyid ar-Radi were that when at the time of the Battle of Jamal
Amir al-mu'minin sent Anas ibn Malik to Talhah and az-Zubayr with the
purpose that he should recall them the Prophet's saying to the effect
that: "You two will fight 'Ali and will commit excess over him", he came
back and stated that he had forgotten to mention it. Then, Amir
al-mu'minin uttered these words about him. However, it is said that Amir
al-mu'minin said the sentence on the occasion when he wanted Anas to
confirm the Prophet's saying. "Whosoever master I am, 'Ali is his
master. O My God, love him who loves 'Ali and hate him who hates 'Ali".
Consequently, numerous persons have testified to this saying but Arias
kept quiet. Then, Amir al-mu'minin, said to him, "You too were present
at Ghadir Khum, what is keeping you silent on this occasion?" and he
said, "I have grown old and my memory does not serve me well". Then,
Amir al-mu'minin, pronounced this curse. (Ansab al-ashraf, al-Baladhuri,
[concerning the biography of Amir al-mu'minin], pp.156-157; al-A'laq
an-nafisah, Ibn Rustah, p.221; Altai's al-ma'arif, ath-Tha'alibi, pp.
105 - 106; Muhadarat al-udaba', ar-Raghib, vol.3, p.293; Ibn
Abi'l-Hadid, vol.4, p.74; Arjah al-matalib, ash-Shaykh 'Ubaydullah
al-Hanafi, pp. 578, 579, 580). In this connection, Ibn Qutaybah
('Abdullah ibn Muslim ad-Dinawari [213/828 - 276/889] writes: People
have related that Amir al-mu'minin asked Anas ibn Malik about the
Prophet's saying: "O My God, love him who loves 'Ali and hate him who
hates 'Ali," and he replied, "I have grown old and I have forgotten it."
Then 'Ali said: "If you are a liar, Allah may afflict you with white
spots which even the turban may not cover. (al-Ma'arif, p. 580) Ibn
Abi'l-Hadid has also supported this view and, denying the incident
mentioned by as-Sayyid ar-Radi, writes: The incident mentioned by
as-Sayyid ar-Radi that Amir al-mu'minin sent Anas ibn Malik to Talhah
and az-Zubayr is an unrecorded event. If Amir al-mu'minin had sent him
particularly to recall to them the the Prophet's saying concerning them,
then he could hardly have come back and said that he had forgotten it
because when he left Amir al-mu'minin and went to these two persons he
should have admitted and remembered the saying, and therefore how could
he, on his return after an hour or a day, plead that he had forgotten it
and deny it. This is something that cannot happen. (Sharh Nahjul
Balaghah al-balaghah, vol.19, pp.217 - 218)

[^78]: We have already explained the meaning of the word "ya'sub" in the
foot-note of saying No.262-I, and pointed out that this title was given
to Amir al-mu'minin by the Holy Prophet himself and we quoted some of
his different utterances on this subject. Here we quote one of the
traditons in which this title appears. It is narrated by Abu Layla
al-Ghifari, Abu Dharr, Salman, Ibn 'Abbas and Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman
that the Holy Prophet used to say: Soon after my death there will be
discord. When it occurs, adhere to 'Ali ibn Abi Talib since he will be
the first person to see me and the first person to shake hands with me
on the Day of Judgement. He is the greatest man of truth (as-siddiq
al-akbar), and he is the discriminator (faruq) from among this ummah who
discriminates between right and wrong, and he is the ya'sub (leader) of
the believers while wealth is the ya'sub of the hypocrites. (In addition
to the references given in the above-mentioned foot-note, see also Fayd
al-qadir, vol.4, p.358; Kanz al-'ummal, vol.12, p.214; Muntakhab
al-kanz, vol.5, p.33; Ibn Abi'l-Hadid, vol.13, p.228; Tarikh ash-Sham,
Ibn 'Asakir, (on the biography of Amir al-mu'minin), vol.1, pp. 74 - 78;
as-Sirah al-halabiyyah, vol.1, p.380; Dhakha'ir al-'uqba, p.56; Yanabi'
al-mawaddah, p. 62, 82, 201 and 251).

[^79]: The purpose behind this criticism by the Jews was to show that
the prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad was a controversial matter, but
Amir al-mu'minin clarified the exact focus of controversy by using the
word "after him" as against "about him", namely that the controversy was
not about his prophethood but about his succession and vicegerency.
Then, commenting on the position of the Jews he pointed out that those
who were today criticising the mutual differences among Muslims after
the Prophet were of the same kind as those who had begun to waver about
belief in the Unity of Allah even in the lifetime of Moses. Thus, when,
on becoming free of the slavery of the Egyptians they reached the other
side of the river and saw the figure of a calf in a temple in Sina',
they asked Moses to get a similar figure for them, whereupon Moses
rebuked them for being still as stubborn as they were in Egypt. This
meant that a people who were so immersed in desire for idol-worship that
even after being initiated into the belief in the Unity of Allah they
became restless on seeing an idol and made the request for a similar
idol to be made for themselves had no right to criticise any difference
among Muslims.

[^80]: The man who is over-awed by his adversary is sure to be defeated
because in facing a foe physical prowess is not enough but steadfastness
of heart and strength of courage is also necessary. When the adversary
loses courage and feels sure that he will he defeated then he will
certainly be defeated. This is what happened to the adversary of Amir
al-mu'minin; he was so affected by his acknowledged reputation that he
was sure of death, in consequence of which his spiritual power and self
confidence came to an end and eventually this mental state dragged him
to his death.

[^81]: 'Abdullah ibn al-'Abbas had advised Amir al-mu'minin to issue a
letter of appointment to Talhah and az-Zubayr as the Governors of Kufah
and to retain Mu'awiyah as the Governor of Syria till such time as his
position became stabilized and the government gained strength. In reply
to which Amir al-mu'minin said that he could not expose his own religion
to danger for the sake of the worldly benefit of others, adding that
"therefore instead of insisting on your own point you should listen to
me and obey me.

[^82]: In the year 38 A.H. Mu'awiyah sent 'Amr ibn al-'As to Egypt with
a large force. 'Amr ibn al-'As called Mu'awiyah ibn Hudayj for
assistance. They brought together the supporters of 'Uthman and waged a
war against Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr and captured him. Mu'awiyah ibn Hudayj
beheaded him and stitching his body into the belly of a dead ass, burnt
it. Muhammad was at that time twenty-eight years old. It is reported
that when the news of the tragedy reached his mother, she fell into a
great rage and indignation. And \`A'ishah, his paternal sister, took a
vow that, as long as she was alive, she would never eat roasted meat.
She cursed Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, 'Amr ibn al-'As and Mu'awiyah ibn
Hudayj after every prayer. When Amir al-mu'minin heard the news of
Muhammad's martyrdom be became immensely sad. He wrote in very grieved
language to Ibn 'Abbas who was at Basrah about the tragic death of
Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. Hearing the news of Muhammad's martyrdom Ibn
'Abbas came from Basrah to Kufah to offer his condolences to Amir
al-mu'minin. One of the spies of Amir al-mu'minin came from Syria and
said: O' Amir al-mu'minin! When the news of Muhammad's murder reached
Mu'awiyah, he went to the pulpit and praised the group who took part in
his martyrdom. The people of Syria rejoiced so much at hearing the news
that I had never seen them in such delight before. Then, Amir
al-mu'minin uttered the above saying. He further said that although
Muhammad was his stepson, he was like his own son. (at-Tabari, vol.1,
pp.3400-3414; Ibn al-Athir, vol.3, pp.352-359; Ibn Kathir, vol.7,
pp.313-317; Abu'l-Fida', vol.1, p.179; Ibn Abi'l-Hadid, vol.6,
pp.82-100; Ibn Khaldun, vol.2, part2, pp.181-182;al-Isti'ab, vol.3,
pp.1366-1367; al-Isabah, vol.3, ppA72-473; al-Gharat, ath-Thaqafi,
vol.1, pp.276-322; Tarikh al-khamis, vol.2, pp.238 239) We have written
before (in the footnote to Sermon No.67) concerning the biography of
Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr.

[^83]: The meaning is that obligations should be so discharged that
there is no occasion for putting forth excuses, because after all in
making excuse there is a hint of shortcoming and humbleness, even though
it may be true and correct.

[^84]: There are a few grades of denial of favours and ingratitude. The
first is that a person may not be able to appreciate (the real
significance of) a favour; for example, the sight of the eyes, the
speech of the tongue, the hearing of the ears and the movements of the
hands and feet. These are all favours bestowed by Allah but many people
do not realize them to be favours, and do not entertain feelings of
gratitude. The second. grade is that a person may see a favour and
appreciate it but may not feel grateful for it. The third grade is that
a person may oppose the Bestower of the favours. The fourth grade is
that instead of using the favours granted by Him a person may use them
in committing sins against Allah. This is the highest grade of denial of
favours.

[^85]: When anyone's star is auspicious and his luck is good, he steps
automatically towards the goal in view, and his mind confronts no
perplexity in determining the correct way of approach; but the person
whose luck is about to ebb stumbles even in the light and his mental
faculties become paralysed. Consequently, when the downfall of the
Barmakids began, ten persons from among them assembled for consultation
about a matter but were not able to take a decision even after long
discussion. Seeing this Yahya said, "By Allah, it is a forerunner of our
decline and a sign of our downfall that even ten of us have not been
able to settle a matter, although while when we were in ascendancy one
of us used to solve ten problems easily.

[^86]: The result of lack of restraint and care in respect of small sins
is that a man becomes rather careless in the matter of sins, and, by and
by, this habit produces boldness for larger sins. Then, he begins to
commit them without hesitation. Therefore, one should regard small sins
as a harbinger of bigger sins, and avoid them, so that the stage for
committing big sins does not come.

[^87]: What worse defect can there be than that a man should criticise
those defects in others which exist in himself. The requirement of
justice is that before casting one's eye on the defects of others one
should look at his own defects and realize that a defect is a defect
whether it be in others or in oneself. A Persian couplet says: Looking
at other's defects is neither property nor manliness. Better look at
your own self since you are full of defects.

[^88]: If Allah considers it appropriate to keep a man living while he
is confined to a closed house, then He is certainly powerful enough to
provide the means of living to him, and just as a closed door cannot
prevent death in the same way it cannot prevent the entry of livelihood,
because the Might of Allah, the Almighty is equally capable of either.
The meaning is that a man should be content in the matter of livelihood
because whatever is destined for him will in any case reach him wherever
he may be. A Persian couplet says: Livelihood like death will reach a
man even if the door be closed, but greed keeps people (unnecessarily)
anxious.

[^89]: "Fa'l" means something from which one augurs well while "tiyarah"
means something from which one augurs evil. From the point of view of
religious law auguring evil from anything has no basis and it is just
the product of whim. However, auguring well is not objectionable. For
example, when after the immigration of the Prophet (from Mecca to
Medina), the Quraysh announced that whoever apprehended the Prophet
would be given one hundred camels as prize. Thereupon, Buraydah ibn
al-Husayb al-Aslami set off in his search with seventy of his men arid
when they met at a halting place the Prophet asked him who he was and he
said he was Buraydah ibn al-Husayb al-Aslami. Buraydah said: "The Holy
Prophet was not auguring evil instead he used to augur good." On hearing
this, the Prophet remarked: "barada amruna wa salaha" (our consequence
will be wholesome). Then he asked him what tribe he came from and on his
replying that he was from Aslam, the Prophet remarked: "salimna" (we
would be safe). Then he asked from which scion he was and when he
replied that he was from Banu Sahm, the Prophet remarked: "kharaja
sahmuka" (your arrow has missed the aim). Buraydah was much impressed by
this pleasing conversation and inquired from the Prophet who he was. The
Prophet replied, "Muhammad ibn 'Abdillah". Hearing this, he
spontaneously exclaimed, "I do stand witness that you are the Messenger
of Allah", and forsaking the prize announced by the Quraysh acquired the
wealth of Belief. (al-Isti'ab, vol.1, pp.185-186: Usd al-ghabah, vol. 1,
pp.175-176).

[^90]: What Amir al-mu'minin means is that man does not enjoy regular
mastery over anything, but such mastery as he is assigned by Allah, and
so long as this mastery lasts the obligations of the shari'ah also
continue, whereas when the mastery is taken away the obligations too are
lifted off, since in such a case the laying of obligations would mean
placing of responsibility beyond capacity which cannot be allowed by any
wise or prudent person. This is why Allah has placed the responsibility
of performing various acts after having conferred the necessary energy
in the limbs. It follows that this responsibility would remain only so
long as the energy subsists and that on the disappearance of the energy
the responsibility for action would also disappear. For example, the
obligation to pay Zakat (tax) applies only when there is wealth; but
when Allah would take away the wealth He would lift off the liability to
pay Zakat because in such a case the laying of obligation is against
prudence.

[^91]: If feeling and conscience is alive even the remembrance of a sin
destroys peace of mind because tranquility and happiness are achieved
only when the spirit is free from the burden of sin and one’s robe is
not polluted with disobedience. And this real happiness is not bound by
time but on whatever day a man desires he can avoid sin and enjoy this
happiness, and this very happiness will be the real happiness and the
harbinger of ‘Id.

[^92]: Despite efforts throughout life a man does not always achieve all
the successes of life. If on some occasions he succeeds as a result of
effort and seeking, on many others he has to face defeat and to give up
his objectives admitting defeat before fate. A little thinking can lead
to the conclusion that when things of this world cannot be achieved
despite effort and seeking, how can the success of the next world be
achieved without striving and seeking. A Persian couplet says: You
hankered after the world but did not attain the objective. O Allah, what
would be the result when the good of the next world has not even been
sought.

[^93]: The good or bad quality that is found in man springs from his
natural temperament. If the temperament produces one quality, his other
qualities will also be akin to this one because the dictates of
temperament will be equally effective in either. This, if a man pays
zakat and khums it means that his temperament is not miserly. Therefore
it is expected that he would not be niggardly in spending on other items
of charity as well. Similarly if a man speaks a lie it can be expected
that he will indulge in backbiting too, because these two habits are
similar to each other.

[^94]: ‘Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr ibn al-‘Awwam (1/622-73/692), whose
mother was Asma’, sister of ‘A’ishah (daughter of Abu Bakr), had grown
in his dislike of the Banu Hashim especially towards Amir al-mu’minin to
such a stage that he was able to change the opinion of his father,
az-Zubayr, against Amir al-mu’minin although the latter was the son of
his father’s aunt. That is why Amir al-mu’minin said: az-Zubayr had
always been from us the Ahlul Bayt (our household), until his ill-owned
son ‘Abdullah grew up. (al-Isti‘ab, vol.3, p.906; Usd al-ghabah, vol.3,
pp.162-163; Ibn ‘Asakir, vol.7, p.363; Ibn Abi’1-Hadid, vol.2, p.167;
vol.4, p.79; vol.20, p.104) ‘Abdullah was one of the instigators of the
battle of Jamal. His aunt ‘A’ishah, his father, az-Zubayr, and the son
of his mother’s uncle Talhah, had fought against Amir al-mu’minin. Thus,
Ibn Abi’1-Hadid writes : It was ‘Abdullah who urged az-Zubayr to fight
(in the battle of Jamal), and made the march to Basrah seem attractive
to ‘A’ishah. (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah al-balaghah, vol.4 p.79) ‘A’ishah
loved her nephew ‘Abdullah very much. To her he was like the only child
of a mother, and none in those days was more beloved to her than him.
(al-Aghani, Abu’l-Faraj, vol.9, p.142, Ibn Abi’l-Hadid, vol.20, p.120;
Ibn Kathir, vol.8, p.336). Hisham ibn ‘Urwah relates : I have not heard
her (‘A’ishah) praying for anyone as she used to pray for him
(‘Abdullah). She gave ten thousand Dirhams (as a gift) to the one who
informed her of ‘Abdullah’s safety from getting killed (by al-Ashtar in
the fight of the battle of Jamal), and prostrated to Allah in
thanks-giving for his safety. (Ibn ‘Asakir, vol.7, adid, vol.20,
p.111)pp.400,402; Ibn Abi’l-H This was the reason of ‘Abdullah’s
authority over her and his complete command over her affairs. He was the
one who directed and guided her in the direction he wished. However,
‘Abdullah’s hatred against the Banu Hashim had reach such a stage that
according to the narrations of a group of historians : During his
(‘Abdullah’s) Caliphate (in Mecca) he did not send blessings on the Holy
Prophet in his Friday prayer speech (khutbah) for forty Fridays. He used
to say: ‘‘Nothing prevents me from mentioning the Prophet’s name except
that there are a certain men (i.e. Banu Hashim) who become proud (when
his name is mentioned). In another interpretation : Nothing prevents . .
. except that the Prophet has a bad household who will shake their heads
on the mention of his name (Maqatil at-talibiyyin, p.474; Muruj
adh-dhahab, vol.3, p.79;at-Tarikh, al-Ya‘qubi, vol.2, p.261; al-‘Iqd
al-farid, vol.4, p.413; Ibn Abi’l-Hadid, vol.4, p.62; vol.19, pp.91-92;
vol.20, pp.127-129) ‘Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr said to ‘Abdullah ibn
al-‘Abbas: I have been concealing my hatred toward you, the people of
this house (i.e. the Household of the Prophet) for the last forty years.
(al-Mas‘udi, vol.3, p.80; Ibn Abi’l-Hadid, vol.4, p.62; vol.20, p.148)
He also used to hate Amir al-mu’minin in particular, defame his honour,
abuse and curse him. (al-Ya‘qubi, vol.2, pp.261—262; al-Mas‘udi, vol.3,
p.80: Ibn Abi’l-Hadid, vol.4, pp.61, 62—63, 79) He gathered Muhammad ibn
al-Hanafiyyah (the son of Amir al-mu’minin) and ‘Abdullah ibn al-‘Abbas
with seventeen men from the Banu Hashim including al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan
ibn ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib and imprisoned them in the shi‘b (a small
mountain valley) of ‘Arim. He intended to burn them with fire, so he
placed plenty of wood at the entrance of the shi‘b. Meanwhile,
al-Mukhtar ibn Abi ‘Ubayd ath-Thaqafi dispatched four thousand soldiers
to Mecca. On their arrival, they attacked ‘Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr
unexpectedly and rescued the Banu Hashim. ‘Urwah ibn az-Zubayr made an
excuse for his brother’s (‘Abdullah) deed saying that this action of his
brother’s was a result of the Banu Hashim’s refusal to swear allegiance
to him (‘Abdullah), like the action of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab towards the
Banu Hashim when they gathered in the house of Fatimah and refused to
swear allegiance to Abu Bakr. So, ‘Umar brought wood and intended to
burn the house on them. (Maqatil at-talibiyyin, p.474; al-Mas‘udi,
vol.3, pp.76—77: al-Ya‘qubi, vol.2, p.261; Ibn Abi’l-Hadid, vol.19,
p.91; vol.20, pp.123—126,146—148; Ibn ‘Asakir, vol.7, p.408; al-‘Iqd
al-farid, vol.4, p.413; Ibn Sa‘d, vol.5, pp.73—81; at-Tabari, vol.2,
pp.693—695; Ibn al-Athir, vol.4, pp.249—254; Ibn Khaldun, vol.3,
pp.26—28) In this connection, Abu’l-Faraj al-Isfahani writes: ‘Abdullah
ibn az-Zubayr always instigated others against the Banu Hashim and
pursued them (in his aim) by every worst method; he inspired against
them and spoke against them on the pulpits; and remonstrated against
them. Sometime Ibn ‘Abbas or someone else from them (Banu Hashim) raised
an objection against him. But afterwards, he changed his way and
imprisoned Ibn al-Hanafiyyah in a prison at the shi‘b ‘Arim. Then, he
gathered Ibn al-Hanafiyyah along with other members of the Banu Hashim
who were present (in Mecca) in a prison and collected wood to set fire
to it. This was because of the news that had reached him that Abu
‘Abdillah al-Jadali and other followers of Ibn al-Hanafiyyah had arrived
(in Mecca) to support Ibn al-Hanafiyyah and fight ‘Abdullah ibn
az-Zubayr. Therefore, he hastened to do away with the prisoners. But
when this news reached Abu ‘Abdillah al-Jadali, he came there at the
time when the fire was already set on them, then he put out the fire and
rescued them. (al-Aghani, p.15) So, all these prove the word of Amir
al-mu’minin about him.

[^95]: If a man ponders over his original condition and the eventual
breaking up and ruining of his body he will be compelled to admit his
lowliness and humble position instead of being proud and vain, because
he will see that there was a time when he did not exist and Allah
originated his existence with a humble drop of semen which took the
shape of a piece of flesh in the mother’s womb and continued feeding and
growing on thick blood. When on completion of the body he set foot on
the earth he was so helpless and incapable that he had neither control
over his hunger and thirst nor on sickness and health, nor any command
over benefit or harm, or any authority over life and death, not knowing
when the energy of limbs may exhaust, feeling and sense may leave,
eyesight may be taken away, power of hearing may be snatched and when
death may separate the spirit from the body and leave the latter to be
cut into pieces by vultures and kites or for worms to eat it in the
grave. An Arabic couplet says : How does one whose origin is semen and
whose end is a carcass dare be vain?

[^96]: This means that a comparison can be made among the poets when
their imagination runs in the same field; but when the expression of one
differs from the other, and the style of one varies from that of the
other it is difficult to decide who is defeated and who has won the
field. Consequently, from various considerations one is preferred over
the other and someone is considered greater for one consideration and
the other for other consideration, as the famous saying goes : The
greatest poet of Arabia is Imriu’l-Qays when he rides; al-A‘sha when he
is eager for something and an-Nabighah when he is afraid. Nevertheless,
despite this categorization Imriu’l-Qays is regarded to be in a high
position among poets of the first era because of the beauty of his
imagination, the excellence of his description, his inimitable similes
and rare metaphors, although many of his couplets are below moral
standards and speak about obscene subjects. But in spite of this
obscenity the greatness of his art cannot be denied, because an artist
looks at a poetic production from the point of view of art ignoring the
other factors which do not affect art.

[^97]: This is the prophecy about the decline and fall of the Umayyads
that proved true, word for word. This rule was founded by Mu‘awiyah ibn
Abi Sufyan and ended with Marwan ibn Muhammad al-Himar in 132 A.H. after
a life of ninety years, eleven months and thirteen days. The Umayyads
period was second to none in tyranny, oppression, harshness and
despotism. The despotic rulers of this period perpetrated such tyranny
that it put blots on Islam, blackened the pages of history and injured
the spirit of humanity. They allowed every kind of ruin and destruction
only to retain their own personal authority. They led armies to Mecca,
hurled fire on the Ka‘bah, made Medina the victim of their brute
passions, and shed streams of Muslim blood. At last, this bloodshed and
ruthlessness resulted in revolts and conspiracies from all sides and
their internal strife and agitation and their mutual fighting paved the
way for their ruin. Although political unrest had set in among them
earlier yet during the days of al-Walid ibn Yazid open disturbances
began to occur. On the other side Banu al-‘Abbas (the ‘Abbasids) also
started preparations and during the reign of Marwan al-Himar they
started a movement under the name of ‘‘al-khilafah al-Ilahiyyah’’ (the
Caliphate of Allah). For successful piloting of this movement they got a
martial leader Abu Muslim al-Khurasani who, in addition to his knowledge
of political events and occurrences, was also an expert in the art of
warfare. Making Khurasan as the base he spread a whole net against the
Umayyads and succeeded in bringing the ‘Abbasids to power. In the
beginning this man was quite unknown and it is for this unknowness and
low position that Amir al-mu’minin likened him and his associates to the
hyena as this simile is used for low and humble people.

[^98]: Generally purchases are made from helpless people in such a way
that taking advantage of their need and necessity, things are purchased
from them at cheap rates and are sold to them at high prices. No
religion allows taking advantage of such helplessness and extreme need,
nor is it permissible in ethics that profiteering should be resorted to
at the time of others' helplessness.

[^99]: The Holy Prophet used often to urge and order the ummah to love
Amir al-mu’minin and forbid them to bear any hatred against him.
Moreover, the Holy Prophet used to regard the love of Amir al-mu’minin
as the sign of Faith (iman) and the hatred of him as the sign of
hypocracy (nifaq) (as we have already mentioned on the foot-note of
No.45). Now, we quote one of the traditions of the Holy Prophet with
regard to this subject. It has been narrated through fourteen companions
that the Holy Prophet said : Whoever loves ‘Ali, he surely loves me; and
whoever loves me, he surely loves Allah, and whoever loves Allah, He
will cause him to enter Paradise. Whoever hates ‘Ali, he surely hates
me; and whoever hates me, he surely hates Allah, and whoever hates
Allah, He will cause him to enter the Fire. And whoever hurts ‘Ali, he
surely hurts me, and whoever hurts me, he surely hurts Allah, (surely,
those who hurt Allah and His Messenger, Allah has cursed them in the
present world and the world to come, and has prepared for them a
humbling chastisement [Qur’an, 33 :57] ). (al-Mustadrak, vol.3,
pp.127—128; 130; Hilyah al-awliya’, vol.l, pp.66-67; al-Isti‘ab, vol.3,
p.1101; Usd al-ghabah, vol.4, p. 383; al-Isabah, vol.3, pp.496-497;
Majma‘ az-zawa’id, vol.9, pp. 108—109, 129, 131, 132, 133; Kanz
al-‘ummal, vol.12, pp.202, 209, 218—219; vol.15, pp.95—96; vol.17, p.70;
ar-Riyad an-nadirah, vol.2, pp.166, 167, 209, 214; al-Manaqib, Ibn
al-Maghazili, pp.103,196, 382) At the same time, the Holy Prophet used
to caution the ummah against exaggeration in (Amir al-mu’minin’s) love
of him in exceeding the bounds of Islam in love for him. One who does so
is called ghali, i.e. he who believes that the Holy Prophet or Amir
al-mu’minin or any of the Shi‘ite Imams is god, or attributes to them
the special attributes of Allah, or believes that the twelve Imams are
prophets, or makes any claim which they (the Holy Prophet and Imams) did
not make about themselves. On the contrary, the Holy Prophet had also
forbidden any offence or denigration concerning them (Imams); and he
used to blame those who lay false and baseless accusations against them
as well as those who hate and bear malice. It was for this reason that
the Holy Prophet sometimes used to refrain from mentioning some of the
excellent qualities of Amir al-mu’minin as Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah al-Ansari
narrates: When Amir al-mu’minin approached the Holy Prophet with the
news of the conquering of Khaybar by himself (Amir al-mu’minin), the
Holy Prophet said to him: ‘‘O’ ‘Ali, had it not been for some groups of
my ummah who may say about you, what the Christians say about ‘Isa, son
of Maryam. I would have said (something) about you so that you would not
pass before any Muslim but that he would seize the dust from the tracks
of your feet demanding blessing from it. But it suffices to say that you
hold the same position in relation to me as Harun held in relation to
Musa except that there shall, in all certainty, be no prophet after
me.’’ (Majma‘ az-zawa’id, vol.9, p. 131; Ibn Abi’l-Hadid, vol.5, p.4;
vol.9, p.168; vol.18, p.282; Manaqib ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, Ibn
al-Maghazili, pp.237—239; Manaqib ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, al-Khwarazmi,
pp.75—76, 96, 220; Kifayah at-talib fi manaqib ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib,
al-Ganji, pp.264—265; Arjah al-matalib, pp.448, 454; Yanabi‘
al-mawaddah, pp.63—64, 130—131) The Holy Prophet had also informed the
Muslim ummah that there will appear two types of deviated groups among
the Muslims who will exceed the bounds of Islamic principles towards
understanding Amir al-mu’minin, as he himself has related: The Messenger
of Allah, peace be upon him and his descendants, called upon me and
said: ‘‘O’ ‘Ali, there is a resemblance between you and ‘Isa son of
Maryam, whom the Jews hated so much that they laid a false accusation
against his mother, and whom the Christians loved so much that they
assigned to him the position which is not for him.’’ (Then, Amir
al-mu’minin continues) Beware ! two types of persons will fall into ruin
over me: The one who loves (me) who will eulogize me for what is not in
me; and the one who hates (me) whose detestation against me will lead
him to lay false and baseless accusations on me. Beware ! I am not a
prophet, and nothing has been revealed to me. But I act according to the
Book of Allah and the sunnah of His Prophet as far as I can. (al-Musnad,
Ahmad ibn Hanbal, vol.1, p.160; al-Mustadrak, al-Hakim, vol.3, p.123;
Mishkat al-masabih, vol.3, pp.245—246; Majma‘ az-zawa’id, vol.9, p.133 ;
Kanz al-‘ummal, vol.12, p.219; vol.15, p.110; Ibn Kathir, vol.7, p.356)
The above mentioned sayings of Amir al-mu’minin (in this foot-note) as
well as in the text have been reported from the Holy Prophet when he
said to Amir al-mu’minin: O’ ‘Ali, two types of persons will fall into
ruin over you: The one who loves exaggeratingly and the liar who lays
false accusation. (al-Isti‘ab, vol.3, p.1101) Also, he said to him: Two
categories will be ruined over you: The one who loves exaggeratingly and
the hater who bears malice. (Ibn Abi’l-Hadid, vol.5, p.6) The famous
scholar of tradition ‘Amir ibn Sharahil ash-Sha‘bi (19/ 640 — 103/721)
has confirmed this saying that these two categories appeared and both
became disbelievers and were ruined. (al-Isti‘ab, vol.3, p.1130; al-‘Iqd
al-farid, vol.4, p.312)

[^100]: The belief in the Unity of Allah is not complete unless it is
supported by belief in freedom of Allah from all imperfection; that is,
one should regard Him above the limitations of body, shape, place or
time and should not subject Him to one’s own imagination and whims,
because the being who is contained within imagination and whims cannot
be Allah, but a creation of the human mind, while the field of mental
activity remains confined to things which are seen and observed.
Consequently, the greater man would try to appreciate Him through
illustrations connected by the human mind or his imaginative efforts and
the remoter he would get from reality. In this connection, al-Imam
Muhammad al-Baqir says : Whenever you contain Him in your imagination
and whim he will not be Allah but a creation like yourself and
revertable towards you. Justice means that whatever the form of
injustice and inequity it should be denied about Allah and He should not
be given such attributes which are evil and useless and which the mind
can in no way agree to attribute to Him. In this connection, Allah says
: And perfect is the word of your Lord in truth and justice; There is
none who can change His words, and He is the All-hearing and the
All-knowing. (Qur’an, 6:115)

[^101]: The friendship that is based on love and sincerity makes a man
free from ceremonial formalities, but the friendship for which formalism
is necessary is unstable and such a friend is not a true friend, because
true friendship requires that a friend should not be a cause of trouble
for the friend. If he is a cause of trouble he will prove tedious and
harmful and this harmfulness is a sign of his being the worst friend.
