Hadith Among the Shi`ah: the Four-hundred Usul
==============================================

As said above, the work of compilation of hadith among the Shi\`ah
started during the life of the Prophet (S). The texts which were
compiled by the early Shi\`ah scholars were called "Usul." It should
however be admitted that these texts were not without defect from the
point of view of the art of writing and compilation; for, most of the
authors of these texts were those who had heard the ahadith from one of
the Imams, in particular, from Imam Muhammad al-Baqir and Imam Ja\`far
al-Sadiq (A), writing them down in notebooks.

These notebooks composed by the Shi\`ah scholars, containing the
traditions heard from one of the Imams, or heard from someone who had
heard the Imam, came to be called "Usul." Out of these texts compiled
from the era of \`Ali (A) to the time of Imam Hasan al-\`Askari, the
eleventh Imam, the popular ones were four-hundred in number by different
authors. Each of them contained a number of ahadith written without any
attention being paid to the sequence or classification according to the
subject. Most of these traditions exist in the al-Mahasin al-Barqi,
al-Kafi, Man la Yahduruhu al-faqih. Some of them are found in Tahdhib.
It appears that most of these notebooks existed in the Shahpur Karkh
Library of Baghdad and were lost when Tughrul the Turk burnt the city on
conquering it in the year 448/1056. Others which escaped this calamity,
and other disasters, were preserved until the time of Ibn Idris and Ibn
Ta'wus and were available to them. Some, more than two-hundred of them,
have survived to our own times.[^29] These notebooks usually go with the
prefix "kitab" and often "nawadir". Thirteen of them exist in the
library of the Tehran University in the manuscript file number 962.
Twelve of them are "kitab" and one is "nawadir". These are:

1. Kitab Zayd al-Zad;
2. Kitab Ghasfari;
3. Kitab ibn Hamid al-Hannat;
4. Kitab Zayd al-Nirsi;
5. Kitab Ja\`far al-Hadrami;
6. Kitab Muhammad al-Hadrami;
7. Kitab \`Abd al-Malik ibn Hakim;
8. Kitab Muthanna ibn Walid al-Hannat;
9. Kitab Haddad al-Sindi;
10. Kitab Husayn ibn \`Uthman;
11. Kitab Kahili;
12. Kitab Salam Khurasani;
13. Nawadir Abi al-Hasan \`Ali ibn Asbat ibn Salim.[^30]

The Four Books:

The later Shi\`ah scholars of hadith compiled four great collections
from the aforementioned notebooks or Usul which became the most
important texts of hadith in the Shi\`ah world receiving hitherto
unprecedented popularity. These four books were the following:

1. Al-Kafi: It was compiled by Shaykh Abu Ja\`far Muhammad ibn Ya\`qub
al-Kulayni al-Razi (died 329/940) which contains 16,099 musnad
(documented) hadith narrated from the Ahl al-Bayt (the Household of the
Prophet).[^31]

2. Man la yahduruhu al-faqih: It was compiled by Shaykh Saduq Abu
Ja\`far Muhammad ibn \`Ali ibn Babwayhi al-Qummi (died 381/991) who is
known as "Shaykh-i Ajal" or "Saduq al-Ta'ifah". This book contains 9,044
hadith.[^32]

3. Al-Tahdhib: It was compiled by Abu Ja\`far Muhammad ibn al-Hasan
al-Tusi (died 460/1068) also known as "Shaykh al-Ta'ifah" (The chief of
the sect). This book contains 13,590 hadith.[^33]

4. Al-Istibsar: This book was also compiled by Shaykh Tusi, and
contains 5,511 hadith. The book is divided into four parts.[^34]

It is necessary to mention here that the four hundred "Usul" were
widely quoted and narrated by the Shi\`ah muhaddithin (scholars of
hadith) until a comprehensive compilation called al-Mahasin was done by
Shaykh Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid al-Barqi, who died in the second
half of the third century of Hijra. His book contained a large number of
ahadith arranged in numerous chapters. The al-Mahasin set an example
which opened a new era in the history of the science of Shi\`ah
hadith;[^35] because it was after him that others took up the task of
collection, compilation and classification of ahadith, which were until
then scattered in hundreds of Usul. This trend led to the emergence of
the four authoritative compilations of hadith during the fourth and
fifth centuries. Since then, they have been considered the greatest
sources of hadith for the Shi\`ah and served as the primary sources for
the later day writers.

The Age of Exposition:

After the compilation of the four great texts of hadith, the next stage
was that of exposition. During this period, the attention of most of the
scholars was devoted to writing of commentaries and exposition of these
texts. A large number of commentaries were written on each of these
texts. In spite of the fact that most of these commentaries have, in the
course of time, been forgotten and lie buried in libraries, more than
120 of these commentaries and exegeses have come down to our
times.[^36]

However, this phase of exposition should be regarded as a period of
langour in the history of development of the science of hadith; because,
instead of a gradual growth, it marked a stage when most of the
discussions went round and round in a definite circle without any
progress or breakthrough. This situation lasted until the time of
Safavid rule. With the formal recognition of the Shi\`ah faith as the
state religion from the early times of the Safavis, the study of hadith
commenced growth once again.

The Age of Great Scholars and Great Books:

Great scholars of hadith appeared in the Shi\`ah world during the
period of Safavid rule. These men restored the leading role of the
Shi\`ah in this field, with the result that after ages of neglect and
stagnation, the study of hadith entered its golden age. At the close of
the eleventh century and the beginning of the twelveth, for once again,
the study of hadith received the attention of great scholars. The most
prominent among them were Muhammad ibn Murtada Mulla Muhsin Fayd
al-Kashani (died 1091/1680), Muhammad ibn Hasan al-Hurr al-\`Amili (died
1104/1692-93) and Mulla Muhammad Baqir ibn Muhammad Taqi al-Majlisi
(died 1111/1699-1700). Each of them has left behind a precious scholarly
work. These works are the following:

1. Kitab al-jami\` al-Wafi: It is the work of Mulla Muhsin Fayd
al-Kashani. This book comprises of the four aforementioned classical
texts of hadith. In this book, which is a very precious work from every
aspect, the repetitive ahadith have been deleted and expositions have
been written on the difficult ones.[^37]

2. Wasa'il al-Shi\`ah: Its author is Shaykh Muhammad ibn al-Hasan
al-Hurr al-\`Amili. This book, like the above one, combines the four
classical texts of hadith and draws upon other sources also.

3. Bihar al-Anwar: It is what can be called an encyclopedia of Shi\`ah
hadith. It is the work of \`Allamah Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi and is the
greatest work of hadith compiled either among the Sunnis or the Shi\`ah.
In this work, in addition to the Shi\`ah sources, there are plenty of
ahadith drawn from the Sunni sources. In spite of the great amount of
labour and pain borne by al-\`Allamah al-Majlisi, it should be admitted
that the book is an unfinished masterpiece; since, he could not succeed
in eliminating many weak traditions from his great work. Had al-Majlisi
lived for another decade, he might have been successful in producing a
true "ocean of light" full of precious pearls and corals and mines of
pure gold. The task of extracting its precious pearls and gold from this
unfathomable ocean and clearing its treasures of their adhering mud and
fungus remains for us to accomplish.

**The Age of Further Research:
**
After the age of al-Majlisi, another age followed in which the study of
hadith made valuable progress. The scholars of this period did not
abandon the pursuits of such men as Fayd al-Kashani, al-Hurr al-\`Amili,
and al-\`Allamah al-Majlisi; rather they adhered to this path with
greater care and attention to the new sophisticated criteria of
authorship. Among those who have left worthy books in the field of the
science of hadith can be named \`Allamah Muhammad Husayn ibn \`Allamah
al-Taqi, and Muhammad Nuri al-Mazandarani al-Tabarsi, the latter of whom
wrote the Kitab mustadrak al-wasa'il wa mustanbat al-masa'il, which was
finished in 1319/1901, adding several chapters to the Kitab al-wasa'il
al-shi\`ah. This book is the greatest compilation of the ahadith of the
Shi\`ah faith. \`Allamah Nuri died in the year 1320/1902 in the city of
Najaf.[^38] In this brilliant period there lived such great men as the
late Ayatullah Haj Aqa Husayn Burujardi, whose work changed the status
of several thousand hadith. It is hoped that the Shi\`ite and Sunni
scholars of our times, working together, may be able to make greater
achievements in this field.

**Hadith Among the Ahl Al-Sunnah - The First Recorders:**

According to Kashf al-Zunun, when the Companions of the Prophet (S)
began to die one after another, the need to record the hadith became
evident. It is also maintained that the first person to compose a book
in Islam was Ibn Jurayj.[^39] The next to be compiled was the al-Muwatta'
of Imam Malik (died 179/795), and Rabi\` ibn Sabih of Basra was the
first man to compile a book with different chapters.

**Al-Sihah al-Sittah or the 'Six Authentic Texts'**

The work of compilation of hadith continued until the time of Imam
al-Bukhari and Imam Muslim, who were followed by al-Tirmidhi, Abu Da'ud
al-Sijistani, al-Nasa'i and others.[^40] Imam Malik, who lived in Mecca
in his al-Muwatta' compiled the ahadith with a sequence based on the
principles of jurisprudence.[^41] Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, in his Musnad
classified the ahadith in various chapters each devoted to a separate
Companion of the Prophet (S) from whom the narration was quoted.[^42]
After them Imam al-Bukhari classified the traditions according to
region: he devoted separate sections to ahadith narrated by people of
Hijaz, Iraq and Syria. Imam Muslim deleted the repetitive ahadith and
put them in various chapters corresponding with various aspects of fiqh
and other chapters dealing with biographical details. After them, Abu
Da'ud, al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasa'i extended the scope of the work devoting
greater attention to classification of the material.[^43]

**Works Based on Al-Sihah Al-Sittah**

The period of the first compilers of hadith was followed by those who
compiled their own collections from al-Sihah al-Sittah, summarizing and
rearranging the ahadith such as \`Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Hamid ibn Abu
Bakr, Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Raqani and Abu Mas\`ud Ibrahim ibn Muhammad
al-Dimashqi who combined the books of al-Bukhari and Muslim.

After them, Abu al-Hasan Zarin ibn Mu\`awiyah combined the books of
al-Muwatta' and al-Jami\` of al-Tirmidhi and the Sunan of Abu Da'ud and
al-Nasa'i and the works of Muslim and Bukhari. After him Ibn Athir
combined the six classical texts (al-sihah al-sittah) and the book of
Zarin, producing a work more organized than that of Zarin. After that
al-Suyuti combined al-sihah al-sittah and the ten masanid (plural of
musnad) and called his book Jam\` al-Jawami', which however retains
several weak ahadith.[^44]

**Conclusion**

To sum up, it may be said that the primary purpose of the first
compilers of hadith was to record the narrations without any attention
to the principles and techniques of compilation and bookwriting. It may
even be said that in the beginning the purpose was not even that of
composing a book; rather the aim was to record and preserve the ahadith
in individual notebooks.

During the second stage, though there was a conscious purpose of
composing books, the works had many defects; for the ahadith lacked
order and classification forcing the reader to go through the whole book
while searching for a certain hadith.

The third phase was that of classification of the ahadith in which
every author divided them into chapters in his own way: one would
classify them on the basis of fiqhi issues and another preferred
classification according to the land of origin of the narrators.

During the fourth phase, the compilers deleted the repetitive ahadith
making the job of the reader a bit easier. In the fifth phase, the
experts of hadith began to examine the traditions from various angles,
such as studying them from the point of view of various jurists and for
discovery of new points - a matter which we shall discuss in greater
detail in a proper chapter. During this stage the whole bulk of hadith
came under critical study and endeavour was made to collect them in a
single work.[^45]

first man to record and compile ahadith. See Ta'sis al-shi\`ah, p.280,
