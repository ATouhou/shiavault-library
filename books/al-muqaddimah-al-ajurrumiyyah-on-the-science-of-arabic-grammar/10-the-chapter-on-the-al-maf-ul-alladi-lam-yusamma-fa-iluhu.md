[^47]

(Maf‘ūl whose Fā‘il is not named)

It is an Ism that is Marfū‘ whose Fā‘il is not mentioned with it.

If the Fi‘l is:

Māḍī its initial letter[^48] is marked with a Ḍammah and what is before
its final letter is marked with a Kasrah,

and if it is:

Muḍāri‘ its first letter is marked with a Ḍammah and what[^49] is before
its final letter is marked with a Fatḥah.

It is of two types: Ḍāhir and Muđmar.

The Ḍāhir is like when you say:

ضُربزيدٌ                    (Zayd was hit)

يُضرَبزيدٌ                  (Zayd is/will be hit)

أُكرِمعمروٌ                  (‘Amr **was honoured)**

**يُكرَم** عمروٌ                  (‘Amr is/will be honoured)

and what is similar to that.

The Muđmar is twelve, like when you say:

ضُرِبتُ                                 [I (masc./fem.) was hit]

ضُرِبنَا                                   [We (masc./fem. dual/pl.)
were hit]

ضُرِبتَ                                 [You (masc. sing.) were hit]

ضُرِبتِ                                 [You (fem. sing.) were hit]

ضُرِبتُمَا                      [You (masc./fem. dual) were hit]

ضُرِبتُمْ                                   [You (masc. pl.) were hit]

ضُرِبتُنَّ                      [You (fem. pl.) were hit]

ضُرِبَ (هُوَ )                 (He was hit)

ضُرِبتْ (هِيَ )               (She was hit)

ضُرِبَا                                    [They (masc. dual) were hit]

ضُرِبُوْ ا                                [They (masc. pl.) were hit]

**ضُرِب** نَ                                   [They (fem. pl.) were
hit]
