Part Iii : Disciplines of `ilm Al-hadith
========================================

At the time of its emergence, there was a difference of opinion among
men of eminence among Muslims about the very necessity of hadith. The
first two caliphs, for example, exhibited a complete lack of interest in
it.[^1] Nevertheless, after the death of the Prophet (S), its importance
was gradually realized. This realization grew with time, to the extent
that it became necessary for religious scholars to consider hadith as
the second authoritative source after the Qur'an for solution of their
canonical problems. The importance of hadith grew steadily with time,
until it took the shape of a vast science with numerous disciplines.

Al-Suyuti, in introduction to his Tadrib al-rawi, writes that at the
beginning of the second century of Hijrah, the sciences related to
hadith consisted of three disciplines: \`ilm tadwin al-hadith, \`ilm
al-hadith, and \`ilm usul al-hadith. However, during the third century,
according to Ibn al-Mulaqqin, the science of hadith came to consist of
more than two hundred disciplines. Abu Hatam, according to a more simple
classification, has mentioned the existence of fifty separate
disciplines. Ibn Hajar describes the various disciplines more simply in
this fashion: \`ilm usul al-hadith, \`ulum al-hadith, \`ilm mustalah
al-hadith, and \`ilm dirayat al-hadith (which also includes \`ilm
al-rijal).[^2]

Ahmad Amin, in his Fajr al-Islam, says: "The study of hadith was
followed by the birth of various disciplines, such as chronicles of
history, wars, and merits of peoples and persons. This was followed by
writing of biographies, such as the work of Ibn Hisham. According to Ibn
Jarir, Ibn Ishaq and al-Baladhuri, their style and method was that of
hadith narration. The anecdotes of the lives and times of former
prophets, together with the hadith and the anecdotes mentioned in the
Qur'an, helped to expand the literature dealing with the former
prophets. The interest in hadith stimulated the study of Greek, Indian
and Persian philosophy and ethics. \`Ilm al-hadith stimulated popular
interest in all sciences, and itself became a religious and canonical
source, and, above all, the source of civil and penal codes. All this,
avoiding further elaboration, bears testimony to the role played by
\`ilm al-hadith in expansion of the sciences."[^3]

According to al-Suyuti, al-Hazimi considered \`ilm al-hadith to consist
of more than a hundred disciplines; Ibn Salah has mentioned 65 of these
various disciplines.[^4] Ibn Khaldun, in his work on history, mentions
the following branches of \`ilm al-hadith: the study of the nasikh and
mansukh verses of the Qur'an, \`ilm al-rijal, \`ilm istilahat al-hadith,
study of the text of hadith and its peculiarities, study of the
qualifications necessary for a narrator to transmit hadith, knowledge of
veracity of transmitters, and \`ilm fiqh al-hadith.[^5]

However, Hakim Abi \`Abd Allah Muhammad ibn \`Abd Allah Hafiz
al-Nishaburi, in his book Ma\`rifat \`ulum al-hadith, mentions fifty-two
disciplines in the science of hadith. In view of its importance, we
mention them here:

1. Recognition of al-hadith al-\`ali: On page 5 of his book, he says
that recognition of the hadith \`ali al-'asnad (a tradition all of whose
narrators are known and veracious) is a part of \`ilm al-hadith. He
mentions further that besides the condition that the chain of
transmitters of a hadith \`ali should be as short as possible, the
transmitters must, in addition, be all veracious.

2. Recognition of al-hadith al-nazil: On page 7, he says that
identification of al-hadith al-nazil is also a branch of \`Ilm
al-hadith. Some have defined al-hadith al-nazil as the opposite of
al-hadith a/-'ali, but this definition is insufficient. In fact, there
are various degrees of the al-hadith al-nazil recognizable only for the
experts. In this category are included the ahadith which require more
than the ordinary amount of learning and scholarship.

3. Study of the veracity of narrators: On page 14, he includes this
also as part of \`Ilm al-hadith. Biographical details, level of
knowledge and degree of carefulness of a narrator are issues related to
this subject.

4. Knowledge of masanid of hadith: On page 17, he says that knowledge
of the masanid (first narrator in the chain of transmission) of a hadith
is an important subject. There is a disagreement among leading Islamic
jurists about the validity of ahadith which are not musnadah. Al-hadith
al-musnad is one which has reached us from one of the well-known
Companions of the Messenger of God (S).

5. Study of al-riwayat al-mawqufah: On page 19, he discusses the study
of al-riwayat al-mawqufah. Al-riwayat al-mawqufah is one whose primary
source is one of the Companions of the Prophet (S).

6. Study of those ahadith whose first narrator is not mentioned.
Al-Nishaburi discusses this topic on page 21.

7. Study of the Companions (al-Sahabah): This study involves the
history of Companions, whether they belonged to the Ansar (the Helpers)
or to the Muhajirun (the Emigrants), and their station and degree of
nearness to the Prophet (S).

8. Study of al-hadith al-mursal: Discussing this topic on page 25, he
includes it among the most difficult in \`Ilm al-hadith, and says that
none except the most learned can handle this subject. Al-hadith
al-mursal is a tradition narrated by someone belonging to the next
generation (the Tabi'un) after the Prophet.

9. Study of al-hadith al-munqati': On page 27, he states that al-hadith
al-munqati' is different from al-mursal, although like al-mursal it is
one narrated by one of the Tabi'un. There are three kinds of al-hadith
al-munqati'.

10. Study of transmitters of al-hadith al-musalsal: On page 29, he
states that there are eight types of this kind of hadith.

11. Study of al-hadith al-mu'an'an: On page 34 of his work,
al-Nishaburi includes the study of non- counterfeit ahadith mu'an'anah
(lit. transmitted) as part of \`Ilm al-hadith.

12. Study of al-hadith al-mu'dal: On page 36, he quotes the definition
given by \`Ali ibn \`Abd Allah al-Madini, the great scholar of hadith,
and his predecessors of al-hadith al-mu'dal as a tradition whose two or
more links of transmitters are missing.

13. Study of the al-hadith al-mudarraj: On page 39, he defines
al-hadith al-mudarraj as a tradition in which the narrator has included
his own words or that of a Companion or someone else in the text of
hadith.

14. Study of al-Tabi\`un (persons belonging to the next generation
after the Prophet (S) and his Companions): On page 41, including the
study of lives of the Tabi'un in \`Ilm al-hadith, he remarks that this
in itself involves several separate disciplines.

15. Study of the Atba' al-Tabi'in (persons belonging to the second
generation after the Prophet): On page 46, this is also said to be
included in \`Ilm al-hadith.

16. Study of al-akabir 'an al-asaghir: On page 48, he includes the
study of al-akabir 'an al-asaghir (lit. 'the greater from the lesser
ones', said of traditions related by someone senior in age or knowledge
from one junior to him in one of these aspects, or by a prolific
narrator from one less prolific in narration of hadith) in \`Ilm
al-hadith.

17. Study of the descendents of the Companions: On page 49, he states
that anyone who lacks knowledge on this subject is bound to make errors
in regard to many traditions.

18. \`Ilm jarh wa ta'dil (lit. challenging the validity, and
settlement, or amendment): On page 82, he states that this involves two
distinct disciplines.

19. Study of al-sahih and al-saqim (said of hadith): On page 58, he
states that this study is different from \`Ilm jarh wa ta'dil mentioned
before.

20. \`Ilm fiqh al-hadith.

21. Study of the nasikh and mansukh in hadith.

22. Study of uncommon words in the text of hadith: On page 88, he
states that this study began after the period of the Atba' al-Tabi'in.
Among those who pursued it were Malik, al-Thawri, Shu'bah, and others
who came after them. The first to compile a work on the uncommon aspects
of hadith (\`Ilm ghara'ib al-hadith) was Nadr ibn Shumayl.

23. Study of the al-hadith al-mashhur (lit. famous): On page 92, he
points out the distinction between al-hadith al-sahih (veracious hadith)
and al-hadith al-mashhur.

24. Study of the al-hadith al-gharib (uncommon): He states on page 94
that it is related to the study mentioned above (no.22); for there are
various aspects of uncommonness.

25. Study of al-hadith al-mufrad (al-khabar al-wahid): He states on
page 96 that this study involves three kinds of hadith: firstly, those
narrated by one from al-Madinah, Makkah or Kufah; secondly, those
narrated by one of the Imams; thirdly, those narrated by someone besides
the above two.

26. Study of apocryphal narrators: Study of those narrators who do not
make a distinction between the narrated text and their own words.

27. Study of deficiencies found in hadith: On page 112, he states that
this study is distinct from \`Ilm jarh wa ta'dil and the study of
al-saqim and al-sahih.

28. Study of al-hadith al-shadh (lit. rare): On page 119, he states
that it is a tradition narrated from only one veracious narrator.

29. Study of prophetic traditions which conflict with others, and which
are relied upon by founders of one of the fiqh schools.

30. Recognition of traditions which are not contradicted by any
other.

31. Study of the various schools of the muhaddithun.

32. Study of the process of memorization of hadith (\`Ilm mudhakarat
al-hadith).

33. Study and recognition of additional words in hadith.

34. Study of al-tashif (slip of pen, misspelling, misplacement of
diacritical marks etc.) in manuscripts.

35. Study of such errors by the muhaddithun in manuscripts of their
ahadith. 36.

Study of the lives of brothers and sisters of the Sahabah, the Tabi'un,
and their descendents up to the present times.

37. Study of the lives of the Sahabah, the Tabi'un, and Tabi'
al-Tabi'in from whom not more than one narrator has transmitted.

38. Study of the tribes of narrators, including the Sahabah, the
Tabi'un, and Tabi' al-Tabi'in up to the present.

39. Study of genealogies of the muhaddithun, from al-Sahabah up to the
present. On page 168, he says that study of genealogies has been
recommended by the Prophet (S). On page 169, he quotes this tradition on
the authority of Abu Hurayrah:

Know your genealogies, so as to fulfil your duties to your kin.[^6]
