Lesson Fifty Four: Martyrdom and Purity
=======================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إذا مُتَّ عَلَى طَهارَة تَكُونُ شَهِيْداً
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

When you pass away in purity, you shall be ranged with the martyrs.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The above tradition refers to part of instructions of the Prophet (peace
be upon him and his progeny) to one of his companions saying: ‘if you
can, perform ritual ablution day and night, because if you die in this
condition, you shall be considered a martyr’.

Besides the literal meaning which refers to performing ritual ablution,
it refers to a more important aspect: living and dying with purity and
innocence. The chaste ones, with guiltless hearts and minds that are
free from dishonesty and vanity, who live a pure life and leave the
world in this condition, surely will be ranged with martyrs because
martyrdom is not limited to being killed in the battle field. There are
also other such sayings among the traditions from the pure household of
the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny)
