Imam Hasan's Role In Islamic Life
=================================

At an early age, the role of the grandson of the Holy Prophet (S) began
to evidence itself. It was before he was officially appointed to the
office of Imamate by his father. His positive role took shape clearly
from the moment the Muslim ummah gave their pledge of allegiance to Imam
‘Ali (as) as the new caliph. It rose to its zenith after the martyrdom
of Imam ‘Ali (as).
