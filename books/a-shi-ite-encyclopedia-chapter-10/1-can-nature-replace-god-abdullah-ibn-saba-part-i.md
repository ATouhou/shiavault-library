Can ‘nature’ Replace God? Abdullah Ibn Saba (part I)
====================================================

Enemies of Islam whose goal were/are to split the Muslims, in their
effort to explain the emergence of Shia, claim that the Shia are a sect
which was originated by Abdullah Ibn Saba, a Jew who embraced Islam
during the reign of Uthman Ibn Affan, the third caliph.

They further state that Abdullah Ibn Saba traveled in Muslim cities and
towns, from Damascus to Kufa to Egypt, propagating among Muslims that
Ali is the Prophet's successor. He provoked Muslims to kill Uthman since
he believed Uthman had occupied the seat of Imam Ali.

He also made mischief in the armies of Ali and his opponents in the
battle of Camel. He was also responsible for all the false ideas of the
Shia forward. These mercenary writers believe that Abdullah Ibn Saba is
the ORIGIN of Shia; and since he himself was a hypocrite and a falsifier
of tales, then all the knowledge and beliefs of the Shia are also false.
In fact, Abdullah Ibn Saba is the best scapegoat for all the claims of
some Sunnis.

While the existence of a person in the name of Abdullah Ibn Saba in the
early history of Islam is seriously under question, what is clear after
extensively researching this topic is that even if a poor man with such
name ever existed at that time,

the stories propagated about this person are legendary, false,
fabricated, and fictitious, and there exists no proof for the validity
of these stories attached to him. This point will be studied in this
discussion, by the willing of Allah.

**Introduction**

The fabricated stories around the character of Abdullah Ibn Saba are
the malicious production of one of the disciples of the devil, namely
Sayf Ibn Umar al-Tamimi.

He was a story teller, lived in the second century after Hijrah, who
shaped his stories by some primary facts he found in the documented
history of Islam available at that time.

Sayf wrote a novel much the same as what Salman Rushdi did in "Satanic
Verses" with similar motives, but with the difference that the role of
Satan in this case was given to poor Abdullah Ibn Saba.

Sayf Ibn Umar distorted the biographies of the companions of the Holy
Prophet (PBUH&HF) to please the government of his time, and to distort
the history of Shia and to ridicule Islam. Sayf was a staunch advocate
of the Umayads, who were known throughout history to be one of the worst
enemies of Ahlul-Bayt, and as such, it was in his best interest to
invent such stories to degrade the Shia.

In his stories however he followed many other goals one of which was to
cleverly elevate the status of his tribe over others by inventing some
imaginary companions form his tribe. However many Sunni scholars found
numerous unjustifiable heresies in his reports which was not limited to
the issue of Abdullah Ibn Saba, and consequently they abandoned his
reports, and accuse him as a man of forgery and lies.

Yet Sayf's works enjoyed the support of a minority of Sunnis to this
date. Here, later on, I give the sayings of several leading Sunni
scholars, who all confirmed that Sayf Ibn Umar was an untrustworthy
person and his stories are void.

Ideological studies indicate that most of those who hate the Shi'ite
school of thought (a lot of whom being the enemies of Islam anyway)
justify their enmity on this obvious heresy which they would exploit to
backup their attack on Shia. The approach which resembles the one
adopted by Sayf Ibn Umar himself.

**The Origin of The Tale**

The tale of Abdullah Ibn Saba is over twelve centuries old. Historians
and writers, one after the other recorded it, adding more and more to
it.

With a glance at the chain of transmitters of this story, you will find
the name of Sayf sitting in there. The following historians recorded
directly from Sayf:

(1) Tabari.
(2) Dhahabi. He has also cited from Tabari(1).
(3) Ibn Abi Bakir. He has also recorded from Ibn Athir(15), who has
recorded from Tabari(1).
(4) Ibn Asakir.

The following have recorded indirectly from Sayf:

(5) Nicholson from Tabari(1).
(6) Encyclopedia of Islam from Tabari(1).
(7) Van Floton from Tabari(1).
(8) Wellhauzen from Tabari(1).
(9) Mirkhand from Tabari(1).
(10) Ahmad Amin from Tabari(1), and from Wellhauzen(8).
(11) Farid Wajdi from Tabari(1).
(12) Hasan Ibrahim from Tabari(1).
(13) Saeed Afghani from Tabari(1), and from Ibn Abi Bakir(3), Ibn
Asakir(4), and Ibn Badran(21).
(14) Ibn Khaldoon from Tabari(1).
(15) Ibn Athir from Tabari(1).
(16) Ibn Kathir from Tabari(1).
(17) Donaldson from Nicholson(5), and from Encyclopedia(6).
(18) Ghiath al-Din from Mirkhand(9).
(19) Abul Fida from Ibn Athir(15).
(20) Rashid Ridha from Ibn Athir(15).
(21) Ibn Badran from Ibn Asakir(4).
(22) Bostani from Ibn Kathir(16).

The above list gives evidence to the fact that the fictitious stories
around the character of Abdullah Ibn Saba has been started by Sayf and
cited next by Tabari directly from Sayf's book as Tabari mentioned
himself (See the chain of narrators of traditions related to Abdullah
Ibn Saba, inside the History of Tabari.

For instance, see the index of Vol. 15, English version, under the name
of Sayf Ibn Umar or Abdullah Ibn Saba). Therefore, Sayf's character and
his history should be studied and analyzed with a great care.
