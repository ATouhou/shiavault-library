76. Attachment to the Two Weighty Things (Thaqlayn)
===================================================

*Dua* for early reappearance of His Eminence, the Master of the Time
(aj) is attachment to *Thaqlayn*, the two precious gems that the Holy
Prophet (S) left in his Ummah. The Messenger of Allah (S) ordered that
we should remain attached to the *Thaqlayn* and this matter is narrated
from the Holy Prophet (S), both by the Shias as well as the Sunnis. In
the traditional report mentioned in *Ghayat al-Maraam*[^1] it is
mentioned as follows:

Amirul Momineen (as) was asked about the statement of the Messenger of
Allah (S): I leave among you two weighty things, the Book of Allah and
my Progeny.

That who are meant by ‘progeny’. Amirul Momineen (as) said: “I, Hasan,
Husain and nine Imams from the descendants of Husain, the ninth of whom
is Mahdi and Qaim. They will not separate from the Book of Allah and it
will also not break away from them till they return to the Messenger of
Allah (S) besides the cistern (of Kauthar).”

I say: The point of evidence in this tradition is: Attachment to the
progeny will be obtained through supporting them. Now since praying for
an early reappearance of our master, the Master of the Time (aj) is
supporting them through the tongue, and which will be a source of
beliefs in them and being steadfast on them, the supplicant will fit
this description.
