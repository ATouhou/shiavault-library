Effort and Success
==================

***“Man will not get anything unless he works hard”*** (Surah al-Najm,
53:39).

There is no doubt about the fact that man cannot make any progress
without effort and hard work. For example, one who studies
whole-heartedly becomes a scholar. Similarly, a farmer who ploughs the
farm, sows seeds in it and waters them, is soon rewarded with crops. On
the other hand, whoever is lazy and indolent and does not do any work,
is faced with woes and worries. Indolence and irresponsibility results
in poverty and grief, and Islam dislikes these things very much. Islam
regards hard work a duty.

The Holy Prophet always insisted upon working hard. He is reported to
have said: “One who works is the friend of Allah, and one who does not
work is considered by Allah, to be His enemy”.

Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (a), our sixth Imam, also impressed upon the people
the advantages of hard work. He has said:

“Allah does not love those who sleep too much, and do not work”.
