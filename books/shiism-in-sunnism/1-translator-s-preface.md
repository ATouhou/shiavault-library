Translator’s Preface
====================

In the Name of Most Exalted

<blockquote dir="rtl">

الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ
نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمْ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا.

***“This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My
favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion.”***

This is what Almighty God revealed to His Prophet (a.s) in Ghadir Khumm,
favoring mankind with a perfect religion. Believing in Islam as the most
perfect religion requires not only a life in accord with its principles
but also a constant attempt to discover the reality and spirit of it.

“*Shiism in Sunnism*” is an invaluable step in the direction of such an
attempt, of which I had the honor of translation. I can hardly, if ever,
praise Allah for the wisdom and capability He has bestowed on me. In
fact, ***‘this is of the grace of my Lord.’***[^1]

I am greatly indebted to my parents for their sincere support throughout
my life. I am also thankful to my professors without whose guidance I
could not accomplish this translation, which is as a drop in the ocean.
I dedicate this first translation experience of mine to the Commander of
the Believers, Imam Ali (a.s), as an offering for ***“the day when We
call every people with their Imams”***[^2] and ***“the day on which
property will not avail, nor sons.***”[^3]
