Obligatory fasts
================

All the schools concur that the wajih fasts are those of the month of
Ramadan, their qada', the expiatory fasts performed as kaffarah, and
those performed for fulfilling a vow. The Imamis add further two,
related to the Hajj and solitude in masjid (i\`tikaf). We have already
dealt in some detail with the fast of Ramadan, its conditions and the
things that invalidate it. Here we intend to discuss its qada' and the
kaffarah to which one who breaks it becomes liable. Other types of
obligatory fasts have been discussed under the related chapters.
