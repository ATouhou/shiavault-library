Story no. 58: On Mothers’ Day
=============================

It was mother’s day, and all the children were buying gifts for their
mothers.  
 Some one was buying stockings, someone shoes, someone a frying pan, and
so on.  
 But Sharif and Azadeh were from an Islamic family. Sharif said
“Whatever I give my mother is less, because the Holy Prophet has said
“Paradise lies under the feet of mothers”.  
 Azadeh said “Whatever we give, it wouldn’t be enough for Mama”.  
 After thinking for quite a while, Sharif said “Because Mama loves to
pray, recite Quran and duas, we can give her a Quran and Mafatih (Book
of Duas).  
 Finally, Shareef bought his mother a Quran and Azadeh gifted her with a
Mafatih.
