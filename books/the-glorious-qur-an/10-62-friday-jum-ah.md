62: Friday (jum`ah)
===================

This chapter containing 11 verses from the Madinese period was revealed
after the previous one on Battle Array 61 and before Victory 48. It
describes the Prophet's increasing troubles with his Jewish neighbors in
and around Madina and contains the famous parable on "The Donkey
Carrying Books" (I), concerning those who do not practise what they
preach nor profit from what they can learn.
