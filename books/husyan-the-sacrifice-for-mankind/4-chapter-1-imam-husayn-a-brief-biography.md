Chapter 1: Imam Husayn – a Brief Biography
==========================================

Imam Husayn alayhis-salam is the son of Imam Ali alayhis-salam and
Fatima alayhas-salam the daughter of the holy Prophet Muhammad
sallallahu- alayhi-wa-aalih. He was the second grandson of the prophet
Muhammad salla-llahu-alayhi-wa-aalih, and he was the holy prophet’s
third caliph successor, after his father and brother Hasan
alayhis-salam.

Like his father and brother, he was the Imam (leader) of the people.
[On instructions from Allah Almighty, prophet Muhammad
salla-llahu-alayhiwa-aalih announced the twelve Imams6 who would succeed
him in leading the Muslim nation.] Imam Husayn is the father of the nine
Imams who followed him in succession.

He was born in Medina on the third of the month of Sha‘ban, in the
third year after Hijra – 624 CE.

On the day of Ashura, while suffering from extreme thirst, he was
brutally killed and his head severed by the swords of the army of
Yazid-bin- Mo‘awiyah on Saturday the tenth of Muharram in the year 61
after Hijra –around 681 CE – in Karbala, Iraq.

His son and successor, Imam Ali ibn7 Husayn, Zayn-al-Abidin
alayhissalam prepared his headless body, after being left in the field
for three days, and buried him in the fields of Karbala, where his
shrine stands today.

The holy Prophet has said in the praise of Imam Hasan and Imam Husayn
alayhum-as-salam8:

"My two grandsons are the delights of my eyes."

6 Imam – literally meaning leader – and in the scope of this work Imam
refers to one of the twelve Ma’soom (impeccable) Imams who in turn
succeeded Prophet Muhammad after his death as appointed by him. The
first of the twelve Imams is Imam Ali alayhis-salam, followed by his son
Imam Hasan alayhis-salam, followed by Imam Hasan’s brother Imam Husayn
alayhis-salam, followed by nine Imams, all descendents of Imam Husayn
alayhissalam.

On instructions from Allah Almighty, Prophet Muhammad
salla-llahu-alayhi-waaalih appointed the twelve Imams beginning with
Imam Ali alayhis-salam as his immediate successor and stated the names
of all twelve imams, even though only three were born at the time.

7 ibn, also written as bin or ben depending on relevant pronunciation,
is Arabic for ‘son of’.

"Hasan and Husayn are the leaders of the youth in Paradise."

"Hasan and Husayn are both Imams whether they rise up or not."

He was the most knowledgeable and the best worshipper among the people
of his time. He would pray one thousand Rak'ahs every night like his
father, and on many nights he would carry sacks of food to the needy, to
the extent that the marks of carrying heavy sacks were clearly visible
on his back after his death. He was very kind, had a great and
forbearing personality, and was hard on those who disobeyed Allah.

When a Bedouin Arab came to Imam Husayn seeking help he recited the
following poem for the Imam:

Disappointed will not be he who makes a request from you.

For you are generous and trustworthy and your father was the killer of
the profligate and the corrupt individuals.

If it was not for the former (members) of your (family)9, we would
still have been in hell.

Then Imam Husayn alayhis-salam, while avoiding eye contact with the
man, gave him four thousand gold coins (Dinars) and apologized to the
man saying:

Take this for I apologise to you, and rest assure that you have my
sympathy For if I were in a different situation and I had more (money)
to offer you, I would have given you far more.

Through his courageous revolution, the like of which there has been
none in the world, he revived the Islamic Law and the religion of his
grandfather, and furthermore he even revived the whole world until the
Day of Judgment. He is the leader of the martyrs and the best among
people after his elder brother.

Throughout his life the Muslims used to revere and adore Imam Husayn
alayhis-salam, and used to see in him what they had seen in his
grandfather, the Messenger of Allah salla-llahu-alayhi-wa-aalih. Their
adoration for Imam Husayn was not just because he was the grandson of
the prophet salla-llahu-alayhi-wa-aalih, but also because he was the
manifestation of the teachings of Islam and the conducts of the
Messenger 9 i.e. the Prophet Muhammad, Imam Ali, Lady Fatima al-Zahra,
and Imam Hasan.

of Allah salla-llahu-alayhi-wa-aalih, no one could fail to see examples
of the highest moral qualities in his behaviour.

The holy Prophet has said in the praise of Imam Husayn alayhis-salam:

"Husayn is from me and I am from Husayn."

Chroniclers and historians have individually remarked that Imam Husayn
was the manifestation of the best examples of noble manners and
conduct,as well as his vast knowledge, which he inherited from the
Messenger of Allah salla-llahu-alayhi-wa-aalih. His actions spoke before
his words.

Imam Husayn alayhis-salam was humbly gracious and generous to the poor
and those in need. He used to support what is right and fight what was
wrong. People always noticed such attributes in his conduct and
behaviour as perseverance, forbearance, and magnanimity. He was the most
pious and God-fearing of all people of his time.

In his book Master of the People of Paradise Dr Ahmad Ashur says:

“If you browse through the pages of the Sihaah books you could not fail
to come across many tens of hadith about the merit and superiority of
Imam Husayn alayhis-salam and the love of the Messenger of Allah
salla-llahualayhi- wa-aalih for him.”

In his book al-Fusul al-Muhimmah Ibn al-Sabbagh al-Maliki, quotes Anas
ibn Malik who said, “I was with al-Husayn alayhis-salam when a servant
entered and in her hand a bouquet of basil. She saluted al-Husayn and
gave him the bouquet. Al-Husayn alayhis-salam said to her ‘You are free
for the sake of Allah.’ I said to al-Husayn ‘She gives you a bouquet of
basil and salute you and you set her free?’ He said ‘This is how Allah
has taught us! Almighty He says: “If you are saluted, salute back in a
better way or return the same salute” and the better way is to set her
free.”10 10 At the time of the prophet salla-llahu-alayhi-wa-aalih and
the Imams alayhum-as-salam slavery was common in the society. One of the
most important values in Islam is freedom and therefore it always aimed
to gradually eliminate slavery from society. Therefore Islam encouraged
people to set their slaves free, and many rewards are prescribed for
setting a slave free. The Prophet and the Imams lead the way in this
process in two ways. One was to setexamples for the Muslims by buying
salves and setting them free at the first possible opportunity. The
second policy of the Imams was to buy as many salves as they could,
educate them and then free them into society as free, well mannered, and
responsible adults.

In this way, this policy gave a good chance to a slave to attain
his/her freedom, set an example for other Muslims to practice, and give
less chance to those who wanted to see slavery ripe in society.

In his Chronicles, Ibn Asaakir reports that Imam Husayn alayhis-salam
used to receive money (Khums and Zakat) from Basra and other
destinations and he used to distribute the money between the poor and
the needy there and then. Imam Husayn alayhis-salam is best known for
his revolt against the status quo. By that time the socio-political
situation had deteriorated to an extreme and intolerable state,
fundamental measures needed to be taken.

The main aim and objectives of Imam Husayn’s revolt, which are in fact
the aim and objectives of Islam at any time and in any place, may be
summarised as follows:

• To bring about a responsible community in order to implement and
convey the message and teachings of Islam.

• To build an Islamic society which takes Islam as its sole source of
reference.

• To rescue the Islamic civilisation from deviation.

This is because the Islamic Ummah (Community) suffered from various
diseases in different domains:

• In the social domain it suffered widely from corruption, bribery,
cheating, oppression, favouritism and nepotism.

• From the law and order point of view, the criminal was not being
prosecuted, and therefore crime was ripe.

• From the ethical viewpoint, they had turned the moral values upside
down.

• From the economic viewpoint, the ruling elite and their cronies
monopolised the wealth of the nation.

For such reasons, and for the fact that the Muslims had remained
indifferent to these issues to the extent that these had become the
norm,that Imam Husayn rose against the injustice and corruption that was
being conducted in the name of Islam.

In the course of his jihad in the cause of Allah, Imam Husayn was
brutally beheaded and his body mutilated, alongside his sons, relatives,
and some seventy of his followers. Furthermore the women and children,
who were subsequently captured, including Imam Husayn’s sisters Zaynab
alayhassalam and Umm Kolthoum alayhas-salam as well as Zayn-al-Abidin
alayhis-salam, were taken as prisoners and paraded in towns and villages
as villains.

And since then the movement of Imam Husayn alayhis-salam inspired the
reform movements against despot rulers all over the world and the
Muslims continue to reap the fruit of the event of Karbala and every
year during the month of Muharram the memory of Ashura is commemorated
with vigour by hundreds of millions of Muslims all over the world.

As it was mentioned earlier, Imam Husayn alayhis-salam was the third of
twelve Imams who succeeded the holy prophet Muhammad salla-llahualayhi-
wa-aalih. On instructions from Allah Almighty, prophet Muhammad
salla-llahu-alayhi-wa-aalih announced the twelve Imams who would succeed
him in leading the Muslim Ommah (nation). Although at the time of the
prophet Muhammad, only the first three Imams were alive, however, the
prophet salla-llahu-alayhi-wa-aalih named all twelve Imams who have been
appointed as the Ma’soom Imams or leaders11. The first caliph
(successor) of the prophet Muhammad salla-llahu-alayhi-wa-aalih whom he
appointed to lead the Ommah after him was Imam Ali alayhissalam.

The prophet appointed Imam Ali alayhis-salam immediately after his last
pilgrimage, in Ghadir Khum, and instructed the Muslims to pay homage of
allegiance (Bay‘ah) to Imam Ali alayhis-salam as the Imam and the leader
of the Muslims, and commander of the faithful, Amir-ul- Mu’minin, which
they dutifully did. Given the number of people present at the time, some
reports put the figure at more than one-hundred-andtwenty- thousands12;
it took more than three days for them to pay thehomage of allegiance to
Imam Ali alayhis-salam.

The names and titles of the twelve Ma‘soom13 Imams are as follows (year
of birth given in brackets):

13 Ma‘soom (plural, Ma‘soomeen) is an individual who has attained a
state of perfection and self-discipline such that they are in total
harmony with the will of Allah, and as such they are, for example, able
to refrain from the slightest error or overlook the smallest matter. In
Islam the Ma‘soom individuals are fourteen; they are Rasulollah, his
daughter Fatima al-Zahra’, and the twelve Imams alayhum-as-salam. The 14
Ma‘soomeen are also referred to as the

by tyranny andinjustice. Imam Mahdi was born in 255 Hijra, 868 CE, and
he went into occultation when his father, Imam Hasan al-Askari was
killed by the Abbasid ruler in 260 Hijra, 873 CE.

Allah only wishes to remove all abomination from you, and thoroughly
purify you, O Ahl-ul-Bayt (Members of the House). [33: 33].
