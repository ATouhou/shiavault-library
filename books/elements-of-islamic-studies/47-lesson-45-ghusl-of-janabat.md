Lesson 45: Ghusl of Janabat
===========================

1. When is it required?
-----------------------

There are two things which cause "*janabat*" and it is *wajib* to do
*ghusl* of *janabat* after them:-  
 (a) Discharge of semen in sleep or while awake;  
 (b) Sexual intercourse. (both parties become *junub*).

2. For which Purpose?
---------------------

*Ghusl* is *wajib* for all the things for which *wudhu* is required.
Also, it is *wajib* to validate a *sawm* (fast), as will be explained
later.

3. Things which are forbidden before performing Ghusl janabat:
--------------------------------------------------------------

The following things are *haraam* if a person has to do *GhusI janabat*:
(a) Reciting even a single  
 verse from those Surahs in which *sajdah* is *wajib*; Touching the
writing of the Qurâ€™an or the names of Allah, the Prophets, or the Imams
(in any script}: (c) Entering any mosque. (If necessary, he/she may pass
through the mosque without stopping for a single second). But so far as
the Mosque of the Prophet, at Medina and Masjid al-Haram, at Mecca, are
concerned, even passing through them is not allowed. (d) Putting
anything into a mosque even from outside; and entering into a mosque to
take out anything.  
 Note 1. The shrines of Imams are like the mosques in every detail.

4. Things which are makruh in the janabat :
-------------------------------------------

For a person who has to do *ghusl janabat*, it is *makruh* to (1) read
Quran more than seven ayats. (This applies to the Surahs in which no
*sajdah* is *wajib*); (2) touch the Quran (not the writing, which will
be *haram*); (3) take a Quran or carry it from one place to other, even
without touching it.
