Weaning the Child
=================

The baby should ideally be on the mothers milk for a period of two
years. Every child has a right to be on breast-feeding for two years,
which Allah has granted to it. Allah says in the Quran:

Mothers should feed their milk to the children for two years. 2:233

If the mother has to wean the child earlier than two years, she is
permitted to do it but not earlier than twenty-one months of feeding.

Imam Sadiq says:

The period of the mother feeding the child should be a minimum of twenty
one months. If someone feeds the child for a lesser period, it will be
causing a hardship to the child.**[1]**

In the two years of feeding by the mother, the child slowly gets used to
consuming other types of food. In this period the mother can taper down
the breast-feeding and substitute it with other nutritive foods. After
the period of breast-feeding is over the child is weaned.. Now it will
get ready to have other type of nutrition. Careful and informed mothers
know the type of foods on which their children can be fed. These foods
have to suit the nature

of the child and should have good nutritive value.

Weaning the child from the breast is however not an easy task. For some
days it will cry and crave for the breast-feeding. At this juncture the
mother has to exercise a lot of patience and tact. The mothers sometimes
try to apply some bitter material on their nipples or color the breasts
black that the child develops an aversion for feeding on it. But care
has to be taken not to scare the child. The child should not get a fear
complex during weaning that it can have wrong effect on its health and
psychology.
