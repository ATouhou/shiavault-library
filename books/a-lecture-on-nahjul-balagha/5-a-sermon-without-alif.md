=====================

*A sermon by the Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib (ع)
that does not contain any Arabic letter Alif.*

في أحد الأيام دار بين العرب و المسلمين نقاش كبير، فقيل ليس من حرف
المعجم حرف أكثر دورانا في الكلام من "الأليف"، فأيد ذلك جميع الجالسين
... تبع ذلك أن نهض نبراس اللغة الأنيق و بحرها العميق و فيلسوفها الدقيق
الامام علي بن أبي طالب (عليه السلام) و خطب خطبة طويلة تشتمل على الثناء
على الله تعالى و الصلاة و السلام على نبيه محمد بن عبد الله بن عبد
المطلب (صلى الله عليه و على آله و سلم) و هي خالية من بدايتها الى
نهايتها من ذكر حرف "الأليف" (الممدودة) و هي كما يلي:-

One day, a heated discussion went on among the Arabs and Muslims during
which it was said that there is no alphabet that recurs in speech more
often than the "Alif" ("A"). All attendants agreed. It was then that the
magnificent lantern of language, its deep ocean and precise philosopher,
namely Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib (ع), stood up and delivered a lengthy
sermon which included praise of Allah Almighty, prayers and salutations
unto His Prophet, Muhammed Ibn Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Muttalib (peace and
blessings of Allah be with him and his progeny). The statements of the
entire sermon, from beginning to end, did not contain a single word
having the "Alif" (*Mamdooda*, elongated alpha) the humble translation
(by Yasin T. al-Jibouri) of it is as follows:

<blockquote dir="rtl">

حمدت من عظمت منته، و سبغت نعمته، و سبقت غضبه رحمته، و تمت كلمته، و
نفذت مشيته، و بلغت حجته (قضيته)، و عدلت قضيته. حمدته حمد مقر بربوبيته،
متخضع لعبوديته، متنصل من خطيئته، معترف بتوحيده، مستعيذ من وعيده، مؤمل
من ربه رحمة (مغفرة) تنجيه، يوم يشغل كل عن فصيلته و بنيه، و نستعينه و
نسترشده و نستهديه، و نؤمن به و نتوكل عليه. و شهدت له تشهد عبد مخلص
موقن، و فردته تفريد مؤمن متق و وحدته توحيد عبد مذعن، ليس له شريك في
ملكه و لم يكن له ولي في صنعه؛ جل عن مشير و وزير، و تنزه عن مثل وعون و
معين و نظير، علم فستر و بطن فخبر، و نظر فجبر، و ملك فقهر؛ و عصي فغفر،
و عبد فشكر، و حكم فعدل، و تكرم و تفضل،. لن يزول و لم يزل، ليس كمثله
شيء، و هو قبل كل شيء و بعد كل شيء رب متفرد بعزته، متمكن بقوته، متقدس
بعلوه، متكبر بسموه، ليس يدركه بصر و لم يحط به نظر، قوي منيع، بصير
سميع، حليم حكيم، رؤوف رحيم، عجز عن وصفه من وصفه، و ظل نعته من نعته،
وصل به من نعمته من يعرفه، قرب فبعد، و بعد فقرب، يجيب دعوة من يدعوه، و
يرزق عبده و يحبوه، ذو لطف خفي، و بطش قوي، و رحمة موسعة، و عقوبة موجعة،
و رحمته جنة عريضة مونقة، و عقوبته جحيم موصدة موبقة (موثقة).

*I praise the One Whose boon is great, whose blessing overwhelms, whose
mercy is faster than His anger, the One whose word is perfect, whose
will is affected, whose argument (issue) is wise, whose case is just. I
praise Him like one recognizing His Godhead, submissive while adoring
Him, dissociating himself from his sin, recognizing His Unity, seeking
refuge with Him against His warning, hopeful for the mercy (forgiveness)
of his Lord that saves him [from the Fire] on a Day when everyone will
be distracted even from his offspring and tribe. We seek His help,
guidance and directions. We believe in Him and depend on Him. I have
testified to Him as a sincere and convinced servant/slave; I recognize
His Uniqueness as a pious believer, and I have recognized His Unity like
a submissive servant/slave.*

*He has no partner in His domain; He relies on none in doing whatever He
does. He is exalted above having an adviser or a vizier. He is above
using a model or an assistant or a helper or a* *peer. He knows, so He
covers; He is acquainted with the innermost, so He is most familiar
[with our intentions]. He cast a look, so He assisted; He owns
everything, so He subdues. He is disobeyed, yet He forgives; He is
adored, so He thanks. He rules, so He affects justice, and He is
generous and grants favors.*

*He shall never come to an end, and He has always been as He is; there
is nothing like Him. He, first and foremost, is a unique Lord in His
exaltation, able through His might, holy through His sublimity, proud of
His Majesty; no (mental) vision can realize Him, nor can anyone ever see
Him. He is strong, invincible, seeing, hearing, clement, wise,
affectionate and kind. One who attempts to describe Him can never do so;
one who attempts to describe His attributes can never do so [either].
His blessing reaches those who get to know Him: He is near, so He is far
[above mental or physical vision]; He is far yet He is near [closer to
us than anything else].*

*He responds to the call of those who call on Him; He sustains His
servant and surrounds him with His love; His niceties are hidden [from
our comprehension]; His power is mighty; His mercy is wide; His penalty
is painful; His mercy is a broad and a Garden of grandeur (Paradise);
His punishment is Hell filled with horrors and chains.*

كفر، رحمة لعبيده و منة لمزيده، ختم به نبوته، و قوى (وضح) به حجته، فوعظ
و نصح و بلغ و كدح، رؤوف بكل مؤمن رحيم، رضي ولي سخي زكي، عليه رحمة و
تسليم و بركة و تكريم، من رب غفور رؤوف رحيم، قريب مجيب حكيم.

*I have testified that He sent Muhammed* ***(ص**) as His servant and
messenger, prophet, chosen one, loved one, friend, a link [with the
Almighty] that grants him [Muhammed] fortune, bringing him closer to
Him, elevating him, granting him nearness and closeness [to the
Almighty]. He sent him during a good (opportune) period of time, when
there was disbelief, as mercy for His servants and a boon for more.*

*Through him He sealed His prophetic messages, strengthened (explained)
His argument. So he admonished, advised, conveyed the message and worked
hard [for people. He was, affectionate towards every believer, merciful,
easy to please, the friend of anyone who is generous and pure: mercy,
salutation, blessing and honor be with him from a forgiving,
affectionate, kind, near, responsive and wise Lord.*

*I have admonished you, O folks who are present here with me, to be
pious (as your Lord has* *admonished) towards your Lord, and I have
reminded you of the Sunna of your Prophet; so, take to awe that calms
your hearts, fear that draws your tears, piety that saves you on a Day
which will puzzle your minds and put you to the test, a day in which one
shall win if the weight of his good deeds is heavy while that of his
sins is light. Let your plea be in humility and surrender, appreciation
and submission, repentance and dissociation [from sin], regret and
return [to righteousness].*

*Let everyone of you seize the opportunity when he is healthy before the
time when he is sick, when he is young before he is aged, old and sick,
[the opportunity] of his ease before he is poor, of having free time
before he is busy, of being wealthy before being impoverished, of being
present at home before he is away traveling, of being alive before his
death. He shall grow old, become weak, aged, sick, ailing, so much so
that even his doctor is fed-up with him, even those who love him turn
away from him. His lifespan will have come to an end. His color of
complexion is changed. His mental power is decreased, so it is said that
he is ailing and his body is failing. He is having a hard time as he
finds himself suffering from the throes of death: He is attended by
those who are close and who are distant.*

*He gazes his looks, yearns as he turns his eyes, his forehead sweating,
his [physical] senses being snatched away from him [one by one]. His
sighs are now silent, his soul has departed, so he is mourned by his
wife. His grave is dug, his children are now orphans, and those who were
around him (his friends or foes) are now dispersed from around him. What
he had accumulated (legacy) has now been divided [among heirs]. Gone now
are his faculty of seeing and hearing; so he receives* Talqeen*; he is
stretched [on the ground] and directed [towards the Qibla]. He is
stripped of his clothes, bathed, in the nude, dried then directed
[towards the Qibla].*

*Something has been spread on the floor for him as his shrouds are being
prepared. His chin has been tied, his soul has already departed from his
body and he has been bidden farewell by all. He is now shrouded, his
head wrapped, so is his body, and he has been handed over [for burial].
He is carried in a wooden box (coffin); his funeral prayers have been
performed with* Takbir *but* *without prostration or the rubbing of the
forehead. He is taken away from a decorated abode [this life], from
well-built mansions and chambers topping each other, so he is now in an
enclosure of a grave which is very narrow and separated from others; it
is built with baked clay on top of each other and is sealed with a
rock.*

*Dust has been healed on him, so he now is sure about that of which he
was warned; his chest is now heavy; he is now a thing of the past. His
friends, chosen ones, companions, in-laws and close friends have all
left him behind. His company and loved ones are now changed, for he is
now nothing but the filling of a grave and the pawn of a waste: Worms
crawl all over his body, his pus drips from his nostrils on his neck and
chest. Soil crushes his flesh as his blood dries and bone decays. He
remains in his grave till the Day when he is herded with others and is
given a new life; so, he is taken out of his grave. His trumpet is
blown, he is called on to gather with others and stand trial. Graves are
scattered around, the innermost in the hearts are recorded and
calculated.*

*Every prophet, Siddiq, martyr, anyone who speaks is brought and made to
stand for the final judgment of an Able God Who is fully knowledgeable
of His servants, seeing [all what they do]. Countless exhalations engulf
him, sighs fade him (distance him), in a horrific position and an
awesome scene before a Great King,*

بعد نضجه كجلد جديد، يستغيث فتعرض عنه خزنة جهنم، و يستصرخ فيلبث حقبة
بندم، فلم يجده ندمه، و لم ينفعه حينئذ ندمه. نعوذ برب قدير من شر كل

*Who knows about everything small and big? He is reined by his sweat,
his worry crushing him, yet his tear has none to feel sorry for, his
scream (defense) is not accepted. His record of deeds is brought, his
innermost becomes visible, and every part of his body now speaks of his
wrongdoings:*

*His eyes testify about what he had seen, his hands about whom he beat,
his legs about where he had gone, his skin about what he had contacted,
his private parts about with whom he had had intercourse. He is
threatened by Munkir and Nakir; and it is unveiled for him where he is
heading; so his neck now is tied with chains and his hands are cuffed.
He is taken alone, dragged and brought to Hell as he is in a great
distress and hardship. He remains in the torment of hell given to drink
of very hot pus that grills his face and separates his skin from his
body. He is beaten by the torture angels of hell with iron clubs. His
skin returns again and again anew after having been baked. He cries for
help, yet even the angels in Hell turn away from him. He pleads for
mercy, so he stays for a while regretful, yet he finds none to care
about his regret. His regret will then be in vain.*

*We seek refuge with an Able Lord from the evil of any final end such as
this,*

و نطلب منه عفو من رضى عنه، و مغفرة من قبل منه، فهو ولي سؤلي و منجح

*and we plead for forgiveness similar to that of one with whom He is
pleased and for an overlooking similar to that of one whose good deeds
He has accepted; for He is my Master, ultimate pursuit and the one Who
grants success to what I seek. Surely one who is pushed away from the
torment of his Lord shall reside in Paradise near to Him and remain
forever in well-built mansions, having Huris with large lovely eyes and
servants. He is given to drink of fresh cool water mixed with ginger and
sealed with musk and fragrance that perpetuates happiness and provides
the sense of pleasure.*

*He drinks of wines in an orchard filled with all types of pleasures,
wine that does not cause any headache to one who drinks it, and it never
runs out; such is the ultimate end of one who fears his Lord, who is on
guard about his sin, about the insinuations of his Nafs* *(self), and
that was the penalty of one who opposes the [sinless] way [in which] he
was created, the one whose evil self-decorates for him to do what is
against his nature. Such is the final judgment and the ruling of One Who
is just: He narrated parables, admonished through texts, revealed
revelations from a Praiseworthy Wise One, revelations which He descended
with a clear (able) Holy Spirit [arch-angel Gabriel] from a Glorious
Lord unto a Prophet who is rightly guided and who guides others, one who
shows others the right way, a mercy to the believers, clearly from a
Great Lord, a master frequented by messengers (angels) who are honored
and obedient [of their Lord].*

*I have sought refuge with a Lord Who is knowing, wise, able, merciful,
from the evil of an enemy who is cursed and stoned; so, let everyone who
pleads plead, and let everyone who seeks [favors of his Lord] seek and
ask forgiveness of the Lord of lords for myself and for you all.*

> ثم قرأ بعدها قوله تعالى: {تلك الدار الآخرة نجعلها للذين لا يريدون علوا
> في الأرض ولا فسادا والعاقبة للمتقين} (القصص:83).

Having finished his miraculous sermon, the Imam (ع) recited this
following verse of the Holy Qur'an:

*"**We shall grant that (eternal) abode of the hereafter to those who
intend neither high-handedness nor mischief on earth, and such end is
(the best reward) for the righteous" (Qur'an, 28:83).***
