**Safar 3, 1330**

I Shi’a Texts Rejected as Testimonials,
---------------------------------------

1) As long as these texts are not quoted by non­Shi’as, Sunnis are not
bound to accept them as testimonials.

II Why Have Others Refrained from Quoting Them?
-----------------------------------------------

2) Had they been verified, why has nobody else quoted them?

III Asking for More Texts
-------------------------

3) Let us refer only to the hadith narrated by Sunnis in this regard,
Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*S*
