**Commentary:**

Allah's Promises Surely Befall! Woe to the Rejecters of Truth!

At the beginning of this Sura, there are five oaths in five verses
about which many comments have been made and they are:


By those (Angels) (winds) sent forth one after another,

And those who move as a hurricane;

And By those who scatter far and wide,

And those who separate (one from another) ;

And By those (the prophets) who reveal the (Divine) Reminder,

To justify or to warn;

Now, let us see what these mysterious oaths, which announce some great
events, mean. Here are three known ideas:

1. All five parts mean winds and hurricanes, which have an effective
role in nature. If so, the verses mean:

By the winds sent forth one after another,

By the violent hurricanes which move;

By those which scatter clouds and bring down, to Earth, the ively
droplets of rain through the clouds,

By those which scatter clouds after falling rain;

By the very winds which remind men of Allah,

(Some others have said that the winds are of tormenting winds. This
idea is opposite to the above, but it is also a reminder.)

2. If all the oaths are sworn to Angels, then, the verses would mean:

By the Angels sent forth (to the prophets) one after another, (or, the
Angels sent forth with some definite known plans) ,

And by those who move, as a hurricane, to carry out their mission,

By those who deliver the heavenly verses and scatter them,

And those who, by this action, separate purity from evil;

And those who give Allah's Messages and instructions to prophets,

3. The first and the second oaths are about winds and hurricanes, but
the third, the fourth and the fifth ones are about Angels and their
mission: i.e. distributing the verses, sorting out the right from the
wrongand revealing Alla's instructions to prophets for justice and
warning.

The first factor, which caused the third idea to form and separated
these verses into two groups, is the conjunction 'and' in two of the
verses, and another form of relative juncture; the Arabic letter 'ف' (F)
which occurs in the rest.

The second factor is the important sense that verse seven consists of.
All the oaths are for the subject matter of this verse, that is, the
reality of the Resurrection and the Hereafter.

We know that at the beginning of the Resurrection there will be many
great happenings that will change the world. There will be violent
storms, earthquakes, and some other shaking events on the one hand, and
on the other hand, formation of the Great Judgment, where Angels divide
the individuals' records, and separate the believers from 0unbelievers,
communicating Allah's decree to them.

If the above five verses are stated according to this idea, they are
suited to what they are sworn to, and, from this point of view, the last
idea is superior to the first two.

The last word in verse five, /zikr/; 'Reminder', means either the
knowledge bestowed upon the prophets, or the verses revealed to them.
And we know that in the verses of Qur'an the word 'Qur'an', itself,
means Reminder; as we see in Sura Al-Hijr, No. 15. verse 6, "And they
say: O thou to whom the Reminder is revealed! Thou art indeed a mad
man!".

Gabriel, who revealed the Message to the holy Prophet (p.b.u.h.) , was
only one angel, but mulqiyat 'angels' is in a plural form. Since,
according to some narrations, sometimes large groups of angels
accompanied Gabriel to bring the verses; as in Sura 'Aabas, No.80, verse
15 which denotes that verses are revealed tothe Prophet (p.b.u.h.) "by
the hands of Angels".

What are these oaths for? The next verse uncovers the secret:

"Surely that which you are promised (for) the Resurrection) will
befall."

There is no doubt that resurrection and bringing man to life again,
recompense and punishment, reckoning and retribution (judgment) are
right and proper.

This verse demands that all of Allah's promises are sure irrespective
of the promises to good-doers and evildoers in this world and in the
Hereafter.

There is nothing mentioned about the Resurrection in this verse, but in
the former verses there are some hints to Resurrection, which confirm
that it exists. For example, giving life to the dead lands by sending
down rain, which is an illustrative incident of Resurrection; revealing
Allah's instructions to the prophets; and appointing Messengers, all of
which would be meaningless without the Hereafter. Then, the promised
Resurrection is bound to come.

Similar to that is Sura Zariyat, No 51, verse 22-23: "And in heaven is
your sustenance,..." and "Then, by the Lord of heaven and earth, this is
the very Truth..."

The oath to the Lord rabb the Owner, the Cherisher' denotes that our
sustenance is seriously true, and it is the Lord's Wisdom which demands
that sustenance be provided to the creatures.

Through the following three verses, the signs of that Day are pointed
out: "Then when the stars are extinguished;"

And when the sky is cleft asunder;"

"And when the mountains are carried away;"

The word /tamasat/ is derived from /tams/ which means 'to efface' or
'to obliterate (to destroy all trace of) ', may refer to the extinction
of the stars or their dissolution, but the first rendition is more
fitting. A similar meaning is found in Sura Takwir, No. 81, verse 2:
"And when the stars darken;".

The word /nasafat/ is derived from /nasf/ which originally means 'to
winnow as chaff the act of winnowing', but here, it means: 'to reduce
the mountains to powder and scatter them abroad'.

In general, from many verses of the Holy Qur'an it is understood that,
at last, this physical world will end with some series of extremely
horrible events, and its regularity will be terribly destroyed. Then the
spiritual world will be substituted by a new order.

The events are so horrible and amazing that no single word or
expression can describe them. Are the mountains which are reduced to
powder and scattered abroad, and like events, describable?

Some commentators have said that, in comparison with these events, the
greatest earthquakes Man has ever seen are like tiny firecrackers, which
little boys explode for fun, and liken these horrifying events with the
greatest atomic bombs.

At any rate, these meanings, in the Holy Qur'an, indicate the great
difference between the physical world and the spiritual world

Then, in the following verse, one of the occurrences at the gathering
place, on the Day of Judgment, is defined:

"And when the prophets are called unto their time appointed (for
witness) ".

The theme of this verse and that of Sura A'raf, No.7, verse 6 are
similar: "Then shall We question those to whom Our Message was sent and
those by whom We sent it."

And then it adds: "For what Day is this (portent) deferred?"

For the Day of Sorting out (right from wrong) .

This question, and its answer, shows the greatness of that Day, and
what a clear and meaningful answer this is!: For the Day of Sorting out.
It is the Day of sorting out right from wrong, believers from
unbelievers, good-doers from evildoers, and the Day of Judgment for
all.

And then: What do you know about the Day of Sorting out?

What are we looking for when the Prophet (p.b.u.h.) , having such
extensive and broad knowledge and keen insight; by which he was able to
discover the secrets of that mysterious world, could not deeply
appreciate all the dimensions of that Day?

As it was repeatedly mentioned before, it is impossible for us,
prisoners in this world of a cage, to understand all the great secrets
of the Hereafter; we may only see its silhouette, but we believe in
it.

Then, the warning: Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth.

The term /wayl/ 'woe' is interpreted as 'punishment with destruction,
any punishment, or, a site in Hell full of torment'. This word is
usually said to anyone or anything for whom or that which falls into
misfortune and on whom one does not wish Allah mercy to descend and,
here, it is used for the painful fate of the rejecters on that Day.

'The rejecters of Truth' are those who do not believe in the Hereafter.
And we know that those who reject the Day of Judgment and the Day of
Reckoning easily commit any sin or corruption. But a firm belief in the
reality of that Day demands virtue and responsibility in human beings.

**Contents of the Oaths:**

In the above verses, it swears to the winds and hurricanes. This is
because they have an important structural role in nature: they move the
clouds and take them over dead lands, pouring down rain, and then
scattering them.

Winds scatter seeds far and wide, here and there, and produce forests.
They fertilize many of the plants and flowers. They change the weather,
hot and cold, or moderate it. They clear the air of epidemics: they take
the fresh air from green fields and bring it into cities to substitute
its polluted one. They cause the seas to undulate and oxygenate the
water, which is essential to the developing processes of living
creatures in the seas. Surely, winds and breezes are beneficial to man
in the world.

Some other verses of the above group swear to angels by which Allah's
Messages and revelations, that cherish virtue and humanity, were
gradually conveyed to the prophets' hearts like the winds that come
gently as harbingers with blessings of rain and fertility. Winds are in
the physical world while angels are in the spiritual world. Then Allah's
oaths are to both the physical cherishers and the spiritual ones.

It is interesting to note that all the oaths are for the belief that
His promise of mercy and justice in the Hereafter, 'the Day of Sorting
out', is indeed true.
