فَلَمَّا دَخَلُوْا عَلَيْہِ قَالُوْا يٰٓاَيُّہَا الْعَزِيْزُ مَسَّـنَا
وَاَہْلَنَا الضُّرُّ وَجِئْنَا بِبِضَاعَۃٍ مُّزْجٰىۃٍ فَاَوْفِ لَنَا
الْكَيْلَ وَتَصَدَّقْ عَلَيْنَا۰ۭ اِنَّ اللہَ يَجْزِي

***…Then, when they entered into his presence, they said, “O Aziz!
Distress has befallen our family, and us, and we have brought [just] a
meager sum. Yet grant us the full measure, and be charitable to us!
Indeed Allah rewards the charitable.”***[^1]

I dedicate this research to my beloved Imam Mahdi, the awaited savior of
the mankind (may Allah hasten his return); to my father, Riazath Husain
Arastu; my mother, Tahera Begum Arastu; my brother, Shoukath Husain
Arastu, my mother-in-law, Rabab Sultana Razavi, and my father-in-law,
Akbar Patel.

I also pay special thanks to the personality of Lady Fatima Ma’suma of
Qum (The granddaughter of Imam al-Sadiq [as]), for providing me with the
opportunity to study in her city and granting me the blessings of her
proximity, through which I was able to complete this book.

[^1]: Surah Yusuf (12), Ayah 88
