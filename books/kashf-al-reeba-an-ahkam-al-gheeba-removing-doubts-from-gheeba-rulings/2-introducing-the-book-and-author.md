***In the Name of All훮h, the most Gracious, the most Merciful***

Praise be to All훮h Who purified the tongues of His friends from vain
talk, backbiting and slandering, purifying their souls from low manners
and contemptible habits. Praised be His Chosen Prophet, too, who was
sent with the easy-to-practice Shar카\`a and the straight path, and
praised be his purified Progeny who follow his path and are fully
knowledgeable of his Sunnah and who are protected from low conduct and
known for their virtues.

I have seen most folks of this age described as having knowledge and
virtues and to whom justice is attributed, and they are nominated for
being the masters safeguarding the performance of the prayers, regular
in their fast, their acts of adoration being abundant and are steadfast
in seeking nearness to All훮h. They avoid a host of prohibitive sins such
as adultery, wine drinking and such clearly ugly deeds. Yet the folks of
this age, despite all of this, are spending a great deal of their time
having fun in their gatherings and dialogues, feeding our souls with
charges leveled against the honor of their believing brethren and Muslim
peers without regarding doing so as a sin, nor are they cautious lest
the Great One of the heavens should overtake them on its account.
