Chapter 5: Ornamentation and Playing
====================================

5.1: Ornamenting Children
-------------------------

**373.** *al-Kafi,* narrating from Abu Sabah who said: “I asked Imam
al-Sadiq (a.s.) about ornamenting children with gold and he (a.s.) said:
“‘Ali ibn al-Husayn [al-Sajjad] (a.s.) would put gold and silver
ornaments [jewellery] on his children and women.”[^1]

**374.** *al-Kafi,* narrating from Husayn ibn Khalid who said: “When I
asked Abu al-Hasan al-Ridha (a.s.) about when to congratulate for a
child’s birth, he said: ‘When Hasan ibn ‘Ali (a.s.) was born Gabriel
descended on the seventh day to congratulate the Prophet (s.a.w.) and
ordered him to choose a name and nickname for him, shave his head,
sacrifice an offering and make a hole on his ear. The same thing
happened when Husayn (a.s.) was born, where on the seventh day Gabriel
came to the Prophet (s.a.w.) and ordered him to do the same things.” He
then said: “They had two ringlets on the left ear. The hole in the right
ear was on the earlobe and the hole on the left ear was on the upper
part. The right ear had an earring (*qurt*) and the left ear had an ear
ornament (*shanf*).”[^2]

5.2: Praising the Playfulness of Children
-----------------------------------------

**375. The Prophet (s.a.w.) said:** “The child’s playfulness in his
childhood causes his intellect to strengthen in his adult age.”[^3]

**376.** *al-Kafi*, narrating from Salih ibn ‘Aqabah who said: “I heard
the ‘Righteous Servant’ [Imam al-Kazim] (a.s.) say: “It is a recommended
practice for a child to play in his childhood so that he becomes patient
in his adult age.” Then he said: “It is not right to do otherwise.”

It also narrated that the most intelligent of children are those who
hate schooling the most.[^4]

5.3: Allowing a Child to Play
-----------------------------

**377. Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.) said:** “Leave the child alone to play for
seven years, then he is to be disciplined for seven years, and then keep
him close to you for seven years. If he became prosperous then that is
good, but if not, he is among those in whom there is no good.”[^5]

**378. Imam al-Sajjad (a.s.) said:** “The Prophet (s.a.w.) said to the
two [Hasan and Husayn] (a.s.): “Stand up and wrestle each other.”

They stood up to wrestle when Fatimah (a.s.) who had gone out for some
needs had come back home and heard the Prophet (s.a.w.) saying: “Again,
O Hasan! Take Husayn firmly and knock him down!”

So she said to her father: “O father, what a wonder! Do you encourage
one against the other? Do you encourage the elder against the younger?”

Then he (s.a.w.) said to her: “O daughter! Are you not happy that I say:
“O Hasan! Take Husayn firmly and knock him down,” while my beloved
Gabriel is saying: “O Husayn! Take Hasan firmly and knock him down?”[^6]

**379.** *al-Mu’jam al-Kabir,* narrating from Abu Ayub al-Ansari who
said: “I went to the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) while Hasan and Husayn
were sitting in front of him on his lap playing, so I said: “O Messenger
of Allah! Do you love them?”

He said: “How can I not love them and they are my two basils that I
scent in this world.”[^7]

**380.** *al-Mu’jam al-Kabir*, narrating from Abu Sa’id who said: “The
Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) was praying when Husayn (a.s.) came in and
took hold of the Prophet’s neck. Then he (s.a.w.) stood up and held
Husayn’s hand and kept on holding it until he went to bow.”[^8]

**381.** *Sharh al-Akhbar,* narrating from Ja’far ibn Farwi who
narrates: “The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) was sitting down with his
companions when Hasan and Husayn (a.s.) came to him. They were young and
they were leaping on him, so at times he would bring his head down for
them and at other times he would pick them up and kiss them. A man who
was in his gathering was looking at him with astonishment to what he was
doing. He said: “O Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.), I don’t think I have
ever kissed my child.” The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) got angry so much
that the colour of his skin changed and he said to the man: “If Allah
has extracted mercy from your heart, then what can I do to you? He who
does not have mercy on our little ones and honours our elders is not
considered among us.”[^9]

**382.** *Sunan al-Nisai*, narrating from ‘Abdullah ibn Shaddad, from
his father who said: “In one of the evening and night prayers the
Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) came to us while he was carrying either
Hasan or Husayn. The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) came forward and put
him on the ground. Then he performed his *takbir* and started his
prayer. During his prayer he prostrated for a long time. My father said:
“I raised my head and I saw a child on the back of the Messenger of
Allah while he was prostrated, then I returned back to my prostration.
When the Messenger of Allah finished the prayer, the people said: “O
Messenger of Allah! You had a long prostration in the middle of your
prayers in a way that we thought something might have happened or
something was being revealed unto you.”

He said: “It was neither, but my son mounted on my shoulder and I did
not like to dismount him hastily until he finished what he was
doing.”[^10]

**383.** *al-Manaqib,* narrating from Ibn Shahr Ashub from Layth ibn
Sa’d who said: “The Prophet (s.a.w.) was praying one day with a group of
people when Husayn who was a young boy was beside him. Whenever the
Prophet (s.a.w.) fell in prostration, Husayn (a.s.) would come and mount
on his shoulder and then shake his feet saying: “Hie! Hie!”

When the Prophet of Allah (s.a.w.) wanted to raise his head, he would
take him and put him beside him, and as soon as he prostrated again,
Husayn would return on his back and say: “Hie! Hie!” He did not cease
doing it until the Prophet (s.a.w.) finished his prayers.

It was at this time that a Jew said: “O Muhammad! You treat the children
a way that we do not.”

The Prophet (s.a.w.) said: “Indeed if you believed in Allah and His
Messenger, you would certainly be kind to the children.”

The Jew said: “I therefore believe in Allah and His Messenger.” He
became a Muslim when he saw the generosity of someone who was of very
high ranking importance.”[^11]

**384.** *al-Mustadrak ‘ala al-Sahihain*, narrating from Ya’la al-‘Àmiri
who said: “He [Yahya] went out with the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) to a
feast they were invited to. The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) was walking
in front of the group and Husayn was playing with some boys. When the
Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) wanted to take him, the child [Husayn] would
run around here and there, so the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) made him
laugh until he took him.

He (s.a.w.) put one of his hands under his neck and the other hand under
his chin, and then kissed him on his mouth.

He (s.a.w.) then said: “Husayn is from me and I am from Husayn. Allah
loves he who loves Husayn. Husayn is an offspring (*sibt*) among the
offsprings (asbat of the prophets).”[^12] [^13]

**385.** *al-Manaqib*, by Ibn Shahr Ashub narrates from ‘Abdullah ibn
Shaybah, from his father who said: “The Prophet (s.a.w.) was called to
prayer while Hasan was clinging onto him, so the Prophet (s.a.w.) put
him down in front of him and prayed. When prostrating he prolonged the
prostration. From among people, I raised my head and I saw Hasan (a.s.)
on the shoulder of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.). When he concluded
his prayers, people told him: “O Messenger of Allah! You performed a
prostration in your prayer that you do not usually perform, like as if a
revelation was descending unto you.”

He (s.a.w.) said: “There was no revelation, but my son was on my
shoulder, and I did not want to hasten until he himself would come
down.”

And in the narration by ‘Abdullah ibn Shaddad it is said that the
Prophet (s.a.w.) said: “My son mounted on my shoulder, and I did not
like to put him down hastily until he finished what he was doing.”[^14]

5.4: Acting in a Childish Manner for Children And Playing with Them
-------------------------------------------------------------------

**386. The Prophet (s.a.w.) said:** “He who has a child must treat him
in a childish manner.”[^15]

**387. Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:** “He who has a child he must act as a
child [with him].”[^16]

**388.** *Kanz al-Ummal*, narrating from ÞAnas, who said: “The Messenger
of Allah was playing with Zainab bint Um Salamah [his step-daughter] and
he repeatedly said: “O little Zainab! O little Zainab.”[^17]

**389.** *Sunan ibn Majah*, narrating from Sa’id ibn Abu Rashid who
said: “Ya’la ibn Marrah narrated to them that they went out with the
Prophet (s.a.w.) to a feast they were invited to. On their way, they saw
Husayn (a.s.) playing in the alley.

The Prophet (s.a.w.) went ahead of the group and stretched out his
hands, but the boy [Husayn] (a.s.) started running around, so the
Prophet (s.a.w.) made him laugh until he took him.

He (s.a.w.) put one of his hands under his chin and the other hand on
the back of his head, and then kissed him.

He (s.a.w.) then said: “Husayn is from me and I am from Husayn. Allah
loves he who loves Husayn. Husayn is an offspring (*sibt*) of the
offsprings (*asbat* of the prophets).”[^18]

**390.** *Sahih ibn Habban,* narrating from Abu Hurayrah who said: “The
Prophet (s.a.w.) would stick out his tongue for Husayn who when seeing
the reddish tip of the tongue he would laugh. Then ‘Uyayna ibn Badr
asked him: “What do I see and why does he do this for him? I have a son
whose beard has grown out, but I have never kissed him.”

The Prophet (s.a.w.) said: “He who does not show mercy will not be shown
mercy.”[^19]

**391.** *al-Manaqib*, narrating from Ibn Shahr Ashub who narrated from
Ibn Mahad from his father who said: “The Prophet (s.a.w.) once knelt
down for Hasan and Husayn and let them mount and set their hands and
legs opposite each other[^20] and he would say: “Your camel is a good
camel.”[^21]

**392.** *Fada’il al-Sahabah*, narrating from Abu Hurayrah who said: “I
saw the Prophet (s.a.w.) holding the hands of Husayn ibn ‘Ali and was
putting his feet on his own feet and saying: “Come up, O small eyed!
Come up, O small eyed!”[^22]

**393.** *Kifayah al-Athar*, narrating from Abu Hurayrah who said: “I
along with Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, Fadl ibn ‘Abbas, Zaid ibn Harithah and
‘Abdullah ibn Mas’ud were with the Prophet (s.a.w.) when Husayn ibn ‘Ali
(a.s.) entered and the Prophet (s.a.w.) took him and kissed him, and
then said: “O little. O little! Come up, O small eyed!” He (s.a.w.) then
put his mouth on Husayn’s mouth and said: “O Allah! I love him. So love
him and love those who love him.”[^23]

first: they cry a lot; second: they play with soil; third: they hate
without malice; fourth: they do not store anything for the next day;
fifth: they build something and then they ruin it.”[^25]

The Function of Playing in the Growth of a Child
------------------------------------------------

Playing is the most serious subject in the life of a child. The term
‘playing’ for adults is equal to pass-time, vanity, negligence and so
on, and they are things that only hinder advancement and progress, but
as for a child, it is the cause of his growth and development. The
child’s period of playing is not a period of the ceasing of progress,
but it is a period of flourishing of talents through playing. This is
why it has been recommended that you let your children play, and
children who are playful will be clever and patient when they become
adults.

The second tradition refers to the fundamental function playing has in
the growth and elevation of one’s personality. A child who has not
satiated his childhood in playing will show some childish behaviour when
he grows up, and having such characteristics is an abnormal conduct some
people are inflicted with in their adolescent and adult age. One of the
causes of this abnormality is a child not fulfilling his natural needs,
and this need is achieved only through acting like a child and playing.

The Importance of Playing from a Psychological Viewpoint
--------------------------------------------------------

Any healthy and useful game a child engages in has many important
benefits that can be easily seen in the psychological growth of the
child’s personality.

### 1- The Physical Importance

The playing along with activities for the growth of the child’s muscles
and giving exercises to different parts of the body is of high
importance and value. These kinds of activities can also be useful for
letting out the additional energy of the child. If the additional energy
is not used in a correct way and it is stored unsatisfied in the child’s
body, it makes him uneasy, nervous and bad tempered.

### 2- The Psychological Importance

Playing gives a child a chance to express his feelings. He can bring out
his pressed energy by means of play. A child can express his feelings
through fear, annoyance, anxiety, happiness and so on in the frame of
his desired personalities however he likes and he can also let out his
negative energy and inner hate.

### 3-The Upbringing Importance

It is by playing that the true personality of children takes it shape,
and considerable changes happen in their spirit all of which are a
passage to the higher stage of growth. Playing will provide a kind of
development for the children, and it is here that the opportunities and
facilities in upbringing are made manifest and certain.

### 4-The Social Importance

In playing a child learns how to socially communicate with others who
are outside his family unit and learns how to solve the problems and
difficulties emerging from these kind of communications, and he also
learns how to socially adapt with others.

### 5-The Educational Importance

By means of playing with different kinds of toys a child can succeed to
learn and recognize colours, shapes, sizes, materials, different kinds
of things and their importance. Playing helps a child recognize the
world in which he lives in, and also to comprehend, touch, feel, and
manage things. It also helps him to differentiate between reality and
delusion.

### 6-The Moral Importance

In the period of playing, a child learns what is good and what is bad!
The child finds out that if he desires to be counted as an acceptable
person in an activity he must be truthful, trustworthy, fair,
disciplined, truth seeking, honest, independent and so on.

A Psychological Analysis of Playing
-----------------------------------

Different theories have been given by psychologists in regards to
analysing and explaining the role of playing in children. Some of these
theories are: The theory of extra power, the theory of removing tension,
the theory of evolving renewal; and the theory of pre-exercise.

### A- The Theory of Extra Power

According to this theory, when the energy of the body increases more
than its normal level as seen in playing, their bodily organs feel extra
powerful. This theory cannot justify the motionless and hidden playing
of children that do not need any physical activity.[^26]

### B- The Theory of Removing Tension

This theory that says playing returns back the consumed power, means a
person’s body will get tired after working and doing activities, and it
needs a kind of practice by which the tension can be removed, which is
to play. Therefore, the need to play appears when the bodily power has
reached its lowest level, and not when it has extra energy. This theory
which has been offered by Schaller and Muris Lazarus does not identify
the playing that is done after the full resting of a child.

### C- The Theory of Evolving Renewal

Based on this theory that has been suggested by S. Hall, children renew
the scenes and activities of their ancestors that were produced due to
the need of their life in their plays. For example, in certain playing
fishing, boating, hunting and the like, the child repeats the outline of
the life of his ancestors who were cave dwellers.

### D- The Attitude of Pre-exercise

Basing upon this theory which was given by K. Groos, playing is
considered as a kind of preparation in a child for his future
activities. According to this view, the content of playing is formed by
activities that the child must have in the maturity period and adult
age.

Although this theory points to the function of playing in the
socializing of a child that was not mentioned in the former theories,
but it can not yet define all the childish playing, like imitating
animals.[^27]

The Age of Playing
------------------

Another issue is the age of playing. Some traditions indicate that a
child must be allowed to play until he is seven years old. Does this
mean that after this age he should not be allowed to play? In narrations
the first seven years is counted as the period of playing, and the
second seven years is the period of disciplining. Accordingly, it mostly
emphasizes that during the first seven years disciplining should not be
performed. Of course, there is no doubt that the narration indicates
that the first seven years is specifically for playing and in this age
the child must be left to play. But is playing forbidden during this
period? Or is it that playing is reproached during this time, and even
though disciplining is done but playing is allowed according to the age
and any certain conditions.

It seems that the second state is more fitting, meaning that in the
second seven years disciplining begins, but according to a child’s
conditions he can also play. Of course, this playing is not general and
without limitations (like the first seven years), and as it is in the
period of disciplining it must have some limitations. This matter can be
studied more in psychological researches.

The Parents Playing with the Child
----------------------------------

Besides giving permission to play, the parents’ themselves playing with
the child is itself another important factor. On one side, playing is an
important pillar of the child’s life, and on the other side, parents are
a part of child’s life and they have a particular position for them.
This is why it is very important for the child that his parents enter
into his world. It is here that playing with child takes its importance.
Since parents are the most important persons for the child, playing with
him causes honour for the child and elevation of his self esteem. It
produces the feeling of self-worthiness and self-motivation. It also
strengthens the relationship of the child with the parents, and it has a
fundamental function in the loyalty and sincerity of their relationship,
being one of the necessary features in the parent - child relationship.

Buying various toys which are sophisticated and expensive does not bring
about a child’s consent in his relationship with his parents. He only
wishes that his parents understand him and his world and participate in
it.

On this basis, there are two issues that can be seen in the teachings of
religion. One is the parents playing with children (which had been
abundantly seen in the conduct of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.)), and
the other is that parents should play with their children like a child.
Adults’ playing their own way is not pleasant and satisfying for the
child, but it is childish playing that satisfies the child and develops
his personality and teaches him the skills of life. This is why the
Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) played childishly with children.

The important point is that adults’ playing with children is not vain
and amusement, but it is a wise, mature, and intellectual practise and
it does not decrease their honour.
