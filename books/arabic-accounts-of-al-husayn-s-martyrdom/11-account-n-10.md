Account N. 10
=============

**al-Waqidi**

Unfortunately little or nothing survives of the monograph written by
al-Waqidi. It is claimed by both Ibn Nadim and his secretary, Ibn Sa'd,
that al-Waqidi was a Shiâ€™i[^44].

However, Shaykh al-Mufid accuses him of being a member of the
\`Uthmaniyya[^45]. What al-Mufid means by that is that al-Waqidi had
strong sympathies with the Zubayrid faction which had supported greater
authority for Medina, and seen the family of Zubayr (and in particular
his son, Ibn al-Zubayr) as the fittest people for the caliphate. If any
of his account had survived, it would have been interesting to examine
his treatment of Ibn al-Zubayr. The \`Uthmaniyya attitude to Ibn
al-Zubayr with regard to this incident is clearly established in the
work of Khalifa b. Khayyat, and there is also a similar report in
al-Baladhuris Ansab al-Ashraf.
