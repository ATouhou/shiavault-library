**Duas When Entering a Graveyard**

The following Imams [A.S.] are quoted as saying the following when a
person is entering a graveyard:

Imam Amirul Momineen Ali [A.S.] said:

"Bismillaahir-rah'maanir-rah'eem. Assalaamu a'laa ahli laa ilaaha illal
laahu min ihli laa ilaaha illal laahoo yaa ahla laa ilaaha illal laahu
bihaqqi laa ilaaha illal laahu kayfa wajadtum qawla laa ilaaha illal
laahu min laa ilaaha illal laahu bihaqqi laa ilaaha illal laahu ighfir
liman qaala laa ilaaha illal laahu wah'shurna fee zum-rati man qaala laa
ilaaha illal laahu Muh'ammadun Rasoolil laahi a'liyyun waliyyullaah."

(In the name of Allah, the Beneficient, the Merciful. Salutations be to
the people of "Laa ilaaha illallahu" from the people of "Laa ilaaha
illallahu", by the right of "Laa ilaaha illallahu" how did you find
saying "Laa ilaaha illallahu" from "Laa ilaaha illallahu" by the right
of "Laa ilaaha illallahu" grant pardon to whoever said "Laa ilaaha
illallahu" and raise us up among the party of those who said there is no
god except Allah, Muhammad is His Messenger, Ali is the friend of
Allah.) [Sayyid, Hadi Husayn (1988), pg. 170.]

Imam Hussain [A.S.] said:

"Allaahumma rabba haad'ihil arwaahil faaniyati walajsaadil baaliyati
wali'z'aamin nakhirtil latee kharajat minaddunyaa bika moo-minatan
adkhil a'layhinna rawh'an minka wa salaaman, minnee."

(O Allah, the Lord of these souls which are dead; and the bodies that
have decayed and the bones that have been worm-eaten and have gone from
this world to You as Faithfuls do admit over them happiness, from
Yourself and salutation from me.) [Sayyid, Hadi Husayn (1988), pg. 169.]
Imam Jafar as-Sadiq [A.S.] said:

"Assalaamu a'laa ahilidayari minal moo-mineena walmuslimeena antum
lanaafarat'un wa nah'nu inshaa-al laahu bikum laah'iqoon" (Peace be on
the inmates of the region from the faithful and believers, you are
lesson to us, and God willing we are about to join you.) [Sayyid, Hadi
Husayn (1988), pg. 170.]

**The Fear of Being Buried**

When the deceased is bought to the grave yard for burial, he / she
should not be buried straight away but should be laid down some distance
from the grave so that the deceased may get used to the new surroundings
and build up strength to face the difficulties to come.

The soul stays interested and attached to the dead body for sometime,
and is present at the washing and the burial of the body. It fears the
questioning from 'Munhar and Nakeer', the squeezing in the grave and the
chastisement in Hell among other things, which they feel unprepared to
deal with. It is important to reassure the soul and be sensitive to the
fear that it is experiencing.

Ali-ibn-al-Hussain [A.S.], the forth Imam, was once asked how he, the
son of the Messenger of Allah, began each morning, and he [A.S.]
replied: "I begin each morning while I am demanded of eight virtues:

Allah, the Exalted, demands of me the obligatory;

the Prophet [S.W.S] demands of me his tradition (Sunnah);

family demand of me food (material);

the self looks for desires;

Satan demands me (to commit) sin;

the two protective angels demand of me virtuousness;

the angel of death demands of my the spirit and;

the grave demands of me my body.

Therefore, I am, surrounded by these traits, demanded"

[Imami, Ayatullah Sayyid Kamal Faghih (1998), pg. 53]
