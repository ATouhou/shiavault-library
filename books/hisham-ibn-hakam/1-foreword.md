Foreword
========

The present book which is in the hands of our esteemed readers, is a
translation of "Hisham ibn Hakam" written by the honourable writer
Hujjatol Islam Muhammad Reza Atai, who has also written and translated
many works which have been published in the recent years.

This is a superb book to introduce the readers to the champions and the
assistants to the Imamate and the cause of Wilayah. This condensed book
should be published in English, Urdu and other languages to assist the
seekers of knowledge in their search for information regarding their
religious champions.

We believe the translation, publication and distribution of Islamic
literature to foreign countries where there is a lack of Islamic
information, will be a great service to the Islamic world.

We feel obliged to extend our thanks and gratitude to Mr. Muhammad
Hashem, a member of the translation department, and all other colleagues
who have tried their best in editing and preparing the text for
publication. We wish them success in promoting Islamic culture.
