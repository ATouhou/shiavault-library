Master of the Shrine
====================

O The Master of the holy Shrine [[1]](footnotes.htm#b001)  
 You are the Majestic and the Divine  
 O The Gem of Muhammad's Crown  
 You are the light of God in our town [[2]](footnotes.htm#b002)**  
** O The golden hands that fly  
 Above the sick and those who cry  
 O The savior of the deer **[[3]](footnotes.htm#b003)  
** People love you so sincere  
 O The shining star of the sky  
 You are always out there so high  
 O The source of light in the believer's heart  
 You are always shining out there so bright  
 O The shining face in my eye  
 I cannot stand to tell you bye  
 O The preacher of the Holy Book  
 Tell me the words and catch me on the hook  
 O The rain of peace and glory  
 Your life is filled with many a story
