Preface
=======

This short biography of Hazrat Fatima (S.A) was written essentially as a
part of a course-work for those enrolled in the correspondence with
Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania.

The major concern has been to provide brief and introductory notes on
the main aspects of the illustrious life history of our "Lady of Light,
Hazrat Fatima (S.A) for readers who have had no previous understanding
of the role of this great personality in Islamic history.

In no way therefore should this work be taken as a comprehensive and
complete study on Hazrat Fatima (S.A). As a matter of fact,
circumstances under which this work was prepared may necessitate
extensive additions and/ or deletions - in future, God willing.

In the preparation of this booklet I found the following works very
useful.
