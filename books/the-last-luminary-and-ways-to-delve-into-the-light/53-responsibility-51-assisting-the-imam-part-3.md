Responsibility 51: Assisting the Imam Part 3
============================================

Following the previous two responsibilities, another obligation upon the
believers is for them to gather together and agree to help Imam al-Zaman
(ajtf).

Indeed, there is a great spiritual effect in gathering together and
agreeing (to help the Imam), which is not present when one does this act
on his own in private.

In a verse of the Qur\`an, we read that:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 تَعَاوَنُوا عَلى الْبِرِّ وَ التَّقْوى 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Help one another towards good deeds and God consciousness.”***[^1]

This verse proves that it is obligatory to gather together and help each
other.

In a tradition from the Commander of the Faithful, ‘Ali b. Abi Talib
(as) it has been mentioned that:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ! لَوْ لَـمْ تَتَخَاذَلُوا عَنْ نَصْرِ الْحَقِّ وَ
لَمْ تَهِنُوا عَنْ تَوْهِينِ الْبَاطِلِ لَمْ يَطْمَعْ فِيكُمْ مَنْ
لَيْسَ مِثْلَكُمْ وَ لَمْ يَقْوَ مَنْ قَوِيَ عَلَيْكُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“O’people! Had you not failed to support the right and undermine the
wrong, he who is not from you would not have overcome you and he who is
now ruling over you would not have had the opportunity to do so.”[^2]

In addition, it has been stated by Imam al-Mahdi (ajtf) in one of the
letters he wrote that:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ لَوْ أَنَّ أَشْيَاعَنَا وَفَّقَهُمُ اللٌّهُ لِطَاعَتِهِ عَلـى
اجْتِمَاعٍ مِنَ الْقُلُوبِ فِي الوَفَاءِ بِالْعَهْدِ عَلَيْهِمْ لَمَا
تَأَخَّرَ عَنْهُمُ الْيُمْنُ بِلِقَائِنَا
  </p>
</blockquote>

“And if our followers, May Allah make them successful in obeying Him,
were united with their hearts in fulfilling the promise that is upon
them, there would be no delay for them from the good fortune of meeting
us.”[^3]
