(a). 'If you come across a hadith related from us then compare it with
the book of Allah. Whatever is in agreement with the book of Allah then
take it and whatever contradicts the book of Allah then reject it or
refer it to us.' 40

(b). 'If you come across two hadiths related from us then compare them
with the book of Allah, what is in concord then take it and what is in
disagreement then reject it.' 41

(c). 'Whatever comes to you related from us then compare it with the
book of Allah, whatever is in concord with it then accept it and what
contradicts it then reject it.' 42

Furthermore, there are numerous Qur'anic verses and traditions which
point out that the Qur'an was sent down upon the Messenger of Allah (S)
in two ways: once it was sent down in its entirety upon the heart of the
Messenger of Allah as in the Qur'anic verse: {Verily we sent down
revelation on the night of Qadr.}43, and once more in instalments over
the space of twenty-three years according to the appropriate occasions
and issues. The Prophet's heart contained the Qur'an, which was revealed
to him firstly in its entirety, then he collated and structured the
Qur'an that was revealed to him secondly bit by bit according to the
structure of the first revelation of the Qur'an. This is the very same
Qur'an as that which exists with us today.

This and other evidence shows that the Qur'an we have today is the
Qur'an that was gathered and collated at the command of Allah and His
Messenger (S) during his lifetime without the addition or

subtraction of a single letter, or any change or substitution. For
Allah has said: {Falsehood does not approach it (the Qur'an) from before
it or from behind.}44, and:

**The Integrity of the Qur'an**

In our book 'The Ways to the Messages',46 we mentioned that the Qur'an,
as we can show from evidences and from common sense, has not been
subject to any additions or subtractions or any changes or alterations
from the way in which the Messenger of Allah organised it during his
life even though chronologically some verses were revealed before
others. The Qur'an of the time of the Messenger of Allah is exactly the
same as that which we have today. The Prophet himself specified the
placing of verses and chapters in the way we see now and there are many
traditions that testify to this.

It is widely related that the Prophet (S) said: 'Whoever completes a
recitation of the Qur'an will receive such and such a reward.' 47

Had the Qur'an not been complete then this would not have been
possible. The Qur'an was also present at his time in a complete written
form in the Prophet's mosque, by the Prophet's pulpit, from which anyone
could make a copy.

Also, thousands of Muslims had memorised the entire Qur'an as the
chronicles of the time report. In this way the integrity, structure and
organisation of the Qur'an remained until this day.

**The Qur'an of 'Ali**

As for the question of the Qur'an of 'Ali which he presented and was
not allowed (by the ruler of the time), what is meant by this are the
commentaries and interpretations which he collected and which he himself
mentioned in a speech related from him. It is clear that they did not
want the commentary or interpretation because it was a special merit of
'Ali's.

Also, what is meant by the gathering of the Qur'an by 'Umar or 'Uthman,
if this was the case, is that the scattered incomplete documents of the
Qur'an written by the companions of the Prophet were brought together so
there would not be one complete Qur'an and several incomplete versions.
This is a natural thing, for example when the speeches of a lecturer are
gathered by his students, some students will be absent for reasons of
illness or travel or the like and hence not have the complete versions
of the speeches. Those who had a full attendance record however will
have the complete version.

'Umar and 'Uthman destroyed the scattered and different documents but
not the complete Qur'an from the time of the Prophet.

I myself have seen copies of the Qur'an written over one thousand years
ago in the coffer of the Shrine of Imam al-Hussein; they were absolutely
no different to the Qur'an we have today. There are also a number of
copies of the Qur'an written in the hand of the Imams in Iran and 'Iraq
and Turkey, all of which are the same as the Qur'an existent today with
no changes.

**The Different Readings**

The 'different readings' are a modern phenomenon that arose from the
opinions of a particular group. Muslims at the time of the great
reciters and after them did not pay those opinions heed and were not
concerned with them so as to change the Qur'an. For this reason, we
would consider the prayer of those who practise these 'readings' to be
invalid.

**The 'Corruption' of the Qur'an' in the Traditions**

Those traditions that attest to the corruption of the Qur'an which are
to be found in the books of the Sunnites and Shi'a alike are spurious
and groundless traditions. Upon further examination we found that 90% of
these traditions in the books of the Shi'a are related by a man called
al-Sayaari who is, by the unanimous opinion of the biographers, a liar,
forger of hadith and mislead. The rest of the traditions have either no
valid chain of narration or no proof, as any careful examiner would find
out. The Sunnite traditions also show themselves up to be false as is
clear to anyone who cares to consult the narrations in the book of
al-Bukhari and others.
