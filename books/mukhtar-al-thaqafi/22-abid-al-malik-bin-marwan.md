Abid al-Malik bin Marwan
========================

Mukhtar made peace with Abdullah bin al-Zubair to unite efforts against
the Umayyads, the enemy of Islam.

Still Abdullah bin al-Zubair was ambitious. He was afraid of Mukhtar 's
increasing power and popular base, for he could end the persons who
committed the Karbala massacre.

Yazeed bin Mu'awiyah died. His son Mu'awiyah succeeded him. Mu'awiyah
bin Yazeed bin Mu'awiyah was a believing young man. He admitted that his
father was bad. Therefore, he resigned from the Caliphate.

Marwan bin al-Hakam was ambitious. He took advantage of the situation.
So, he became the ruler. He ruled for six months. He died. Then his son
Abid al-Malik succeeded him.

Abid al-Malik bin Marwan sent a big army to occupy al-Madina
al-Munawwara. Mukhtar heard about the army. He formed an army of three
thousand fighters to save the Prophet's City.

Apparently, Bin al-Zubair sent an army of two thousand fighters to
defend Madina against Abid al-Malik's Army. Abdullah bin al-Zubair's
real aim was to attack Mukhtar 's army.

Mukhtar 's soldiers were busy fighting. Bin al-Zubair's army took
advantage of the situation. It attacked Mukhtar 's soldiers. It killed
some soldiers. The rest escaped to the desert. They died of hunger and
thirst.

Bin Zubair disliked the Alawids. He brought them together near a
mountain outside Makkah. He prevented them from leaving that place.
Besides he demolished their houses.

Mukhtar sent five thousand fighters to raise the siege. He released the
Alawids and rebuilt their houses.
