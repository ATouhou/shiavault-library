Occasion of the Revelation (verse No. 28 - 31)
==============================================

Some of the chiefs of the tribes who had always obeyed their carnal
desires, and followed their lusts, went to the prophet with pride and
vanity, and said to him:ِ

\`\`O, Mohammad! When you are so surrounded by the poor, beggars,
laymen, and labourers, and the slaves, like SALMA"N, ABUZAR, SOHAIB,
BALA"L and etc., how can we and other NOBLES, and dignitaries of
Ghoreish, come to join you and mix and mingle with these who call
themselves Muslims! If you dismiss such people from about yourself, then
the road will be paved for us to come and cooperate with you!''

When they said so the above verse (NO.28) was sent down telling the
prophet to keep patient with those who call on their Lord in the morning
and evening, seeking His presence; and to turn away from them in quest
of the splendour of the present life.


[ 638 ]
THE BAREFOOTED CLEAN HEARTS

We have already taken the lesson from the companions of the cave that,
the standard for evaluation of Man is not his rank and wealth. Among the
youths we found a minister, a layman, a shepherd, and his dog, who
worked collectively in one line for the love of God. The same object is
also followed in these verses with another point of view:

A truthful Muslim turns to God, in the morning, noon and evening or
night, by performing his regular daily prayers; and seeks God's presence
and nearness. These are very different from him whose heart has been
made negligent of God's rememberance, and who is the servant of his
carnal desires and lusts.

It was the creed of our prophet to follow the truth that he received
from our Lord. The truth is clear and evident, and if some one wants to
reject it deliberately, he must accept the terrible consequences of his
choice of falsehood, in the blazing fire of God's wrath.

The spirit of Man can be either fed up with the love of God, or with
his own carnal love, vain desires, and lusts. The soul cannot contain
and retain both of these at the same time. He who follows his carnal
desires and caprices will forget his Merciful Lord, and will never be
satisfied with what he has. He wants more and more of the adornments of
this world, until he meets his dreadful end. But the righteous believer
will be rewarded beyond his merits, and a tenfold return for every good
action of his so as to prepare him for the excellent and eternal life in
the gardens of bliss, in the Paradise.


وَاضْرِبْ لَهُمْ مَّثَلا رَّجُلَيْنِ جَعَلْنَا لاَِحَدِهِمَا
جَنَّتَيْنِ مِنْ أَعْنَاب وَحَفَفْنَاهُمَا بِنَخْل وَجَعَلْنَا
بَيْنَهُمَا زَرْعاً(( 32 ))

32- AND STRIKE FOR THEM THE PARABLE OF TWO MEN: FOR
[ 639 ]

ONE OF THEM WE MADE TWO GARDENS OF GRAPES, SURROUNDED WITH DATE-PALMS,
AND BETWEEN THEM WE MADE CORN-FIELD.

كِلْتَا الْجَنَّتَيْنِ آتَتْ أُكُلَهَا وَلَمْ تَظْلِمْ مِّنْهُ شَيْئاً
وَفَجَّرْنَا خِلاَلَهُمَا نَهَراً(( 33 ))

33- EACH OF THE TWO GARDENS PRODUCED ITS FRUIT, AND FAILED NOT THE
LEAST. AND WE MADE A STREAM TO FLOW IN THEM.

وَكَانَ لَهُ ثَمَرٌ فَقَالَ لِصَاحِبِهِ وَهُوَ يُحَاوِرُهُ أَنَا
أَكْثَرُ مِنْكَ مَالا وَأَعَزُّ نَفَراً(( 34 ))

34- AND THERE WAS A (REMARKABLE) PROFIT FOR HIM (IN THE FRUIT OF HIS
GARDEN). THEN HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND WHEN HE WAS DISPUTING WITH HIM:ِ
\`\`I AM WEALTHIER THAN YOU AND MIGHTIER IN PERSONNEL. (CHILDREN)

وَدَخَلَ جَنَّتَهُ وَهُوَ ظَالِمٌ لِنَفْسِهِ قَالَ مَا أَظُنُّ أَنْ
تَبِيدَ هَذِهِ أَبَداً(( 35 ))

35- AND HE ENTERED HIS GARDEN, BEING OPPRESSOR TO HIMSELF, HE SAID:ِ
\`\`I DON'T THINK THIS (GARDEN OF MINE) WILL EVER PERISH.''

وَمَا أَظُنُّ السَّاعَةَ قَائِمَةً وَلَئِنْ رُّدِدْتُّ إِلَى رَبِّي
لاََجِدَنَّ خَيْراً مِّنْهَا مُنقَلَباً(( 36 ))

36- AND I DON'T THINK THE HOUR WILL COME ON. AND EVEN IF I RETURNED TO
MY LORD I WILL FIND BETTER THAN IT IN EXCHANGE.


[ 640 ]

THE COMMENTARY


THE ILLUSTRATION OF A MATERIALIST WITH PRIDE,

AGAINST A HUMBLE BELIEVER.

VERSE NO. 32 - 36

Here is a simple similitude, to illustrate the contrast between two
companions, one of whom is a sincere believer and the other one, a
wealthy Materialist; who is a purse-proud, that his material properties
like garden, farmland, and excellent house, and furniture, has puffed
him up with vanity and pride. He takes his companion with him to his
fruitful garden to show him his importance, but his friend looks at them
with indifference, and neutral disposition! On contrary to his
companion, the believer had all his trust in God.

There in the garden they fell into a dispute about faith, and the life
in Hereafter. The wealthy, seeing his fruitful garden; in his vanity and
pride said to his companion:ِ

\`\`I am wealthier than you, and mightier in man power; and I don't
think this garden of mine will ever perish, and I don't think that the
hour of Resurrection will come on; and even if I return to my Lord I
will find better than these, in exchange!''

The Materialist who was puffed up with vanity and pride, thought that
his power would never diminish, and looked at his friend with a
contemptible eye and scornful gaze! But he was more unjust to himself
than his friend, and knew not that his vanity and pride was ruining him
and all that he had.


قَالَ لَهُ صَاحِبُهُ وَهُوَ يُحَاوِرُهُ أَكَفَرْتَ بِالَّذِي خَلَقَكَ
مِنْ تُرَاب ثُمَّ مِنْ نُّطْفَة ثُمَّ سَوَّاكَ رَجُلا(( 37 ))

37- HIS COMPANION SAID TO HIM, WHILE HE WAS ARGUING
[ 641 ]

WITH HIM:ِ \`\`HAVE YOU LOST FAITH IN HIM WHO CREATED YOU FROM SOIL,
THEN FROM A SPERM-DROP; AND AFTER THAT FASHIONED YOU INTO A MAN!?

لَّكِنَّا هُوَ اللهُ رَبِّي وَلاَ أُشْرِكُ بِرَبِّي أَحَداً(( 38 ))

38- BUT AS FOR ME; ALLAH IS MY LORD, AND I WILL NOT ASSOCIATE WITH MY
LORD ANY ONE.

وَلَوْلاَ إِذْ دَخَلْتَ جَنَّتَكَ قُلْتَ مَا شَاءَ اللهُ لاَ قُوَّةَ
إِلاَّ بِاللهِ إِنْ تَرَنِ أَنَا أَقَلَّ مِنْكَ مَالا وَوَلَداً(( 39
))

39- WHY THEN WHEN YOU ENTERED YOUR GARDEN, DID NOT SAY:ِ \`\`ALLAH'S
WILL BE DONE, THERE IS NO POWER EXCEPT IN ALLAH,'' WHEN YOU SAW ME TO
HAVE LESS WEALTH AND CHILDREN THAN YOU?

فَعَسَى رَبِّي أَنْ يُؤْتِيَنِي خَيْراً مِّنْ جَنَّتِكَ وَيُرْسِلَ
عَلَيْهَا حُسْبَاناً مِنْ السَّمَاءِ فَتُصْبِحَ صَعِيداً زَلَقاً(( 40
))

40- THEN IT MAY BE THAT MY LORD WILL GIVE ME BETTER THAN YOUR GARDEN;
AND SEND AGAINST IT, (i.e. YOUR GARDEN) HAIL-STONE FROM THE SKY (FALLING
IN SHOWER) THEN IN THE MORNING YOU FIND IT A SLIPPERY BARREN WASTE.

أَوْ يُصْبِحَ مَاؤُهَا غَوْراً فَلَنْ تَسْتَطِيعَ لَهُ طَلَباً(( 41
))

41- OR IT BEGIN THE DAY WITH ITS WATER HAVING SUNK DOWN, SO THAT YOU
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FIND IT AGAIN.


[ 642 ]

THE COMMENTARY


THE ANSWER OF THE HUMBLE BELIEVER (VERSE NO. 37 - 41)

Here the believer companion rejects all the baseless and literary
compositions of his friend, about his false and deceiving motives.

First of all he objects against his proud companion for denying God!
Although the above verses do not imply that the Materialist denied God,
but his denying the Resurrection and raise of the dead consists of
denying God's power of creation; and this is why the believer reasons by
the three stages of Man's creation. Originated in clay, turned into
sperm-drop, and fashioned into Man. These are all the wonderful signs of
God's Creating Power; which may prove that raising up the dead is far
easier for Him than we may think of it. The believer in the second part
of his argument says to his companion:ِ \`\`If you feel proud of having
farmland watered by perpetual stream, and fruitful garden with many
children, I am proud to have a Lord, Merciful and Compassionate, Who is
the only one true reality; and I worship no one other than him, and
associate no partners with Him.''

He then admonished his friend that he could have a better way of
enjoying God's Gifts with thankfulness:ِ

\`\`Why then, when you entered your garden did not say:ِ \`\`Allah's
will be done! There is no power except in Allah.'' If you have ploughed
the earth, sowed the seeds, and irrigated the land, you have done it by
the power and provisions of God. You must not ignore the fleeting nature
of the goods of the present life; and also God's punishment which is
always preceded by His Mercy and Grace.''

In general sense of meaning the Arabic HOSBA"N is any kind of
punishment by way of reckoning. But it also implies a punishment by
hail-stone and thunderbolt.


[ 643 ]

وَأُحِيطَ بِثَمَرِهِ فَأَصْبَحَ يُقَلِّبُ كَفَّيْهِ عَلَى مَا أَنفَقَ
فِيهَا وَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا وَيَقُولُ يَا لَيْتَنِي لَمْ
أُشْرِكْ بِرَبِّي أَحَداً(( 42 ))

42- AND, (IT SO HAPPENED THAT) ALL ITS FRUITS WERE DESTROYED! THEN HE
BEGAN THE DAY WITH WRINGING HIS HANDS (WITH THE GRIEF) FOR WHAT HE HAD
SPENT ON IT, WHILE IT WAS FALLEN DOWN UPON ITS FOUNDATIONS; AND HE WAS
SAYING:ِ \`\`WOULD THAT I HAD NOT ASSOCIATED WITH MY LORD ANY ONE.''

وَلَمْ تَكُنْ لَّهُ فِئَةٌ يَنصُرُونَهُ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ وَمَا كَانَ
مُنتَصِراً(( 43 ))

43- AND THERE WAS NOT ANY HOST TO HELP HIM EXCEPT ALLAH, NOR WAS HE
ABLE TO HELP HIMSELF.

هُنَالِكَ الْوَلاَيَةُ للهِِ الْحَقِّ هُوَ خَيْرٌ ثَوَاباً وَخَيْرٌ
عُقْباً(( 44 ))

44- THERE THE GOVERNORSHIP (WAS PROVED TO) BELONG TO ALLAH IN TRUTH. HE
IS THE BEST TO REWARD, AND THE BEST FOR THE END. (OF THOSE WHO OBEY
GOD).


THE COMMENTARY


AND THIS IS HOW IT ENDS. (VERSE NO. 42 - 44)

The argument ceased, and the believer could not penetrate the truth in
the heart of the materialist. He returned home as proud as he had come;
not knowing that he was destined to taste his bad luck here in this
life. He fell asleep in the night, and a hail stone shower, a flash of
lightning with a crash of thunder, an earthquake, or who knows
[ 644 ]

what sort of a punishment, stroke his garden by way of reckoning; and
in the next morning he could not find anything of what he had last
night!

All had been destroyed and reduced to nothing!

What else could he do but wringing his hands with the grief and anger
for all that he had lost; and all that he had spent so far! Who could
help him then except Allah? All his income, besides all his capital on
which his hopes had been built, gone at once; and he was now as poor as
his companion or more! No one could now help him; nor even himself could
be of any help. He who was thinking too much of his children and
dependants, in being helpful in emergency cases, found them all of no
use!

One cannot expect his rescue from a drowned. The people in this world
are all more helpless than one another.

This parable illustrates the vanity of wealth which may end in
blasphemy and destruction. Men with low capacities, when become rich,
may easily lose their self-control; and make a show of their wealth and
possibilities to the others, to use it as a means of attaining
superiority. People too may gather round them as the gnats gather round
a piece of sweet, or the ants gather on the carcass of an insect, and
this gathering, the rich people who are usually void of knowledge, may
take it to be due to their personal influence and attraction.

On the other hand their love for their material properties may become
so tender, that they don't think that their superiority and position
will ever perish! Even they may think that they are loved by God, that,
He has given them so much of wealth and material goods; and if there be
a next life at all, they will have a better position and wealth, there
too:ِ

\`\`And he entered his garden, being oppressor to himself, said; I
don't think this garden of mine will ever perish, and I don't think the
hour will come on; and even if I returned to my Lord, I will find better
than it, in exchange.''

Some of the lessons that we may take from the above example, are as
follows:ِ

[ 645 ]

Aِ The goods of this material world are all fleeting by nature and may
vanish swiftly, and therefore we should not rely on them.

Bِ The friends who encircle round about us in time of fortune, are
mostly the friends of purse and position, and as soon we lose our rank
and wealth, we lose them too! We ought to know that a friend in need is
a friend indeed.

Cِ Repentance and return is useless after the punishment of God has
overtaken us. Pharaoh too, repented when he was drowned! we read in S
10:90ِ91;

\`\`And We passed the Israelites over the sea with Pharaoh and his
hosts in pursuit; until when drowning overtook him, he said:ِ

\`\`I believe that there is no God except He in whom the children of
Israel believe, and I am of those who have submitted to God.''

And God's answer to Pharaoh was:ِ

\`\`Now!? And you have rebelled before and were of the corruptors?''
And so was the case with our materialist gardener in the above parable,
that when he saw his garden and fruits all destroyed, he said:ِ (VERSE
NO.42)

\`\`Would that I had associated no one with my Lord.'' He did say so,
but it was too late!


وَاضْرِبْ لَهُمْ مَّثَلَ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا كَمَاء أَنزَلْنَاهُ مِنْ
السَّمَاءِ فَاخْتَلَطَ بِهِ نَبَاتُ الاَْرْضِ فَأَصْبَحَ هَشِيماً
تَذْرُوهُ الرِّيَاحُ وَكَانَ اللهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْء مُّقْتَدِراً(( 45
))

45- AND STRIKE FOR THEM THE SIMILITUDE OF THE PRESENT LIFE; (IT IS)
LIKE THE WATER WHICH WE SENT IT DOWN FROM THE SKY. THEN THE VEGETATION
OF THE EARTH IS MINGLED WITH IT. THEN IT BECOMES DRY STUBBLE, WHICH THE
WINDS SCATTER IT, AND ALLAH HAS ALWAYS HAD POWER OVER EVERYTHING.

[ 646 ]

الْمَالُ وَالْبَنُونَ زِينَةُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَالْبَاقِيَاتُ
الصَّالِحَاتُ خَيْرٌ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَاباً وَخَيْرٌ أَمَلا(( 46 ))

46- WEALTH AND SONS ARE ADORNMENT OF THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD, BUT THE
GOOD DEEDS THAT LAST, ARE BETTER IN THE SIGHT OF ALLAH, AS REWARDS AND
BETTER IN HOPE.


THE COMMENTARY


THE BEGINING AND END OF LIFE IN A LIVELY PICTURE (VERSE NO. 45 - 46)

The good things of this world are transient and fleeting; but we cannot
easily understand that, in our short life of 60 to 80 years. Here the
Glorious Qura"n, through an expressive parable illustrates the life on
the earth saying:ِ

\`\`Strike for them the similitude of the present life which is like
the drop of rain that We send it down from the sky.'' It serves to
fertilise and develop the seeds when it sinks down and mingles with the
soil. Then the plain of deserts and mountains becomes full of movements.
There appears everywhere, the buds, flowers, and fruits, one after
another adorning the land. It seems that everything is alive. Every bud
smiles, every bird shouts of joy, and every tree is dancing with
happiness! But very soon the Fall of Autumn appears, to turn the trees
and plants yellow, and make every green grass or leaf, as dry stubble
which can easily be scattered by the wind! Not the vegetation alone
that, everything down here is fleeting; the rank and wealth, the
strength and health, and even the man power and children, all will move
swiftly away!

Only the righteous deeds have a lasting value in the sight of God, and
may become the foundation of our hopes for God's rewards in the
Hereafter.


[ 647 ]

وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاَْرْضَ بَارِزَةً
وَحَشَرْنَاهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً(( 47 ))

47- AND (REMEMBER) THE DAY IN WHICH WE MOVE THE MOUNTAINS, AND YOU WILL
SEE THE EARTH PLAINLY, AND WE MUSTER THEM ALL, NOT LEAVING BEHIND EVEN
ONE OF THEM.

وَعُرِضُوا عَلَى رَبِّكَ صَفّاً لَقَدْ جِئْتُمُونَا كَمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ
أَوَّلَ مَرَّة بَلْ زَعَمْتُمْ أَلَّنْ نَّجْعَلَ لَكُمْ مَوْعِداً(( 48
))

48- AND THEY WILL BE PRESENTED TO YOUR LORD IN LINES; (AND WE SHALL SAY
TO THEM) VERILY YOU CAME TO US (AS NUDE AND DESTITUTE) AS WE CREATED YOU
AT FIRST, THINKING THAT WE WOULD NOT FIX AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOU. (WE
WOULD NOT SEE EACH OTHER)

وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَابُ فَتَرَى الْمُجْرِمِينَ مُشْفِقِينَ مِمَّا فِيهِ
وَيَقُولُونَ يَا وَيْلَتَنَا مَالِ هَذَا الْكِتَابِ لاَ يُغَادِرُ
صَغِيرَةً وَلاَ كَبِيرَةً إِلاَّ أَحْصَاهَا وَوَجَدُوا مَا عَمِلُوا
حَاضِراً وَلاَ يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَداً(( 49 ))

49- AND THE BOOK (WHICH IS THE RECORD OF DEEDS) WILL BE PLACED (BEFORE
THEM), THEN YOU WILL SEE THE SINNERS FEARFUL OF WHAT IS (WRITTEN) IN IT,
AND THEY SAY:ِ \`\`WOE TO US! WHAT SORT OF A BOOK IS THIS, THAT LEAVES
OUT NOTHING SMALL OR GREAT, BUT IT HAS IT NOTED DOWN!'' AND THEY FIND
ALL THAT THEY DID IT PRESENT, AND YOUR LORD WILL OPPRESS NO ONE.

[ 648 ]

THE COMMENTARY


WOE UNTO US! (VERSE NO. 47 - 49)

The immediate reference here is to three stages of the Resurrection;
the stage before it, its connection to Man, and to a part after it.

The verses imply that before Resurrection, our planet and our solar
system will all have a total destruction. The moon may stick to sun, and
both of them lose their light and luminance. The earth shakes strongly
and then flattens. The sky will rent asunder, and the stars will lose
their luster and scatter here and there in the space. The mountains will
move and become like carded wool. The oceans will burst out, and the
graves will turn upside down and the deads will raise up!

In the second stage, people who have raised up from death, will all be
present before God in different classes and various lines, all nude and
destitute. They have nothing with them of their acquired possessions,
that they had accumulated before their death, and thought that they
owned it. It will be said to them:ِ \`\`So you came to us as nude and
destitute as We created you in the first time when you thought we would
never meet each other''

Then the record of our deeds will be given in our hand to convince us
of what We have done. In our record nothing is omitted, and nothing is
entered wrongly. If there is a punishment, it has been earned by the
sinner himself, and God will oppress no one the least.


وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلاَئِكَةِ اسْجُدُوا لاَِدَمَ فَسَجَدُوا إِلاَّ
إِبْلِيسَ كَانَ مِنْ الْجِنِّ فَفَسَقَ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهِ
أَفَتَتَّخِذُونَهُ وَذُرِّيَّتَهُ أَوْلِيَاءَ مِنْ دُونِي وَهُمْ لَكُمْ
عَدُوُّ بِئْسَ لِلظَّالِمِينَ بَدَلا(( 50 ))

50- AND WHEN WE SAID TO THE ANGELS; PROSTRATE YOURSELVES BEFORE ADAM.
THEN THEY ALL PROSTRATED,
[ 649 ]

EXCEPT IBLIS, WHO WAS OF THE JINNS. SO HE DISOBEYED THE COMMAND OF HIS
LORD. DO YOU THEN TAKE HIM AND HIS OFFSPRING AS MASTERS BESIDES ME WHILE
THEY ARE YOUR ENEMY!? WHAT A BAD SUBSTITUTE ARE THEY FOR THE
OPPRESSORS.

مَّا أَشْهَدْتُّهُمْ خَلْقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالاَْرْضِ وَلاَ خَلْقَ
أَنفُسِهِمْ وَمَا كُنتُ مُتَّخِذَ الْمُضِلِّينَ عَضُداً(( 51 ))

51- I CALLED THEM NOT TO WITNESS THE CREATION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE
EARTH, NOR THEIR OWN CREATION. AND I WAS NOT (THE ONE) TO TAKE THOSE WHO
LEAD OTHERS ASTRAY AS AN ASSISTANCE.

وَيَوْمَ يَقُولُ نَادُوا شُرَكَائِيَ الَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ فَدَعَوْهُمْ
فَلَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُوا لَهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّوْبِقاً(( 52 ))

52- AND THE DAY IN WHICH HE SAYS:ِ \`\`CALL ON THOSE WHOM YOU THOUGHT
TO HAVE BEEN MY PARTNERS. AND THEY WILL CALL THEM ON, BUT THEY ANSWER
THEM NOT.'' AND WE SET A PLACE OF PERDITION BETWEEN THEM.

وَرَأَى الْمُجْرِمُونَ النَّارَ فَظَنُّوا أَنَّهُمْ مُوَاقِعُوهَا
وَلَمْ يَجِدُوا عَنْهَا مَصْرِفاً(( 53 ))

53- AND THE SINNERS SEE THE FIRE, AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ABOUT TO
FALL IN IT, AND WILL NOT FIND A MEANS TO TURN THEM AWAY.

[ 650 ]

THE COMMENTARY


DON'T MAKE MASTERS OF SATANS (VERSE NO. 50 - 53)

Once again the argument returns to the fall of Mankind through IBLIS,
who is Man's avowed enemy. Allah asked:ِ

\`\`Do you then take him and his offspring as masters besides Me?''

It is indeed a false exchange, to prefer a sworn enemy over our
Merciful and Compassionate Cherisher Lord!

In this verse Satan's offspring may mean all those who follow him. Our
evil deeds, and even our evil thoughts and motives, might be considered
as the offsprings of Satan.

Some people may think too much of Satan, and therefore in the next
verse (NO.51) such ideas have been rejected by saying that, God did not
call Satan and his offspring to witness, when He created the heavens and
the earth; nor even in their own creation.

He who has not any role and effect in the creation of himself and other
creatures of the world, and knows nothing of the secrets of existence,
how can he become a Lord and a leader. In other word the creation is
based on fact and truth, and there is no room for him whose programme is
seduction and misleading.

There is also a warning in the next verse (NO.52) that in the
Resurrection Day, Allah will say to the polytheists and idolaters to
call on those whom they thought to have been God's partners. They will
call them, but they receive no answer at all, because there is a part or
partition of Perdition between the two parties.


وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَا فِي هَذَا الْقُرْآنِ لِلنَّاسِ مِنْ كُلِّ مَثَل
وَكَانَ الاِْنسَانُ أَكْثَرَ شَيْء جَدَلا(( 54 ))

54- AND WE HAVE EXPLAINED IN THIS QURA"N OF ALL SORTS OF EXAMPLES FOR
PEOPLE, BUT MAN DISPUTES MORE THAN EVERYTHING ELSE.

[ 651 ]

وَمَا مَنَعَ النَّاسَ أَنْ يُؤْمِنُوا إِذْ جَاءَهُمْ الْهُدَى
وَيَسْتَغْفِرُوا رَبَّهُمْ إِلاَّ أَنْ تَأْتِيَهُمْ سُنَّةُ
الاَْوَّلِينَ أَوْ يَأْتِيَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ قُبُلا(( 55 ))

55- AND NOTHING PREVENTED MAN FROM BELIEVING WHEN THE GUIDANCE CAME TO
THEM, AND ASKING FOR THEIR LORD'S FORGIVENESS; EXCEPT COMING TO THEM THE
FATE OF THE ANCIENTS, OR THE PUNISHMENT COME ON THEM FACE TO FACE.

وَمَا نُرْسِلُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ
وَيُجَادِلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِالْبَاطِلِ لِيُدْحِضُوا بِهِ الْحَقَّ
وَاتَّخَذُوا آيَاتِي وَمَا أُنْذِرُوا هُزُواً(( 56 ))

56- AND WE SEND NOT THE MESSENGERS EXCEPT AS BEARERS OF GLAD-TIDINGS,
AND WARNERS. AND THE UNBELIEVERS DISPUTE WITH FALSEHOOD, IN ORDER TO
CONFOUND THE TRUTH, BY IT, AND THEY TOOK IN MOCKERY MY SIGNS AND
WARNINGS.


THE COMMENTARY


AS IF THEY WAIT FOR PUNISHMENT ONLY (VERSE NO. 54 - 56)

These verses here come to some conclusion of the preceding
arguments:ِ

\`\`We have explained in this Qura"n of all sorts of examples for
people....''

The Scripture consists of the history of the past generations with
clear cut examples of their sweet and bitter incidents and accidents,
which can solve all the serious problems of Mankind; but they did not
[ 652 ]

make use of the advices, admonitions, and warnings, accompanied by
good-tidings, of the Book! They only adhered to disputes for want of
wisdom and discernment. By way of obstinacy they called for repetition
of what had happened to the disbelievers of the past centuries!

In other word the stubborn and obstinate people will not believe
willingly, and they must either taste the punishment that afflicted the
past generations, or at least see that sort of punishments with their
own eyes.

Then to console His prophet, Allah says:ِ

\`\`We send not the Messenger except as warners and bearers of
glad-tidings.''

The Messenger's duty is to warn us of the dangers of evil, and give us
glad-tidings of the life to come with all its splendour, lest we abandon
to despair when we see the death of our dearers and nearers.


وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ ذُكِّرَ بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِ فَأَعْرَضَ عَنْهَا
وَنَسِىَ مَا قَدَّمَتْ يَدَاهُ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ
أَكِنَّةً أَنْ يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِي آذَانِهِمْ وَقْراً وَإِنْ تَدْعُهُمْ
إِلَى الْهُدَى فَلَنْ يَهْتَدُوا إِذاً أَبَداً(( 57 ))

57- AND WHO IS MORE UNJUST, THAN HE WHO WAS REMINDED BY THE SIGNS OF
HIS LORD, THEN HE TURNED AWAY FROM IT, AND FORGOT WHAT HIS HANDS HAD
FORWARDED? WE HAVE PUT A VEIL UPON THEIR HEARTS NOT TO APPREHEND IT, AND
A HEAVINESS IN THEIR EARS (SO THAT THEY DON'T HEAR). AND IF YOU CALL
THEM TO GUIDANCE, THEY WILL NEVER BE GUIDED!

وَرَبُّكَ الْغَفُورُ ذُو الرَّحْمَةِ لَوْ يُؤَاخِذُهُمْ بِمَا كَسَبُوا
لَعَجَّلَ لَهُمْ الْعَذَابَ بَلْ لَّهُمْ مَوْعِدٌ لَّنْ يَجِدُوا مِنْ
دُونِهِ مَوْئِلا(( 58 ))

[ 653 ]

58- AND YOUR LORD IS FORGIVING, MERCIFUL. IF HE WAS TO TAKE THEM TO
TASK FOR WHAT THEY EARNED, HE WOULD HAVE HASTENED THE PUNISHMENT FOR
THEM, BUT THERE IS AN APPOINTED TIME FOR THEM, FROM WHICH THEY FIND NO
REFUGE.

وَتِلْكَ الْقُرَى أَهْلَكْنَاهُمْ لَمَّا ظَلَمُوا وَجَعَلْنَا
لِمَهْلِكِهِمْ مَّوْعِداً(( 59 ))

59- AND THESE ARE THE TOWNS (THE RUINS OF WHICH YOU MAY SEE) THAT, WE
DESTROYED THEM WHEN THEY OPPRESSED; AND WE APPOINTED FOR THEIR
DESTRUCTION AN APPOINTED TIME.


THE COMMENTARY


ALLAH HASTENS NOT HIS PUNISHMENT (VERSE NO. 57 - 59)

The above verses are the complementary to the aforementioned ones,
beginning with:ِ

\`\`Who is more unjust than he who was reminded by the signs of his
Lord, and he turned away from it, and forgot all that his hands had
forwarded.''

The instructions of the prophets remind us of the truth that is planted
in our soul by nature and creation. The aim of the prophets (AS HAZRAT
IMAM ALI, A.S. HAS SAID), is to make people faithful to the pact and
promise, made in their nature when they were created. They are to be
reminded of the favours of God that they have forgotten it.

The verses also imply that our soul is already acquainted with the
facts and truth that have been sent to us through the apostles, and that
they are sent from our Lord God. We also should not forget that our
hands have forwarded many wrongs and the prophets have come to
[ 654 ]

cleanse us from the dirt and filth of our forgotten sins.


But if in such a case he is reminded by the signs of God, and he still
rejects to repent and return; he is indeed the greatest of oppressors to
himself! He now deserves to fall down into the abyss of ignorance,
darkness, and perdition, due to his utmost folly.

When there comes a time that our sins put a veil upon our heart, and we
do not listen to Divine Warning, we have to perish. And such a perdition
is due to the height of our own folly, that inspite of having such a
Merciful and All-forgiving Lord we should cast ourselves down to such an
abyss of ignorance.

THANKS FOR HELP


When his Holiness HAZRAT AYATULLAH-AL-OZMA", NASIR MAKARIM SHIRAZI, in
the MARCH 1999, ordered me to start translating an expressive summary of
his great work on the Glorious Qura"n, which is named as, \`\`THE
EXAMPLE COMMENTARY'' I took his order for the best of opportunities in
my life. I immediately resigned of my office, and got rid of all my
jobs, in order to use my full time and power, with love and pleasure, on
this sacred work. Now after three years of a full time work, I offer to
my dear readers the third volume of the whole work, which has to
complete in six volumes altogether.

Up to here, half of the whole Qura"n has been translated and published,
and it is also found on Internet too.

Whether I have been successful or failed, I have nothing to say. I only
know that I have done my best; and I leave the judgement to the Most
Merciful and Compassionate Lord, for whose sake and pleasure, and for
nothing else; I have done the work.

In the present attempt, I have to give my sincere thanks to the
following commentators, translators, and publishers, without whose help
I could not have reached the point that I have reached.

First of all, and in particular, I owe to make a mention of MOWLANA
ALLAMEH ABDULLAH YUSUF ALI, whose valuable work in translation and
commentary of QURA"N, has been the most intimate friend of mine, in the
past ten years. I have always had it a sacred duty incumbent upon me to
rehearse a few pages of his sacred work first time in the morning,
before I started doing anything else:

\`\`And those who came after them say:ِ \`\`Our Lord! Forgive us and
our brothers who came before us into faith, and leave not in our hearts
rancour against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed Full
of kindness Most Merciful.''

S 59:10

[ 656 ]

In this third volume of the work, I also owe much to my dear colleague,
Miss Poora"n Pebdani, who earnestly did all the typings, computer work,
corrections, and the layout work of the book.


Then I owe a lot of my present attempts to the following translators of
Qura"n, books, and publishers:ِ
