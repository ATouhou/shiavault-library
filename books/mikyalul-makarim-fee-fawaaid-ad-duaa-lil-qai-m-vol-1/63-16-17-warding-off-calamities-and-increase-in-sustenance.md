16 & 17. Warding Off Calamities And Increase In Sustenance
==========================================================

There are a large number of traditions that prove this matter. Among
them are:

1. In *Kafi,* through his own authentic of narrators, it is narrated
from His Eminence, Abu Abdillah Sadiq (as) that he said:

“Prayer of a man for his brother in his absence increases sustenance and
wards off calamities.”[^1]

2. In *Wasailush Shia* from Humran bin Ayyin it is narrated that His
Eminence, Abu Ja’far Baqir (as) said in a tradition:

“You must pray for your brother in religion in his absence as it
increases your sustenance, and he said it thrice.”[^2]

3. Also in the traditional report of Musada bin Sadqa from Imam Ja’far
Sadiq (as) it is narrated that he said:

“Indeed, prayer of a believer for his brother in his absence is accepted
and it increases sustenance and wards off difficulties.”[^3]

4. From Muawiyah bin Ammar from Imam Ja’far Sadiq (as) it is narrated
that he said:

“Praying for your brother in his absence attracts the sustenance of the
supplicant, and wards off calamities from him and the angels tell him:
The like of it is given to you.”[^4]

I say: These traditions prove that these two benefits would accrue to
the supplicant who prays for any believer in his absence. O sensible
people, do you know anyone more perfect in faith than your master, the
Master of the Time (aj)? Since his *Marefat* is a cause for perfection
of faith, hasten to pray for His Eminence.
