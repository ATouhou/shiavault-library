The Author's Preface
====================

**THE EXAMPLE COMMENTARY IN BRIEF**

The greatest capital that we Muslims have, is the GLORIOUS QURA"N. Our
gnosis and knowledge, the commandments, living programmes, Islamic
politics, and the way of approach to God, and all and all; we find them
in this Great Divine Book.

Therefore it is incumbent upon all the Muslims, to get better
acquainted with this great religious book they have.

On the other hand; the fame of Islam has widely spread all over the
GLOBE, partly due to the Muslims late vigilance and wakefulness, and
partly due to the Islamic Revolution of Iran. This widely echoed name,
has aroused the sense of investigation and research, in the non -
Muslims who now like to know more and more about Islam. Therefore, at
present, there is a great demand for the translations and the
commentaries of the Holy QURA"N, throughout the world. Unfortunately
such a wide demand has not been satisfied yet.

Fortunately the presence of the HOLY QURA"N, all over in the Muslim
societies, throughout the world and especially in our own country
(Iran), daily increases. Expert reciters of the Book; those who keep it
in their memory, and the well versed commentators are not few or rare.
The commentary of QURA"N is now turned to an important classic field of
learning in the THEOLOGICAL SCHOOLS of QOM, and for this purpose the
EXAMPLE COMMENTARY was prepared, which is expressive, simple to
understand, deep in meanings and meanwhile it is a work, up to date.
This was aimed to answer the problems of the day and to satisfy the
necessities of our time. Perhaps this is why the book has been received
by the people of various kinds, with ardent interest and hot
enthusiasm.

A big group of scholars, and learned commentators, well versed in
QURA"N, who are mostly Theological School Teachers of Qom; such as the
masters and professors:

MOHAMMAD REZA A"SHTIANI - MOHAMMAD JAAFAR EMA"MI - DAWOOD ELHA"MI -
ASADULLAH IMANI - ABD. ALRASUL HASANI - SAYYED HASAN SHOJAEE - SAID
NUROLLAH TABA" TABA"EE - MAHMUD ABDULLAHI - MOHSEN GHERA"ATI and
MOHAMMAD MOHAMMADI (ESHTEHARDI), worked hard for a period of fifteen
years full time, to create this important and voluminous work.

Of course their weariness was entirely removed by the interest and warm
attention that people paid to their work. And now this hope is induced
in them that if God Speeds, it might be a work accepted in the presence
of Allah.

The FARSI VERSION of the BOOK has repeatedly gone under print. (more
than ten times so far)
The ORDU TRANSLATION too, in twenty seven volumes, has had several
prints.
The Arabic Version also, which is named ALAMSAL, has recently been
published in BEIRUT, and else where is the Islamic countries.
Translation of the Book to English language is presently at hand, and
we hope that it shall very soon appear among the press.

When the complete work was published in 27 volumes, a group of people
demanded to have a concise of it, in order to get access to the
meanings; quicker, and by a less price, and else, in some teaching
classes to have a brief of the whole lot, for teaching and discussion.
It made us to consider the request, and intend to summarise the 27
volumes, reducing them to only five - a work that was not so easy to
do.

Then it happened that professor AHMAD ALI BA"BA"EE accepted the
responsibility of this hard and laborious job.

His ability and skill had already been proved to me for arranging the
Example Commentary in sequence of different subjects in a couple of
years.

I too, very often looked the work over and controlled it and gave
advices as far as I could, and many thanks to our Merciful Lord for the
fruitful results that has been obtained in the form of an expressive
translation of the text, and commentary in brief, for those who want to
use it as a reference. I have named it:

**THE EXAMPLE COMMENTARY IN BRIEF**

I thank Mr. BA"BA"EE too, for the excellent and useful work that he has
fulfilled, and hope it to be accepted by the learned and those who have
great interest in the HOLY QURA"N; and may it be a reservation for all
of us in the Dooms Day.

THE TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

**AS FOR THE TEXT**

The Glorious Qura"n is the Word of God. I am of opinion that no mortal
translator like me, can convey the whole and exact meaning of the verses
with so many dimensions that they have, into another language. The best
solution to this problem is to read and comprehend the Book in its
Arabic version. This is why I have inscribed the Arabic text as the
topic of my work.

RUMI says:-

If we cannot draw the whole lot of the sea water,

We may drive enough to satisfy our thirst. In translating the Arabic
Text, for every verse and even for every phrase, I have referred to all
the existing important English Translations such as that of
Sale'sِArthur J.ArberyِN.J. DawoodِAbdullah Yusef Ali and Dr M.H.
Shakir. I have collated and made a careful comparison of their
translation and the original Arabic text to the meaning of which I am
not much unaware. In this comparison my scale and criterion has been the
Farsi translation of His Holiness Ayatollah AL-OZMA MAKAREM SHIRAZI.
Besides; I have added the especial views of his Holiness in between
parenthesis as he himself has done in his Persian version.

In this respect I have done my best, and only for the sake of God, and
nothing else; so as to produce a clean, correct, and expressive
translation of the Holy Book that has been my favourite throughout my
life.

I have avoided entirely the customary Archaic language, and have made
my translation in the simplest form, and the most correct meaning as I
could, so that the common people speaking English and even the laymen
might read and understand the intention of their Lord God. But how far
have I succeeded to approach my goal? This is a matter to be judged by
the dear and learned reader.

**AS FOR THE COMMENTARY**

The Example Commentary of His holiness is a great voluminous collective
work done by 15 scholars and learned commentators, all well versed in
Qura"n who worked hard for some 10 years under the direct control and
direction of Ayatollah Al-Ozma-Makarem.

Therefore the life of an individual like me will not suffice to perform
even half of the translation. On the other hand his holiness has written
this great book for the Persians who are almost all Shiites, and also
they believe in the matter. But I am translating it for the English
speaking world who are almost all Christians, and among them we may find
many people who hate Islam, and don't believe most of the matters.

To this effect my translation is focused on a certain quotations from
the whole work, that may illustrate what is the truth about Islam; who
is the God that we Muslims worship, and what about Resurrection Day. And
matters that are common to all in Islam. And these quotations I have
translated and written in my own special literature and simple language
for common people. As a matter of fact the soul and spirit of the
translation belongs to his Holiness Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi; and its
body has been shaped and formed by me.

Therefore, when comparing the translation with the original work, in
the first glance both may look different; while a deeper look will
prove, that I have taken the meanings from his holiness and illustrated
it with my pen and handi work in order to show in brief; what Islam and
Qura"n is. However I hope this abridgment may show the grandeur of the
whole work of 27 volumes. Mansoor Aminy-Baghbadorani

وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَى لِفَتَاهُ لاَ أَبْرَحُ حَتَّى أَبْلُغَ مَجْمَعَ
الْبَحْرَيْنِ أَوْ أَمْضِىَ حُقُباً(( 60 ))

60- AND WHEN MOSES SAID TO HIS GENTLE YOUTH; I WILL NOT GIVE UP UNTIL I
REACH THE JUNCTION OF THE TWO SEAS, EVEN IF I AM TO CONTINUE GOING ON
AND ON.

فَلَمَّا بَلَغَا مَجْمَعَ بَيْنِهِمَا نَسِيَا حُوتَهُمَا فَاتَّخَذَ
سَبِيلَهُ فِى الْبَحْرِ سَرَباً(( 61 ))

61- THEN WHEN THEY REACHED THE JUNCTION, FORGOT THEIR FISH THERE, AND
IT TOOK ITS WAY INTO SEA CRAWLING.

فَلَمَّا جَاوَزَا قَالَ لِفَتَاهُ آتِنَا غَدَاءَنَا لَقَدْ لَقِينَا
مِنْ سَفَرِنَا هَذَا نَصَباً(( 62 ))

62- WHEN THEY PASSED OVER (THE JUNCTION OF THE TWO SEAS), HE SAID TO
HIS GENTLE YOUNG; BRING US OUR FOOD THAT WE HAVE BEEN TIRED OF THIS OUR
JOURNEY.

قَالَ أَرَأَيْتَ إِذْ أَوَيْنَا إِلَى الصَّخْرَةِ فَإِنِّى نَسِيتُ
الْحُوتَ وَمَا أَنْسَانِيهُ إِلاَّ الشَّيْطَانُ أَنْ أَذْكُرَهُ
وَاتَّخَذَ سَبِيلَهُ فِى الْبَحْرِ عَجَباً(( 63 ))

63- HE SAID; DID YOU SEE (WHAT HAPPENED)!? WHEN WE REPOSED ON THE ROCK,
THERE, I FORGOT THE FISH. AND NOTHING MADE ME TO FORGET IT EXCEPT SATAN
(LEST I SHOULD) MENTION IT (TO YOU), WHEN IT TOOK ITS WAY INTO THE SEA
WONDERFULLY.

قَالَ ذَلِكَ مَا كُنَّا نَبْغِ فَارْتَدَّا عَلَى آثَارِهِمَا قَصَصاً((
64 ))

64- HE SAID; THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR. THEN THEY TURNED BACK
ON THEIR TRACES IN SEARCH (AGAIN).

THE COMMENTARY
THE WONDERFUL STORY OF MOSES AND KHEZR
VERSE NO.60ِ64

In this chapter eighteen of Qura"n, there are three amazing narratives
which take us out of our present natural state of life, showing that,
neither the world is limited to that which we see, nor the real nature
of some incidents are exactly what we apprehend. These narratives are:ِ
1ِThat of the companions of the cave which proves the relativity of
time.

2ِThe meeting of Moses an Arch prophet with an apostle on special duty,
which proves that some of our apparent losses are real gains! 3ِAnd the
journeys of Zulgharnine which we shall study a little later.

In the present narration we see that even Moses who was an
Arch-Prophet, and with the highest knowledge of his time and space, has
thought that his knowledge was not perfect, and desired to know more,
and explore more information about the mysteries of life. He goes in
search of a divine teacher, who shows him three paradoxes in which
apparent losses are real gains, and cruelty is true Mercy!:ِ

\`\`And remember when Moses said to his gentle youth; I will not give
up going on until I reach the junction of the two seas....'' In this
narration the fellow-traveller of Moses in his journey is not named in
the Qura"n, but according to some Islamic traditions he must have been
JOSHUA, the brave, faithful and virtuous successor of Moses. As for the
junction of the two seas, or the geographical location of the meeting,
it could have been the point in Sinai Peninsula, where the Gulf of
Aqaba, and the Gulf of Suez join together. Some other commentators,
believe it to have been where the Indian Ocean, and Red Sea, come
together.

In a figurative language, the two seas might be the two main fields of
apparent and unapparent knowledge, the symbols of which in this
narration are Moses and Khezr.

When Moses and his youth came at the junction of the two seas they
reposed on a rock leaving their food which was a dried fish, besides
them. Then the attendant of Moses saw that the dead fish took its way
and creeped down to the sea wonderfully! And more strange than that,
Joshua forgot to tell Moses the wonderful movement of the fish.

They moved on their way on, and in another place, when tired of
travelling on foot, they felt to need some refreshment. So Moses said to
his attendant:ِ \`\`Bring us our food, that, we have been tired of this
our journey.'' There was when Jashua, remembered how strangely the fish
had crawled down the rock, and swam into the sea! So he informed Moses
of that saying:ِ

\`\`Did you see what happened when we reposed on the rock? I forgot the
fish. And it was Satan who caused me to forget, to mention it to you,
when it took its way into the sea.''

فَوَجَدَا عَبْداً مِنْ عِبَادِنَا آتَيْنَاهُ رَحْمَةً مِّنْ عِنْدِنَا
وَعَلَّمْنَاهُ مِنْ لَدُنَّا عِلْماً(( 65 ))

65- THEN THEY FOUND ONE OF OUR SERVANTS TO WHOM WE BESTOWED OUR MERCY,
AND TAUGHT HIM A KNOWLEDGE FROM OUR OWN (PRESENCE)

قَالَ لَهُ مُوسَى هَلْ أَتَّبِعُكَ عَلَى أَنْ تُعَلِّمَنِ مِمَّا
عُلِّمْتَ رُشْداً(( 66 ))

66- MOSES SAID TO HIM:ِ \`\`MAY I FOLLOW YOU SO AS TO TEACH ME SOME OF
WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT FOR DEVELOPMENT?'' [ 20 ]

قَالَ إِنَّكَ لَنْ تَسْتَطِيعَ مَعِى صَبْراً(( 67 ))
67- HE SAID:ِ \`\`YOU CAN NEVER STAY PATIENT WITH ME.''
وَكَيْفَ تَصْبِرُ عَلَى مَا لَمْ تُحِطْ بِهِ خُبْراً(( 68 ))
68- AND HOW CAN YOU KEEP PATIENT ON WHAT YOU HAVE NOT ENOUGH
INFORMATION ABOUT IT?''
قَالَ سَتَجِدُنِى إِنْ شَاءَ اللهُ صَابِراً وَلاَ أَعْصِى لَكَ
أَمْراً(( 69 ))
69- HE (MOSES) SAID:ِ \`\`SOON SHALL YOU FIND ME PATIENT IF GOD SPEEDS,
AND I WILL NOT DISOBEY YOU ANY ORDER.''
قَالَ فَإِنِ اتَّبَعْتَنِى فَلاَ تَسْأَلْنِى عَنْ شَىْء حَتَّى أُحْدِثَ
لَكَ مِنْهُ ذِكْراً(( 70 ))
70- HE SAID:ِ \`\`THEN IF YOU FOLLOWED ME; DO NOT ASK ME OF ANYTHING,
UNTIL I MYSELF MAKE A MENTION OF IT TO YOU.''

**THE COMMENTARY
MEETING WITH A GREAT TEACHER**

VERSE NO.65ِ70

When Moses and his attendant returned searching again:ِ

\`\`They found one of our servants to whom We bestowed our Mercy, and
taught him a knowledge from our own presence.''

The verse (NO.65) implies that being the servant of God, is the
greatest of honours, and being taught by God Himself, means having a
kind of knowledge that no one else has it except God. But who was that
servant of God Whom Moses was looking for? Qura"n does not name the Man;
but in Islamic traditions he is named, \`\`KHEZR'' which literally means
green. He is a prophet on special [ 21 ]

duties, who takes his knowledge and information directly from God. He
knows the secrets of events, and of the paradoxes of life, which the
ordinary prophets know it not. He is a mysterious being whose parents,
if any, no one knows, and his life is everlasting. He is bestowed with
two gifts from God;ِ that of a Mercy and also a certain kind of
knowledge by which he is able to interpret the mysteries of events.

When Moses saw the Divine Teacher, he said to him:ِ \`\`May I follow
you to teach me some of what you have been taught for development?'' The
Man of God did not agree with the request of Moses at first and said:ِ

\`\`You can never stay patient with me, because you have not enough
information about what I am doing.'' But Moses promised the teacher to
keep quiet, and obey him in all that he would order; with the help of
God of course. Thus Moses closed the doors of objections and excuses, on
the side of his party; so that he was admitted to the curious class of
mysterious knowledge! فَانطَلَقَا حَتَّى إِذَا رَكِبَا فِى السَّفِينَةِ
خَرَقَهَا قَالَ أَخَرَقْتَهَا لِتُغْرِقَ أَهْلَهَا لَقَدْ جِئْتَ شَيْئاً
إِمْراً(( 71 ))

71- SO THEY BOTH SET OUT UNTIL THEY EMBARKED IN A BOAT (AND HE)
SCUTTLED IT! (MADE A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT) MOSES SAID: \`\`DID
YOU SCUTTLE IT, TO DROWN ITS CREW? VERILY YOU DID SOMETHING
OFFENSIVE.''

قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ إِنَّكَ لَنْ تَسْتَطِيعَ مَعِى صَبْراً(( 72 ))

72- HE SAID:ِ \`\`DID I NOT SAY THAT YOU CAN NEVER STAY PATIENT WITH
ME?''

[ 22 ]

قَالَ لاَ تُؤَاخِذْنِى بِمَا نَسِيتُ وَلاَ تُرْهِقْنِى مِنْ أَمْرِى
عُسْراً(( 73 ))

73- HE SAID:ِ \`\`TAKE ME NOT TO TASK FOR WHAT I FORGOT, AND TAKE IT
NOT HARD FOR ME. (IN THIS CASE OF MINE)

فَانطَلَقَا حَتَّى إِذَا لَقِيَا غُلاَماً فَقَتَلَهُ قَالَ أَقَتَلْتَ
نَفْساً زَكِيَّةً بِغَيْرِ نَفْس لَّقَدْ جِئْتَ شَيْئاً نُّكْراً(( 74
))

74- (ONCE AGAIN) THEY SET OUT UNTIL THEY MET WITH A BOY, AND HE SLEW
HIM!

HE (MOSES) SAID; DID YOU KILL AN INNOCENT PERSON WHO HAS KILLED NO
ONE!? VERILY YOU DID SOMETHING TOO BAD.

THE BEGINNING OF PARTِ16

قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَّكَ إِنَّكَ لَنْ تَسْتَطِيعَ مَعِى صَبْراً(( 75
))

75- HE SAID; DID I NOT TELL YOU THAT, YOU WILL NEVER STAY PATIENT WITH
ME?

قَالَ إِنْ سَأَلْتُكَ عَنْ شَىْء بَعْدَهَا فَلاَ تُصَاحِبْنِى قَدْ
بَلَغْتَ مِنْ لَّدُنِّى عُذْراً(( 76 ))

76- HE SAID; \`\`IF EVER I QUESTIONED YOU AGAIN, DO NOT ACCOMPANY ME;
FOR YOU THEN WILL HAVE ENOUGH EXCUSE ON MY SIDE.'' [ 23 ]

فَانطَلَقَا حَتَّى إِذَا أَتَيَا أَهْلَ قَرْيَة اسْتَطْعَمَا أَهْلَهَا
فَأَبَوْا أَنْ يُضَيِّفُوهُمَا فَوَجَدَا فِيهَا جِدَاراً يُرِيدُ أَنْ
يَنقَضَّ فَأَقَامَهُ قَالَ لَوْ شِئْتَ لاَتَّخَذْتَ عَلَيْهِ أَجْراً((
77 ))

77- THEN THEY SET OUT (AGAIN) UNTIL THEY CAME TO A TOWNS FOLK. THEY
ASKED THE PEOPLE TO GIVE THEM SOME FOOD, BUT THEY REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN
THEM. THERE, THEY FOUND A WALL ON THE POINT OF FALLING DOWN. HE SET IT
UP. (REPAIRED THE WALL)

MOSES SAID; \`\`IF YOU WANTED, YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN A WAGE FOR
THAT.''

قَالَ هَذَا فِرَاقُ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنِكَ سَأُنَبِّئُكَ بِتَأْوِيلِ مَا
لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ عَّلَيْهِ صَبْراً(( 78 )) 78- HE SAID:ِ \`\`NOW IS THE
TIME OF SEPARATION BETWEEN ME AND YOU. SOON SHALL I INFORM YOU OF THE
INTERPRETATION OF WHAT YOU COULD NOT BEAR IT PATIENTLY.''


**THE COMMENTARY
A DIVINE TEACHER, AND SO MANY WRONGS!?**

VERSE NO.71ِ78 From now on, we see that all the pronouns in the
following incidents of KHEZR and MOSES are in dual form; which implies
that JOSHUA did not accompany Khezr and Moses.

They both went on, until they reached a ship which Khezr scuttled it.
The ARABIC, \`\`KHARAGHA HA"'' literally denotes that he tore it; but in
[ 24 ]

connotations, it means that, Khezr must have dug a hole at the bottom
of the ship in order to sink it down! Moses was a prophet of God; how
could he keep calm and quiet, when he saw something wrong happened,
without objecting and forbidding it? He therefore kept not indifferent
when something extraordinary was going on, that could not be interpreted
with his prophetic principles, and in terms of his experiences.

Some of the great expounders of Qura"n like, TABARSI, have understood
the said town to have been NAZARETH at the North of Palestine which is
the place in which Jesus Christ was born.

أَمَّا السَّفِينَةُ فَكَانَتْ لِمَسَاكِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ فِى الْبَحْرِ
فَأَرَدْتُّ أَنْ أَعِيبَهَا وَكَانَ وَرَاءَهُمْ مَّلِكٌ يَأْخُذُ كُلَّ
سَفِينَة غَصْباً(( 79 ))

79- AS FOR THE BOAT, IT BELONGED TO SOME POOR PEOPLE WORKING ON THE
SEA. I INTENDED TO PUT A FAULT IN IT, WHILE THERE WAS A KING AFTER THEM,
TAKING ALL BOATS BY FORCE.

وَأَمَّا الْغُلاَمُ فَكَانَ أَبَوَاهُ مُؤْمِنَيْنِ فَخَشِينَا أَنْ
يُرْهِقَهُمَا طُغْيَاناً وَكُفْراً(( 80 ))

80- AS FOR THE BOY, HIS PARENTS WERE BELIEVERS. THEN WE FEARED THAT, HE
SHOULD IMPOSE ON THEM REBELLION AND BLASPHEMY.

فَأَرَدْنَا أَنْ يُبْدِلَهُمَا رَبُّهُمَا خَيْراً مِّنْهُ زَكَاةً
وَأَقْرَبَ رُحْماً(( 81 ))

81- SO WE WISHED THAT THEIR LORD WOULD GIVE THEM IN EXCHANGE, A BETTER
THAN HIM IN PURITY, AND CLOSER IN AFFECTION.

[ 25 ] وَأَمَّا الْجِدَارُ فَكَانَ لِغُلاَمَيْنِ يَتِيمَيْنِ فِى
الْمَدِينَةِ وَكَانَ تَحْتَهُ كَنزٌ لَّهُمَا وَكَانَ أَبُوهُمَا صَالِحاً
فَأَرَادَ رَبُّكَ أَنْ يَبْلُغَا أَشُدَّهُمَا وَيَسْتَخْرِجَا كَنزَهُمَا
رَحْمَةً مِّنْ رَّبِّكَ وَمَا فَعَلْتُهُ عَنْ أَمْرِى ذَلِكَ تَأْوِيلُ
مَا لَمْ تَسْطِعْ عَّلَيْهِ صَبْراً(( 82 ))

82- AND AS FOR THE WALL; IT BELONGED TO TWO ORPHAN BOYS IN THE CITY,
AND THERE WAS A TREASURE BENEATH IT FOR THEM; AND THEIR FATHER WAS A
RIGHTEOUS MAN, SO YOUR LORD INTENDED THAT THEY SHOULD REACH THEIR
MATURITY, AND TAKE OUT THEIR TREASURE AS A MERCY FROM YOUR LORD; AND I
DID NOT DO IT BY MY OWN WILL. THAT IS THE INTERPRETATION OF WHAT YOU
COULD NOT BEAR IT PATIENTLY.


**THE COMMENTARY
THE INNER SECRETS OF THE THREE INCIDENTS**

VERSE NO.79ِ82

When the separation of the two fellow-travellers became inevitable the
Divine Teacher decided to reveal the secrets of the three incidents, to
Moses so as to show him that there was public and private interests in
all the three events; and that, it could be a key to open many secrets
and locks of knowledge for Moses and for all. He therefore began with
revealing the mystery of the ship which he scuttled, saying:ِ

\`\`As for the boat, it belonged to some poor people working on the
sea. I intended to put a fault in it while there was a king after them
taking all boats by force.'' [ 26 ]

Khezr, by the Divine knowledge that he was given, knew well that the
ship which worked for the benefit of a group of poor and weak people on
the sea, was going to be seized by a cruel and unjust king, very soon,
for some military purposes. If the king could have commandeered the
boat, no resource would be left for the owners of the ship, to provide
them with their means of sustenance and support of life. Therefore, by a
simple act of piercing a hole at the bottom of the boat, he rendered it
unserviceable, and saved it from the confiscation.

But Moses from the nature of his duty as a prophet, objected to what
Khezr did, and said to him:ِ

\`\`Did you scuttle the ship to drown its crew? Verily you did
something wrong and very offensive!''
The man of God with a fair self-possession said to Moses:ِ
\`\`Did I not say that you can never stay patient with me?''
Moses felt sorry for being hasty and forgetting his promise, and begged
his pardon, saying:ِ
\`\`Please take me not to task for my forgetfulness, and take things a
little easy for me.''
Thus the man of God pardoned him, and they continued with their
journey.
In their way on, they met with a boy, and Khezr slew him, without
seeing any fault!
Again seeing a murder for nothing, excited Moses and he raised his
voice to object:ِ
\`\`What! Did you kill an innocent person who has killed no one!? You
have done a very bad thing indeed!''
Again with coolness, and in a reproaching way said the mysterious
prophet of God:ِ
\`\`Moses! Did I not tell you that you will never stay patient with
me?''
The second act of Khezr seemed more cruel to Moses, when he saw him to
kill a boy who had not any evident guilt. Khezr had a [ 27 ] special eye
or knowledge, by which he could see the danger of blasphemy and
rebellion in that boy which could result in killing his parents who were
a virtuous couple who had brought the boy up with care and love.

Any how; again Moses asked his companion to excuse him for the last
time:ِ

\`\`If ever I questioned you again, you may not accompany me, for
having enough excuse against me.'' Then they set out until they reached
a towns folk. There, they had already spent all their provisions for
their journey, and were very tired too. So they expected the towns
folk's hospitality, but they proved to be utterly parsimonious a people,
and even refused to give them some food! Inspite of that, they found a
wall in the town, which was broken and on the point of falling down; and
Khezr repaired the wall, and set it up. Loving and respecting guests is
an Eastern custom; and therefore, Moses expected the towns folk to offer
entertainment of themselves, and unasked. But in spite of their
stinginess, Khezr rebuilt for them their falling wall, and asked them
not any wages! Here was when Moses made his third mistake, and said to
Khezr:ِ

\`\`Now that they refused to give us some food, you had better taken a
wage or reward for your maintenance of the wall.'' When so, Khezr said
to Moses:ِ

\`\`Now is the time of separation between me and you; but I will inform
you of the interpretation of what you could not bear it patiently.''
Khezr also knew that if the wall had fallen the treasure which was
buried beneath it would have been discovered by the greedy people of the
town, who were eagerly desirous for wealth. But God's intention was to
hand the treasure over to its real owners who were the two orphans and
who would eventually become as righteous as their father.

And thus Khezr proved to Moses that there was public and private
benefits involved in all the three acts he did. [ 28 ]

**WHAT WERE THE BASIS OF THE THREE ACTS**

Islamic scholars and inquirers have put forward the argument that on
what basis did Khezr performed his three actions? Was it according to
the religious Law, or the universal Law of creation? Are we really
permitted to put a fault in something that belongs to some one else,
just to prevent some one else to seize it? Or is it lawful to slay a boy
who might commit a crime in future? Or is it necessary for us to toil
and work free of any charge, to protect other people's wealth and
treasure?

The jurisprudents, and those who are well versed in the religious Law,
say that; when Khezr scuttled the ship, he did something less important
to save something which was very important.... much more than the
charge; and this sort of actions are lawful and praiseworthy in the
sight and doctrine of God's religion. On the other hand; the consent and
pleasure of the poor owners of the ship could have been foreseen.
Therefore what Khezr did with the ship, was not wrong.

As for the boy; the expounders of Qura"n believe that he had already
reached a stage of guilt and evil, so as to have been condemned to
death. In other word he had been apostate, and mischief maker; so much
so, that his present could be an illustration of his future.

And as for the repair of the wall; it should not bring forward any
argument, because sacrifices for the good of other people in need; is a
praiseworthy act by all the religions and creeds.

On the other hand, Allah has created the universe according to His
General Plan, which is based upon certain rules and laws. Violating
these laws and regulations, must have, and it really has, its own due
reaction; depending on how far someone has gone astray, and howmuch has
he violated the rules of creation. Therefore, the world is controlled
under the dominion, and supreme authority of two orders; universal or
religious. Allah may make use of both kinds of regulations, to control
the events that may happen in the creation and throughout the
universe.

[ 29 ]

**LESSONS OF THIS NARRATION**

There are many useful lessons that the incidents of Moses and Khezr may
teach us, some of which are as follows:ِ .ِDivine Knowledge has its main
source in the service and worship of God. Here in these verses, Allah
Has called Khezr, \`\`ONE OF HIS SERVANTS'' to whom He has bestowed,
\`\`A KNOWLEDGE'' from His own presence.

.ِKnowledge should accompany action, and we should not love knowledge
only for knowledge.
.ِMan should not be hasty, because almost all the affairs need time,
leisure, and opportunity, in order to mature.
There is the English proverb that:ِ \`\`All things come to him who will
but wait''
And there is the Persian proverb that:ِ \`\`Patience is bitter but
bears sweet fruit.''
.ِWe should not judge our affairs with their appearances only. Sometime
apparent losses can be real gains:ِ

\`\`....And it may be that you dislike a thing and it is good for you;
and it may be that you love a thing which is bad for you. And Allah
knows and you do not know.'' S 2:212
.ِSome children who are offensive to their parents may be condemned to
have a short life for their offense.
.ِBoth, the teacher and student, must behave politely to one another,
in word as well as in deeds. [ 30 ]

وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنْ ذِى الْقَرْنَيْنِ قُلْ سَأَتْلُوا عَلَيْكُمْ
مِنْهُ ذِكْراً(( 83 ))

83- AND THEY ASK YOU ABOUT ZELGHARNINE; SAY:ِ \`\`SOON SHALL I RECITE
TO YOU A MENTION OF HIM.

إِنَّا مَكَّنَّا لَهُ فِى الاَْرْضِ وَآتَيْنَاهُ مِنْ كُلِّ شَىْء
سَبَباً(( 84 ))

84- WE ESTABLISHED FOR HIM (POWER AND GOVERNORSHIP) IN THE EARTH, AND
GAVE HIM A WAY (OF ACCESS) TO EVERYTHING.

فَأَتْبَعَ سَبَباً(( 85 ))

85- SO HE FOLLOWED A WAY:ِ

حَتَّى إِذَا بَلَغَ مَغْرِبَ الشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِى عَيْن
حَمِئَة وَوَجَدَ عِنْدَهَا قَوْماً قُلْنَا يَا ذَا الْقَرْنَيْنِ إِمَّا
أَنْ تُعَذِّبَ وَإِمَّا أَنْ تَتَّخِذَ فِيهِمْ حُسْناً(( 86 ))

86- UNTIL HE REACHED (WHERE IT SEEMED TO HIM TO BE) THE SETTING POINT
OF THE SUN. HE FOUND IT SETTING IN A MUDDY DARK SPRING. HE FOUND A
PEOPLE BESIDE IT. WE SAID:ِ \`\`O, ZELGHARNINE! YOU MAY EITHER PUNISH
THEM OR TREAT THEM KINDLY.''

قَالَ أَمَّا مَنْ ظَلَمَ فَسَوْفَ نُعَذِّبُهُ ثُمَّ يُرَدُّ إِلَى
رَبِّهِ فَيُعَذِّبُهُ عَذَاباً نُّكْراً(( 87 ))

87- HE SAID:ِ \`\`AS FOR HE WHO HAS OPPRESSED; I SHALL SOON PUNISH HIM.
THEN HE WILL BE PASSED OVER TO HIS LORD, WHO WILL PUNISH HIM A SEVERE
PUNISHMENT.''

وَأَمَّا مَنْ آمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَلَهُ جَزَاءً الْحُسْنَى
وَسَنَقُولُ لَهُ مِنْ أَمْرِنَا يُسْراً(( 88 ))

[ 31 ]

88- BUT AS FOR HE WHO BELIEVED AND DID RIGHTEOUS DEEDS, FOR HIM SHALL
BE GOOD REWARD; AND SOON WE SHALL SAY FOR HIM OF OUR EASY ORDERS.

ثُمَّ أَتْبَعَ سَبَباً(( 89 ))

89- THEN HE FOLLOWED ANOTHER WAY.

حَتَّى إِذَا بَلَغَ مَطْلِعَ الشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَطْلُعُ عَلَى قَوْم
لَّمْ نَجْعَلْ لَّهُمْ مِنْ دُونِهَا سِتْراً(( 90 ))

90- UNTIL HE REACHED (WHERE IT SEEMED TO HIM TO BE) THE RISING POINT OF
THE SUN.

HE FOUND IT RISING UPON A PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE PROVIDED NO COVERING
AGAINST IT. (THEY WERE NUDE AND EXPOSED TO SUN RAYS)

كَذَلِكَ وَقَدْ أَحَطْنَا بِمَا لَدَيْهِ خُبْراً(( 91 ))

91- SO WAS IT; AND WE ENCOMPASSED BY KNOWLEDGE WHAT WAS (GOING ON) WITH
HIM.
