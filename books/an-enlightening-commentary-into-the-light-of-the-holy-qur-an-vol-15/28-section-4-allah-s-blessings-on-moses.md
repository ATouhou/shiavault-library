Section 4: Allah’s Blessings on Moses
=====================================

Surah As-Saffat – Verses 114-116
--------------------------------

***114. “We bestowed Our favour on Moses and Aaron.”***  
***115. “And We delivered them both and their people from the great
distress.”***  
***116. “And We helped them so that they were the victors (over their
enemies).”***

The remembrance of the graces and favours of Allah to the former Divine
prophets (as) was the cause of peace, comfort, encouragement and
consolation of the Prophet of Islam (S) and the Muslims in the terrible
circumstances of Mecca.

These verses refer to a part of the Divine favours unto Moses and his
brother, Aaron, and there are some discussions consistent with what was
formerly said about Noah and Abraham in the previous verses. The
contents of these verses are fairly similar to each other, and the words
are somehow harmonized so that they may arrange a firm training program
about the believers.

Again in these verses for the explanation of many events the style of
‘epitome and expansion’, which is the style of the Qur’an, has been
used.

At first, it says:

***“We bestowed Our favour on Moses and Aaron.”***

In Philology and the uses of the Qur’an, the Arabic term ***/minnat/***
has a vast meaning which includes bestowing the divine heavy bounties,
too.

However, in these verses Allah secretly gives the news of some worthy
and great favours which he granted to these two brothers; and in the
later verses He explains a few of these favours each of which is
worthier than the other.

In the second verse, Allah says:

***“And We delivered them both and their people from the great
distress.”***

What grief was greater than this that the Children of Israel were
captured in the grips of the cruel, blood-thirsty people of Pharaoh who
used to slaughter their sons and spared alive their females to serve
them and make their men work hard for them?

Yes, losing freedom and being involved in the grips of a cruel king who
had mercy neither on the children nor on the adults, and he even misused
the honour of the females of a nation, was a great distress and a heavy
grief. This was the first favour that Allah bestowed on the Children of
Israel.

Then, in the third verse, the Qur’an implies that Allah helped Moses and
Aaron and the Children of Israel so that they could win their powerful
enemies, on the day when the great blood-thirsty army of Pharaoh, and in
front of them Pharaoh himself, forcefully attacked them, the Children of
Israel were very weak and had not enough fighters and means of war to
fight against them, but the grace of Allah came to help them and buried
the troops of Pharaoh in the waves of the sea.

So the Children of Israel were delivered from great distress and He gave
the Pharaohs’ castles, wealth, gardens, and properties to them.

Surah As-Saffat – Verses 117-119
--------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَءَاتَيْنَاهُمَا الْكِتَابَ الْمُسْتَبِينَ
  </p>

<blockquote dir="rtl">

***117. “And We gave them both the Book making things clear.”***  
***118. “And We guided them both on the right way.”***  
***119. “And We left (praise) for them both among the later
generations.”***

The first is deliverance from that tyrant ruler, and then there is
invitation to the Book and Path of Allah.

These verses point to the favours and spiritual merits that Allah gave
to this group of people.

The Qur’an says:

***“And We gave them both the Book making things clear.”***

Yes, the Torah, the clear Book, was a Book which made things clear, and
answered all the religious and worldly needs of the Children of Israel
at that time; as in Surah Al-Ma’idah, No. 5, verse 44 we recite:

***“Verily We have sent down the Torah, wherein is guidance and
light…”***

And in the next verse it points to another spiritual merit, the merit of
guidance to the Straight Way, when it says:

***“And We guided them both on the right way.”***

It is the same right way which is far from any crookedness and deviation
and which is the way of the Divine prophets and there is not any line of
deviation, aberration and fall in it:

It is interesting that in all our prayers, when we ask Allah to guide us
to the straight Path, we say:

***“The path of those upon whom You have bestowed Your bounties, and not
(the path) of those inflicted with Your wrath, nor (of those) gone
astray.”***[^1]

And this is the path of prophets and saints.

In the third verse, it refers to the duration of the religious school
and their good name (praise) and says:

***“And We left (praise) for them both among the later generations.”***

This is the same meaning that the Qur’an mentioned in the former verses
about Abraham and Noah.

In principal, the history and the names of all men of Allah and those
who pave the great path of the right, are eternal and it must be so,
because they do not belong to a proper people or nation, but they belong
to the whole world of humanity.

Surah As-Saffat – Verses 120-122

***120. “Peace be on Moses and Aaron.”***  
***121. “Verily thus do We reward the doers of good.”***  
***122. “Verily they were both of Our faithful servants,”***

The godly men are alive and receive Allah’s greetings.

These verses refer to the greeting and peace of Allah to Moses and
Aaron, a salutation from the side of Allah, the Exalted, the Merciful, a
greeting which is the secret of health in religion and faith, in belief
and religious school, and in the right line and doctrine. It is a
greeting which denotes to the deliverance and security from the Divine
punishment in this world and the next.

It says:

***“Peace be on Moses and Aaron.”***

Through the next verse, Allah refers to the recompense and to His great
reward to them, and says:

***“Verily thus do We reward the doers of good.”***

If they obtained these honours, it is not undue. They were righteous.
They were faithful, sincere, and benevolent, and such ones must be given
all these rewards.

Finally, in the third verse, the Qur’an points to the same proof that
was formerly mentioned in the story of Abraham and Noah.

So, concerning Moses and Aaron, it says:

***“Verily they were both of Our faithful servants,”***

It is faith that makes man’s spirit so clear and strong that he goes
after kindness, benevolence, purity and virtuousness, a kindness which
opens the doors of Divine mercy to man, and brings kinds of blessings
down to him.

Surah As-Saffat – Verses 123-125

***123. “And verily Elyas was of the apostles.”***  
***124. “When he said to his people: ‘Will you not be in owe (of
Allah)?’”***  
***125. “Do you call on Ba‘l and abandon the best of the creators?”***

The fourth life story, which is mentioned in Surah, out of the life
stories of the former prophets, is the short biography of Elyas.

It says:

***“And verily Elyas was of the apostles.”***

There is no doubt that Elyas (as) is one of the prophets of Allah, and
the verse under discussion has explicitly stated this matter.

The name of this Divine prophet has been mentioned in two verses of the
Qur’an, once in this very Surah, As-Saffat, and the other one is
mentioned is Surah Al-’An‘am, No. 6, verse 85. However, there are
different stories and various matters about this Divine prophet recorded
in books.

You may refer to the commentary books of Majma‘-ul-Bayan, Al-Mizan,
Rauh-ul-Bayan, Al-Kabir by Fakhr-i-Razi, Fi-Zalal, ’A‘lam-ul-Qur’an, and
Encyclopaedia by Dehkhuda.

In the second verse, it implicitly announces that they ought to remember
the following event:

***“When he said to his people: ‘Will you not be in owe (of Allah)?’”***

This statement points to the subjects of godliness, avoiding from
polytheism and idolatry, from sins, injustice, and corruptions and from
whatever drives man into destruction.

With a more precision, in the third verse it says:

***“Do you call on Ba‘l and abandon the best of the creators?”***

It is understood from this verse that they had a famous idol by the name
of Ba‘l, in front of which they fell themselves in prostration, and
Elyas dissuaded them from that ugly action and invited them toward the
great Creator of the world and pure Unity.

It is for this reason that some commentators believe that the centre of
the activity of Elyas was Ba‘labak, one of the cities of Syria since the
name of that special idol was Ba‘l, and /bak/ meant ‘city’ and with the
combination of those two parts the word Ba‘lbak had been formed.

It has been said that this long idol had been so big that the length of
it was nearly twenty one meters and it had four faces with a few guards.

But some other commentators have not considered Ba‘l as the name of a
definite idol and they have taken it as the absolute name of idol, while
some others use it as the concept of Rabb (lord) and object of worship.
Raqib in Mufradat says:

*“Originally /ba‘l/ means husband, but Arabs use the objects by which
they drew nigh to God called Ba‘l.”*

***126. “Allah is your Lord and the Lord of fathers of old.”***  
***127. “But they belied him, therefore they shall certainly be brought
(to Hell).”***  
***128. “Except for Allah’s sincere servants;”***  
***129. “And We left (praise) for him among the later generations.”***

The comparison of an idol and Allah makes any conscience awake, Elyas
seriously reprimanded this idol worshipping nation, and reminded them
that they had left the Lord Who is their Lord and the Lord of their
fathers.

He told them He had been the Owner and Lord of all of them, and any
blessing they had was from Him, and solution of any problem is possible
by His Might, and besides Him, there is neither any source of goodness
and favour nor any remover of vice and impediment.

It seems that, similar to the idol worshippers of the time of the
Prophet of Islam (S), the idol worshippers of the time of Elyas, in
order to justify their own deed, relied on the tradition of their
ancestors, and in answer to them, Elyas says:

***“Allah is your Lord and the Lord of fathers of old.”***

The application of the Arabic word ***/rabb/*** is the best motive for
contemplation and thinking, since the most important matter in a man’s
life is this fact that he knows from the side of whom he has been
created and now who is his authorized one, his lord, and his benefactor.

In the next verse the Qur’an implies that this obstinate and self-loving
group of people did not hearken to the reasonable advices and clear
guidance of this Divine great prophet and they belied him.

The verse says:

***“But they belied him…”***

So, Allah has stated their punishment in a short sentence where the
Qur’an continues saying:

***“…therefore they shall certainly be brought (to Hell).”***

In Hereafter, they will be called in the Divine court of Justice and
then brought into the chastisement of the Hell where they will receive
the retribution of their ugly and evil deeds.

The third verse indicates that a small group of people, who were
sincere, pure and righteous, believed in Elyas, and in order that their
right would not be wasted.

The verse immediately after it says:

***“Except for Allah’s sincere servants;”***

And in the fourth verse, Allah says:

***“And We left (praise) for him among the later generations.”***

Later generations will never forget the utmost efforts of these great
prophets in guarding the line of Monotheism and growing the seed of
faith, and their remembrance and their school of thought will be alive
as long as the world exists.

***130. “Peace be on ’Ilyasin (Elyas).”***  
***131. “Verily thus do We reward the doers of good.”***  
***132. “Verily he was (one) of Our faithful servants.”***

We must learn from Allah (s.w.t.) how to greet to Divine prophets, the
great friends of Allah.

This verse says:

***“Peace be on ’Ilyasin (Elyas).”***

The application of the term ’Ilyasin instead of Elyas is either for the
sake that ’Ilyasin was a word inside the term Elyas and both of them
have the same meaning; or it refers to Elyas and his followers which has
been used in this total form.

***“Verily thus do We reward the doers of good.”***

Here the purpose of righteousness and kindness is in their vast meaning
which envelops both performing all His laws and commandments and then
struggling against any kind of polytheism, deviation, sin and mischief.

And in the third verse it refers to the main root of all of these things
which is faith.

Concerning Elyas, it says:

***“Verily he was (one) of Our faithful servants.”***

Faith and servitude is the origin of kindness, and kindness causes that
one may be involved in the row of the sincere ones and be addressed with
the greeting of Allah.

***133. “And verily Lot was (one) of the Envoys.”***  
***134. “When We delivered him and his people all.”***  
***135. “Except an old woman among those that tarried.”***  
***136. “Then We destroyed the rest.”***

The life story of the people of Lot is a gazing-stock for all. In these
verses the life story of Lot (as) has been reiterated as an instructive
lesson.

According to the explicit statement of the Qur’an, Lot was contemporary
with Abraham and he was one of great prophets of Allah. Lot’s name has
been mentioned in many verses of the Qur’an, and both he and his people
have repeatedly been discussed in it, and the painful fate of this
deviated nation, in particular, has been explained in the clearest form.

The first verse says:

***“And verily Lot was (one) of the Envoys.”***

In the second verse, after this short statement, base on the style of
epitome and expansion that the Qur’an has, it refers to a part of his
event in order to be remembered, and says:

***“When We delivered him and his people all.”***

And, in the third and fourth verses, it continues saying:

***“Except an old woman among those that tarried.”***

***“Then We destroyed the rest.”***

The above mentioned short sentences point to the history of every
adventure of this nation the explanations of them were stated in the
verses of Suras: Hud, No. 11, Ash-Shu‘ara, No. 26, and Al-‘Ankabut, No.
29.

Like other Divine prophets, Lot began his invitation with Monotheism,
and then he applied his utmost struggle against the corruptions of the
society, specially against the same famous ethical deviation, their act
of homosexuality, the disgrace of which is known throughout of history.

This great prophet suffered very much and he did his best for the
improvement of this deviated nation and he did whatever he could to
hinder them from their ugly shameful deeds, but he failed and got no
positive result. There were, of course, a few people who believed in him
and very quickly they went out from that polluted environment.

At last, Lot became hopeless of them and decided to pray and asked for
the deliverance of his own self and his family from Allah. So He
accepted his invocation and delivered that small group save his wife,
the same old woman who not only did not follow his teachings but also
helped his enemies.

Allah sent the most grievous punishments for that nation. At first, He
destroyed their cities and then He caused a rain of pebbles to be rained
over them in a form that all of them were annihilated and even their
bodies were effaced.

***137. “And verily you pass by them in the morning.”***  
***138. “And at night; do you not then understand?”***

Both deliverance and destruction are in the power of Allah.

This verse declares that every morning you usually pass by their ruined
cities and you see what kind of fate they afflicted with.

The verse says:

***“And verily you pass by them in the morning.”***

Of course, these things are as a preparation for awakening the proud
neglect ones.

And, in the next verse, it says:

***“And at night; do you not then understand?”***

This statement is for the sake that the cities of the people of Lot were
located alongside the way of the caravans of the people of Arabia toward
Syria and, in their travelling, these people used to pass by them both
day and night.

If they had a spiritual ear they would hear the painful cries of this
sinful afflicted people, because the ruins of their cities, by a mute
tongue, teach all the passengers and make them aware of being afflicted
in the grips of some other events similar to them.

Yes, there are a lot of lessons for taking example, but those who may
take an example are few.

Ali (as) says:

*“How many are the objects of lessons, but how few the taking of
lessons.”*[^2]

There is a narration from Imam Sadiq (as) who, in answer to the question
about the commentary of these verses, said:

*“When you are reciting the verses of the Qur’an you pass by them. The
Qur’an reiterates the news which Allah has stated for you.”*[^3]
