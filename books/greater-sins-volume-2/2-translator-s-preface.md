Translator’s Preface
====================

**In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate the Merciful**

Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds and benedictions upon the
Messenger of Allah and his Purified Progeny (a.s.)

By the Grace of the Almighty, the first volume of “Greater Sins” has
been completed in English.

The significance of Moral Science and Ethics is evident from the words
of the Messenger of Allah (S) when he has described the aim of his
advent. He said, “I have been sent for perfecting the morals.”

The learned Ālim, Ayatullah Dastghaib was one of the greatest
Muallim-ul-akhlaq (Teacher of Moral Science). Some of his important
books are Gunahane Kabira, Qalbe Salīm, Mā’ad, Barzakh etc. His books
cover various moral and ethical issues.

The book Gunahane Kabira deals with Greater Sins. Ayatullah Dastghaib
has exhaustively explained the phenomenon of sin, the classification of
sins, and the necessity of avoiding them. He has also described fifty
different types of Greater Sins.

Although the English translation is based on the Urdu Edition, I have
relied upon the original Arabic text while translating traditions and
Qur’anic verses.

Since the English equivalents of Islamic terminology do not convey the
exact meaning, I have used the Arabic terms. However those who are not
conversant with Arabic words may refer to the Glossary of Islamic Terms.

Wassalam.
