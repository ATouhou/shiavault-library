Section Two: Rights and Obligations
===================================

**In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent the Merciful**

Amirul-Mu'minin Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a) said:

“Right is the most comprehensive in description and the narrowest in
equity; whenever it be for the good of somebody in a situation, it will
surely be against him in another, and whenever it be against somebody in
a definite situation, it will be for his good in another. If it
incessantly flows in the good of somebody, that somebody must have been
exclusively Allah, not any of His creatures, because Allah is
All-powerful over His servants and just with all those upon whom His
acts are imposed.

But He has made His right, which is imposed upon His creatures, is that
they must obey Him, and made the requital of that obedience as
duplicated rewards, out of His grace and large favor that He is worthy
of. He, the Praised, then made some of His rights imposed on some people
for others; hence, He made them equivalent in their aspects, and made
them necessitate each other, and made the obligation of some depend
totally upon others.”
