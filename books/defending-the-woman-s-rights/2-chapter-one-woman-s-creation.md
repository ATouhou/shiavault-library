Chapter One : Woman's Creation
==============================

Woman's soul and body is created from the same essence as man is. In
fact, there is no difference between the reality of man and woman. The
Holy Qur'an explicitly mentions this fact when saying:

(0 People! Be careful of your duty to your Lord, Who created you from a
single being and created its mate of the same kind), 1 and (He it is Who
created you from a single being, and of the same (kind) did He made his
mate that he might incline to her), 2 and (And one of His signs is that
He created mates for you from yourselves that you may find rest in
them). 3

So, woman's creation is from the same essence as man's creation, just
as the Prophets (a.s.) arc human beings and selected from among humans
themselves.

The Qur'an says, (Certainly Allah conferred a great favor upon the
believers when He raised among them a Messenger from among
themselves).4

The sameness of man and woman is a theme easily acquired from the
Qur'anic verses. There is only one other

2 Qur'an, 7:189.

viewpoint in this regard that considers woman as an addition to man's
creation. This is derived from some traditions of the Prophet's
Household (a.s), but it is rejected by Imam Sadiq (a.s).

Zurara narrated, "Once, Imam Sadiq (a.s) was asked about the creation
of Eve and that some people believed that the Almighty Allah created her
from Adam's lower left rib, and the Imam (a.s) said, 'The Almighty is
beyond doing so. Those who hold this view think that Allah could not
create a wife for Adam, but from his rib. What do they mean? They let
others make excuses in this regard. May Allah judge between us and them
all!' Then the Imam (a.s) said, The Almighty Allah created Adam from
soil and ordered the angels to prostrate before His creation. Then He
made Adam sleep deeply, and created a new being for him ... The new
being moved and Adam was awakened by her movement. He saw a pretty
creation just like himself, except that she was a woman ... Then Adam
said: '0 Allah! Who is this beautiful being to whom I am inclined?'
Allah replied: 'This is My servant Eve' ..." 1

Allama Majlisi says, "It is common among some historians and tradition
narrators that Eve was created from Adam's rib, but some other
traditions reject it." 2

Then Allama Majlisi narrates an exegesis discussion from Abul Fotuh
ar-Razi. Ar-Razi in the exegesis of the Qur'anic verse (0 People! Be
careful of your duty to your Lord, Who created you from a single being
and created its mate of the same kind), 3 has said, "By this mate, Eve
is

meant. There are two views on Eve's creation; the first is that Eve was
formed from Adam's rib, and the second is that Adam's wife was created
from the same essence. And this verse is like another one that says:
(And Allah made wives for you from among yourselves)1 or (Certainly a
messenger came to you from among yourselves)."2

Then, Allama Majlisi says, "The creation from the same essence means
from the same father and it does not nullify the presence of a mother,
as a requirement ..."

There is another possibility about the word (min; 3 from) that it may
be a causative preposition. In other words, it means that "He created
wives for you ..."4 This second view is in accord with Imam Sadiq's view
that woman has an independent creation just like man.

**Chapter Two : Woman's Perfection**

In the Qur'anic view, woman can reach perfection, just as man can. The
Holy Qur'an explicitly states that she can go to ascension via awareness
and good deeds. Anytime there is reference in the Qur'anic verses about
human perfection, women are pointed out along men:

(Surely the men who submit and the women who submit, and the believing
men and the believing women, and the obeying men and the obeying women,
and the truthful men and the truthful women, and the patient men and the
patient women, and the humble men and the humble women, and the
almsgiving men and the almsgiving women, and the fasting men and the
fasting women, and the men who guard their private parts and the women
who guard, and the men who remember Allah much and the women who
remember; Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a mighty reward.
1

In this verse, submission, belief, truthfulness, patience, humbleness,
fasting, chastity, and remembrance of Allah are mentioned in the same
way for man and woman. Both of them can equally reach these heavenly
positions.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 Qur'an, 33:35.

(So their Lord accepted their prayer: That I will not waste the work of
a worker among you, whether male or female, the one of you being from
the other). 1

(And whoever does good deeds whether male or female and he (or she) is
a believer; these shall enter the paradise and they shall not be dealt
with a jot unjustly). 2

In this verse, the unity of man and woman is justified, that an
attempter should get reward as much as his/her attempt. Allah is beyond
differentiating between the efforts of man and woman.

(And whoever does good deeds whether male or female while he (or she)
is a believer; We will most certainly make him live a happy life, and We
will most certainly give them their reward for the best of what they
did.) 3

This verse mentions the sameness of worldly rewards for good deeds of
man and woman. In other words, good deeds of any servant receive equal
rewards in this world and the Hereafter.

It should be pointed out that other Qur'anic verses about human
perfection include both man and woman, though they are stated with
masculine pronouns. Statements such as (0 You who believe!) 4 means '0
People!' and refer to both men and women.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 Qur'an, 3: 195.
2 Qur'an, 4: 124.
3 Qur'an, 16: 97.

4 In Arabic, it recites as masculine.

**Chapter Three : Woman's Reason**

The Holy Qur'an knows woman as a human, possessing all human qualities
and all necessary capabilities of a human being. Nothing about
deficiency in woman's mind has been mentioned in the Qur'an at all.
Rather, as pointed out earlier, man and woman are equal to Qur'an in
terms of reaching perfection, which is only possible through deep
understanding. However, some traditions introduce woman as less
intelligent than man. Some points worth mentioning in this regard.

a. Low intelligence and inadequate cognition is attributed to many
people and social classes by Islam, either men or women, for instance:

Pride and arrogance is an indication of stupidity.

Imam Ali (a.s.) says, "One's self conceit is the sign of his lack of
reason." 1

One, who accompanies the stupid, would lose his own reason. 2

Not listening to the wise kills reason. 3

Wastefulness wipes out reason.4

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 Al-Hayat, 1/180;
Persian translation 1/304.
2 Imam Ali's tradition, Bihar Al-Anwar, 1/160.
3 Ibid.
4 Imam Ali's tradition, Mizan Al-Hikma, 6/431.

Pride and self-deceit decreases reason. 1

One who loves something excessively would suffer from folly. 2

Lustfulness destroys brain. 3

A wise man keeps calm in anger; otherwise, he is foolish. 4

One who always does nonsense is unwise. 5

Such guidelines are for awakening people, so that they know and
overcome obstacles and try to perfect their wisdom. 6

Some other groups of people, on the other hand, are considered wise and
even possessing complete cognition, either men or women.

A wise person seeks perfection and an unwise one seeks wealth. 7

A wise person judges his own opinion, not relying on what he likes. 8

A wise individual acts as to his cognition. 9

No wisdom is more valuable than opposing whims and desires. 10

tradition, Bihar Al-Anwar, 78/186.

6 The important topic of "to know obstacles" is discussed in chapter 41
of Al-Hayat 1/294-312.
7 Tradition of Imam Ali (a.s), Mizan Al-Hikma 6/ 414.
8 Ibid.
9 Ibid.
10 Tradition of Imam al-Baqir (a.s), Bihar Al-Anwar 78/ 229.

A wise person is religious and faithful. 1

Humbleness before the truth and accepting it is the highest degree of
wisdom.2

Such statements do not concern innate human folly; rather they refer to
cultural and social effects on human wisdom. One's background,
education, and lifestyle may prepare the necessary conditions for
his/her growth and materialization of innate capabilities. Any kind of
shortcoming in these aspects, on the other hand, would harm human
abilities, and even completely destroy a certain aptitude. The
traditions about mindlessness have considered this doubtless issue.

Another issue is worth considering about human mind; wisdom is
mentioned as accompanying faith in some traditions.

The Prophet of Islam (a.s.) says, (Surely, goodness is obtained by
wisdom. He has no faith, one who has no reason.) 3

Imam as-Sadiq (a.s.) says, (He, who is wise, is faithful.) 4

Imam al-Kadhim (a.s.) says, (0 Hisham! The Almighty selected His
prophets so that people accept His religion wisely. Therefore, those who
understand the religion more wisely accept the prophets' invitation
well. And whoever is more aware of Allah's religion, is wiser than
others ...) 5

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 Tradition of Imam
as-Sadiq (a.s), Al-Hayat 1/113.
2 Tradition of Imam al-Kadhim (a.s), Al-Hayat 1/114.
3 Al-Hayat 1/49, Persian translation 1/77.
4 Ibid., 1/113, Persian translation 1/189.
5 Ibid., 1/135; Persian translation 1/227.

Keeping in mind these teachings as well as the Qur'anic verses
referring to the faithful women, as equal to faithful men, it becomes
clear that women possess the kind of reason necessary for high-rank
faithfulness. So anywhere that true faith, humbleness before Allah,
chastity, and worship exist, reason and human wisdom inevitably exist.

Therefore, woman's mindlessness, referred to in some traditions, may
mean the momentary state caused by human negligence. As these passing
states are related to behavioral factors, they can be changed by a
change in behavior, thus regaining the innate human nature. For
instance, one who suffers from pride and despotism may lose reason. Then
if these vices are wiped out by training and refinement of the soul, the
barriers of thoughtfulness are removed, and thus the human mind regains
its capacity and guides man.

According to what has preceded, woman's folly referred to in some
traditions is related to the contemporary women who were less engaged in
intellectual issues and they only thought of their female aspects. The
mentioned traditions hence do not refer to woman's permanent nature.

Some descriptions of certain people or social classes are commonly seen
in traditions that are related to changeable dispositions, just as
common as these changeable states in traditions are sometimes
interpreted as natural ones by mistake.

To make the point clearer, a tradition from Imam Ali (a.s) follows.
Imam Ali (a.s) said, "Women are not pious when in need and not patient
with their lust. Cosmetics are necessary for them even if they are old.
They are arrogant and proud even if they are disabled ... anyway, treat
them kindly and speak with them well that they may improve their
behaviors." 1

The last phrase of Imam Ali's statement indicates that the mentioned
vices are not permanent innate ones; rather they are caused by women's
milieu and education. Otherwise, the Imam would not say, "Treat them
kindly that they may improve their behaviors."

In fact, these faults are due to inadequate education and improper
culture of the society. They can be changed by kindly reactions.
Therefore, by the term 'mindlessness' in traditions, it is meant the
improper effect of society's culture on women.

b. Perhaps, the lack of reason implies the different brain weights of
man and woman that is a reality about these two human kinds. 2 It is
also proved by scientific researches that women's emotional intelligence
is stronger. But this is not a weak point for woman; rather, it is an
important necessity for her motherhood tasks. Woman's emotion plays a
more central role in children's personality development and family's
warm environment than man's strict mind-governed role. This quality
diverts woman from complex intellectual issues to make the family warm
and lovely.

c. If one or some traditions contain a certain controversial issue, it
should be scrutinized to see if there are other contrasting traditions
or verses. If the tradition's document is correct and no contrasting
traditions are found,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 Wasa'il ash-Shi'a,
14/130.

2 The brain developmental period is also different in boys and girls:
"... brain size increases in 10 or 11 years of age. Then it partially
stops in girls, but continues gradually in boys." Lotfabadi, H. (1373).
Growth Psychology. P. 74. Tehran, Samt Publications.

the principle of "ta'adol wa tarjih" (balance and preference) 1, a
principle of Osul filed, should be followed. Perhaps, after expert
studies it is found that there is in fact no contrast. However, there
may be two traditions or a tradition and a Qur'anic verse that are
labeled as 'general' and 'specific', 'absolute' and 'provisional' and so
on. Also, two traditions may be about two separate subjects or about two
states of the same subject. In these cases, there remains no contrast.
Finally, if a tradition is in total contrast with the meaning of a
Qur'anic verse and they are by no means compatible, the tradition is
ignored, clue to its contrast to Allah's words. As a result, surface
incompatibility cannot be regarded true contrast without careful
investigation.

It should, of course, be kept in mind that this is a completely
specialist job done by precise standards. Not everyone can nullify a
tradition because of his/her own criteria.

In investigating about the tradition of 'woman's folly', it does not
seem compatible with the Qur'anic verses. Nowhere in the Holy Qur'an
there is a mention to such an issue; rather, woman and man are mentioned
equally in case of good and bad conditions, as was pointed out in the
section of 'woman's perfection'.

Moreover, the mentioned tradition is not in accord with another
tradition of Imam Ali (a.s) in Nahjol Balagha :

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 According to these
two principles, if a tradition is in balance with another one or a
Qur'anic verse, it is accepted. If, on the other hand, two traditions
are not in accord with each other, the one that is more preferred should
be accepted (translator).

"Avoid consulting with women, except women whose reason has been
tried." 1

Therefore, the traditions containing 'woman's folly' and traditions
like the one just mentioned are "Itlaq wa Taqyeed' (absolute and
limitation acceptance) and the former are rejected. Therefore, Imam
Ali's tradition does not include all women, but some exceptions. Today,
however, those exceptions are more than those days, and perhaps they are
the majority.

Another tradition is narrated from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that refers to
women's exceptional cognition.

"So many women who may have more religious understanding than men
have."

This is not equal cognition of men and women, but the occasional
superiority of women. This tradition will be discussed in later
chapters, too.
