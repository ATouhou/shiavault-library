Lesson Fifty Seven: The Real Religious Men Are Few
==================================================

Imam Husayn (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلنّاسُ عَبيْدُ الدُّنْيا وَ الدِّينُ لَعِقٌ عَلَى أَلْسِنَتِهِمْ
يَحُوطُونَهُ ما دَرَّتْ بِهِ مَعايِشُهُمْ فَإذا مُحِّصُوا بِالْبَلاءِ
قَلَّ الدَّيآنُونَ!
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Most of the people are servants of the materialistic world and only pay
lip service to religion. As long as they are enjoying a good life under
the grace of religion, they support it. But when they are tested with
hardships, only a few are found to be religious.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Religion, particularly a religion like Islam, preserves the rights of
society’s people and supports their real and fair interests. However,
sometimes religion is a barrier for personal and private interests of
individuals. This is when those who are true to their religion are
distinguished from those who only make empty claim to be religious.

Most people look at things from the viewpoint of their own interests .
They advocate religion when it preserves their personal rights but when
it conflicts with their private interests, they leave it totally or take
a selective approach …“ we believe in some and disbelieve in the
others”.

The real religious people are those few who are faithful to their
religion in every situation, and religion and belief dictate their
priorities in life, not personal interests.
