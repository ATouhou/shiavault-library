Who is a faqih?
===============

A faqih or mujtahid or Ayatollah is the one who has the quality of
ijtihad. Technically, ijtihad means 'the process of deriving religious
rulings from their religious sources'. For example, it is the role of
such person to discover Islamic view on banking or politics or
international relations. Of course, the procedure is very
sophisticated.32 Sometimes for one single*fatwa* (edict) to be issued,
ijtihad might involve weeks of enquiry and investigation of religious
sources. Obviously ijtihad must be based on revelation and reason.33
