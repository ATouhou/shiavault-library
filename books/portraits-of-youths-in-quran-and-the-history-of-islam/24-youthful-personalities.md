Youthful Personalities
======================

### From The Time Of The Holy Imams Till The Occultation Of The Last Imam

In this part, first of all I would mention the period in which the
luminous faces of the holy personalities had illuminated the world.
After that we would throw some light on the life of some of these
personages and then move ahead. We would also write therein, about the
brilliant personalities, firm like rocks, who were the ardent followers
of the Holy Imams.

In this section we shall write about those young personalities who are
considered the successors of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) by the Shia
people of the world.
