##### In the name of Allah

*(He it is Who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of
truth, that He might cause it to prevail over all religions, though the
polytheists may be averse).*

Qur'an, 9:33

*(Certainly a Messenger has come to you from among yourselves; grievous
to him is your falling into distress, excessively solicitous respecting
you; to the believers is he most kind and merciful).*

Qur'an, 9:128

*(And We have not sent you but to all mankind as a bearer of good news
and as a warner, but most mankind do not know).*

Qur'an, 34:28

*(He it is Who raised among the inhabitants of Mecca a Messenger from
among themselves, who recites to them His communications and purifies
them, and teaches them the Book and the Wisdom, although they were
before certainly in clear error).*

Qur'an, 62:2

*(And We have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds).*

Qur'an, 21:107

*To the builder of the human civilization,*

*The loftiest savior,*

*The greatest liberator of manâ€™s will and behavior,*

*To him who has destroyed the beliefs of ignorance and turned them into
refuse,*

*To the master of the prophets; the great messenger of Allah (may Allah
have blessings on him and on his progeny),*

*I offer this effort about his life which has illuminated the universe
with the high values and principles, hoping it will receive acceptance
and mercy from our Lord.*
