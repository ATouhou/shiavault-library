Kharijite's Doctrine of Caliphate
=================================

**( 107 )**

The only concept of Kharijites attracting the modem revisionists is
their theory about the Caliphate. They had a democratic ideology. They
said, "Caliphate should be achieved by election. The best qualified to
it is the one who has the qualities of faith and reticence. May be he is
a Qureishite or non-Qureishite. May be he is from a notable or an
insignificant and backward tribe, or is an Arab or a non-Arab".

If after election or receiving the allegiance, he (the Caliph) acts
contrary to the interests of Islamic society, he is to be dismissed from
Caliphate, and if he refuses to do so, war must be waged against him
till he is killed.

They stand in opposition to the Shiahs who say that Caliphate is
pre-ordained by Allah and the Caliph is appointed by God alone. They
stand in opposition to Sunnis as well who say that the Caliphate is only
for the Qureishites and adhere to (the tradition that) "The Imams must
be from the Qureish".

Obviously their idea about the Caliphate, is not contemporaneous with
their origin. Rather it proceeds from their famous slogan," (Command is
from none except Allah)". They were originally adherents of the view
that the people and society do not stand in need of an Imam or a
government they should of themselves follow the Book of Allah.

But subsequently they retraced and they themselves confided allegiance
in Abdullah bin Wahb Raasbee.
