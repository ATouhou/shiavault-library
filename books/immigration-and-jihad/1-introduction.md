Introduction
============

If we had come across this book twenty or thirty years ago, we would not
have paid much attention to it. This is particularly true in the current
climate where foreign lands, especially the Western world, have become
the residence of millions of Muslims, the majority of whom have left
their homelands to escape persecution and save their faith.

Therefore, immigration and jihad have become among the important topics
that occupy the minds of Muslims in this time and age. It is not only
because the subject is subtle, but a source of worldly aggravation.

It is for these reasons that we have decided to translate it into
English, to make it an addition to the Mutahhari series published by Dar
Al-Hadi, London, which has been created as a result of consultation with
Hujjatul Islam as-Sayyid Jawad ash-Shahristani, the Chairman of Alul
Bayt (a.s.) Foundation for Reviving the Heritage.

It has been decided that the translation of this work be among the first
books that deserve to be translated, not only because it is an important
one, but because of its significance among the circles of young men and
women.

In the end, I pray to the Almighty to bestow success on us in both this
world and the hereafter. I would like to express my gratitude to Najim
al-Khafaji for his translation and Hayder al-Khoee for his help.
