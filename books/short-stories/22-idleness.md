Idleness
========

This was a period of inactivity. Thank God, it did not last long. Now
that I see my end approaching, before the fulfillment of my aim, which
is to worship for the sake of Allah, I feel sad about that period of
idleness. Man's life is worthless, unless it is devoted to work for the
sake of Allah, the Almighty. How despicable idleness is! How

strange that man is careless of his religious duties and neglects
religious rituals! Now, I feel those past days blame me for neglecting
them. They are sorry for having passed by without the performance of
anything but the ordinary duties. Nothing more has been recorded in the
pages of good deeds. Those days are ashamed to demand Allah's pleasure,
on the Day of Judgment. What can I do? Whatever passed away won't come
back. I should have made up for those days later. I know that one's days
are counted. I wonder if I did my best. Only Allah the Almighty knows
that.
