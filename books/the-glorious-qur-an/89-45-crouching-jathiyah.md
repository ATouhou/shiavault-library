45: Crouching (jathiyah)
========================

This chapter was revealed after the previous one called Smoke 44 and
before the next one, The Dunes 46, thus continuing the sequence. It
contains four sections of 37 late Meccan verses, except for V. 14 which
dates from the Madinese period.

The title is to be found in V.28 (IV). There is much moral teaching in
this chapter, especially in section II.
