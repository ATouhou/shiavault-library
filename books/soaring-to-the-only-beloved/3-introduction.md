Attention is the concomitant of conversation. Every sound human being
enjoys attention when transmitting his thoughts to his addressee. Such
attention neither requires laborious thought processes nor any kind of
exertion for the control of the movement of the mind. When one wishes to
convey something, the mind translates it to its respective words and the
tongue reveals the same. One, however, would need to bridle his tongue
to avoid uttering all what is forbidden or futile.

Most of the speech in prayer is from a Divine source, and hence bridling
does not make any sense. Instead, the *musalli* is required to ensure
that his attention is continuously focused on the act of worship or the
Worshipped One, and that the words of his prayer originate from the
depths of his heart and the heights of his mind.

This is where many are overcome by the bird of imagination, which has
habituated itself to fly from one branch of the tree of material
attachments to another. Consequently, the worshipper gets deprived of
the progress and spiritual development he could acquire through this
most effective means of attaining God's proximity.

It is difficult for one to immediately achieve and maintain this
praiseworthy and necessary state of attention in prayer. One has to
cross certain levels of attention before enjoying a natural conversation
with the Beloved.

In the present treatise we shall briefly try to discuss the following
vital issues concerning attention in prayer:
