The Manifestation of the Divine Wrath after the Murder of Imam Hussain (Q)
==========================================================================

It was not long for the Devine Manifestation, for the death of Imam
Hussain (Q), to be reflected on all the mirrors of the worlds of
creations in many various and marvelous universal terminologies.

This anger was shown on earth, in the sky, by plants and animals, in the
sea, and on land. In some regions, people knew the reason behind such
signs, while in other regions, people had no idea what was going on.
Thus, it was known between Muslims, indeed they enormously agreed upon
the origin of such universal changes. Many historians stated some of
these changes, and here is some of it2 : The sky rained thick blood, any
stone lifted in Jerusalem, was ought to find thick blood under it, the
blackening and crying of the sky, and other facts that no Muslim can
deny.
