Dedication
==========

This work is dedicated to the lady who holds the distinction of being
the Leader of the Women of all of the Worlds â€“ from the first to the
last - Lady Fatima Zahra, peace be upon her.

Fatima Zahra has the honor of being the only surviving child of the
final Messenger of Allah, and as such her status is even further
elevated as it is through her that the lineage of the Prophet continues
until the end of time.

May Allah accept this humble effort from all of those involved in this
project, and may He make this book the means through which Fatima Zahra,
peace be upon her, finds us worthy of her intercession on the Day of
Judgment.
