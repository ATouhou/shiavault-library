Letter 37
=========

"Wali" is a Linguistic Denominator; so, Where is the Text?
----------------------------------------------------------

**Thul-Hijjah 29, 1329**

The word "wali" is a common denominator between the supporter and the
friend, the loved one and the brother-in-law, the follower, the ally,
and the neighbour. Whoever takes charge of a matter is its "wali." The
ahadith you have qouted may simply mean: â€˜Ali is your supporter, or
friend, or loved one, after the Prophet; so, where is the text which you
claim?

Sincerely,

*S*
