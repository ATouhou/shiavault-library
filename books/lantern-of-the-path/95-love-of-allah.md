Love of Allah
=============

   
 When love of Allah takes possession of the innermost being of Allah's
bondsman, it empties him of every preoccupation except remembrance of
Allah. The lover is the most inwardly sincere of all people for Allah.
He is the most truthful in his words, the most faithful in his pledge,
the most astute in his actions, the purest in remembrance, and the
greatest in devoting his self in worship.  
    
 The angels compete with each other to converse with him, and boast of
having seen him. Through him Allah makes His lands flourish, and by His
regard, Allah honours His slaves. Allah gives to people when they ask
Him by his right, and removes afflictions from them by His mercy. If
people knew how they stand with Allah, they would not try to draw near
to Allah save by the dust of his feet.  
    
 The Commander of the Faithful said, 'Love of Allah is a fire which does
not pass by anything without burning it up; the light of Allah does not
come over something without illuminating it.  
    
 The skies of Allah do not cause a cloud to appear without it covering
whatever is beneath it; the wind of Allah does not blow on something
without it moving. Allah's water gives life to everything, and from
Allah's earth everything grows. Whoever loves Allah is given every
possession and authority.'  
    
 The Holy Prophet said, 'When Allah loves a slave in my community, He
casts love of him into the hearts of His friends, the spirits of the
angels and the keepers of His throne, so that they love him.’  
    
 That lover truly has an abundance of bliss, and will be able to
intercede with Allah on the Day of Resurrection.'
