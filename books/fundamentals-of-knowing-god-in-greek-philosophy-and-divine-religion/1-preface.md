Preface
=======

**In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful**

The book that is with you, is the general layout of “Divine Theology”
and the “Theology of Greek Philosophy.”

In this research, effort has been made to discuss and compare the
genuine foundations and basic fundamentals of Knowing God and the ways
of gaining the knowledge of God in Divine Religions and in Greek
Philosophy.

Studying this book will bring us near to the view that the monotheistic
religions have exhibited a “new logic” in the “*Ma’rifat* (knowledge,
gnosis) of God” which the like of has never been found in the human
sciences.

Here, I consider it my duty to thank the respected Master and Faqih, the
commentator of Qur’an and the diver in the (sea) of gnostic knowledge of
Holy Imams, Hazrat Ayatullah Mirza Muhammad Baqir Miyaangi for this
reason that I have reaped benefits from him which has been reflected in
this present book.
