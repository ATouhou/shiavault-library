Preface
=======

This is the 3rd volume in this series contains answers to questions
asked from January, 1972 to March, 1975. These questions cover a wide
range of burning topics of modern times.

The popularity of the 1st two volumes has convinced us of the
usefulness of this venture; and the Mission hopes that this volume will
be even more widely read.

These questions were received from correspondents residing in East
Africa, UK, Europe, Canada, USA, Pakistan and India. We have omitted the
names for obvious reason. This series is published for the benefit of
our Shia Ithna-aseri youths.

The Mission is grateful to Mr.Murtaza Bandali, Dar-es-Salaam, for his
help in checking the proof and making useful suggestions.
