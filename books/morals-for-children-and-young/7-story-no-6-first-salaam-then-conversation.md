Story no.6: First Salaam, then conversation
===========================================

“How are you?” Qasim asked his school friend, Ali.  
 Ali didn’t answer him.  
 “Why didn’t you answer me?” asked Qasim.  
 Ali replied “Because you didn’t greet me (with a salaam) first. Don’t
you know that you should do that first and then your conversation?

Yes, one of the etiquettes and morals of Islam is that when ever we meet
each other one should first greet with salaam and the other should reply
to it.
