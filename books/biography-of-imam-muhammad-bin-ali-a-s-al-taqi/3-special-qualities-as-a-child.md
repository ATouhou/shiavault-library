Special Qualities As a Child
============================

Over and above Imam Reza's introduction of Imam Taqi (A.S.) to the
followers, there was also one special quality that Allah had given to
Imam Taqi (A.S.) that made him acceptable as Imam of his time despite
his young age; this quality was his unique intelligence. To see this
quality' at work, consider the following incident.

After Imam Reza's martyrdom, Mamoon Rashid decided to call Imam Taqi
(A.S.) to Baghdad so as to silence those who believed that he had caused
Imam Reza's death.

Imam Taqi (A.S.) came to Baghdad and his first meeting with Mamoon
occurred in a Bazaar of Baghdad.

Imam (A.S.) was in the streets of Baghdad when Mamoon accompanied by
his choicest friends and generals passed by, riding fast-running horses,
All children who were playing in the streets ran away, fearing mischief
from the Royal procession. The Imam (A.S.), however, stood fearlessly
watching the King and his entourage.

Mamoon had not yet met the Imam (A.S.) and therefore did not recognise
him as such. But he could not help observing the charm and the courage
of the Imam (A.S.). He stopped his horse, and inquired.

"Young man, what made you stand here fearlessly when all other children
of your age ran away in fear of the running horses?" The Imam (A.S.)
replied without any hesitation.

HWhy would I want to run away when there is enough passage for you and
your horses to pass by and when I have done nothing wrong to fear
reprisals from you?"

The child's perfect manners and eloquence stunned Mamoon. He asked in
bewilderment. "Whose son are you, young man?" "I am Muhammad the son of
Ali Bin Musa," replied the chold.

Mamoon went away on his hunting expedition, full of thoughts about what
he had seen and heard.

As part of his hunting exercise, Mamoon set-free in the air hunting
falcons. One of the falcons returned carrying a live fish in its beak.
This was not usual. For how could a fish be in the air to be hunted by a
falcon? Mamoon was a quick-thinking person. He thought of an idea and
hid the fish in his palms.

On his way back, he met Imam Taqi (A.S.) again. Mamoon dismounted from
his horse, came near the Imam (A.S.) and said. "O the son of Prophet!
Can you tell me what is hidden in my closed palm?"

The Imam (A.S.) replied, "Allah has created seas and rivers and other
water bodies. In them live fishes. Sometimes, as a result of strong
currents, some small fishes are pulled into the air, and become a prey
of hunting falcons.

Kings hide the fish in their palms to test the knowledge of the
children of the Prophet." Mamoon was very much impressed by the Imam's
superb reply and took him to his palace.

Such display of intelligence was not accidental. The Imam (A.S.) was to
show it again so abundantly that both friends and foes could not help
but acknowledge his unsurpassable knowledge and wisdom.

We shall see these instances at the appropriate places in this unit. At
this point it is enough to mention that at such young age he used to run
classes in Medina in the Mosque of the Prophet, surrounded by scholars
from different parts of the world.

At one such instance, a group of pilgrims asked him as many as thirty
thousand questions and he answered them all, to their satisfaction.

His recognition as a scholar was universal. Ismail bin Ibrahim says
that one he was present among scolars in the luminous presence of their
great teacher, Ali bin Imam Jaffer Sadiq (A.S.). Then came a young boy
who was hardly thirteen years old. Their teacher, Ali Bin Jaffer stood
up and would not sit down, out of respect, till the young boy implored
him to do so. After a short conversation, the young boy went away.

The respected teacher accompanied him for some distance. In the
presence of the young man the teacher behaved as if he himself was a
learner.

After the departure of the young man, Ismail bin Ibrahim says they
could not help but protest to their teacher, saying that he had no cause
for treating a young boy with such respect, not minding his own advance
age and high status as a scholar.

These objections upset Ali Bin Jaffer. Holding his white, flowing beard
in his hands, he said, "What else am I supposed to do? What Allah did
not see in these white hairs, that He saw in the youthfulness of the one
whom you can a child, and made him His representative on this earth.

I seek refuse in Allah from underestimating the position of that child
and from failing to show due respect to him."

**HIS FAMILY**

His first marriage was to Ummul Fazl, the daughter of Mamoon, the
Caliph of the time. His second marriage was to a Nubian lady from the
same clan as Ammar Yasir, the Prophet's dear companion. Her name was
Sumannah. She was the mother of our tenth Imam, Ali Naqi (A.S).

According to Mufid, the Imam had one more son, named Musa and two
daughters, Fatima and Imama.
