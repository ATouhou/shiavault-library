Man as a Member of Society
==========================

   
 Man in his life comes into contact with countless persons, groups and
things; his relationship with some is amiable; with some others,
antagonistic. Whatever the case, he has to base all his contacts, all
his dealings, on justice — thus ensuring peace and happiness in
society.  
    
 But before that, he has to do justice to his own self, his own soul,
and to all the powers and faculties which God has bestowed upon him.
Unless and until he maintains a balance between his desire and anger, he
cannot do justice to others.
