58. The Verb Form Numbers
=========================

The Verb Form Numbers system is quite old, going back to the earliest
European Arabic grammars such as that of Guillaume Postal, Paris, ca.
1538 and Pedro de Alcala' ca. 1613. Their order of numbering is the same
as that which we are familiar with today. Another grammar was published
in Rome ca. 1622 which uses the numbering system but has forms II and IV
switched. Erpenius' grammar was only superseded in 1810 by the grammar
of De Sacy, who used the same system which has been in vogue ever since.
Incidentally, the numbering system was also used in older grammars of
Hebrew, but seems to have fallen out of usage.

The system, an extremely useful mnemonic device is not entirely
unrelated to the traditional work of**صَرف** , for it follows the order
of** المجرَّد** and**المزيد**   .The use of numbering, however, is the
Latin, European innovation which might have been a claque on some aspect
of the study of Latin grammar. At the very least, it is well known that
Latin grammar traditionally numbers the different classes of
conjugation. De Sacy is careful to make clear in his presentation the
verb forms that they fall into groups of

** المزيد بحرف ، المزيد بحرفين، المزيد بثبلثةِ حُروف**
</p>

Most verbs in Arabic can be classified into ten forms. These forms are:

**1. فَعَلَ     دَرَسَ                     6. تَفاعَلَ      تَراسَلَ**

**2. فَعَّلَ    دَرَّسَ                      7. إنفَعَلَ
إنقَلـَبَ**

**3. فاعَلَ   شاهَدَ                      8. إفتَعَلَ       إرتَفَعَ**

**4. أفعَلَ    أقبَلَ                       9. إفعَلَّ        إحمَرَّ**

**5. تَفَعَّلَ    تَحَدَّثَ                    10. إستَفعَلَ
إستَخدَمَ**

Furthermore, each transitive pattern has an automatic passive
counterpart where the stem short vowel Ftha and Kasra are replaced by
Dhamma and Kasra.
