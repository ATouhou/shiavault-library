Master Of The Shrine
====================

O The Master of the holy Shrine[^1]

You are the Majestic and the Divine

O The Gem of Muhammad's Crown

You are the light of God in our town[^2]

O The golden hands that fly

Above the sick and those who cry

O The savior of the deer[^3]

People love you so sincere

O The shining star of the sky

You are always out there so high

O The source of light in the believer's heart

You are always shining out there so bright

O The shining face in my eye

I cannot stand to tell you bye

O The preacher of the Holy Book

Tell me the words and catch me on the hook

O The rain of peace and glory

Your life is filled with many a story
