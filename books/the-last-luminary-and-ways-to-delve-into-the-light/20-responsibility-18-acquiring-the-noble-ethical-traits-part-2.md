Responsibility 18: Acquiring the Noble Ethical Traits Part 2
============================================================

Another responsibility is to ask Allah for the noble traits (Makarimul
Akhlaq) so that a believer can resemble and manifest the traits of the
Imam, thus earning his love.

In regards to this responsibility, it is highly recommended to recite
the prayer known as “Makarimul Akhlaq”[^1] which has been mentioned in
various books of supplications, as this Du’a is very beneficial in
attaining this rank. This supplication starts as follows:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلىٰ مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِهِ وَ بَلِّغْ بِإِيـمَانِي
أَكْمَلَ الإِيْـمَانِ وَاجْعَلْ يَقِيـنِي أَفْضَلَ الْيَقِينِ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“O’ Allah! Send your blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad
and elevate my faith to a perfect faith and make my certitude the best
of certitudes...”

Reciting these sorts of supplications is important for developing the
noble ethical traits and reaching this state is only possible with the
assistance of Allah for it is out of the reach of humanity to attain on
their own.

A believer can only struggle and choose the path meaning that it is up
to him to choose the path towards the noble traits and then struggle to
reach one’s goal.

However, the true point of achieving these traits, for example, arriving
to the stage of possessing the noble ethical traits, in dependent upon
both the intention and struggles of a person and the desire of Allah 
to grant the believer such a status.
