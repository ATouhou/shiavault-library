Publisher’s Foreword
====================

My dearest readers, in which they were all asking for books and leaflets
dealing with the biography of the *‘ulama’*, who played a bright role in
the world of thought and religious sciences, in all fields. In response,
this Foundation has embarked on perusing the matter attentively and with
utmost care, to meet the sincere desires of the readers longing for
studying the Islamic culture and its characters.

While Ansariyan Publications is presenting the series of “Meeting the
Pious”(*Liqa’ ma’a al-’Abrar*), it only hopes that it can attain the
satisfaction and approval of our beloved readers, meeting their
requests. And it is Allah Who helps us to succeed.
