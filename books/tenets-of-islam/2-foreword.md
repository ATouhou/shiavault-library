**In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent the Merciful.**

All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe and His blessings be on
the last of all Prophets and Apostles and his infallible descendants,
from whom Allah removed uncleanness and cleansed them a thorough
cleansing[^1], and appointed each one of them the leader of mankind
after the Holy Prophet.

One of the most eminent Shi'ah scholars, Shaykh Abu Ja'far Muhammad, who
was born at Tus and buried at Najaf, has said:

*The acknowledgement of Allah is incumbent on everyone obligated to
observe the religious precepts, because Allah is the Benefactor. It is,
therefore, necessary for us to acknowledge Him so that we may be
thankful to Him.*

[^1]: Surah al-Ahzab, 33:33
