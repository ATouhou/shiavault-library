Conjunctions
============

149. What is a conjunction?  
 A conjunction is making a word follow another one by using a
preposition. For example:  
**کَسَرتُ القَلَمَ و الدَّواةَ** (I broke the pen and ink bottle.)

150. How many conjunctional prepositions are there?  
 There are nine conjunctional prepositions: **الواو ، الفاء ، ثُمَّ ، أو
، أم ، لَکن ، لا ، بَل ، حَتَّیَ**

151. Are conjunctions used between all kinds of words?  
 Conjunctions are used between nouns, for example: **جاءَ الکریمُ و
البخیلُ** (The generous person and the stingy person came.) and between
verbs, for example: **قام الرجلُ و سَجَدَ** (The man stood up and
prostrated.)

152. How is a conjunction used with pronouns?  
 If the pronoun is implied it must be emphasized by a separated pronoun
before the conjunction. For example: **جاءَ هُو و أبُوه** (He and his
father came.)

153. How is a conjunction used with connected pronouns in the nominative
state?  
 If the pronoun is a connected pronoun in the nominative state it must
be emphasized by a separate pronoun before the conjunction, for example:
**جئتَ أنتَ و أخوکَ** (You and your brother came.)

154. How is a conjunction used with connected pronouns in the genitive
state?  
 If the pronoun is a connected pronoun in the genitive state the reason
for it being in the genitive state (the genitive preposition or the
prefixed noun) must be repeated before the word after the conjunct. For
example: **سَلَّمتُ علیه و علی أخیه** (I greeted him and his brother.)
