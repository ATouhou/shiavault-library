250. A verbal noun is a word which represents a verb in meaning and
action, is not effected by any factor, and the objective compliment
cannot come before it.

251. There are three types of verbal nouns in regards to time: those
that represent the preterit tense, for example**:سرعان** which is
derived from **أسرَعَ,** those that represent the aorist tense, for
example**:وا** which is means **اتلهّف,** and those that represent the
imperative, for example**:هَیَّا** which means **أسرِع.**

252. The rulings of verbal nouns are that they remain in one state with
regards to number and gender except if the second person *kāf* is added
to it, in which case they become conjugational, for example**:علیکَ**
**و** **علیکِ.**
