Humble Presentation
===================

I humbly present this short commentary of the daily supplication of the
Holy Month of Ramadān to the Holy Prophet Muhammad (s) and his
infallible progeny (as), who represent the perfect Manifestations of the
All-Merciful, and sincerely pray to the All-Merciful Lord to accept the
offering.

This humble attempt should be taken as a point of ascent to the meanings
of other supplications narrated from the Holy Prophet (s) and his
infallible progeny (as). When reciting any supplication, one should
never limit oneself to the periphery but should struggle for the center
and the spirit. Our initial journey would be ‘the journey of thought and
concept’, but this should lead us to overhaul ourselves and ‘comprehend
the kernel of prayer.’

May Almighty Allāh assist all of us before we lose the priceless
opportunity of this transient life.

*Walhamdu lillāhi Rabbi’l ‘Ālamīn*  
*And All praises belong solely to Allāh, the Lord of the Universe*

*Utterly destitute to the All-Affluent*  
*Abū Muhammad Zaynu’l ‘Ābidīn*  
*Qum al-Muqaddasa*  
*Sha‘bān al-Mu‘azzam 1423*

From the heavenly atmosphere of the neighbourhood of Hadrat Fātima
Ma‘sūma (as), may the Almighty imbue our hearts with intense love for
her, and may He Grace us with her intercession-Āmīn.
