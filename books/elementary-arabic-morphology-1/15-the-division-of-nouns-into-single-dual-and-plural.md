50. A single noun is a noun that denotes one thing. For example**:**
**غلامٌ حصانٌ** (a horse, a male servant)

51. A dual noun is a noun that denotes two things and is formed by
adding:

• an *alif* and a *nūn*; for example: **کِتابانِ رَجُلانِ** (two books,
two men)

• a *yā'* and a *nūn*; for example: **کِتابَینِ رَجُلَینِ**

52. A plural noun is a noun that denotes more than two things and is
divided into three categories: a masculine sound plural, a feminine
sound plural and a broken plural.

53. A masculine sound plural is formed by adding:

• a *wāw* and a *nūn*; for example: **مُسلِمُونَ صَادِقُونَ** (Muslims,
truthful people)

• a *yā'* and a *nūn*; for example: **مُسلِمِینَ صَادِقِینَ**

54. A feminine sound plural is formed by adding an *alif* and *tā'*; for
example: **ذاهِبات کاتِبات** (female authors, female leavers)

55. A broken plural is formed by changing the form of the single noun;
for example: **رِجالٌ ﺃرغِفَة** (loaves of Syrian bread, men)
