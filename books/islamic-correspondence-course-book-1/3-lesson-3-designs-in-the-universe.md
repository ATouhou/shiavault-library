Lesson 3 : Designs in the Universe
==================================

In this universe, from the smallest atom to the largest celestial body,
in everything we see, we are reminded of its perfect orderliness and
exact regulation, so much so that great scientists have been provoked to
amazement.

One look at the world around us makes it clear that all things in it
are in full coordination with one another.

The nourishment of living creatures, for example, depends on the
coordination between the sun, clouds, rain, earth and its resources. All
this points to the existence of one coordinated system in the
universe.

There is so much orderliness in nature that the scientists, by using
the immutable laws of nature, can explain the course any phenomenon will
take before it occurs.

For this reason, scientists endeavour to discover these laws. For if
these laws did not hold would not every kind of effort in this field be
fruitless? So let us look at some examples of the order and design in
the universe:

The earth in which we live, with respect to its size, its distance from
the sun, the speed of its orbital movement, etc., is so arranged that it
is able to act as the support for life. If the smallest change were to
take place in its condition, losses of unacceptable dimensions would
occur.

"The earth rotates on its axis at one thousand miles an hour; if it
turned at one hundred miles an hour, our days and nights would be ten
times as long as now, and the hot sun would then burn up our vegetation
during each long day while in the long night any surviving sprout would
freeze.

"Again, the sun, the source of our life, has a surface temperature of
12,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and our earth is just far enough away so that
this "eternal fire1 warms us just enough and not too much! If the sun
gave off only one-half of its present radiation, we would freeze, and if
it gave half as much more, we would roast.

"The slant of the earth, tilted at an angle of 23 degrees, gives us our
seasons; if it had not been so tilted, vapours from the ocean would move
north and south, piling up for us continents of ice.

If our moon was, say, only 50 thousand miles away instead of its actual
distance, our tides would be so enormous that twice a day all continents
would be submerged; even the mountains would soon be eroded away.

If the crust of the earth had been only ten feet thicker, there would
be no oxygen without which animal life must die. Had the ocean been a
few feet deeper, carbon dioxide and oxygen would have been absorbed and
no vegetable life could exist."1

The atmosphere, most of whose constituent elements are lifegiving
gases, is sufficiently viscous that it can, like a shield or armour,
protect the earth from the deadly attack of 200 million meteors every
day, which approach the earth with a speed of 50 km per second.

The responsibility for regulating the temperature of the earth's
surface within limits which maintain life also belongs to the
atmosphere, and if it did not exist, inhabited land, like the dry
deserts, would become incapable of supporting life.

"Because of these, and a host of other examples, there is not one
chance in millions that life on our planet is an accident."2 But why are
we taking the long way round in explaining these things?

Nearer than anything else is our own body. The mysteries of man's
existence are without number, so much so that the world's scientists,
after years of research and study, have not yet been able to fathom all
the wonders of it.

After many years of study, Dr. Alexis Carel wrote a book called L
'homme, cet inconnue (Man, the Unknown). He confessed that biology and
other sciences were 1 A. C. Morrison quoted in S. Saeed Akhtar Rizvi,

still unable to discover the facts about the working of the human body,
and that many problems remained to be unraveled. Now let us examine some
of the marvels of our own existence. THE CELLS OF THE BODY: A human body
is like a building.

It is composed of small building blocks called cells, each of which is
itself a living entity. In the structure of the cells most metals such
as iron, copper and calcium are used as are other elements like oxygen,
hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur.

The number of cells in the body of man is about 10\*6 which is
equivalent to ten thousand, million, million.

Each one of these living cells works in perfect cooperation with the
next, and all of them follow the same aim. They are very quick to
suffer, having low tolerance levels, and nourishment must be correctly
supplied for their needs.

The blood, with the help of the heart, performs this duty very well.
The structure of the heart is well-designed and has perfect dimensions,
so that it can supply blood to the whole body through the agency of the
blood vessels and the capillaries.

The blood, after it has delivered nourishment to the cells, absorbs
poisonous substances which have accumulated there and returns to the
heart with a dull colour.

The heart delivers this to the lungs, a filtering apparatus for the
blood, whereupon it is resupplied to the whole body with a bright colour
and greater freshness.

While passing through the kidneys, another part of these poisonous
matters are removed, so that no kind of disturbance arises in the
general working of the body.

Do we not see in the precise combination and quantity of the metals and
elements from which the cell is formed, and also the amazing structure
of the heart and its way of working, a plan of perfect and superior
design? And if we see in the human body, a mysterious whole and at the
same time a design, are we exaggerating?

Without doubt, no.
