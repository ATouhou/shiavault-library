2. Why did Allah (s.w.t.) not create mankind perfect from the onset?
====================================================================

This objection stems from an oversight of the fact that the main branch
of perfection is voluntary perfection. In other words, perfection (and
development) means that man traverses the path using his own feet and by
means of his resolve. If he were to be held by the hand and taken by
force, neither would it be a matter of glory nor would real perfection
be achieved.

For example, if a person out of his own will decided to give one riyal
from his wealth in charity, he would have progressed towards moral
perfection in that same ratio, whereas if millions were to be taken
forcefully from him and given in charity, he would not have advanced
even one step towards this goal. It is for this reason that in various
verses of the Qur’an this reality has been asserted that had Allah
(s.w.t.) desired, all the people would have become believers, under
compulsion. However such faith would not have proved beneficial to
them.[^1]
