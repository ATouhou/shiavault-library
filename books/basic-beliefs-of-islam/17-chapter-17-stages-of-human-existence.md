Chapter 17 : Stages of Human Existence
======================================

**The spectum of human existence**

In the above sketch, human essence from womb to tomb and thereafter,
has been drawn to explain the various events that happen one after the
other.

This precisely shows that our stay in this physical world is extremely
shor t in comparison to the pre-birth and after-death existence. We have
lived millions of years somewhere in some form before we were conceived
in mother 's womb and will live millions of years somewhere in some form
when we will be thrown into the ear th's womb.

From there, we will rise to proceed to the final destination which will
be beyond the limits of time. The Holy Quran invites to think that, how
this shor t stay in this physical world, is going to shape our endless
and eternal life.

**Womb to Tomb and thereafter**

The following chart has been prepared with the help of the Holy Quran
which gives a precise record of events that occur from womb to tomb and
thereafter. The Quran has described these stages in various places which
are easily understandable to men of average intellect. It has been
simply summarized in a map to show that these facts are in strict
accordance with what has been discovered by scientists and what will be
discovered much later on.

Science progresses by observation, experiments, and exploration. But
Unfor tunately in many cases, these accurate modes of perceptions are
flawed by wrong interpretation. An honest researcher in science can
testify these clearly-defined stages of human existence.

From this self-explanatory map, a man of rational thinking can easily
arrive at the following conclusions.

1 - Allah Subhanahu taala has first created the souls and kept them in
a specific place.

2 - The soul was introduced in an organic body after the process of
fertilization. The body with soul stayed in the mother 's womb for 9
months from where it arrives in the physical world at the time of
birth.

3 - The life in the physical world is an infinitesimal por tion of the
actual life.

4 - Death is not the end of life but the beginning of the second phase
of the eternal life. Death separates the body from the soul.

5 - After experiencing death, the departed soul of every man and woman
continues to live in a place which is conditioned in accordance with
his/her performance in the world. This intermediate place which is a
bridge between the first physical world and the second meta-physical
world is known as the Barzakh.

6 - The stay in Barzakh may be pretty long but definitely not
permanent. The soul will remain at this station from the time of the
death until the end of the world / beginning of the new world, i.e., the
day of Qiyamath / the resurrection day.

7 - The world will end at a definite time which only Allah knows. The
entire universe and everything in it will be annihilated. Thereafter
i.e., after the execution of the Qiyamah and total annihilation of the
universe, Allah will then resurrect the entire human race that has ever
existed anywhere and at any time for final judgment. This will be the
most impor tant day for every soul.

**PARADISE**

Allah (swt) created all the souls and housed them altogether in a place
known as Alam-e-Arwah and asked the whole bulk of souls - Am I not your
Lord All souls responded, saying, Yes! you are our Lord.

Single diploid cell resulted from fusion of a male and female gamete.
The zygote divides, and specialized cell lines develop which eventually
results in offspring.

Every man and woman who was born in this world will acquire the final
and eternal life which he or she will spend in a place known as Jannat
or Jahannum. Phases of life.

As the map of life shows, we have various stages and phases of life.

1 - Life before birth.
2 - Life in this world.
3 - Life after death.
4 - Life after resurrection.
