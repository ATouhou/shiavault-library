Mary's Death and Prophethood of Jesus
=====================================

According to a number of accounts, Mary conceived Jesus when she was
thirteen years old. She gave birth to him at Bethlehem, a suburb of
Jerusalem, fifty-one years after the beginning of the reign of the
Ashkelonites (or Ashkenazim). Allah sent the wahi (inspiration) to him
at the age of thirty, and He raised him up from the temple at Jerusalem
on Laylatul-Qadr (the Night of Power) during the month of Ramad,.an when
he was thirty-three years old; so, his prophethood continued for only
three years. His mother lived after his being raised to heavens for six
years, and Allah knows best.
