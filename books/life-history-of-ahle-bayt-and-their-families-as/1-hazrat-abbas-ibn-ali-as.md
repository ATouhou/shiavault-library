Hazrat Abbas Ibn Ali (as)
=========================

Hazrat Ali married Fatimah Binti Huzaam Ibne Khalid in 24 Hijrah.
Fatimah gave birth to Hazrat Abbas on the 4th Shabaan, 26th Hijrah. In
27th Hijrah Ja'far was born and in 29th Hijrah Uthmaan was born.
Abdullah was born in 32nd Hijrah. Because she had four sons Fatima Binti
Huzaam was known as Ummul Baneen.

Ummul Baneen, from the very first day she entered Hazrat Ali's house,
treated the children of Bibi Fatimah with utmost respect. She brought up
her own sons to look upon Imaam Hassan, Imaam Hussain, Bibi Zainab and
Bibi Kulthoom, not as brothers and sisters but as masters and
mistresses.

Imaam Hussain was very attached to Hazrat Abbas. When Hazrat Abbas was
born, Hazrat Ali asked Imaam Hussain to recite the adhaan and the iqamah
in the ears of the child. When he was on the arms of Imaam Hussain, the
infant smiled and raised his arms. There were tears in Imaam Hussain's
eyes. Was it because he knew that the child was trying to say: "O Mawla
I have come and will happily give these my arms and my life for you and
Islam"

In early childhood Hazrat Abbas would follow Imaam Hussain like a
shadow. If Imaam Hussain looked thirsty, Abbas would rush to bring him
water. If Imaam Hussain seemed hot, Abbas would fan him with the hem of
his cloak. At the battle of Siffeen in the 34th Hijrah, Abbas was only
eight years old. Imaam Hussain was fighting in the battle field. When
Hazrat Abbas saw an enemy soldier approaching Imaam Hussain from
behind,

he took a sword and rushed into the battle field and killed the enemy,
at the same time crying out in a loud voice, "How can any one dare
attack my Mawla while I am alive." He continued to fight maintaining his
position behind Imaam Hussain. Muawiya saw this and asked, "Who is that
boy?" When he was told he was Abbas ibne Ali, he said, "By God! No one
can fight like that at that age except a son of Ali!"

Hazrat Abbas grew up to be a tall and handsome man. He was so tall,
that when he sat on a horse his feet touched the ground. He was so
handsome that he was known as Qamar-e-Bani Hashim, the Moon of the
family of Hashim.

Hazrat Abbas was also a valiant warrior. It was said that Muawiya did
not dare invade Madina because of five men who were with Imaam Hussain
and could, together with their Imaam, conquer a whole army. These were
Muhammad Hanafia, a brother of Imaam Hussain, Hazrat Muslim ibne Aqeel,
Abdullah Ibne Jaffer, Hazrat Abbas and Hazrat Ali ibnal Hussain, our
fourth Imaam, Zainul 'Abideen.

When Imaam Hussain decided to leave Madina in the month of Rajab 60
Hijrah, he did not encourage Muhammad Hanafia and Abdullah Ibne Jaffer
to accompany him. He wanted to make sure that no one at the time or in
the future would suggest that Hussain wanted to fight for the
khilafah.

Just before Imaam Hussain left Madina, Ummul Baneen summoned all her
four sons and said to them, "My sons you must remember that while I love
you, Imaam Hussain is your Master. If Imaam or his sisters or his
children get injured or hurt while you are still alive, I will never
forgive you." There were tears in Hazrat Abbas's eyes as he promised his
mother that he and his brothers would lay down their lives for Imaam
Hussain and his children.

The caravan reached Kerbala on 2nd Muharram. From the day the sad news
of Hazrat Muslim's murder had reached the caravan of Imaam Hussain,
Hazrat Abbas and his brothers increased their vigilance to protect Imaam
and the others.

Hazrat Abbas was very popular with the children of Imaam Hussain
especially Sakina who was only four years old. Whenever the children
wanted anything they would cry out "Ya Abbas!" or "Ya Ammahu!", and
Abbas would go running. But from the seventh of Muharram Abbas was
unable to respond to their cries for water.

Then came the day of Ashura, after Zuhr prayers one by one the brave
companions of Imaam Hussain fell in the battle field. At last only Imaam
Hussain, Ali Akber and Hazrat Abbas were left. Imaam Zainul 'Abideen lay
sick in his tent.

Several times Hazrat Abbas asked Imaam Hussain for permission to go and
fight. Each time Imaam Hussain would reply "Abbas, you are the captain
of my army, you are my 'alamdaar - the standard bearer". Hazrat Abbas
would never argue with Imaam Hussain. His three brothers were killed in
the battle fought after Zuhr.

Imaam Hussain could see the anger in Hazrat Abbas's eyes, especially
when Hazrat Qasim's body was trampled upon by the enemy. Imaam Hussain
knew that if he let Abbas go and fight, there would be a massacre in the
enemy rank. Imaam Hussain's object was to re-awaken Islam and not to
score a victory on the battle field.

Just then Bibi Sakina came out holding a dried up mask. She walked up
to Hazrat Abbas and said "AL ATASH, YA AMMAHU! I am thirsty O my uncle
Abbas !" Abbas went to Imaam Hussain and requested for permission to go
and get water for Sakina. Imaam Hussain gave his permission. Abbas put
Sakina's mashk on the 'alam, mounted his horse and rode up to Imaam
Hussain.

He said "I have come to say goodbye". Imaam Hussain said "My brother,
come and embrace me". Hazrat Abbas dismounted his horse. There were
tears in Imaam's eyes. As Hazrat Abbas prepared to mount his horse,
Imaam Hussain said, "My brother, I want a gift from you. I want your
sword". Hazrat Abbas, without uttering a word, gave Imaam Hussain his
sword and rode into the battlefield, armed only with a spear and holding
the 'alam.

There were 30,000 enemy soldiers in the battlefield. They had all heard
of the valour of Hazrat Abbas. A cry arose, "Abbas is coming!" Yazeed's
soldiers started hiding behind one another. A few brave ones dared go
near Hazrat Abbas but were soon put to death by the spear or by a
kick.

Hazrat Abbas reached the river Furaat. He filled the mashk with water.
He himself was very thirsty. He took the water in his palms, looked at
it and threw it away saying, "O water of Furaat, my lips can welcome you
only after Sakina has quenched her thirst !?" He placed the mashk on his
'alam and started to ride back.

Umar Sa'ad cried out, "Do not let that water reach Hussain's camp,
otherwise we shall all be doomed!"

A soldier climbed a tree and as Abbas was riding past the tree he
struck his sword on the right shoulder The spear and the arm fell on to
the ground. Just then someone crept behind Hazrat Abbas and struck him
on the left shoulder. The 'alam fell. Hazrat Abbas gripped the mashk
with his teeth. His one object was to get the water to Sakina. Fighting
with his feet he urged the horse to get him to Imaam's camp as quickly
as possible.

Alas ! an arrow was shot. It went flying across the desert and hit the
mashk. The water began to pour out and with the water all the hopes of
Hazrat Abbas poured on to the sands of Kerbala to be buried forever in
the thirsty desert. Abbas now did not want to go back and face Sakina.
With his feet, he signalled the horse to turn back. The enemy surrounded
him from all sides. Abbas fell from the horse!! As he fell, he cried out
"My salaams to you Ya Mawla!"

Imaam Hussain seemed to lose all his strength when he heard the voice
of his dear brother Abbas.

When Hazrat Abbas left to go to fetch water, Imaam stood at the gate of
the camp watching the 'alam. Sakina was standing next to Imaam Hussain,
also with her eyes fixed on the 'alam. When Abbas reached the river bank
and bent down to fill the mashk, the 'alam disappeared from sight.
Sakina was frightened and looked at her father.

Imaam said, 'Sakina, your uncle Abbas is at the river bank'. Sakina
smiled and said, 'Alhamdulillah !' and called out all the children to
welcome Abbas. When Hazrat Abbas lost both arms, the 'alam fell onto the
ground. Sakina could see it no longer! She looked at Imaam Hussain, but
he turned his face away. Sakina began to tremble with fear and her eyes
filled with tears. She raised her hands and prayed, 'Ya Allah! Do not
let them kill my uncle Abbas! I will never ask for water again!' and ran
inside to her mother.

Imaam Hussain reached where Hazrat Abbas was lying. It was a tragic
sight. Hazrat Abbas was lying on the ground. Both arms had been severed!
There was an arrow in the right eye and blood blocked the left eye. As
soon as Hazrat Abbas sensed the presence of Imaam Hussain he said
"Mawla, why did you take the trouble to come over? Please go back and
look after Sakina." Imaam Hussain said, "My dear brother, all your life
you have served me and my children.

Is there anything I can do for you at this last moment of you life ?"
Hazrat Abbas replied, "Aqaa, please, clean the blood from my eye so that
I can see your beloved face before I die!" Imaam cleaned the blood.
Abbas fixed his gaze on Imaam. Then he said, "Mawla please do not carry
my body to the camp.

I do not wish Sakina to see me in this state!" Imaam Hussain took
Hazrat Abbas in his arms, and kissed his forehead. Just then our Mawla,
our Mushkil Kushaa, Abbas ibne Ali breathed his last. Imaam Hussain
placed Sakina's mashk on the 'alam and carried the 'alam to the camp. He
went to Bibi Zainab's tent. Imaam Hussain could not say a word. He gave
the 'alam to Bibi Zainab and sat down on the floor! The brother sister
performed aza-e-Abbas.


**Hazrat Ali Akber (as)**

Hazrat Ali Akber was the son of Imaam Hussain. He was a handsome young
man of eighteen. His mothers' name was Umm-e-Laila. He was also a brave
soldier. He had been taught fencing and archery by Hazrat Abbas. He so
much resembled the Holy Prophet that Imaam Hussain was often heard to
say that whenever I remember the Holy Prophet I look at Akber.

Ali Akber had a loud beautiful voice. It was he who always recited
adhaan. On the morning of Ashura day Ali Akber recited adhaan. Every one
knew that it was the last time they would hear Ali Akber's adhaan. Imaam
Hussain began to weep when Ali Akber began his Adhaan. The ladies could
also be heard crying in their tents.

After Zuhr prayers Ali Akber stood in front of Imaam Hussain. He said,
"Father I request for permission to go and fight the enemies of Islam."
Imaam looked at his son lovingly. He said, "Akber, you have my
permission. May Allah be with you! But Akber, you know how much your
mother, sisters and aunts love you.

Go and say farewell to them."Ali Akber went into the tent of his
mother. Every time he wanted to come out of the tent the mother, aunts
and sisters would pull his cloak and say, "O Akber, How can we live
without you!" Finally Imaam Hussain had to go in and plead with all to
let Ali Akber go.

Imaam helped his youthful son to mount the horse. As Akber began to the
ride towards the battlefield, he heard foot steps behind. He looked back
and saw his father. He said, "Father, we have said good-bye. Why are you
walking behind him." Hussain replied, "My son, had you been a father you
would surely have understood !!"

Ali Akber fought very bravely. No one dared come close to him in single
combat after he had killed many well known warriors. Umar Sa'ad ordered
his soldiers to finish off the young man saying, "When he dies, Hussain
will not want to live! Ali Akber is the life of Hussain." While a few
soldiers attacked Ali Akber another slowly crept up to him and threw a
spear at his chest with such ferocity that it penetrated Akber chest and
he felt faint.

As he was falling from his horse, he cried out. "O Father, my last
salaams to you!" As he hit the ground the spear broke but the blade
remained lodged in Akber's chest.

When our Imaam heard Akber's salaam he looked at Furaat where Abbas lay
and said, 'Abbas! Now that this brother of yours needs you most, where
have you gone?' With all his strength sapped by the anguish in Akber's
voice, Hussain began to walk towards the battle-field.

Let us pause briefly to remind ourselves of an incident in the seventh
Hijrah. The Jews of Khaiber had revolted against the Holy Prophet. The
Prophet and the Muslims of Madina laid a siege on Khaiber. They
surrounded the fortress in which the Jews had taken shelter. The Muslims
could not get victory unless they entered the fortress.

There was a moat surrounding the fortress. Hazrat Ali had been unable
to accompany the Muslims due to his illness. Three days passed and the
Muslims could not find any solution. Even if they got across the moat
they would face the famous gates of the fortress. These were made of
steel, and it is said that at least twenty men were needed to push open
or close each gate.

On the third day, after the morning prayers, the Prophet summoned Ali.
Hazrat Ali immediately responded. He jumped his horse over the moat and
with one hand swung open both the gates of the fortress with such force
that they broke off their hinges. He carried them and put them across
the moat to form a bridge. The Muslims rode into the fortress and
conquered Khaiber.

Now let us go back to Kerbala. When Imaam Hussain got to where Akber
lay he took him in his arms. Akber had his right hand on the chest. He
placed his left arm over the shoulder of his father. Hussain said
"Akber, why do you embrace me with one arm only?" Akber would not reply.
Hussain tried to move Akber hand. Akber resisted. Imaam gently moved the
hand. Then he saw it! He saw the blade of the spear.

Imaam Hussain laid Ali Akber on the ground and sitting on his knees he
put both his hands on the blade of the spear. He then looked at Najaf,
and cried out, "Father, I too have come to my Khaiber!" He pulled out
the blade. Jibraeel cried out "Marhaba! Marhaba!" Akber took a deep sigh
and then lay still.

**Imam Raza (as), A Brief Look into his Life**

Name: Ali bin Musa.
Titles: Ar-Ridha, Zamin-e-Thamin, Gharibul Ghuraba, Alim e Ale
Muhammad.
Kuniyya: Abul Hasan.
Birth: 11th Zilkaad.
Mother: Bibi Suttana (or Najma or Ummulbanin).
Father: Imam Musa Al-Kadhim (a.s.)
Death: 29th Safar 203 a.h. (Poisoned by Mamun Rashid ).
Buried: Mashhad, Iran.

**His Parents & Birth**

Mother : She was a slave of Umme Hamida (6th Imam's wife). When the 7th
Imam had gone to buy her from the slave trader he was told that when he
was coming to Medina from Marrakesh a pious Christian lady had told him
that Bibi Suttana was a very special slave who would bear a son who
would spread the true word from the East to the West.

Umme Hamida saw the Prophet (S.A.W.) in her dream telling her to give
Bibi Suttana to Imam Musa Al-Kadhim (a.s.) which she did. The 6th Imam
used to tell his companions to await the birth of his grandson who he
addressed as Alim e Ale Muhammad. He was one of the three Imams who did
Jihad with their knowledge.

(The other two were the 5th and 6th Imams). Imam Ali Ar-Ridha (a.s.)
was born one month after the martyrdom of his grandfather Imam Ja'fer
As-Sadiq (a.s.) He was born during the reign of the Harun Al-Rashid who
poisoned his father.

**Father : Imam Musa Al-Kadhim (a.s.)**

**His Titles**

Ar-Ridha - Angels, Prophets, Aimma, believers and even the enemies of
Ahlul-Bayt accepted him. So much so that Mamun Rashid had to offer him
to be the heir apparent (to be the leader after him). Imam
Zamin-e-Thamin - Thamin means eight. Zamin means safety and security.
One of the incidents attributed to this title is that one day Imam was
going through the market place with a few followers when he saw a hunter
about to kill a (struggling) female deer.

Imam told the hunter to let the deer go as she wanted to feed her two
young ones who were in the forest and that she would return to the
hunter who could then kill her. The hunter thought that Imam was making
a fool out of him. Imam stood in surety and the hunter allowed the deer
to go. A little while later the deer returned with her young ones and
asked Imam to look after them. We believe that if anyone who is going on
a journey goes under the security of Imam he/she will return safely.

Gharibul-Ghurabaa (One who is a stranger i.e. he is away from his
hometown). Imam was far away from his home and family and he is the only
Imam who is buried out of Iraq and Hejaz (Saudi Arabia). Alim e Aali
Mohammed - The learned one from Aale Muhammad. This name was given to
him by his grandfather (Imam Ja'fer As-Sadiq (a.s.)).

**Life and Works**

Imam played a significant role in the educating of Muslims. Setting
examples of education through one's own conduct.

He saw a short period of the rule of Harun Rashid who had murdered his
father. Harun Rashid also attempted to kill Imam Ali Ridha (a.s.) but
was unsuccessful. After Harun's death, his sons, Amin and Mamun fought
for power. Mamun won with Amin being killed.

Immediately after becoming the Khalifa Mamun, according to the
tradition started by Muawiya, had to name a successor (heir apparent) .
Mamun summoned Imam to come to his capital Marw sending a messenger to
Medina to bring the Imam to him and specifying a certain route and
sending a security force . The route he chose was not the normal route
where, a lot of Shia's lived. On the way they entered a town called
Nishapur. There the scholars and people requested Imam to tell them a
hadith. Imam related the following hadith which is known as the hadith
of the golden chain.

"My father Musa Al-Kadhim narrated to me from his father Ja'fer
As-Sadiq from his father Mohammed Al-Baqir from his father Ali Zaynul
Abedeen from his father , the martyr of Kerbala from his father Ali ibn
Abu Talib saying :"My loved one, and the pleasure of my eyes, the
Messenger of God (S.A.W.) told me once, that Jibrail told him from the
Lord "The kalima of LA ILAHA ILLALLAH is my fort; whoever said it would
enter my fort; and whoever entered my fort was safe from my
punishment".

Those who wrote down the hadith numbered twenty thousand. People
started reciting the Kalima when Imam put his hand up and continued:
"Yes, the kalima is Allah's fort. It will provide you with excellent
safety but on one condition only and that is that you obey and follow
us - the holy Imams in the progeny of the holy Prophet (S.A.W.). On
reaching Marw Mamun forced Imam to accept the heir apparency (To be the
leader after him). Imam accepted unwillingly.

**Why did Mamun want Imam to be the heir apparent?**

1. To please the Shia public opinion in Khurasan and the surrounding
areas which would make it easier for Mamun to be accepted by the people
there and a victory over his brother Amin.

2. To avoid clashes with those like the Alawids who had always
threatened the Abbasids with various uprisings.

Mamun celebrated the occasion of Imam's acceptance of heir apparency.
Imam only gave a short sermon saying after he had praised Allah "We have
over you a right appointed by the Prophet, and you have a right over us
as well; so if you fulfil your duty towards us, we will be bound to
perform our duty towards you".

Mamun ordered a new coin to be minted with Imam Ar-Ridha's name on it.
Imam however knew that this would not last long.

Soon Mamun put Imam under constant watch. Imam used the position to
spread the true word of Islam. Mamun's court was visited by thousands
and Imam made an impact on their minds. His ahadith were widely
recorded. Mamun who was fond of scholarly discussions would arrange for
intellectuals from Greece, Italy , India etc. to come to his court and
hold discussions with the Imam.

One day a Jewish scholar was brought by Mamun to debate with Imam. The
scholar asked: "How can you accept Muhammad to be the prophet of God
when he showed no miracles ? " Imam replied : "The greatest of miracles
of Allah is the human mind. It allows ideas to be thought through and
reasoned out. Islam appeals to human reason. Man must accept God through
reason and not through miracles ".

The scholar did not have much to say after that answer.

Imam also encouraged greatly the remembrance of Imam Husayn (a.s.)

Mamun was never sincere in his behaviour towards Imam. Seeing the
Imam's popularity increase disturbed him immensely especially after the
occasion when he requested Imam to lead Eid prayers as he was not well.
He saw that even before Imam had reached the mosque the people had lined
the streets and were reciting takbir and it seemed that even the walls
of Marw were doing the same. He had to ask Imam to go back that day.

There are various accounts of how Imam Ali Ar-Ridha (a.s.) was killed
by Mamun. One of them is that Imam used to like grapes and Mamun offered
Imam poisoned grapes. Imam was ill and died after two days on the 29th
Safar 203 a.h.

Imam Ali Ar-Ridha (a.s.) died in Toos in a village called Sanabad. He
had only one son, Imam Muhammad At-Taqi (a.s.), who succeeded him as the
9th Imam.

Mamun ordered Imam's grave to be dug near his father Harun's and when
it was being dug he said that Imam had told him that when his grave
would be dug water and fish would appear underneath. Just as Imam had
said when they finished digging a spring of water appeared with fish in
it and then disappeared. Imam is buried there at what is today called
Mashhad in IRAN.
