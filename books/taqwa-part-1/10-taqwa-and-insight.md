Taqwa and Insight
=================

Taqwa leads to clear-sightedness and insight as it is stated in the holy
Qur’an:

***…If you are wary of Allah, He shall appoint a criterion for you…
(8:29)***

This verse illustrates that insightfulness is among the important
effects of taqwa and we can say that this has paved the way for the
mystic journey.

Taqwa and Deliverance

The other effect of taqwa is that the one who has it can get himself out
of predicaments and hardships. The Qur’an says:

***…And whoever is wary of Allah, He shall make a way out for him and
provide for him from whence he does not reckon. And whoever puts his
trust in Allah, He will suffice him. Indeed Allah carries through His
command. Certainly Allah has set a measure for everything. (65: 2-3)***
