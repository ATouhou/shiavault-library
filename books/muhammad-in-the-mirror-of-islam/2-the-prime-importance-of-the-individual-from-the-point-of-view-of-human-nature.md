The Prime Importance of the Individual from the Point of View of Human Nature
=============================================================================

Human nature seeks no more than to perpetuate as far as possible its own
existence and to achieve its instinctive desires. If the first step man
takes in his development is to form social groupings, and if he
preserves these societies by acting in accordance with their laws-thus
surrendering to the same extent a degree of his individual freedom, it
is in order that by depriving himself of one portion of his freedom he
gain and benefit from another portion by being better able to provide
for his innate requirements and his subsistence.

The first goal of creation is the happiness of the individual; the
happiness of society follows upon this. In other words the purpose of
creation is the perfection of human nature, and this perfection is
realized in the being of the individual, not in the shape and form of
society. Thus, man is directed towards the formation of social groupings
to preserve the individual.

For in order that he may realize the fundamental purpose of
life-happiness and well-being-it is necessary that he should follow an
orderly system of living, a system which inevitably must be social. He
must eat, drink, clothe himself, sleep, rest, wed, bear offspring,
secure his needs, and through the use of his mind provide the means of
his own subsistence.
