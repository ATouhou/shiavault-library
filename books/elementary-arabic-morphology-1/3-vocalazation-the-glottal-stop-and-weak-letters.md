8. There are four vocals:

*Tashdīd*: ّ, *al-madd*: , the *wasl* glottal stop and the *qad‛*
glottal stop: **ﺀ**

9. All of the vocals are written above the letter except for the glottal
stop if it has a *kasrah* and is at the beginning of a word.

For example: **ﺇکرام** (respect)

10. The *tashdīd* denotes that one letter is actually two letters. For
example: **قَدﱠم.** (to lead the way) In this example the *tashdīd*
takes the place of a second *dāl*.

The *madd* denotes that an *alif* has been erased after a glottal stop
in the form of an *alif*. For example: **ﺁثر**

The *wasl* glottal stop denotes that the *alif* should not be
pronounced. For example: **تَفَتّحَ**  
**الوَردُ** **(**the flower blossomed)

The *qat‛* glottal stop denotes that the *alif* should be pronounced.
For example: **ﺃخَذَ** (to take)
