Some English Books on Shi’a Beliefs
===================================

The first book is of a Sunni brother who was exposed to the Shi’a for
the first time, after studying several Sunni madhabs, including Sufism.

The book is written from a Sunni prespective.

1. "Then I was guided", by Dr. Muhammad al-Teejani al-Samawi $6  
 2. "Beliefs of Shi’ite School”by Muhammad Ridha Mudhaffar $6  
 3. "Probe into the History of Hadeeth”$6  
 4. "Role of Ahlul-bayte in preserving the teaching of Islam”$8  
 5. "Imamate,”by Dr. Akhtar Rizvi. $12  
 6. "A Shi’a Anthology", by Tabatabai $5  
 7. "Arabic for English speaking students”$25  
 8. "Qur’an w/commentery+long intro”by S.V. Mir Ahmed ‘Ali (Shi’a) $25  
 9. "Abdullah Ibn Saba and Other Myths,”by al-Askari, S. M. $12  
 10. "The Awaited Savior,”by B. al-Sadr and M. Mutahhari. $3.5  
 11. "An Inquiry Concerning al-Mahdi,”by B. al-Sadr. $8  
 12. "A Reply To: Belief of Mahdism in Shi’a Imamia". $6

These are a couple of places that have these books:  
 TTQ (718) 446-6472 in NY  
 al-Khoei Foundation (718) 297-6520 in NY

More books in English:

13. "Shitte Islam", by Tabatabai (translated into English by Seyyed
Hussein Nasr)

Note: Allamah Ayatollah Seyyed Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei, who passed
away recently, was one of the scholars and philosophers of Shi’a Islam.
He is known for many contributions to Islamic scholarship, including
\_Tafsir al-Mizan\_.

14. "An Introduction to Shi’i Islam: History and Doctrines of Twelver
Shi’ism", by Moojan Momen

Note: The beginning chapters explain the historical events that lead to
the Shi’a-Sunni split. I don’t think the author is a Shi’a himself, but
the book is informative.

15. "The Shiites Under Attack", by Muhammad Javad Chirri. Available
from: The Islamic Center of America, 15571 Joy Road, Detroit, Michigan,
48228.

This book is very interesting and highly recommended for those who would
like to study Shi’a. It removes many doubts and allegations
scientifically.

Books 13, 14 and 15 are available in many US public and/or university
libraries.
