Question : How Far Is a Muslim Allowed To Entertain Himself ? Is He Allowed To Entertain Himself With Music ?
=============================================================================================================

Answer:

A Muslim is not allowed to entertain himself or herself with dance,
music, gambling or drinking.

Question:

What is your opinion about the Christian theory of salvation through
the crucifixion (death) of Jesus ? Is it justice to kill someone for
another's salvation ?

Answer:

It is absolute non-sense. You have answered this question when you
said: "Is it justice to kill someone for another's salvation ?'.'

Question:

Is the Christian thought about the cause of the death correct ? That
man dies because of the disobedience of our father 'Adam' and 'Eve' ?

Answer:

This also is a myth. Nobody in his right sense would think like it
seriously. It is a supposition to support the above mentioned theory of
salvation.

Question:

Did our Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) deliver his message to the Jinnis ? If
the answer is yes, how did he do this, while the Jinnis are not usually
seen by man ? And how is Islam maintained among the Jinnis now ?

Answer:

Yes, our Holy Prophet preached among the Jinns, and this fact is
clearly described in the Sura 'Al-Jinn' in the 29th Juzw. The Jinns are
not seen by men, as you have said, usually. But they may make themselves
visible if they want. And the power of the eyes of the Holy Prophet was
such that he could, and did, see the angels (who also are not seen
usually by men); therefore, it is not a serious problem.

As about the maintenance of Islam among them now, it is described in
our books, that they have their own scholars and preachers, as the human
beings do. And it has been hinted in many traditions of our Imams that
the Jinni Muslims were not misled by those who contrived to mislead the
mankind; they are on right path.

Question:

May I know the Dua and manner of slaughtering the following animals :
Chicken; goat; cow; camel; wild animals; an animal for Aquiqua; an
animal for slaying Festival, i.e. Idd-ul-Hajj.

Answer:

Chicken, cow, goat and animals like these are slaughtered by knife.
Camel is first pierced in the neck by spear, and then slaughtered by
knife.

In all slaughterings, except Aquiqua and Sacrifice of Idd-ul-Hajj the
only dua which is wajib is 'Bismillah'.

In Aquiqua and sacrifice, as mentioned above, it is necessary to have
the 'niyyet' (intention) that you are slaughtering the animal for that
particular purpose Qurbatan llallah (i.e., in obedience to the command
of Allah).

Other necessary conditions for the slaughter of any animal are as
follows:-

1. The person who slaughters must be a Muslim.
2. The knife must be of iron or steel.
3. At the time of slaughtering, the face, hands, feet and stomach of
the animal must be towards Quibla. Also, the person slaughtering that
animal must be facing towards Quibla.
4. Before begining the slaughter, when the knife is put on the animal's
throat, the person must say 'Bismillah' with intention of slaughtering
it.
5. The animal should move its body or limbs after slaughter before
dying. Also it is necessary that as much blood should come out of its
body as normally comes out from such animals.

Aquiqua: Before slaying the animal for Aquiqua, this Dua is Sunnat :

Bismillahi wa billahi Allahumma hadhihi Aqiqatun an (name of the child
and his father) Lahmuha bi lahmihi wa damuha bi damihi wa adhmuha bi
adhmihi wa sh'aruha bi sh'arihi wa jilduha bi jildihi Alla-hummaj'alha
waqa-an li (name of child and his father). If the child is a daughter,
then after taking her name first time, the remaining Du'a will be
recited as follows :-

Lahmuha bi lahmiha wa damuha bi damiha wa adhmuha bi adhmiha wa
sh'aruha bish'ariha wa jilduha bi jildiha Allahummaj-alha waqa-an li
(name of child and her father). Another Du'a :

Ya qaume' Inni bari-un mimma tushrikuun Inni wajjahtu wajhiya lilladhi
fataras-samaawaati wal ardha hanifam muslimanw wa ma ana minal
mushrikiin Inna Swlaati wa nusuki wa mahyaya wa mamaati lillahi
Rabbil-Aalamiina La sharika lahu wa bi dhaalika umirtu wa ana minal
muslimiin Allahumma minka wa laka Bismillahi wallahu Akbar. After
slaughtering, say:

Allahumma Swalli ala Muhammadinw wa Aali Muhammad wa Taqabbal min (name
of child and his/her father).

Sacrifice at Eid-ul-Hajj time: Before killing the animal, this Dua is
Sunnat: Wajjahtu wajhiya lilladhi fatarassamaawaati wal ardha hanifam
muslimanw wa ma ana minal mushrikiin Inna swalaati wa nusuki wa mahyaya
wa mamaati lillahi Rabbil-Aalamiina La sharika lahu wa bi dhaalika
umirtu wa ana minal muslimiin Allahumma minka wa laka Bismillahi wallahu
Akbar.

After slaughtering, say:

Allahumma Taqabbal minni. Hunting wild animals: If a wild animal whose
meat is Halal, is killed by hunting, it will be Halal on the following
conditions :-

1. The weapon must be sharp (like spear or arrow) which pierces the
body by its sharp edge. Also, the bullets of a gun are allowed. But
small gun like air-gun is not allowed.

2. The Person who uses that weapon must use it with intention of
killing that animal. If, for example, an animal is killed by his bullet
accidentally, its meat will not be Halal.

3. The said person must be a Muslim.

4. At the time of using that weapon, he/she must say 'Bismillah'

5. The animal, at the arrival of the hunter, must be dead by that
weapon (or so near to death that slaying it in normal way is not
possible). If at the arrival of the hunter it is alive, and there is
enough time to slay it in normal way, it must be slaughtered
accordingly; otherwise, its meat will be Haram.

Yours sincerely, S. S. Akhtar Rizvi. 4th November, 1970. Maulana S. S.
Akhtar Rizvi, How are you Maulana ! ! ! How is your family and the
Mission staff there ?

I promised to write to you on the day we met in Arusha, but the
situation did not allow me. We were not allowed to go out of the camp,
nor were there stamps in our shop for some reasons. The first reason
also has hindered me from the prayer practice you arranged for me in
Arusha.

I hope to leave this wonderful place on or before 24th November.
Therefore, I think it would be better if you do not send me anything by
this address. I will send you my address after my arrival at home. It
may be that I am transferred from Sunga. Much greetings to your family
and to the Bilal Muslim Mission staff. May Allah accept our Taubas in
this Holy Month of Ramadhan - Amin.

Your son in Islam, Dhikiri O. Mohamed Kiondo. 3rd December, 1970. Dear
Maulana S. S. Akhtar Rizvi, How are you Maulana ? How has it been, the
Idd-el-Fitr ?

I am very well, by the blessings of Allah; and my family at Kwe-mkole
in Korogwe District is all well.

I am glad to inform you that I will still be in this place using the
same address. I hope, after few days, I will send you Shs. 15/- for the
registration and first payment of the fees for the Correspondence
Course. May Allah help us.

Your son

Dhikiri O. Mohamed Kiondo. 11th December, 1970. My Dear Dhikiri, Thank
you for your letter of 3rd December, 1970. You will charge. be enrolled
as a student of Islamic Correspondence Course, free of The application
form is enclosed, which please return duly filled. With best wishes.
Yours sincerely, S. S. Akhtar Rizvi. My Dear Dhikiri, Here are the
answers to your questions

Question:

Have the Scientists recognised the need of a Planner and a Designer ?

Answer:

You should find its answer in Unit 2 (God of Islam). Apart from other
chapters, the 13 th and 14th chapters specially deal with this
question.

Question:

How Pascal used Hazrat Ali bin Abi Talib's (A.S.) idea ?

Answer:

I am publishing an article on it in June issue of "Light". (Now see
'Need of Religion', published by this Mission). Question: How have the
other sects of Islam failed to fulfil the necessary qualities of a
Religion ? Answer:

All right. Look into chapter 5 of 'Need of Religion' and start
comparing :-

A) Ashaira (i.e., Sunnis) do not accept that reason or intellect has
any place in religion. In fact, they do not accept any relation between
a cause and its effect. And unless the relationship of cause and effect
is accepted, nothing can be proved by any argument.

B) By the same reasoning, the teaching of Sunni'ism neglects 'mind' and
thus prevents the development of a human being as a "whole".

C) The belief in Pre-destination is enough to show how Sunni'ism fails
this test. Question:

How do the Qadariyyas share with God in Legislating the Shariat ?

Answer:

Qadariyyas believe that human beings are 100% independent of Allah in
their actions, and Allah has no control over their deeds. They are
counted as 'Mushrik' because, according to that belief, they treated
themselves as equal to and independent of Allah in their actions. I am
afraid that the sentence in 'God of Islam' concerning this topic is not
very clear. I will make it more clear in the next edition.

Question:

What were the ten intellects that the ancient Greek philosophers
believed to have created the Universe ?

Answer:

This thing has no existence; it was a creation of the mental luxury of
Greek philosophers. They said that the Creator created the first
intellect; this first intellect created the second intellect and first
sky; the second intellect, in its turn, created the third intellect and
the second sky; and likewise, the ninth intellect created the tenth
intellect and ninth sky. The tenth intellect created this Earth.
According to them, the Creator, after creating the first intellect, is
powerless to do any other work.

Question:

How can the name Rahim be used for others besides Allah

Answer:

The word 'Rahim' literally means 'Merciful'. In Arabic language it was
being used for merciful persons. And it continued to be used in that
way. In the Qur'an this adjective has been used for our beloved Prophet
also. But 'Rahman' was not used before Islam and in the Islamic
terminology the difference in the meaning and usage of the two names was
prescribed, as I have mentioned in the book, 'God of Islam'.

Question:

How can the belief in one God create brotherhood ?

Answer:

As children of one father have a feeling of brotherhood because all are
the off-springs of one father, likewise, the creatures of One God are
bound to have brotherly feelings towards each other because they are the
creation of One Creator.

Question:

Suppose a Muslim eats something forbidden in his religion - will he
need a special purification? What is it?

Answer:

There are no special purification rites. The method of cleansing by
water, as described in 'Elements of Islamic Studies' applies here also.
But one must ask forgiveness of Allah for disobeying His Sheriat. With
best wishes, I am, Sincerely yours, S. S. Akhtar Rizvi.

Question:

Satan was one of the Angels. Angels were not given the power of doing
things according to their free will, power and intention. How did Satan
come to disobey Allah while he was bound to Allah's commandments and
guidance?

Answer:

Satan was not from the angels. Qur'an repeatedly says that he is from
Jinns. Jinns, like human beings, have been given free will and they are
expected, like human beings, to obey, the commands of Allah by their
free will and power.

Question:

According to our belief (Shia), a prophet is sinless. Why should we
pray for our Holy Prophet of Islam during prayers and other times, when
we believe that he was Masum? Answer:

We pray for our Holy Prophet in obedience to the command of Allah: -
The benefit of 'Salawat' returns to us as the Holy Prophet has said:
'Whoever among you sends one Salawat to me, I pray for him 10 times."
The Mercy and Grace of Allah is limitless. Our Holy Prophet was already
bestowed with Grace of Allah more than any one else. But it does not
mean that the Grace has reached its limit: it has no limit. Therefore,
we pray for him so that Allah may bestow him with His ever-new Graces
and Mercies.

Moreover, we praise and thank Allah and pray before him, though He has
no need of our prayers, thanks and praises. But by doing so, we express
and show our relation and gratitude to Him. Likewise, the Holy Prophet
has no need of our 'Salawat'; but by ordering us to recite 'Salawat'
Allah wants us to express our relation with, and gratitude to, the Holy
Prophet.

Question:

How is it that there are differences in praying while the prayer was
taught by our Holy Prophet himself?

Answer: I am sending you "Light" Vol. I No.1. You read it and will find
out how the system of prayer was changed.

Question:

What support do the Sunnis have, that Music is allowed provided that it
is not "Kufur"?

Answer:

I do not know but it seems that this rule was established to justify
the music parties of the kings of Bani Ummaya and Bani Abbas Sincerely
yours
