The Blessed Boy
===============

The years passed. Makkah and its villages dried up because there was no
rain.

The people came to Shaikh al-Bat-ha. They asked him to pray to Allah for
rain. They said: “Abu-Talib, the valley's become rainless. Our families
are without food. So come on and pray to Allah for rain.”

Abu Talib went out. He had great confidence in Allah. He took his
nephew, Muhammad with him.

Abu Talib and Muhammad stood beside the Ka'aba. The boy's heart took a
pity on the people. Abu Talib asked Ibrahim's and Ismael's Lord to send
down heavy rain.

Muhammad looked at the sky.

Only a little time passed. The sky was full of clouds. Lightening
flashed. Thunder sounded. The rain came down heavily.

The rain water flowed in the villages. The people came back pleased
thanking Allah for the blessing of the rain. Abu Talib also came back.
His love for his nephew increased very much.

The years passed. Muhammad became a young man. He was extremely polite.
So, people called him the Truthful, the Trustworthy One.
