S - Sahl Ibn Saad
=================

One of the companions of the Prophet (pbuh&hf) and loyal followers of
Imam Ali. When he saw the women of Ahlul Bayt coming towards Damascus,
he went to one of them, introduced himself and then asked if there was
anything he could do for them.

Sakeena said that it would be appreciated if he could make the holder of
Imam Husayn's head move away from them so that people would stop looking
at the daughters of the Prophet. Sahl payed 400 Dinars to the holder of
the head, and in return asked for him to do as Sakeenah had asked of
him. Sahl died at the age of 96 or 100 on 88 AH.
