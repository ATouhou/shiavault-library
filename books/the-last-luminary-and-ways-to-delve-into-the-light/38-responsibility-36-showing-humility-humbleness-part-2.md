Responsibility 36: Showing Humility & Humbleness Part 2
=======================================================

A true believer’s entire presence must show humility to the 12th Imam.
By this we mean that every part of our body must be in the service of
and ready to carry out the commands of the Imam.

We must know that in the presence of the Imam, we are weak and
insignificant and that it is the Imam who possesses greatness and
magnimity. In addition, we must follow the Imam by our actions and our
heart.

Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad as-Sadiq (as) has said the following in his
supplication for the day of Friday:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّـي أَتَقَرَّبُ إِلَيْكَ بِقَلْبٍ خَاضِعٍ وَ إِلـىٰ
وَلِيِّكَ بِبَدَنٍ خَاشِعٍ وَ إِلـىٰ الأَئِمَّةِ الرَّاشِدِينَ
بِفُؤَادٍ مُتَوَاضِعٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“O’ Allah! Indeed I seek nearness to you with a submissive heart, and (I
seek nearness) to your representative with a body that is humble; and (I
seek nearness) to the rightly guided A\`immah by a heart filled with
humility.”[^1]
