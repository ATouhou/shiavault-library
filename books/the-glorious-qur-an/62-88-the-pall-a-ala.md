88: the Pall (a`ala)
====================

These 26 early Meccan verses were revealed after Winnowing [Winds] 51
and before The Cave 18. Here Muhammad's Divine charge or Prophetic
commission is announced.

The chapter gives a clear picture of the final Judgment and its ultimate
reward. It ends somewhat like the passage to the hills around do I lift
up my longing eyes" found in Psalm 121.
