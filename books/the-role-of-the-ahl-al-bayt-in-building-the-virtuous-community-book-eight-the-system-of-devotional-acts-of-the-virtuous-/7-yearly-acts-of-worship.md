Yearly Acts of Worship
======================

The acts of worship that are done once a year occupy a vast arena in the
system of devotional acts. They are of three kinds:

Special Days and Nights
-----------------------

Special days and nights are associated with the yearly acts of worship
that have come in the form of rituals.

Three Blessed Months
--------------------

The three blessed months are Rajab, Sha’ban, and Ramadhan. Their basic
act of worship is fasting, becoming obligatory in the blessed month of
Ramadhan. It is thus highly recommended to fast during the month of
Rajab.

Fasting during Sha’ban is also highly recommended because the Holy
Prophet (S) used to fast for this whole month.

It is obligatory to fast during Ramadhan according to the conditions
mentioned by jurisprudents in their books on the practical laws of
Islam. Some conditions necessary are: presence in one’s hometown,
enjoyment of sound physical condition, and absence of any obstacles that
may prevent fasting, such as old age, etc.

Hajj and the First Ten Days of Dhu’l-Hijjah
-------------------------------------------

This includes devotional acts that deal with the ritual *Hajj* and the
devotional acts practiced on the first ten days of the month of
Dhu’l-Hijjah. In addition to its magnificent spiritual, political,
social, and economic aspects, the unique and distinctive worship of
*Hajj*, in its content and practice, combines all the other acts of
worship (the ritual prayer, almsgiving, fasting, and self-purification).

We will discuss the last two with brief explanations, having already
discussed specific days and nights.
