Lesson One Hundred Twenty Four: Take Counsel To Be Guided!
==========================================================

Imam Hasan (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ما تَشاوَرَ قَوْمٌ إلاّ هُدُوا إلى رُشْدِهِمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Nations in which consultation with each other is practiced, are always
guided to their welfare and benefit.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Group work always produces synergistic benefits, improvement and
development. When many heads come together, their collective experience
and knowledge can be tapped to facilitate planning, problem solving,
productivity, creativity and innovation.

Those who have become self-opinionated and obstinate often suffer from
mistakes and losses. Everyone has unique mental powers. One mind may
produce a brain wave that would never occur to another. When the bright
ideas of many minds combine , they would produce a light that can
illuminate any darkness. Let us all decide to adopt the practice of
always consulting with informed and intelligent persons.
