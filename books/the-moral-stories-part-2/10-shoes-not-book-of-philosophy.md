Shoes Not Book of Philosophy
============================

It was a day of Idd and Bahlool went to a mosque for prayers. There was
multitude of people and the place was getting congested. When he arrived
at the door, he was large number of shoes and sandles scattered
around.

Since his shoes wen stolen before, he feared he might again lose them
if he did not take care this time. Hence he took out a handkerchief and
covering around his shoes, he entered the mosque and sat in one corner.
A man sitting near him seeing a parcel covered and being taken care of
said to Bahlool:

"I guess you are holding a valuable book. Can you tell me of what
subject it is?"

Bahlool replied:

"It is on philosophy."

The man then asked him; "Where and from which bookshop you have
purchased?" Bahlool replied:
"From a shoe-maker shop have I purchased"


**HAROON'S NEW PALANCE**

It took quite some time for Haroon to get a new palace built for
himself. When ready, he was one day walking about on the top of it,
enjoying the scenery and the beauty around him. Suddenly, his attention
was drawn downwards towards Bahlool who was passing by and gazing at the
structure of the palace. Haroon called him saying:

"Oh Bahlooll I have a request to make to you. Can you suggest some
suitable words for this magnificent new palace of mine?"

Bahlool instantly found a piece of charcoal and scribbed thickly over
the wall of the palace with the following words:

"You have raised the earth-bricks whilst you have lowered your religion
(subordinated religious principles) If you have raised this building
from your own money, then you have acted extrava-vently. And if you have
built it from the money belonging to others (public treasury) then
verily you have commited oppression and Allah does not like the
oppressors"

How wice befitting is the following saying of Imam Jaffer Sadique
(A.S.): "Whoever acquires wealth illicitly, becomes subdued and involved
in such a construction work which would absorb all such wealth which is
spent after eerth, water and construction work.

Ultimately, he departs from this world before he is able to enjoy the
advantage and pleasure of his buildings fully" Bahlool was one of such
people as described by Ali bin Abi Tabib (as) in one of his sermons:
"There are some people devoted to the remembrance (of Allah) who have
adopted it in place of worldly matters so that commerce or trade does
not turn them away from it.

They pass their life in it. They speak into the ears of neglectful
persons warning against matters held unlawful by Allah," (Nahjul
Balaghah sermon 222)


**Refund Of Loan On Reapperrance Of Imam**

Someone decided to tease Bahlool on the belief of the concealed 12th
Imam and his reappearance one day to establish a rule of equity and
justice throughout the world.

In a sitting where Bahlool was also present, he said this to him:
"Don't you cherish the belief that your Imam (the 12th Imam Hazrat Mahdi
(A.F.) will reappear in the end of time and establish a rule of justice?
if you are firm on this belief, why not loan to me now five hundred
dinars and I shall repay when your Imam reappears."

In reply, Bahlool told him:

"Undoubtedly this is my belief and I am willing to loan you the money
on a condition. And it is this that you provide a guarantee that you
will not then be transformed into a pig or a dog. Should you then become
so, from whom shall I recover my money?"

Hearing this, those present raised a big laughter and the one who was
out to tease Bahlool became dumbfounded.

And Bahlool lifting his stick left the place and went away. Recognizing
the Imam of the age is so important and essential that the Holy Prophet
(S.A.VV.) had said:

"He who dies without recognizing the Imam of his age is like the one
who died during the jahiliyya (the pagan era before me advent of Islam)
To die during jahiliyya means a death devoid of Islam and faith.
