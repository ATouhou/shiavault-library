6. The Attribution of Forgetfulness to Allah
============================================

Abu Ja‘far cites: "Forgetfulness, like beguiling, can only be applied to
Allah in the sense that with this He will requite the evil-doers."

Abu ‘Abdillah adds that the true interpretation is not what has been
advanced, because forgetfulness literaly signifies both abandonment and
postponement. Allah, the Exalted, says:

***Whatever verse We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one
better than it or the like of it [2:106].***

Now, here,'what We abrogate' means, 'We leave it in place or suspend
it'. Hence, the Exalted, means by 'They forget Allah', that 'they
departed from their obedience to Allah', and He meant by 'so He forgot
them', that, 'He withdraws His mercy from them'. And He means by:

***So He makes them forget their own souls [59:19]***

that 'He made them uneasy through His withdrawal, and that He obliged
them to disregard their own good and not to care for their own
interest'. This is a tenable interpretation of the verse, though the
other one, advanced by Abu Ja‘far, is not refuted, and Allah, the
Exalted, is the granter of success.
