Need of Friends
===============

There is no one in the world who does not need friends. The more friends
we have the more successful our lives will be. A learned man has said,
“One who thinks that he does not need friends is like the simpleton who
tells the sun that he does not care whether it rises or sets”.

It should also be remembered that it is necessary to be careful in the
selection of friends. Making more friends does not mean that we should
have firm relations with anyone and everyone. If we befriend unmannerly
and lazy people, their bad habits will gradually affect us and we shall
become lazy and worthless like them. This will make us lose our esteem
in the eyes of others.

There is a well-known proverb: “A man is known by the company he keeps”.
We should, therefore, befriend those people who are good mannered, pious
and hard-working. Islam says that two companions should act as preachers
for each other and each one of them should point out the shortcomings of
the other. So by associating with such people we shall overcome our
weaknesses and advance on the path of progress.

It should also not be forgotten that making friends is not sufficient;
but it is also necessary to retain their friendship. This would be
possible only when we behave with them properly and sincerely. Imam Ali
(a) has said:

“A man who has no friends is very poor. And poorer than he, is he who
cannot retain the friendship and loses his friends”.

A man is known by the company he keeps.
