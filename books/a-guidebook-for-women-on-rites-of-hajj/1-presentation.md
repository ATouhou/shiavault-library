Dear Sister in Islam,

May Allah (swt) grant you the Great Opportunity of Pilgrimage to the
House of Allah (swt) with Deeper Understanding and Higher Spirituality
in your A 'amals (Inshallah)

Iltemas al-Du 'a

“There is nothing better than a Woman who has achieved Perfection in her
spiritual being!”

In the course of time, we have come across books of Guidance and Wisdom
that concentrate on Islamic Rituals that aim to educate all Muslim
Brothers & Sisters on a general level; however, The Guidebook for Women
series aim to provide a concise manual on different Islamic Rituals and
Issues, especially for Women in order to perfect their lbaadah.

After all, the *'adhmat* (greatness) of Women can only be reached when
they follow Seerat al-Faatimat uz-Zahra (sa) by means of educating
themselves further and gaining more Ma'rifat and Spirituality in their
Islamic rituals.

It is important to realize that Allah (swt) has given Women such a grand
status that, despite being equal to Man, her Spirituality significantly
affects and transfers on to everyone around her Family, Husband,
Children, Friends, Colleagues, Neighbors, and many more.

Hence, these series of Guidebooks aim to Answer all the Questions a
Woman would have in relation to Islamic Issues in order to help them
gain more Ma'rifat and Spirituality in their Religious acts, and include
it as a normal practice in their everyday life. (lnshallah)
