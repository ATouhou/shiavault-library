Foreword
========

Rites are considered among the matters of worship whose depths cannot
be fathomed by humans, nor their philosophy be completely comprehended
nor the purpose behind their legislation understood. . . ! Rather, the
believer must perform them as means of submitting and seeking nearness
to Allah, to Whom belong Might and Majesty.

Man has achieved tremendous scientific advancement. This has caused the
new genera- tion to be inquisitive about the logic and aims from such
parrot worship.

The renowned Muslim scholar as-Sayyid Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr has
answered this question in this invaluable booklet A General Look at
Rites.

We have already given a brief introduction of the author in the
foreword of his other book namely The Revealer, the Mess- enger and the
Message in its English translation. We praise the Almighty Allah Who be-
stowed on us the success of translating and publishing this book. We
pray to Him to help us continuously in accomplishing our aims in the
service of His cause. He is the Supreme Master, the Supreme Helper.
