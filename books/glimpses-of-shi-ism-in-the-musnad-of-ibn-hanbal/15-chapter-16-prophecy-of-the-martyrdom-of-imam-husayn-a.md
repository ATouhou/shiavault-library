Chapter 16 : Prophecy of the Martyrdom of Imam Husayn (‘a)
==========================================================

Ibn Hanbal says:

Muhammad bin ‘Ubayd has related to us from Sharhabi-l bin Madrak from
‘Abdulla-h bin Nujayy from his father who narrates that he was marching
with (Imam) ‘Ali- [(‘a)] towards Siffi-n and when we reached Ninevah,
(Imam) ‘Ali- [(‘a)] cried in a loud voice:

“O Aba- ‘Abdilla-h! Be patient. O Aba- ‘Abdilla-h! Be patient beside
the River Euphrates.”

I asked him:

For what?

He said:

“Once when I went to the Prophet I saw tears in his eyes and asked
him:

O Messenger of Allah (S) who has made you upset? Why are your eyes
moist with tears?

He said:

Bal qa-ma min ‘indi- Jibra’i-lu qabl, fahaddathani- anna al-Husayn
yuqtulu bishatt al-Fura-t. Qa-la: Hal laka an ushimaka min turbatih?
Qa-la: Qultu: Na‘am. Famadda yadahu faqabaza qabzatan min tura-bin fa
a‘ta-ni-ha-. falam amliku ‘ayni- an fa-zata- (A while ago [the
Archangel] Gabriel left. He has informed me that indeed Husayn will be
killed beside the River Euphrates.

Then he [the Prophet] said:

Do you like to smell part of his soil [where Imam Husayn (‘a) will be
killed].

I said:

Yes.

He stretched his hand and taking a fistful of soil gave it to me. As a
result, tears started rolling down uncontrollably from my eyes.)”[^61]

The annotator of the Musnad regards the isna-d of this hadith as sahi-h
and writes that Nujayy is not the only one to narrate this from Imam
‘Ali- (‘a).
