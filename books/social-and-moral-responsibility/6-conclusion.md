Conclusion
==========

The effectiveness of HEIs in supporting the development of students’
social and moral responsibility rests on an holistic approach,
encompassing the institutional ethos; culture; structures and
pedagogies. While active learning focusing on engagement and rational
debate can support the development of students’ ability to recognise and
consider ethical issues, the environment in which this takes place must
reflect an ethos that promotes positive relationships and values such as
respect, honesty and caring.

Mass market, consumerist approaches to higher education may fail to
provide students with the necessary environment in which social and
moral development can take place effectively. Students need
opportunities to engage in learning communities that both respect their
individuality and support their involvement with others in mutually
created learning experiences that nurture debate and challenge their
thinking.
