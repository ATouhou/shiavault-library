Intention
=========

The person who has a sincere intention is the one who has a sound
heart; because a sound heart, free from thoughts about forbidden things,
comes from making your intention purely for Allah in all matters.

  <p>
يَوْمَ لَا يَنفَعُ مَالٌ وَلَا بَنُونَ. إِلَّا مَنْ أَتَى اللَّهَ
بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>



***The day on which neither property will avail, nor sons, except him
who comes to Allah with a heart free [from evil].*** (26:88-9)


The Holy Prophet said, 'The intention of the believer is better than
his action,' and also, 'Actions are by intentions, and every man will
obtain what he had intended.' The slave of Allah must therefore have
sincere intention in every moment of action and stillness because then
he will not be heedless. Those who are heedless have been censured by
Allah:


<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا كَالْأَنْعَامِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

*** ***

***They are nothing but as cattle; nay, they are straying farther off
from the path.*** (25:44)



<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْغَافِلُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***These are the heedless ones***. (7:179)


Intention appears from the heart, according to the purity of knowledge.
It varies as belief varies, at different moments in its strength and
weakness. The selfishness and passion of those with sincere intention is
subjugated to the power of the glorification of Allah and modesty before
Him. He is by his nature, his appetites and his own desires, in a state
of discomfort, and yet people find ease at his hand.
