The Exigency of Presenting Samples:
===================================

The presentation of samples is vital both for the adolescents and the
adults. The young generation are affected by the adults, and the adults
leave impression on the children, and naturally, every one of us takes
effect from the one we love.

The language of samples sound clearer and livelier than the language of
books and writings. I am to say that what is seen leaves more effect on
us than what is heard.

Though seeing, we even feel the facts, as our heart looks for what our
eyes have perceived.

The Divine religions have presented samples before they take action. The
instructors also endeavor to present their syllabus and educational
systems through examples.

The samples are effective in the society construction or deconstruction,
due to the fact that human beings are by nature the hero-worshippers.
All of us try to discover our ideals in the other persons or objects,
and then admire and show resemblance to them.

Our practical experience in both our personal and social life is a
living proof to this claim. Study the behavior of your child; to whom
does his acts resemble, and whose behavior is embodied in his manner?
This is more or less case in the adults, too. In other words, anyone
take steps to adopt a hero who embodies higher qualities.
