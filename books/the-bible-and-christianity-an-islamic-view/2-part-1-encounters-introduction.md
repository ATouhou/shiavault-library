Part 1: Encounters : Introduction
=================================

Islam always relied on dialogue and reason to promote its stance and
disseminate its teachings. Contrary to the Islamophobics who falsely
assert that Islam spread its message by the sword, Islam attracted
devout followers from the four corners of the world through reason, by
encouraging the other side to ponder and reflect on what Islam had to
say. This approach takes its lead from Allah’s instructions in the
Qur’anic verse, {Invite (the people) to the Way of your Lord – Islam –
with wisdom and good exhortation . . .}1

Armed with reason and logic, the Muslim faithful addresses any debate
with an open mind and without any prejudice, for he is only interested
in the Truth. Thus the starting point for a Muslim faithful and his
attitude in such debates would be based on the Qur’anic verse, {and we
or you are either rightly guided or in manifest error}2

It is on this basis that the author conducted his debates with
non-Muslims, as can be seen from the presentation in this book.

Coupled with this approach of wisdom and reasoning, is another means
that complements the first, and that is tolerance, leniency,
perseverance and forgiveness. Taking lead from such Qur’anic verses as
{and argue with them in a manner that is best}3, this approach too is
highly encouraged in Islam, and is manifested in the teachings and
conducts of the final messenger of Allah, Prophet Muhammad peace be upon
him and his progeny, as well as in those of the impeccable Imams of this
progeny.

Imam Ali peace be upon him, reports, “The holy prophet Muhammad
personally owed a Jew some money, and one morning the Jew came to the
prophet and demanded his money. The prophet told him that he does not
have any money so that he could give him any of his dues. The Jew said,
“I am not going to leave you alone, until you give me the money”. The
Jew effectively confined and restricted the prophet Muhammad peace be
upon him. Since the Jew imposed that restriction upon the prophet and
the latter owed the former, he complied with him. This is at a time when
the prophet Muhammad was not only the Messenger of God; he was also a
ruler and a head of the Islamic state, commanding considerable power
and

influence. When it was time for the midday prayers the prophet
performed the prayers, and this standby continued when the prophet
performed the prayers for other times, and until the following day, the
Jew remained alongside the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him and his
family. The companions of the prophet were enraged by the conduct of the
Jew, and they started to threaten him. Objecting to their behaviour, the
prophet asked them, “What are you doing?” they replied, “O Messenger of
Allah! A Jew has detained you!”

Prophet Muhammad replied, “My Lord has not sent me to wrong one who is
under the protection of the Islamic state, nor anyone else!” By midday
of the following day, having seen the conduct of the prophet of Islam,
the Jew said, “I testify there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is
His Servant and Messenger . . . and I give half of my money in the cause
of Allah . . .”4

Taking lead from the Qur’anic verse {and if the ignorant address them
they reply (in) peace}5, when a Christian man came to Imam Baqir and
said to him mockingly, “Are you Baqar (meaning cow)?” The Imam peace be
upon him replied, “I am Baqir (literally meaning the splitter of
knowledge, i.e. being the most knowledgeable of his time, as he then
known).” He said, “are you not the son of a cook?” The Imam replied,
“That is her skill.”

The Christian man then went on to say to the Imam, “are you not the son
of the obscene Negro?” The Imam calmly replied, “If you are saying the
truth, then may Allah forgive her, and if you are saying lies, then may
Allah forgive you.” The calm, courteous and non-violent replies of the
Imam lead the Christian man to the truth that the Imam had, and embraced
Islam whole-heartedly. It was in such ways that prophet Muhammad, peace
be upon him and his pure family, used to deal with others; through
leniency and compassion, tolerance, forgiveness, and magnanimity, such
that he managed to attract the hearts and minds of the people. In this
respect Allah Almighty states, 4 Sheikh al-Sadouq, “al-Amali”, p 465.

5 The Holy Qur'an, The Criterion (25): 63. Encounters

{It is part of the Mercy of Allah that thou dost deal gently with them.
Were thou severe or harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from
about thee . . .}6

In this way, Islam has today attracted some two billion followers, and
this is despite all the atrocities that have been committed by so-called
Muslims in the name of Islam over many centuries.

What follows is the script of one of many encounters between muslins
and non-Muslims at the outset of dawn of Islam some 1400 years ago.
