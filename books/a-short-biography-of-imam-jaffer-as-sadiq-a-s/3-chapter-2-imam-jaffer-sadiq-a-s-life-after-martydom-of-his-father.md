Chapter 2 : Imam Jaffer Sadiq (a.s) Life After Martydom of His Father
=====================================================================

**INTRODUCTION:**

Imam Jaffer Sadiq (A.S) took over as the Imam of the time from his
father in AH 114 when Hisham Bin Abdul Malik was the Caliph. Unlike most
of his predecessors, who had ruled for veiy short times and therefore
did not have enough time to obstruct the progress of Islamic Education
propagated by Imam Baqir and Imam Sadiq (A.S.), Hisham ruled for 22
years.

He became a real threat to Islam, especially in the later years of his
life. Imam Sadiq (A.S) therefore had to do two things. First and
foremost, he had to protect all the educational progress that his
grandfather, his father and he himself had achieved up to this point in
time.

Second, he had to play down his role as the champion of Islamic
learning and wait for another opportunity to arise, and then to continue
his work from where he had left it. In this chapter, we shall see how he
succeeded in accomplishing these two goals.

**HIS RESPONSIBILITIES AS THE IMAM OFTHE TIME:**

Remember that when Imam Baqir (A.S) was about to depart form this
world, he had asked Imam Sadiq (A.S.) to be fully responsible for the
"ummah'.

Imam Sadiq (A. S) had promised to do just that, but to do so through
the process of education and learning. This is the key to understand the
Imam's reaction to various situations that arose during twenty four
years of his Imamat.

Imam (A.S.) had two options to choose from: Either involve himself in
political activities and bring down the oppressive rulership of the
Ummayades, or seek reform through the process of education. At that
time, the political option appeared to be the better of the two
choices.

but if we look at the events now; we can realize that the second option
was. indeed, the best option, and we can appreciate Imam Sadiq's wisdom
and deep foresight in choosing this option to bring about necessary
changes in the society.

Before we examine Imam Sadiq's approach, let us look at the reasons
which made people at that time, think that the political choice was the
only choice available.

The Ummayade rulers were cruel carefree and completely incapable of
ruling effectively. They did not care for Islam or the Muslims.

To meet their own ever-using expenses, the rulers overburdened their
subjects with taxation and exhausted resources, with the result that
there were dissatisfaction and uprising throughout the empire.

By putting down these upn sings, the Ummayad rulers only made
themselves more unpopular and, not only did they weaken themselves, but
also paved way for further uprisings. Syed Ameer Ali described this
situation thus: "The flower of the nation had perished either in the
civil wars or under the suspicious policy of a jealous court.

The blind confidence reposed by the last sovereign in his ministers had
thrown the government in the hands of incomplete and self-seeking
functionaries whose incapacity and misrule alienated the people.

Hisham was little fitted by character or disposition to cope with
difficulties, which now beset the empire. The frequent change of
governors led to disastrous consequences."

**(A SHORT HISTORY OF THE SARACEN AS):**

Then, it was clear that time was ripe for those with leadership
abilities and some recognition in Muslim society to organize themselves
to topple the I mmayade dynasty. Imam Jaffer Sadiq (A.S), in the eyes of
his contempora-ries, was the ideal person for this task. However, Imam
(A.S) had a different opinion.

When proposals came to him to do so, he flatly refused to get himself
involved politically. How right the Imam was, we shall see in the course
of this chapter.

Whereas Imam Jaffer Sadiq (A.S) refused to seize this opportunity,
there were others who were tempted to so. They went after it and the
result was disaster and destruction for them. This subject w ill be
discussed elaborately in Chapter 3 and 4.

At this juncture, we shall describe briefly the merits of Imam Jaffer
Sadiq's (A.S) approach and its impact on the welfare of humanity in
general and Muslims in particular.

**THE STRATEGY OF REFORMING THE CORRITT SOCIETY THROUGH THE PROCESS OF
EDI CATION AND LEARNING:**

Zaid, Imam Muhammad Baqirs step-brother, and later on his son, Yahya,
decided to take the political choice.

Similarly, later on, Imam Hasan's grandson Abdullah Mahaz and his two
sons Muhammad (popularly known as 'Nafse Zakiah" - the pure soul) and
Ibrahim, too, decided to get involved politically to counteract the
Ummayad oppression. The outcome of their approach will be discussed in
chapter 3 and 4.

The grandchildren of Abbas, the Prophet's uncle, by the name of Abu
Abbas (later on came to be known as Saffah "The bloodshedder") and Abu
Jaffer (later on came to be known as Mansoor —""the victorious"), too,
chose to agitate against the Ummayad rulers. The outcome of their
struggle will be assessed in chapter 3 and 4. The activity of these
agitators was mostly in Iraq, Persia and to some extent in the Peninsula
of Arabia.

Similar agitations were also brewing in Syria, Africa, Spain, and in
those parts of Central Asia and Europe where the Ummayad rulership
extended.

Hisham Bin Abdul Malik Bin Merwan had considered these threats more
serious than Imam Sadiq's education program in Medina.

He therefore put to full use his energies and resources to suppress
these agitators so as to save his throne. Imam Jaffer Sadiq (A.S) took
this opportunity to carry out his mission that had been put to a
temporary halt by Hisham.


**Imam Sadiq's "Revolution' Through Education**

After a short interruption, Imam Jaffer Sadiq (A.S) resumed his
teaching program, knowing that it was now safe to do so.

Whereas Imam Zainul Abeedin (A.S) and Imam Baqir (A.S) had fully
established the Center of Learning.

Imam Sadiq (AS) went ahead; he helped it to attain a status similar to
a modern university.

**DEVELGPM ENT OF THE CENTER OF LEARN ING TO HAVE THE STATUS OF A
MODERN-TYPE UNIVERSITY**

The most outstanding characteristics of a university are:-

• It is a place of advanced learning

• It is an institute that disseminates both pure and applied knowledge
on a wide range of disciplines.

• The teachers of this institute are highly talented with proven
experience in their respective fields of learning.

• It has a very rich source of information to facilitate independent
research for those students wishing to specialize in a branch of
knowledge that interests them most.

• The teaching method employed in this institute has basically two
features: Lectures given to a full class and tutorials (or seminars)
where the classes are smaller in size and there is an informal
interaction between the tutor and the students.

A university that develops on these principles builds ?ts reputation,
which is reflected through the high quality of students that it
produces, and the volume of information that it generates.

The public both national and international - then gives recognition to
such an institution. The ultimate result is seekers of knowledge
throughout the civilized world Hock around such an institution.

Imam Jaffer Sadiq's Institution had all these qualities as revealed by
the curriculum as well as the methodology that had been adopted by Imam
(A.S).

**THE CURRICULUM OF THE INSTITUTE:**

The core of the curriculum was to teach correct Islamic knowledge as
contained in the Holy Quran and explained by the Prophet (S.A.W.W) and
the divinely appointed Imams from the progeny of the Prophet - the AHLUL
BAYT.

The focus was on TAFSEER or that science of the Quran that dealt, in
detail, with such issues as the surface and the underlying meaning of
the various verses. the circumstances under which each verse was
revealed and the correct interpretation of the commands and lessons of
the Quran.

FIQH-( Islamic jurisprudence or law) was another subject that was given
special attention. Theoretic as well as practical problems were
addressed and their solutions worked out during the FIQH session.

The science of 'HADITH’ had also an important position in the classes
of Imam Sadiq (A.S). A very important concept was explained: the concept
of the Golden Chain of Narration. The essence of this concept was any
tradition that an Imam from Ahlul Bayt mentions has a continues chain of
narrators (all being Imams) that links it to the Prophet (S.A.W.W.)
whose source is the Angle Gabriel whose source is Allah, the Almighty
Himself.

In an age when false “hadith” were being fabricated and associated with
the Prophet (S.A.W.W), Imam (A.S) taught his students a golden yardstick
to use in differentiating a true hadith from a false one.

He said any hadith that contradicts any verse of the Quran is a false
one and has no merit. Moreover, to counter the false hadith. Imam (A.S)
introduced the correct but hitherto unknown hadith in thousands on
various subjects pertaining to the basics of faith, ethics, and all
other matters of life and death.

He encouraged his students not only to memorize these hadiths. but
record them in writing so as to avert the problem of misrepresentation
in the future. He left the task of classification these hadith to his
graduates.

Imam also taught ISLAMIC: HISTORY with the focus on the biography of
the Prophet (S.A.W.W) - the "SEERAI-T. He provided a complete and
correct picture of the life of the Prophet to counteract the falsified
versions that was the work of those false scholars paid to do so by the
Ummayad rulers.

Apart from these broad ‘core’ subjects students with special aptitudes
and interests were encouraged to develop then skills at such specialized
disciplines as the Arabic Language and Literature, Philosophy, Logic and
Physical Science like Chemistry and Biology.

Capable students were encouraged to carry out their research under the
tutelage of the Imam himself, and to write books for future usage. These
students were also encouraged to become teachers who could then go out
far and wide in the world to preach the true message of Islam.

There were five students whom the Imam trusted most and singled them
out to be the future teachers in the event that when the Imam was gone
and the institute closed by the rulers; these students were Band Bin
Muawiyah, Abu Basii; Layth Bin Murad, Zararah Bin Ain, and Muhammad bin
Muslim.

Imam (A.S) considered them as "trustees of Allah" for their
administration of the permissible (halal) and the forbidden (haram) in
religion.

As a result of this encouragement, several thousand books were written
by the the students of the Institute. Out of these, 400 books were on
fundamentals of faith (FURUU).

After the passing away of the Imam (A.S) and when the University was
closed down by the Abbaside ruler Mansoor, the Shia came to depend on
these books heavily Later on, scholars prepared digests and summaries of
these books for the use of the followers of the "Madhab of Ahlulbayt."
Four of these books became the 'core' books and continue to be so. These
books are:

1. AL-KAFI - authored by -Kulaini
2. AL-TAHDHIB - authored by Tusi
3. AL-ISTIBSAR - authored by Tusi
4. MAN LA YAHDARAH AL-FAQIH authored by Sudduk.
