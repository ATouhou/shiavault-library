Commentary : Verse 33
=====================

33- وَالسَّلاَمُ عَلَيَّ يَوْمَ وُلِدتُّ وَيَوْمَ أَمُوتُ وَيَوْمَ
اُبْعَثُ حَيّاً

33. " And peace be on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the
day I shall be raised alive."

**Commentary:**

Then, finally, from the tongue of this newborn Child (Hadrat Messiah)
the verse says:

" And peace be on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day
I shall be raised alive."

This statement has occurred both about Yahya (John)(1) (a.s.) and about
Jesus Christ (a.s.).

Hadrat Imam Rida (a.s.) said: "The most horrible days of a man are
three days: the birth day, the day of death, and the Day of Hereafter."
('Uyun 'Akhbar-ir-Rida, vol. 1, p. 257)

1- Sura Maryam, No. 19, verse 15


**Commentary : Verse 34.35**

34- ذَلِكَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ قَوْلَ الْحَقِّ الَّذِى فِيهِ
يَمْتَرُونَ

35- مَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ مِن وَلَدٍ سُبْحَانَهُ إِذَا قَضَى
أَمْراً فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ

34. " This is Jesus, son of Mary, a statement of truth, concerning
which they doubt."

35. " It is not befitting to Allah that He should beget a son. Glory be
to Him! When He decrees a thing, He only says unto it: 'Be', and it
is."

**Commentary:**

Formerly the Qur'an illustrated clearly the event of the birth of Jesus
through previous verses. Now, it refers to the negation of the
superstitions and the polytheistic words that they have said about Jesus
(a.s.). It says:

" This is Jesus, son of Mary, …"

The Qur'an emphasizes on the fact that Jesus is the son of Mary, in
order to negate his being as the son of God, and then, it adds:

"… a statement of truth, concerning which they doubt."

Then, in the next verse, it explicitly says:

" It is not befitting to Allah that He should beget a son. Glory be to
Him! …"

But, if He intends something and commands, He says to it 'Be' and it
will come into being, too. The verse continues saying:

" … When He decrees a thing, He only says unto it: 'Be', and it is."

This statement indicates that having son for Allah, in the form that
the Christians imagine it unto Him, does not fit the sanctity of the
Rank of Allah. On one side, its requisite is the existence of body, and
on the other side, there should be considered a limitation for Him, and
on the third side, Allah does not need anything.

The expression saying "'Be' and it is" is a very lively illustration
unto the vast power of Allah and His domination and sovereignty over the
subject of creation.

**Explanations:**

Jesus Christ (a.s.) has been introduced through the afore mentioned
verses by seven outstanding epithets and two accomplishments.

A. The epithets of Jesus Christ:

1. To be a servant of Allah: "Verily am a servant of Allah."
2. To bring a heavenly Book: "…He has given me the Book."
3. To be a prophet: "…and made me a prophet."
4. To be blessed: "And He has made me blessed."
5. To be kind unto the mother: "And (He has made me) kind to my
mother."
6. Not to be arrogant and unblessed: "He not made me arrogant and
unblessed."
7. To be humble, gratitude, and prosperous: "And peace be on me."

One of them is prayer and the other is almsgiving (zakat). The above
mentioned verse says that the truth about Jesus is just what Allah said:
"This is Jesus, son of Mary".

In the holy Qur'an, the Christians have been repeatedly mentioned as
deviated whose belief about Christ, as the son of God, is wrong. For
example, in Sura Al-Ma'idah, No. 5, verse 73, it says: "certainly they
disbelieve who say: 'Verily Allah is the third of the three', …" And, in
Sura At-Taubah, No. 9, verse 30, it says: " …and the Christians say:
'The Messiah is the son of God' …". But, this verse, shows the correct
argument in response to these erroneous claims regarding the
characteristics of Jesus.

There is no need to say that the Will of Allah comes into being, even
without the expression of 'Be', but Allah has described His Will for us
in this manner so that we could understand it.

Allah is Omnipotent, and He is not in need of anything or any means in
creating, His infinite Power is a reason why He is far exalted from
powerlessness and from begetting a son.

**The Qur'an and the Christ:**

As a result of the stiff pressure that the pagans of Mecca put upon the
followers of the Prophet of Islam (p.b.u.h.) , a group of Muslims,
accompanied by Ja'far-ibn-Abitalib, by the order of the Prophet
(p.b.u.h.) , migrated to Ethiopia (Abyssinia). The pagans of the Quraysh
thought that if the Muslims could become powerful there and form a
government, they would be able to root out the idolatry that the
polytheists practiced. They sent 'Amru'as and with a delegation to
Ethiopia bearing presents for the ministers of Najashi, the king of
Abyssinia.

Those ministers took the presents from them to put Najashi to motion
against the emigrant Muslims. But Najashi decided to personally summon
the Muslims and hearken to their sayings. Ja'far, who was the
representative of the Muslims, began speaking at the presence of the
king of Ethiopia. He said his words about the wrongdoings of idolatry,
superstitions and transgressions of the Age of Ignorance. He informed
Najashi of the advent of Islam and luminosity of the religion of Hadrat
Muhammad (p.b.u.h.) . Ja'far spoke so influentially that Najashi wept
and sent the pagans' presents back to them. He said: "The Lord, Who gave
me power, did not take bribery from me. Why should I take bribery from
you?"

That meeting ended with the benefit of Muslims and the loss of
infidels. After this defeat, 'Amru'as contemplated and, on the following
day, offered the king a new suggestion. In order to excite the religious
zeal of Najashi, he told him that Muslims had some notions which were
against his belief. Najashi summoned Muslims once more and asked them
their belief about Messiah (a.s.). In answer to him, Ja'far Tayyar
recited some verses of the Qur'an from Sura Maryam up to the verse which
says: " This is Jesus, son of Mary, a statement of truth, concerning
which they doubt.". By hearing the verses of the Qur'an, Najashi shed
tears and said: "This is the truth". After this second defeat, when
'Amru'as? wanted to start another new effort, Najashi raised his hand
and gave him a sharp slap in his face.(1)

**Commentary : Verse 36**

36- وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ رَبّـِى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَذَا صِرَاطٌ
مُّسْتَقِيمٌ

36. " And verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship (only) Him.
This is a straight path."

**Commentary:**

The persistence of Messiah (a.s.) on Monotheism, and his emphasis that
the straight path is only this one, is an answer to the adherents of
trinity as well as others. (A similar text to the abovementioned holy
verse has also occurred in Sura 'A-l-i-'Imran, No. 3, verse 51, and Sura
Az-Zukhruf, No. 43, verse 64).

Through introducing himself, Jesus (a.s.) said he was a servant of
Allah: "…Verily I am servant of Allah …".(1) Then, the first command he
received was about prayer and worship: "…and He has enjoined on me
prayer…", (2) and the first program he announced was worshipping Allah:
"… So worship (only) Him…". Thus taking Jesus as a Son of God is an
alteration in religion which causes blasphemy.

However, this verse implies that the last word of Jesus, after
introducing himself with the qualities which were previously referred
to, is the subject of Monotheism, specially on the field of worship, on
which he emphasized more. By this verse, Jesus (a.s.) says:

" And verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship (only) Him.
This is a straight path."

1 Sura Maryam, No.19, verse 30
2- Sura Maryam, No. 19, verse 31

Thus, from very beginning of his life, Messiah (a.s.) struggled against
any blasphemy, and worshipping gods of dualism and polytheism, because
monotheism, and worshipping Allah, is the straight path, while the rest
paths are some deviated paths. (In the Qur'an, the path of Allah and His
Messenger, accompanied with worshipping Him, has been introduced as the
'straight path'.)
