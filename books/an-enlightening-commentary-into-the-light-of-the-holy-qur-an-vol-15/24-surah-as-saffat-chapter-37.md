***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

This Surah, containing one hundred and eighty two verses, was revealed
at Mecca. The name of this Surah has been taken from its first verse
which begins with an oath by Saffat, a group of angels who are arrayed
to perform the command of Allah.

This Surah is the first Surah of the Holy Qur’an which begins with an
oath. Like most of other Meccan Suras, many of the verses of this Surah
are also about Origin and Resurrection accompanied with some warnings
and admonitions.

The Virtue of Reciting Surah As-Saffat
--------------------------------------

Imam Sadiq (as) said:

*“Whoever recites Surah As-Saffat every Friday, he will be saved from
every pollution and disease, and every contamination will be removed
from his worldly life, and Allah will provide him with the most abundant
sustenance and He does not afflict him, his children and his body with
the harms of the cursed Satan and the hostile haughty ones.*

*And if he dies on that day or night, Allah will cause him to die as a
martyr, and He will raise him among martyrs, and He will set him in the
same grade with the martyrs in Paradise.”*[^1]

These abundant rewards are given for reciting the Surah if the person
performs the content of the Surah and the Qur’an accordingly, and these
are required but the barriers must be removed, too.
