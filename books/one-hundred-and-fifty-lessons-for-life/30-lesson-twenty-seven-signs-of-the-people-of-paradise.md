Lesson Twenty Seven: Signs of the People of Paradise
====================================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إنَّ لاَِهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ اَرْبَعَ عَلامات: وَجْهٌ مُنْبَسِطٌ وَ
لِسانٌ فَصِيْحٌ وَ قَلْبٌ رَحِيْمٌ وَ يَدٌ مُعْطِيَةٌ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The people of paradise have four signs: open face, eloquent and clear
tongue, a merciful heart and bountiful hand.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The noblest human schools are those which train individuals to acquire
good character and become valuable members of the society because
society is the source of all blessings.

The signs which the above tradition attributes to the people of paradise
are all concerned with factors that strengthen social relations and sow
seeds of affection in the land of society.

Open and pleasant faces, soft and kind, with clear and eloquent tongues,
with hearts yearning to help people, and hands not holding back
assistance – Yes! these are the signs of the people of paradise.
