Lesson One Hundred Fourteen: Ill-Gotten Wealth
==============================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ يَكْسِبُ مِنْ غَيْرِ حَقِّهِ يَصْرِفُهُ فِي غَيْرِ أَجْرِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

He who acquires wealth illegitimately, will spend it in ways which
confer no divine reward.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

It is a common belief that some types of properties are unsuitable for
spending on public welfare or charity. The above tradition is a good
proof for this public belief. And one can verify it because one can see
cases where some individuals have intended to participate in a good
cause using their property, but they have either stopped half way or
their project, though completed, is not effective or even
counter-productive. On the other hand one finds a lot of faithful and
virtuous individuals who have accomplished a lot of good work with their
meager resources.
