21: Prophets (anbiya)
=====================

This chapter of 112 Meccan verses arranged in seven sections was
revealed after the one on Abraham 14 and before Believers 23 and [Soul]
Snatchers 79 It is full of important philosophy beginning in Section II
which deals with the essential Oneness of God. We are also told that the
God of every man allows for

no intercession (II).

The next theme concerns a prophet's gifts, and it states that Muhammad
was a messenger rather than a poet (IV). We learn how Abraham dealt with
images or daIs (V), while the roles of David and Solomon are also
discussed (VI), a section that is somewhat parallel to 38:III-IV. The
theme becomes inspiring in the face of

the prophet's trials, and at the end it becomes almost apocalyptic.
