*“Your redressing what you have missed through your silence is easier
than attaining what you have lost through your speech, Safeguarding the
contents of the vessel through fastening its cover and safeguarding what
is in your hands is dearer to me than seeking for what is the hands of
others. The bitterness of cutting off hopes (in people) is better than
seeking from people. An occupation (to earn one’s living) accompanied by
chastity is better than wealth accompanied by immorality. A person is
the best keeper of his secrets.*

*Often one strives for what is harmful for oneself. He who speaks much
speaks nonsense and he who contemplates gains insight. Associate with
people of goodness and you will be of them; forsake evil people and you
will be separated from them. The worst food is what is forbidden.
Wronging the weak is the most evil wrongdoing.*

*Where gentleness is considered to be roughness, there roughness is
gentleness. Sometimes the remedy is the disease and the disease is the
remedy. Sometimes one who is not a sincere counselor gives sincere
advice and the one considered to be a sincere counselor gives insincere
advice.* *Beware of relying on hopes for they are the capital of fools.
Intellect is the safeguarding of experiences, and the best of your
experiences is that which teaches you a lesson. Hasten to avail of
opportunity before it becomes grief. Not every seeker attains (his
desire) nor does every absent one return. Among the factors of
corruption are to neglect taking care of one’s provisions (for the
Hereafter) and deeds that ruin the Hereafter.*

*Every affair has an outcome. What is destined for you will soon come to
you. The trader takes a risk. Often the little (wealth) becomes more
abundant than what is much. There is no good in a mean helper or a
friend who is suspect. As long as time is in your grasp, take your share
of it. Do not put anything at risk hoping for something more than it.
Beware that the stubborn mount should become ungovernable”.*

Commentary
----------

In this letter, Imam ‘Ali (as) provides us with some significant pieces
of wisdom:

### 1. Silence And Speech

There is no doubt that language and speech are among God's blessings to
man. Language is a means for communication and for the propagation of
knowledge and for guiding people. God distinguishes man from the world
of beasts by language:

> "الرّحمنُ، عَلَّمَ القُرآنَ، خَلَقَ الإنسانَ، عَلَّمَهُ البيانَ" 579

***"The Beneficient God, taught the Qur’an; He created man, taught him
the mode of expression"***

But if human language is not guarded against absurdity, telling lies,
arguments, abuse, ridicule, back-biting, accusation, or telling
tales…[^1] it will change into disaster. Thus, the scholars of ethics
advise us to speak only when necessary or else make use of silence.

From the view-points of benefits and losses, language is of four
forms:
One kind of language has absolute benefits. The second type includes
absolute losses. In the third type both benefits and losses are mixed.
And the fourth type is neither useful nor useless.
Using silence is necessary in three stages of the above four stages. In
that case where we can speak, we should take care not to contaminate
language with hypocrisy, artificiality, and talkativeness.[^2]
It is for this reason that in Islam, emphasis is more on silence. The
Prophet (S) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"رَحِمَ الله عَبداً تَكَلَّمَ خَيراً فغَنِم او سَكَتَ فَسَلِمَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"May God have mercy on a servant (of God) who speaks good and acquires
benefit or keeps silent and remains safe".*[^3]

The great Prophet (S) is also reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن كانَ يُؤمِنُ بِاللهِ واليَومِ الآخِرِ فَليَقُل خَيراً او
لِيَصمُت"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"One who believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him speak good things
or remain silent"*[^4]

Imam Sadiq (as) said when talking about Prophet David, who had told his
son:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"يا بُنَيَّ اِن كُنتَ زَعمتَ اَنَّ الكَلامَ مِن فِضّةٍ فَاِنَّ
السُكُوتَ مِن ذَهَبٍ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"O my son, if you say that speech is of silver, then silence is of
gold"*[^5]*.*
Imam Reza (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مِن عَلامَاتِ الفِقهِ الحِلمُ والعِلمُ والصَمتُ اِنَّ الصَمْتَ بَابٌ
مِن اَبوابِ الحِكْمَةِ، اِنَّ الصمتَ يُكسِبُ المَحَبَّة ـ الجَنَّةَ ـ
اِنَّهُ دَليلُ عَلَى كُلِّ خَيرٍ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Among the signs of being learned are forbearance, knowledge and
silence. Silence is one of the doors of wisdom. Silence is a means of
attracting love and attaining Heaven and is a guide to every
good"*[^6]*.*

And in “Misbah al-Shari’ah” it is narrated from Imam Sadiq (as):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"الصَّمْتُ شِعارُ المُحَقّقِينَ بِحقَائِقِ ما سَبَقَ وجَفَّ القَلمُ
بهِ وهُو مِفتاحُ كُلِّ راحة مِنَ الدُّنيا وَالآخِرَةِ والصُونُ مِنَ
الخَطايَا وَالزَلَلِ وَقَد جَعَلَهُ الله سِتْراً على الجَاهِلِ
وَتَزَيُناً لِلعَالِم وفِيهِ عَزلُ الهَوى وَرِياضَةُ النَّفسِ
وَحَلاوَةُ العِبادَةِ وَزَوالُ قَسَاوَةِ القَلبِ وَالعَفَافُ
وَالمُروَّةُ وَالظَرَف فَاغلِق بَابَ لِسانِكَ عَمّا لَكَ مِنهُ بَدَلاً
سِيما اِذا لَم تَجِد اَهلاً لِلكَلامِ والمُساعَدَةِ في المُذاكَرَةِ

*"Silence is the mark of those who confirm the realities of what came
before and of which the pen has written. It is the key to every ease in
this world and the Hereafter, and a preservation from errors and lapses.
Allah has made it a cover for the ignorant and an embellishment for the
scholar. In it is the removal of desires, the training of the soul, the
sweetness of worship, the removal of hard-heartedness, chastity, sense
of honour and sagacity. Therefore close the door of your tongue* *to
unnecessary speech, particularly when you do not find one who is worthy
of being spoken to and who will assist in discussion for the sake of
Allah and concerning Allah.*

*Rabi’ b. Khuthaym would place a piece of parchment before him and write
down all that he had uttered. Then, at night, he would take himself to
account for what was in favour of him and what was against him (in his
speech). He would say: “Ah! Ah! The silent ones have been successful and
we have remained behind”. One of the companions of the Messenger of
Allah would place pebbles in his mouth. When he wanted to speak about
what he knew was for Allah, concerning Allah and for Allah’s pleasure,
he would remove the pebbles (from his mouth) .….*

*The cause of the destruction and salvation of creatures is only speech
and silence. Thus good fortune belongs to him who is provided with the
knowledge of incorrect and correct speech and the benefits of silence,
for that is among the moral traits of the Prophets and the mark of the
chosen ones. He who knows the value of speech does well in the
companionship of silence. The speech and the silence of one who is
acquainted with the subtleties of silence and entrusted with its
treasures, is worship, and none is aware of this worship of his but the
All-compelling King”.*

Thus, silence and speech could be the definite sources of people’s
salvation or destruction, respectively. We envy those who know the asset
of silence and the righteousness of speaking. This is among the ethics
of the Prophets and is among the marks of the true believers.

As you will see, one of the principles of silence is the preservation
against making errors that occur through speech and can not be
compensated for. Imam ‘Ali (as) has relied heavily on this principle:
Redressing what you have lost due to your silence is easier than
compensating for what you have lost due to your speech. This is because
by putting the cover on a bottle you can safeguard its contents.

This point is depicted in the poems of our poets who are under the
influence of Imam ‘Ali (as) and other religious leaders.

Amir Khosro, the Iranian poet, says:
Any moment you talk, it is pleasant,
But sometimes silence is even sweeter;
To close the mouth is to close the door of troubles,
It is because the world is pregnant with good and bad.
I have seen many who regret having spoken
But I have seen nobody who regrets having been silent
Listening is better than saying if you care,
The first will fill us; the second will make us empty,
The pearl became very precious because
It became ear from top to the toe;
The sharp sword became tongue all over,
That is because it could shed people’s blood.
Sa’di says:
Until you know perfectly that your speech is appropriate,
You should not open your mouth to talk.
Another poet says:
Until the time you have not uttered a thing, it is at your disposal,
But when it is said, it will dominate you;
Do not tell anybody your secrets,
Because he will disclose it everywhere;
Deposit your treasure to treasure-keepers,
Keep your secrets to yourself.
But as it is said before, both speech and silence have their own
merits. Wherever you have to talk, being silent is not wise and the
other way around. The poet says:
Two things spoil the wisdom,
Being silent when you are supposed to talk, and talking when you are
supposed to be silent.

When Imam Zayn al-‘Abidin (as) was asked which one was better: speech or
silence, he answered:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لِكُلِّ وَاحدٍ مِنهُما آفاتٌ فَاِذا سَلِما مِنَ الآفاتِ فالكَلامُ
افضَلُ مِنَ السكُوت قِيلَ كَيفَ ذَلِكَ يابنَ رَسُولِ الله؟ قالَ لأنَّ
الله عَزَّوجَلَّ مَا بَعَثَ الاَنبِياءَ وَالأَوصِياءَ بِالسكُوتِ
اِنَّما بَعَثَهُم بِالكَلام ولا استُحِقَّت الجَنَّةُ بِالسُكُوتِ ولا
استُوجِبَت وِلايةُ اللهِ بِالسُكُوتِ ولا تُوقِّيَتِ النارُ بالسُكُوتِ
اِنَّما ذَلِكَ كُلُهُ بِالكَلامِ مَا كُنتُ لاَعدِلَ القَمَرَ بِالشَمسِ
اِنّك تَصِفُ فَضلَ السُكُوتِ بِالكَلامِ ولَسْتَ تَصِفُ فَضْلَ الكَلامِ
بِالسُكوتِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Both speech and silence have their harmful aspects. If both are free
from harm, then speech is more excellent than silence”. It was said:
“How is that, O son of the Messenger of Allah”? Imam as-Sajjad (as)
answered:*

*"Because Allah did not send His Prophets and (their) trustees with
silence, but sent them with speech. Paradise is not deserved through
silence, nor is God’s guardianship merited through silence, nor is the
Fire guarded against through silence. All this is possible only through
speech. I do not place the sun on a level equal to the moon. You
describe the excellence of silence through speech; you do not describe
the excellence of speech through silence."*[^7]

### 2. Be Moderate, Do Not Squander, Do Not Be Jealous, Do Not Dissipate

It is a fact that man could not be indifferent towards his fellow
creatures in the matter of finance, because all possessions are God’s
and we are His creature. Sometimes God sends one’s livelihood without
intermediary. But most often He obliges some people to carry out this
task in order to shape their characters:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وأَنفِقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And spend out of what we have given you."***[^8]

But the topic is now the quantity and quality of donation. Some are so
generous that they will give away what they have till they remain
money-less. And some people go to the other extreme and are extremely
miserly.

Islam reproaches both groups severely and orders moderation.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَلَا تَجْعَلْ يَدَكَ مَغْلُولَةً إِلَى عُنُقِكَ وَلَا تَبْسُطْهَا
كُلَّ الْبَسْطِ فَتَقْعُدَ مَلُومًا مَحْسُورًا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And do not make your hand to be shackled to your neck nor stretch it
forth to the utmost limit of its stretching forth, lest you should
afterwards sit down blamed, stripped off."***[^9]

And in Surah al-Furqan where the attributes of the true believers are
enumerated, one of the specific characteristics of such people is
considered to be moderation:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَالَّذِينَ إِذَا أَنفَقُوا لَمْ يُسْرِفُوا وَلَمْ يَقْتُرُوا وَكَانَ
بَيْنَ ذَلِكَ قَوَامًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And they who when they spend are neither extravagant nor
parsimonious, and keep between these the just mean."***[^10]
Imam ‘Ali (as) talks about this principle of moderation and does not
want us to be misers because by the expression "safeguard what you have
in your hands" he means safeguarding it in moderation, neither
parsimoniously nor extravagantly.[^11]

Thus, what Imam ‘Ali (as) means is the following: what you have at your
disposal, spend it moderately; never donate all you have and then beg
others for some sustenance and humiliate yourself and become what the
Holy Qur’an calls:

***"..lest you should afterwards sit down blamed, stripped off."***

#### Is There A Contrast Between Moderation And Donation?

Some assume that there is a contrast between moderation which is
mentioned in the above Surahs and by Imam (as) and donation which is
mentioned in different Islamic traditions as well as in the ninth verse
of Hashr:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَيُؤْثِرُونَ عَلَى أَنْفُسِهِمْ وَلَوْ كَانَ بِهِمْ خَصَاصَةٌ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And prefer them before themselves though poverty may afflict them"
[Qur’an 59:9].***

But attention to the location and timing of the descent of these Surahs
and other evidences show us that there is no contrast between these two.
It is because the Surahs and traditions which emphasize moderation are
applicable to those situations where extravagance may destroy the life
pattern of the one who spends out or weakens his family altogether. In
such cases donation is prohibited and moderation is in order. Observing
the principle of moderation might be a general principle which should be
carried out by the mass or it may be a specific principle which should
be carried out at specific times such as war, famine, unexpected events
and the like. At these critical moments exalted people should do
sacrifice and help others. This happened when Hashim, the great
grandfather of the Prophet (S) donated all his possession at the time of
famine. Another example of donation is the act of the Muslims at the
dawn of Islam. They helped out the newly converted and the immigrants
who had been deprived of all of their possessions. They, through their
assistance, could protect Islam. Naturally these two commandments
pertain to different situations and they do not contradict each other.
Each one is carried out at specific occasions.

### 3. The Bitterness Of Cutting Short One’s Hopes Is Better Than Asking People For Help

The essence of resorting to Allah and the lack of despair towards God’s
benevolence is that man, so far as possible, should not ask for people’s
help and should trust God only. Although such a position sometimes
deprives people of material assets and adds to the possession of the
proud ones and is sometimes accompanied with hardships, the honor and
glory which are obtained in this way are not comparable to the
humiliation of asking others for help.

The Qur’an interprets such a state of needlessness and resort to and
reliance on God and not asking people for help as "cutting off hopes and
not relying on others". This state is praised as it is shown in the
following traditions:

Imam Sadiq (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"ثَلاثةٌ هِيَ فَخرُ المُؤمِن وزِينَتُه في الدُّنيا والآخِرة: الصلواتُ
في آخِرِ الَّليلِ ويَأسِهِ مِمّا في اَيدِي النّاسِ ووِلايةُ الإمامَ
مِن آلِ مُحمَّد (ص)"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“There are three things which are a pride and an ornament for a
believer here and in the Hereafter: Prayer at the end of* *the night,
cutting off hopes of what is in the hands of people and the wilaya
(guardianship) of an Imam from the Household of Mohammad (as)”.*[^12]

He has also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اليأسُ مِمّا في اَيدِي النّاسِ عِزُّ المُؤمِن في دِينِهِ ومُروَّتِه
في نَفسِهِ وشَرَفِهِ في دُنياهُ وعَظَمَتُه في اَعيُنِ النَاسِ
وجَلالَتُهُ في عَشِيرَتِه ومَهابَتِه عِندَ عِيالِهِ وَهُوَ اغنى
النّاسِ عِندَ نَفسِهِ وعِندَ جَمِيعِ النّاس"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Cutting off hopes in what people possess causes a believer’s glory in
his religion, sense of honour in soul, his noblity in his world, his
greatness in the eyes of others, his loftiness in his tribe, and his
prestige in his family. Such a person is the one most free of need in
his own view and before all mankind."*[^13]

Imam ‘Ali (as) is narrated to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"الغِنى الأكبَر اليأسُ عمَّا في اَيدِي النّاس"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"The greatest wealth is cutting off hopes of what is in the hands of
people”.*[^14]

### 4. Little Fortune Plus Chastity Is Better Than Big Fortune Which Is Gained Through Dishonesty

As we know assets and children are a means for man’s troubles and
trials.

> "أَنَّمَا أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَأَوْلَادُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ"594

***"Your possessions and your children are only a trial".***

As a whole, the wealthy people are more prone to committing sins.

> "إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَيَطْغَى أَنْ رَآهُ اسْتَغْنَى"595

***"Man is most surely inordinate. Because he sees himself free from
want".***

In contrast, those who enjoy a simpler life, due to the shortage of
possibilities, are less prone to the sins.

But those who have less wealth but are honest are better than those who
have more wealth for the following reasons:

First, the honest ones enjoy magnanimity, ease of conscience and
specific human values which the people of sins are deprived of.

Second, although the middle class think the wealthy ones as lucky, the
masses who possess divine nature consider them unhealthy and dirty.

Third, the criterion for good and bad acts is not the transitory
physical pleasures; rather those acts are considered valuable which may
bring about Divine satisfaction and rewards in the Hereafter, which are
ever-lasting.[^15]

> "وَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ لَمُحِيطَةٌ بِالْكَافِرِينَ"597

***"And most surely hell encompasses the unbelievers".***

It is for this reason that Imam ‘Ali (as) states:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"والحِرفَةُ مَعَ العِفّةِ خَيرٌ مِنَ الغِنى مَعَ الفُجُورِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"An occupation (to earn one’s living) accompanied by chastity is better
than wealth accompanied by immorality”.*

Sa’di, the Iranian poet, says:
If you recognize the pleasure of the abandoning pleasures,
Never will you consider as pleasure the pleasure of soul;
Your bird of spirit will fly to Heavens,
If you free it from the cage of greed;
But you lack the patience of the phoenix,
You are like a sparrow in the claws of lusts;
You are worshipping your surface so much
That as far as you are living you will not get to the deep.
If an herb grows out of your humane nature
The flowers of the garden seems to you as if they were herbs
You would never buy the two worlds,
If you knew the value of what you have,
From the remaining part of life you will get nothing,
If you are decided to perform as you do now;
Tell me what better-than-life did you get
As you spent your life-time;
You may not buy one moment of life with a big land
Your life was given to you free of charge;
You sleep-walker walk as slowly as
I fear, you will miss your caravan;
My advice to you, brother, is
As far as you can, do not waste your time;
You should keep your tongue in your mouth like a shell
Then you could throw out pearls when time is ripe;
All his life, Sa’di underwent hardships
Till he got the fame that he enjoys now.

### 5. It Is Better For A Man To Keep His Secrets:

Keeping secrets is one of the ethical principles of Islam. It is
emphasized in Islam. Sometimes disclosing secrets to others might lower
the pain-load of the person. But for this act there are conditions:
Firstly you should find trustworthy persons to disclose your secrets.

Imam ‘Ali (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لا تُؤدِّ عَن سِرِّكَ مَن لا اَمانَةَ لَهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Do not entrust your secret to one who is not trustworthy".*[^16]

Secondly, we should not even tell the whole secret to the trustworthy
because on the one hand, that secret might somehow get revealed and hurt
us. In this regard Imam ‘Ali (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن كَتَم سِرَّهُ كانَتِ الخِيَرةُ بِيَدهِ وكُلُّ حَدِيثٍ جَاوَزَ
اثنَين فَشا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"One who conceals his secrets has the choice in his hand. Any
conversation that is between more than two persons will be
revealed"*[^17]

Elsewhere Imam ‘Ali (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"سِرُّكَ اَسِيرُكَ فَاِن اَفشَيتَهُ صِرتَ اَسِيرَهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Your secret is your captive. Once you reveal it, you become its
captive."*[^18]

Imam ‘Ali (as) has also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"سِرُّكَ سُرُورُكَ اِن كَتمتَهُ واِن اَذعتَهُ كانَ ثُبُورَك"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Your secret is your happiness as long as you conceal it. When you
reveal it, it is your destruction."*[^19]

On the other hand, people are not always the same; a friend today might
turn into a foe tomorrow. He might, then, use that secret as a club on
your head and hurt you. Imam Sadiq (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لا تُطلِع صَدِيقَكَ مِن سِرِّكَ اِلا عَلى مَا لَو اَطلَعتَ عَلَيهِ
عَدوَّكَ لمَ يَضُرُكَ فِانَّ الصَدِيقَ قَد يَكُونُ عَدوّاً يَوماً ما"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Do not disclose your secret to your friend except that much, which if
you informed your enemy of it, it would not harm you. For one day your
friend may become your enemy."*[^20]
Regarding this, our Iranian poet has said:
Never rely wholly on your friend,
Keep hidden your secret from your friend;
Some day your friend might turn against you,
He might turn and show you his animosity.
Naturally, nobody could be a better secret-keeper than a person
himself. He is the most reliable person concerning his secret. Imam ‘Ali
(as) has said regarding this:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"صَدرُكَ اَوسَعُ لِسِرِّكَ”
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Your chest is the widest place to keep your secret".*[^21]

Sa’di, the Persian writer and poet, says:
Do not disclose to your friend your secrets. You do not know if he will
turn against you. Do not inflict any damage over your foe; he might
someday become your friend. If you wish a secret to remain secret, do
not reveal it, even if he is reliable. Nobody is friendlier to your
secret than you yourself.
It is better for you to remain silent than,
Telling a person your secret and asking him not to disclose it;
O wise man, block the water from its headspring,
Because when the spring over-flows, you cannot stop it;
You should not utter anything in private,
That cannot be said at any association of people.

### 6. There Are Many Who Strive For What Is Harmful For Themselves!

Trial and perseverance are the agents for material progress and for
perfection:

> "وَأَنْ لَيْسَ لِلْإِنسَانِ إِلَّا مَا سَعَى"604

***"And that man shall have nothing but what he strives for".***

Some people struggle in the right direction and in the God's path. And
some others go astray.
They are deviated "Those who go astray" and are not in favor with Allah

***"Not the path of those upon whom the wrath is brought down" [Qur’an
1:7]***

It is clear that those who struggle for Allah may not superficially be
affluent in this world; but because God will not leave any service to
Him unanswered, such a person has gained a lot:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَمَنْ أَرَادَ الْآخِرَةَ وَسَعَى لَهَا سَعْيَهَا وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ
فَأُوْلَئِكَ كَانَ سَعْيُهُمْ مَشْكُورًا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it as he ought to
strive and he is a believer; as for these, their striving shall surely
be accepted."***[^22]
But those who go astray and perform evil on the earth and commit
wrong-doings may seem lucky ones in the eyes of some. But they are real
losers since they have spoiled their Hereafter which is made of the
actions we perform here. However much they strive, they will lose more.
Furthermore, such people are usually punished in this world.

> "وَإِذَا تَوَلَّى سَعَى فِي الْأَرْضِ لِيُفْسِدَ فِيهَا وَيُهْلِكَ
> الْحَرْثَ وَالنَّسْلَ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْفَسَادَ"606

***"And when he turns back, he runs along in the land that he may cause
mischief in it and destroy the tilth and the stock, and Allah does not
love mischief-making."***

And as for those who assume they are doing good when actually are
committing sins, the Qur’an says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"قُلْ هَلْ نُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِالْأَخْسَرِينَ أَعْمَالًا الَّذِينَ ضَلَّ
سَعْيُهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ
يُحْسِنُونَ صُنْعًا أُولَئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ
وَلِقَائِهِ فَحَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَلَا نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ
الْقِيَامَةِ وَزْنًا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Say: Shall We inform you of the greatest losers in their deeds?
These are they whose labor is lost in this world's life and they think
that they are well versed in skill of the work of hand. These are they
who disbelieve in the communications of their Lord and His meeting, so
their deeds become null, and therefore We will not set up a balance for
them on the day of resurrection."***[^23]

With regards to the above information, we will understand what Imam ‘Ali
(as) means by the expression *"Often one strives for what is harmful for
oneself”.*

### 7. He Who Speaks Much Speaks Nonsense

Naturally, a person, who talks a lot, does not have enough time to weigh
what he says. As a result, his speech is both baseless and wrong. The
listener also might get bored and the speaker may lose his vigor.

Fortunately, in the Islamic traditions all these points are made clear.

Imam ‘Ali (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"الإكثارُ إضجار"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Too much talking is annoying”.*[^24]

At another occasion, he has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"الإكثارُ يُزِلُّ الحَكِيم ويُمِلُّ الحَلِيم فَلا تُكثِر فَتَضجَر
وتُفرِط فَتَهِن"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Too much talking causes a wise man to err and wearies the forbearing
one. Thus, do not talk too much such that you trouble people and exceed
the bounds, so you are held in little estimation."*[^25]

Imam ‘Ali (as) has also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إيّاكَ وكَثرَةُ الكَلامِ فَاِنَّه يُكثِرُ الزَلل ويُورِثُ المَلَل"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Beware of talking too much because it increases your errors and causes
weariness.”*[^26]

He has also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"كَثرَةُ الكَلامِ تُبسَطُ حَواشِيهِ وتَنقُصُ مَعانِيهِ فَلا يُرى لَهُ
اَمَدٌ ولا يَنفَعُ بِهِ اَحَد"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Excessive speech augments the superfluities in it and diminishes its
meaning. There is no end to it and none will benefit from it.*[^27]

He says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اَقلِل الكَلامَ تَامَنِ المَلام"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Lessen your speech so that you are safe from blame."*[^28]

### 8. Contemplation Is The Basis Of Insight

Wisdom distinguishes man from the beasts. Man uses wisdom to recognize
the facts of creation and relations among them.
Thus thinking about similar events is to concentrate on a specific
case. Just as if the conditions for sight are possible and there are no
obstacles, seeing will naturally take place, in the same way, if the
conditions for thinking are present and the obstacles are absent,
insight and the understanding of conditions will naturally occur.[^29]
It is for this reason that in the Islamic traditions contemplation is
considered as an illuminating factor for wisdom.
On the other hand, in the Islamic traditions, it is said that we
discover the unknown through our wisdom.

> "بِالفِكرِ تَنجَلِي غَياهِبُ الامُور"614

It is also said that contemplation broadens the spirit of realism in a
man and increases his insight.
Finally, contemplation is considered not only as an act of worship but
also one hour of it is considered equal to years of worship.
Imam ‘Ali (as), in his book, points out the role of contemplation in
the illumination of facts.

### 9. The Effects And Role Of Companionship

One of the factors which build up one's personality is companionship.
Since human nature adopts other people's behaviors easily, when he
accompanies the good ones, he is influenced by them. On the contrary,
when he accompanies the bad ones, he becomes one of those. It is said:
Do not accompany the bad as far as you can,
Because human soul adopts other's nature;
Noah's son accompanied the bad ones,
He lost his Prophethood as a result.
The dog of the cave settlers for a few days only
Followed the good ones and became good.
Because of this characteristic of impressionability, companionship is
emphasized in the Islamic traditions and the Qur’anic verses.

It is narrated from Solomon (as), the Prophet, who said,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لا تَحكُمُوا عَلى رَجُلٍ بِشَيئ حَتّى تَنظُرُوا اِلى مَن يُصاحِب
فانَّما يُعرَفُ الرَجُلُ باشكالِه واقرانِهِ ويُنسَبُ الى اَصحابِه
واِخوانِه"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Do not pass judgment on a person without seeing those with whom he
keeps company; for a man is only known through his likes and his
companions, and is ascribed to his companions and brothers”.*[^30]

Imam ‘Ali (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مُجالَسَةُ الأشرارِ تُورِثُ سُوءَ الظنَّ بالأخيار ومُجالَسَةُ
الأخيارِ تُلحِقُ الأشرارَ بالأخيارِ ومُجالَسَةُ الأبرارِ لِلفُجّارِ
تُلحِقُ الأبرارَ بِالفُجّار، فَمَن اِشتَبَهَ عَلَيكُم اَمرُه ولم
تَعرِفُوا دِينَه فانظُروا اِلى خُلَطائِهِ فاِن كانُوا اَهلَ دِينِ الله
فَهُوَ على دِينِ الله واِن كانُوا عَلى غَيرِ دِينِ الله فَلا حَظَّ
لَهُ مِن دِينِ الله اِنَّ رَسُولَ الله (ص) كان يقول: مَن كانَ يُؤمِن
بالله واليَوم الآخِر فَلا يُؤاخِينَّ كافرا ولا يُخالِطَنَّ فَاجِراً
ومَن آخى كافِراً او خالَطَ فاجِراً كانَ كَافِراً فاجراً"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Companionship with evildoers causes an evil opionion about the good
and companionship with the good links the evildoers to the good. The
companionship of the virtuous with the transgressors links the virtuous
to the transgressors. So those of you who are doubtful about someone and
you do not know his religion, then look at his friends. If they are
adherents of the religion of Allah, then he is on the religion of Allah.
If they are on other than the religion of Allah, then he has no share in
the religion of Allah. This is because the Messenger of Allah (as) used
to say: One who believes in God and the Day of Resurrection should not
fraternize with an infidel or associate with a transgressor. One who
fraternizes with an infidel or associates with a transgressor is an
infidel, a transgressor.*[^31]

And the Prophet (S) has also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"المَرء على دِينِ خَلِيلهِ فَلينظُر اَحدَكُم مَن يُخالِل"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"A man is of the same religion as his friend. Then every one of you be
careful with whom you associate".*[^32]

You first tell me who your friends are,
Then I'll tell you who you are.
This very feature of impressionability and companionship caused ‘Uqbah
b. Abi Mu’eet to be influenced by the temptations of his old friend
Ubayy ibn Khalaf to become infidel to Islam and to pour the intestines
of an animal over the Prophet's head and to insult him and to spit on
his sacred face. The Qur’an expresses his mental status at the Day of
Resurrection through the following words:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَيَوْمَ يَعَضُّ الظَّالِمُ عَلَى يَدَيْهِ يَقُولُ يَا لَيْتَنِي
اتَّخَذْتُ مَعَ الرَّسُولِ سَبِيلًا يَا وَيْلَتِي لَيْتَنِي لَمْ
أَتَّخِذْ فُلَانًا خَلِيلًا لَقَدْ أَضَلَّنِي عَنْ الذِّكْرِ بَعْدَ
إِذْ جَاءَنِي وَكَانَ الشَّيْطَانُ لِلْإِنسَانِ خَذُولًا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And the day when the unjust one shall bite his hands: O would that I
had taken a way with the Apostle; O woe is me! Would that I had not
taken such a one for a friend! Certainly he led me astray from the
reminder after it had come to me; and the Shaitan fails to aid
man"***[^33]

Sa’di, concerning companionship, says:
In the bath one day I received a piece of fragrant clay from a
friend,
I asked the clay if it was musk or ambergris
Because I was drunk with its odor
It said it used to be a worthless piece of clay
But it was companion to a flower
The perfect behavior of the company had influenced it
Or else it was still the same piece of clay.
It is for this reason that in the Qur’an and in traditions there is
continuous persuasion over friendship with honest people and genuine
God-believers. Making friends with unclean people is strictly
prohibited. Two of these traditions are reported here:

Firstly: Imam ‘Ali (as) has said

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِحذَر مُجالَسَةَ قَرِينِ السُوءَ فاِنَهُ يُهلِكُ مُقارِنَهُ ويُردِي
مُصاحِبَهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Be on your guard against associating with an evil companion for he
will destroy his companion and ruin his friend."*[^34]

Secondly, he said,

**
**

"جَالِسِ اَهلَ الوَرَعِ والحِكمَةَ واَكثِر مُناقَشَتِهِم فَإنَّكَ اِن
كُنتَ جَاهِلاً عَلَّمُوكَ واِن كُنتَ عَالِما ازددت علماً"

*"Associate with people of God-fearingness and wisdom and have frequent
discussions with them. If you are ignorant they will teach you, and if
you are a scholar they will increase your knowledge.”*[^35]

### 10. The Worst Food Is The Illegally Gained Food

It can not be denied that food is effective in building one's
personality. It is because food changes into energy and sets our body in
motion and is manifested in the form of action and work and would be
permanent in the storage of the days in accordance with the principle of
permanency of matter and energy. It will later manifest into an
appropriate shape in the Day of Resurrection.

Thus, if food is lawful and legally-gained, it will manifest itself as a
wholesome nutrient and it will bring about comfort and ease. If it is
gained through illegal means it will bring about fire and will badly
hurt man.
The Holy Qur’an talks about the swallowers of the property of the
orphans unjustly in the following manner:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَالَ الْيَتَامَى ظُلْمًا إِنَّمَا
يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ نَارًا وَسَيَصْلَوْنَ سَعِيرًا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"As for those who swallow the property of the orphans unjustly,
surely they only swallow fire into their bellies and they shall enter
burning fire"***[^36]

And as for those who conceal the rights, the Holy Qur’an says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنْ الْكِتَابِ
وَيَشْتَرُونَ بِهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا أُوْلَئِكَ مَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي
بُطُونِهِمْ إِلَّا النَّارَ وَلَا يُكَلِّمُهُمْ اللَّهُ يَوْمَ
الْقِيَامَةِ وَلَا يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Surely those who conceal any part of the Book that Allah has
revealed and take for it a small price, they eat nothing but fire in
their bellies, and Allah will not speak to them on the Day of
resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful
chastisement"***[^37]

As you will observe, for both swallowers of the properties of orphans
and the concealers of facts, through which they gain illegal profits,
the fire of Hell is anticipated. Their actions are symbolized as fires
and this hurts them in the Hereafter.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"ووَجَدُوا ما عَمِلُوا حاضِراً ـ ومَن يَعمَل مِثقَالَ ذَرَّةً شرّاً
يَرَهُ "
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And what they had done they shall find present there”.***[^38]
***“And he who has done an atom's weight of evil shall see it"***[^39]

It is for this reason that the illegally gained property is severely
reproached in the Islamic traditions, and it is supposed to be an agent
against the acceptance of worship and prayers:
The great Prophet (S) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن اَكَلَ لُقمَةَ حَرامٍ لم تُقبَل لَه صَلاة اَربَعِينَ لَيلَةً ولم
تُستَجَب لَهُ دَعوَةٌ اَربَعِينَ صباحاً وكُل لحَم يُنبِتَه الحَرامُ
فالنارُ اولى بِهِ واِن الّلقمَةَ الواحِدَةَ تُنبِتُ الّلحْم"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"The prayers of one who takes a mouthful of forbidden food will not be
accepted for forty nights and his supplications will not be accepted,
either, for forty days. The Fire is worthy of every piece of flesh grown
out of forbidden food, and (even) one mouthful of food is effective in
the growth of flesh"*[^40]

The great Prophet (S), when answering someone who wanted his
supplication to be accepted, said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"طَهِّر مَأكَلكَ. لا تُدخِل بَطنَكَ الحَرامَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Purify your food and do not let anything forbidden enter your
stomach"*[^41]

In a tradition from Imam Sadiq (as) we read:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَنْ سَرَّهُ اَن تُستَجابَ دَعوَتَهُ فليُطَيّب مَكسَبَه"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"One who wishes his supplication to be accepted, let his earnings be
pure”.*[^42]

There is another tradition saying:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لا يُحجَبُ عَنِّي دَعوَةٌ إلاّ دَعوَةُ آكِلِ الحَرامِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"No supplication is veiled from Me, except the supplication of those
who eat what is forbidden."*[^43]

We read in another tradition:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن وَقَى شَرَّ لَقلَقَهِ وقَبْقَبِهِ وذَبْذَبِهِ فَقَدِ وَجَبت لَهُ
الجَنَّةُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Heaven is incumbent on one who preserves himself from the evil of his
tongue, his stomach and his sexual organs."*[^44]

Regarding the above-mentioned issues, some feeble-minded persons might
think the worst kind of food is the one which hurts him physically. But
such impairment is curable and its time is limited to this world alone.
But the damage of the illegally gained food is related to man's soul and
is not repairable most of the time and pertains to the hereafter which
is eternal.

### 11. Injustice To The Weak Is The Worst Of Injustice

Among injustices, the injustice inflicted upon the weak people who lack
the power to defend themselves, is the worst kind of tyranny. Injustice
to such a person is only possible by one who has no manhood. Injustice
to people who are capable enough to defend themselves is not of the same
magnitude as the first one, but it is still very pernicious. This sort
of injustice is reproached in the Islamic traditions:

Imam Baqir (as) has said: My Father, at his death, told me one piece of
advice:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"يا بُنَيَّ اِيّاكَ وظُلمُ مَن لا يَجِدُ عَلَيكَ ناصِراً اِلاّ الله"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"My son! Beware of inflicting any injustice upon the one who has no
helper except God to stand against you"*[^45]

Imam ‘Ali (as) was once asked: Which sin is the quickest in punishment
for the sinner? He answered:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن ظَلَمَ مَن لا ناصِرَ لَه اِلا الله وجاوَرَ النِّعمَةَ
بِالتَقْصِيرِ واستَطالَ بِالبَغِي عَلى الفَقِير"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"One who inflicts injustice upon a person who has no helper except God,
who does not appreciate the assets; and one who oppresses the
poor."*[^46]

The Prophet (S) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اشتَدَّ غَضَبُ الله على مَن ظَلَمَ مَن لا يَجِدُ ناصِراً غَيرَ الله"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"God's anger is severe toward a person who inflicts injustice on one
who does not have any helper other than God."*[^47]

Imam Sadiq (as) is also reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَا مِن مَظلَمَةٍ اَشَدُّ مِن مَظلَمَةٍ لا يَجِدُ صَاحِبُها عَلَيهَا
عَوناً اِلاّ الله عَزَّوجَلَّ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"No injustice is worse than the one whose sufferer has no helper
against it but God"*[^48]

### 12. Sometimes Showing Severity Is Better Than Being Lenient

Sometimes it is advisable to be severe instead of kind and lenient. An
example is when a child or a student take advantage of the kindness of
the father or the teacher and do not take a lesson. In such a case the
child or the student should be treated severely. Another example is when
the mass of people take advantage of the kindness of the country
officials and start weakening the government through participation of
revolt. In such a case of mutiny, severity is necessary. This aggression
is in fact a kind of tolerance.

When we observe that the Prophet (S) and Imam ‘Ali (as), although being
kind and amicable, used aggression towards the mutiny-makers, or our
Imam, in struggle against trouble-makers was severe, we will notice that
these actions were to keep the independence of the community.

For this reason, Imam (as) has said in his letter:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِذا كانَ الرِفْقُ خَرَقاً كانَ الخَرَقُ رِفقاً"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Where gentleness is considered to be roughness, there roughness is
gentleness”.*

### 13. Sometimes The Remedy Is The Disease And The Disease Is The Remedy

The above title simply means that at times something which on appearance
looks hazardous might be useful or vice versa. Thus appearance should
not attract our attention and should not make us happy or unhappy.

### 14. Be Aware Of The Intention Of Those Who Give Advice

It is assumed that those who sometimes do not give sincere advice are
not sincere and the sincere advisors are benevolent. But this should not
lead us to accept wholly what the advisors try to tell us or to reject
what others tell us.

This is because sometimes we behave in contrast to what we generally
believe: i.e. one who is not considered to be a sincere advisor might be
benevolent and a well-wisher, and a sincere counselor might deceive us.
A wise man listens critically to them.
It is for this reason that Imam ‘Ali (as) emphasizes:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"ورُبَما نَصَحَ غَيرُ الناصِحِ وَغَشَ المُستَنصَحُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Sometimes one who is not a sincere counselor gives sincere advice and
the one considered to be a sincere counselor gives insincere advice”.*

This teaching is in harmony with the instructions of the Holy Qur’an
which says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"فَبَشِّرْ عِبَادِي الَّذِينَ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقَوْلَ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ
أَحْسَنَهُ أُوْلَئِكَ الَّذِينَ هَدَاهُمْ اللَّهُ وَأُوْلَئِكَ هُمْ
أُوْلُوا الْأَلْبَابِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Therefore give good news to my servants: Those who listen to the
word then follow the best of it; those are they whom Allah has guided,
and those it is who are the men of understanding"***[^49]

### 15. Reliance On Wishes Is Foolishness

As we have already seen, wishes are essentials of man's life. If he did
not have these wishes, he could not survive.

But to live in the world of fantasy and to live a life of dreams will
not do because the materialization of dreams needs hard work and trial.
They say "Three things wear out the intellect: extensive wishes, giving
quick replies (without thought) and excessive laughter"[^50]
It seems that the topic of Abu Tammam’s poem is related to this part of
Imam ‘Ali’s (as) statement.[^51] Abu Tammam says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن كانَ مَرْعَى عَزمِهِ وهُمُومِهِ رَوضُ الأمانِي لمَ يَزَل
مَهزُولاً"
  </p>
</blockquote>

"A person who pastures his determination and resolution in the meadows
of wishes will always be weak."

Imam ‘Ali (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"ايّاكَ والإتِكالُ على المُنَى فاِنَّها بَضائِعُ النُوكى"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Beware of relying on wishes for they are the capital of fools."*

### 16. Intellect Is The Safeguarding Of Experiences

In the lexicon the word intellect (‘*aql*) means understanding.
Sometimes it is used as an infinitive:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وما يَعقِلُها اِلاّ العَالِمُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And none understand them but the learned"***[^52]

This word may sometimes be used in the nominal form. In that case it
means: "The power which distinguishes good from bad, right from wrong,
and truth from falsehood".[^53] Perhaps this second meaning is meant by
the Prophet (S) when he said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وما خَلَقَ الله خَلْقاً اَكرَمَ عَلَيهِ مِنَ العَقْلِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"God has not created any creature nobler than the intellect"*[^54]

The word ‘*aql* (intellect) is sometimes used in the sense of *’iqal*
which is a band by which a camel is fettered. Thus, ‘*aql* or intellect
is in fact a power which hinders man from going astray. When Imam Sadiq
(as) was asked what the intellect was, he answered:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَا عُبِدَ بِهِ الرَّحمَنِ واكتَسَبَ بِهِ الِجنَان"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"The intellect is a power through which man worships God and by which
he earns paradise".*

Then he was asked: What was in Mu’awiya, then? He answered:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"تِلكَ النَكرَاءُ تِلكَ الشَيْطَنَةُ وَهِيَ شَبِيهَةٌ بِالعَقلِ
ولَيسَت بِالعَقْلِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"That was cunning. That was devilry. It resembles intellect, but it is
not intellect."*[^55]

And wherever God reproaches people because they lack intellect, the
first meaning is meant:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Deaf, dumb and blind, so they do not understand"***[^56]
And wherever man, due to lack of intellect, is not considered to be
obliged to carry out an action, the second sense is meant.[^57] Al-Kafi
mentions ‘*aql*, (intellect) as the opposite of *jahl*, (ignorance), and
"Kitab al-‘aql wa’l jahl" (The book of the intellect and ignorance) is
the title of one of the sections of the book, where the first sense is
meant and not ‘*aql* in contrast to *junun* (madness).[^58]
Man can comprehend some facts naturally; facts such as the following:
whole is greater than each one of its parts; the combination of two
contradictory things is impossible; justice is good, and the like. Man
can also get some facts through experimentation: facts such as the
following: the burning act of fire, the wetness of rain, the instability
of injustice, etc.

Concerning this, Imam ‘Ali (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"العَقْلُ عَقلانِ: عَقْلُ الطَبْعِ وعَقْلُ التَجْرِبَةِ وكِلاهُمَا
يُؤدّي الى المَنفَعَةِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"There are two kinds of intellect: innate intellect and intellect
through experience. Both of these lead man towards benefits."*[^59]

Imam ‘Ali (as) has also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"العَقلُ عَقلانِ: مَطبُوعٌ وَمَسمُوعٌ ولا يَنفَعُ مَسمُوعٌ اِذا لمَ
يَكُ مَطبُوع كَمَا لا يَنفَعُ ضَوءُ الشَمْسِ وضَوءُ العَينِ مَمنُوعٌ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"There are two kinds of intellect: innate and what is acquired through
hearing. The intellect acquired through hearing is of no use when there
is no innate disposition for it, just as sunlight is of no use when
there is no eyesight."*[^60]

Concerning the fact that the innate, natural intellect increases with
experiences, Imam ‘Ali (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"العَقْلُ غَرِيزَةٌ تَزِيدُ بِالعِلمِ والتَجارِب"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Intellect is an innate quality that increases through knowledge and
experience."*[^61]

With regards to the above topics, what Imam ‘Ali (as) means by ‘*aql* in
his expression is "the experimental and acquired intellect” and not
theoretical intellect. And by experience he means the acquisition of
partial samples in order to reach to a general conclusion; examples are:
injustice is not eternal; the government of righteousness is steady;
Samqunia is a laxative, etc.[^62]

### 17. The Best Experiences

As it was discussed previously, experience is one of the ways to gain
information in this world. Gaining knowledge and experience helps us to
guide our lives in the right path.
Imam ‘Ali (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَخَيرَ ما جَرَّبتَ ما وَعَظكَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The best of your experiences is that which teaches you a lesson.”*

The Prophet (S) also has said: "A believer is not bitten twice from the
same hole"[^63]
It is for this reason that the Holy Qur’an, after narrating the stories
of the ancient nations, wants us to take our lessons from them: ***"In
their histories there is certainly a lesson for men of
understanding"***[^64]

Imam ‘Ali (as) commands people to take lessons from the previous
instructive events:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"فاتَّعِظُوا عِبادَ اللهِ بِالعِبَرِ النَوافِعِ واعتَبِروا بالآي
السَواطِعِ وازدَجِرُوا بِالنُذُرِ البَوالِغِ وانتَفِعُوا بِالذِكرِ
وَالمَواعِظِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"O servants of God, take warning from beneficial admonitions. Take
lessons from the clear signs, restrain yourselves (from sin) through
far-reaching warnings and benefit through reminder and
exhortations."*[^65]

Imam ‘Ali (as) has also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن اَحكَمَ مِنَ التَجارِبِ سَلِمَ مِنَ العَواطِب, مَن غَنِيَ عَن
التَجارِبِ عَمِيَ عَن العَواقِبِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"One who learns well from experiences is safe from misfortunes; and one
who does not care about experiences cannot anticipate the
consequences"*[^66]

He has also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
(التَجرِبَةُ تُثمِرُ الاِعتِبَار)
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The fruit of experiences is learning lessons”.*[^67]

He has said elsewhere:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن حَفِظَ التَجارِبَ اَصابَت اَفعَالُهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

"*The deeds of one who safeguards his experiences will be
correct."*[^68]

But, unfortunately, as Imam ‘Ali (as) says, the number of those who take
lessons is few.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَا اكثَرَ العِبَر واقَلَّ الإعتِبار"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"How great the number of cases for taking lessons is and how small is
the number of those who learn lessons!"*[^69]

### 18. Taking Advantage Of Opportunities

The proper conditions are not always ready for man. But once in a while
there are good opportunities available to him. Later on, they might not
exist any more. The Prophet (S) has said in this regard:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِنَّ لِرَبِّكُم في أيّامِ دَهرِكُم نَفحَاتٌ ألا فَتَعرَّضُوا لها"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"In the days of your life, there are fragrant breezes (of mercy) from
your Lord. Take yourselves forward to benefit from them."*[^70]

In this relation, the Prophet (S) is reported to have said,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَنْ فُتِحَ لَهُ بَابٌ مِنَ الخَيرِ فَليَنتَهِزهُ فإنَّه لا يُدرى
مَتى يُغلَقُ عَنهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"One to whom a door of good is opened up, let him seize the opportunity
since it is not known when it will be closed to him."*[^71]

Of course the chances are as unstable as the clouds in the sky. You
should seize them or else you will lose them for ever.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِنتَهِزُوا فُرَصَ الخَيرِ فانَّها تَمُرُّ مَرَّ السَحابِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Seize opportunities for good since they pass away like clouds".*[^72]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"تَركُ الفُرَصِ غُصَصٌ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Losing opportunities creates sorrows".*[^73]

The Prophet (S) told Abu Dharr:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِغْتَنِم خَمساً قَبلَ خَمسٍ: شَبابَكَ قَبلَ هَرَمِكَ وصَحّتِكَ قَبلَ
سَقَمِكَ وغِناكَ قَبلَ فَقرِكَ وفَراغَكَ قَبلَ شُغلِكَ وحَياتَكَ قَبلَ
مَوتِكَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Take advantage of five things prior to five other things: your youth
prior to your age, your health prior to your sickness, your wealth prior
to your poverty, your leisure prior to your occupation, and your life
prior to your death."*[^74]

It is for this reason that Imam ‘Ali (as) in his letter gives the
following statement:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"بَادِر الفُرصَةَ قَبلَ أن تَكُونَ غُصّةً"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Hasten to avail of opportunity before it becomes grief."*

Sa’di, the Persian poet, says:
O young man obey your God today,
Because tomorrow, when you are old, you may not act as a young man;
The world stole from me days,
Each day of which was followed by a Qadr night,
Alas I did not appreciate the value of that day,
Now I start realizing, which is too late;
Due to my ignorance I lost the clear water,
Now I have to carry out Tayamum for my prayers;
When you are in the middle part of youth,
Your night is over, stop sleeping;
Now you try when the water is up to your waist,
Not at the time when flood passes over you head;
Do not waste your life using words like alas;
Because opportunity is dear and time is short.

### 19. Not Every Seeker Attains (His Desire) Nor Does Every Absent One Return

Sometime a man notices that he has not reached his goals in life. This
makes him unhappy. He might even seclude himself from the community. He
might then become a pessimist.
Imam ‘Ali (as) wants to, through examples, show us that this phenomenon
is very commonplace. It is not you alone who have not reached your
goals: there are other people like you. Should they be sad and depressed
like you? Or should they circle the difficulty and find a way out? It is
clear that this is the right way. You might perhaps not have reached
your objectives. But is the system of the world established in such a
way that everyone should succeed? Should every traveler return home?
Since this is the case, you have to be content of your God-given fate
and avoid being crushed by depression and disappointment. You have to
use your means to compensate for what you have lost.
Regretting the past and worrying about future are two mental
disturbances which inflict many people and have put hurdles on their
right ways of life. This problem will be solved through a right
planning, however.

Imam as-Sadiq (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"الايّامُ ثَلاثَةٌ: فَيَومٌ لا يُدرَكُ ويَومٌ النّاسُ فِيه فَيَنبَغِي
اَن يَغتَنِمُوه وغَداً إنّما فِيهِ اَملُه"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Life consists of three days: a day which has passed, never to return;
the present day in which people are living, of which they should take
advantage; and tomorrow, in which one’s hopes lie."*[^75]

Concerning the avoidance of depression and worry about the past and
future Imam ‘Ali (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لا تُشْعِر قَلبَكَ الهَمّ على ما فاتَ فَيَشغَلَكَ عَنِ الاستِعدادِ
بِما هُو آتِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Do not distress yourself about what has passed since it will occupy
you from preparation for what is to come."*[^76]

He has also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لا تَحمِل هَمَّ يَومِكَ الّذِي لمَ يَأتِكَ على يَومَكَ الّذِي قَد
اَتاكَ غُصَّةً"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Do not impose the anxiety about your tomorrow on your today out of
grief."*[^77]

Elsewhere Imam ‘Ali (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَما فَاتَكَ مِنهَا فَلا تَأسَ عَليهِ جَزَعاً"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Do not be grieved over what has escaped you of this world."*[^78]

It is also said by Imam ‘Ali (as):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"فَلا تَحمِل هَمَّ سَنَتِكَ على هَمِّ يَومِكَ كَفاكَ كُلُ يَومٍ ما
فِيهِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Do not impose the anxieties for the year ahead on the anxiety of
today. What each day holds is sufficient for you".*[^79]

A poet has written:
Why should the earth-dwellers,
Refer to the past events, always;
Why are they sad because of the past events?
Why should they cry on the present happenings?
They have nothing to do except complaining,
They would not take lessons from their past;
One, in his heyday of youth,
Regrets over his childhood;
He is the most handsome,
But frowns and gets an angry face;
How nice the past childhood was, he says,
Be happy that that time has returned;
The other has gone through the youth,
And has found it extremely rough;
He has lost vigor, wisdom and intelligence,
And he has made it his motto to talk on youth;
Where are the days of strength?
So that I could once again engage in love;
What I have seem among people,
Nobody thinks about now, I found;
Everybody is under the influence of illusions,
Nobody had anything except sorrow;
They don’t know that,
The present will become past pretty soon.

### 20. Destroying the Provisions For The Hereafter And The Resurrection Day Is A Great Loss

Those who envisage life only as it is in this world and do not consider
the other world, see man’s life and death as these pertain to the world
of beasts and which are materially determined.[^80]
The act of providing for the provisions for the next world might seem
vague and at times meaningless to these people.[^81]

But those who do not limit life span only to the life here and are of
the conviction that we have transformed from material phase to the
animal phase and to the human state and finally enter a phase called the
Hereafter or Resurrection Day. These stages were carried out without our
consent, however. In the Hereafter we have to harvest what we have
planted in this world. And if such a day did not exist, first the
creation would be aimless; secondly, the lack of such a day is in
contradiction with God’s justice; thirdly, the unstable nature of this
world shows that

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إِنَّ السَّاعَةَ آتِيَةٌ أَكَادُ أُخْفِيهَا لِتُجْزَى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ
بِمَا تَسْعَى"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Surely the hour is coming. I am about to make it manifest so that
every soul may be rewarded as it strives".***[^82]

Therefore, if a person destroys the provisions of this hazardous way and
thinks of life as it is here in this world, he will not enjoy a true
life even here because he has disobeyed God.[^83] Since the Resurrection
is inevitable and everybody should see the consequences of his actions
in this world, therefore, as Imam ‘Ali (as) has warned us, we should not
engage in destroying the provisions for Hereafter by wrong deeds and
holding wrong ideology. This would be a great loss.

### 21. Every Affair Has An Outcome

Definitely each act has an outcome. Therefore we should act in such a
way as to get good results. This is only possible through the following
ways: First, before engaging in an act, see the outcome: if it is good,
do it; or else, leave it. A man came up to the Prophet (S) and asked him
to offer him some pieces of advice. The Prophet (S) asked him three
times if he would carry out what he advised him on. The answer was
positive. The Prophet (S) then said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اُوصِيكَ اِذا أنتَ هَمَمتَ بِأمرٍ فَتَدَبَّر عَاقِبَتَهُ فإن يَكُ
رُشداً فامضِهِ واِن يَكُ غيّاً فانتَهِ عَنهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"I advise you, that when you intend to do something, reflect on its
outcome. If it is in the right direction, continue with it; but if it is
on the path of error, leave it ".*[^84]

Second, select the right path of action since the Holy Qur’an says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَلَيْسَ الْبِرُّ بِأَنْ تَأْتُوا الْبُيُوتَ مِنْ ظُهُورِهَا
وَلَكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ اتَّقَى وَأْتُوا الْبُيُوتَ مِنْ أَبْوَابِهَا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"..It is not righteousness that you whould enter houses at their
backs, but righteousness is this that one should guard against evil; and
go into the houses by their doors..."***[^85]
Jabir has reported from Imam Baqir (as) his saying:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"ويَنبَغِي أن تَأتُوا الامُورَ مِن جِهاتِها أيَّ الامورِ كَانَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"It is advisable to enter affairs, whatever they may be, through their
(right) directions."*[^86]

On the one hand, the Holy Qur’an enumerates the good things[^87] which
await the true believers[^88] (those who guard against evil). On the
other hand, the Qur’an commands people not to be rejecters[^89],
guilty,[^90] mischief-makers[^91] and unjust.[^92]

Imam Sadiq (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِن اَردتَ أن يُختَمَ بِخَيرٍ عَمَلُك حَتّى تَقبِضَ وانتَ في افضَلِ
الاعمالِ فَعظِّم لله حَقَّهُ اَن تَبذِلَ نَعمَائَهُ في مَعاصِيهِ واَن
تَغتَرَّ بِحلمِهِ عَنكَ واَكرِم كُلَّ مَن وَجَدتَهُ يَذكُرُنا او
يَنتَحِلُ بِمَودَّتِنا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"If you wish to seal your acts with good in such a way that at the time
of death you have a good record of good deeds, then magnify the rights
of Allah such that you do not use His blessings in disobedience to Him,
you do not consider yourself strong because of His forbearance towards
you, and honour all those whom you find mentioning us or professing love
for us."*[^93]

Third, the selection of right ways and the carrying out of good deeds
should be continuous all the way through the life. There are some, like
Talha, Zubayr, Hassan b. Thabit, Usama b. Zayd, and others who selected
the right way at first but later disregarded their obligations and
turned into the losers.

In contrast, there have been people who were wrong-doers throughout
their life but suddenly, due to the right decision-making, became the
fortunate ones, such as Hurr b. Yazeed ar-Riyahi, and Zuhayr Ibn
Qayn.[^94]
For this reason, the outcome is of crucial significance. Jesus Christ
(as) has said in this connection:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِنَّ النّاسَ يَقُولُونَ: اِنَّ البِناءَ بِأسَاسِهِ واَنا لا اقولُ
لَكُم كَذلِكَ، قالوا: فَماذا تَقُولُ يا رُوحَ الله؟ قال: بِحَقٍّ اقولُ
لَكُم اِنَّ آخِرَ حَجَرٍ يَضَعُهُ العامِلُ هُوَ الأساسُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"People say: The value of a building is determined by its foundation.
But I do not say that to you”. They asked him: “What do you say, Spirit
of Allah?” He said: “By the truth, I say to you that the* *last stone
which the builder puts on the building is the foundation." The narrator
says "What is meant is the end-product"*[^95]

The Prophet (S) is also reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن اَحسَنَ فِيما بَقِيَ مِن عُمرِهِ لم يُؤاخَذُ بِما مَضَى مِن
ذَنبِهِ ومَن اَساءَ فِيمَا بَقِيَ مِن عُمرِهِ اُخِذَ بِالأوَّلِ
والآخِرِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"One who does good deeds for the remaining part of his life shall not
suffer for the sins previously performed. But one who does evil in what
remains of his life, will be punished both for his earlier and his later
sins."*[^96]

The Prophet (S) is also reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مِلاكُ العَمَلِ خَواتِمُه"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"The basis for the action (to be right or wrong) is its end."*[^97]

However, it is us who determine the results of our action.

### 22. What Is Destined For You Will Soon Come To You

All events of this world, including the sustenance and livelihood of all
creatures, are predetermined by Allah:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَإِنْ مِنْ شَيْءٍ إِلَّا عِنْدَنَا خَزَائِنُهُ وَمَا نُنَزِّلُهُ
إِلَّا بِقَدَرٍ مَعْلُومٍ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And there is not a thing but with Us are the treasures of it, and We
do not send it down but in a known measure".***[^98]

And Allah will determine each creature's sustenance in accordance with
its capacities. Since the gaining of livelihood through prohibited ways
entails mental and spiritual losses, we are not allowed to engage in
greed, injustice, aggression, theft or the like to achieve our
objectives.
Imam ‘Ali (as) prohibits us from gaining possessions through illegal
and forbidden means and warns us that the predetermined sustenance will
keep a person from engaging in unlawful acts.
Thus, the traditions and the verses of the Holy Qur’an which deal with
the predetermination of livelihood are a hurdle on the way of the greed
of the world-mongers who do every sort of injustice to attain what they
wish for. These verses and traditions warn such people not to struggle
in vain. If they go through legal ways, they will receive what they
need.[^99]

And the Holy Qur’an says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَمَا مِنْ دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا
وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا كُلٌّ فِي كِتَابٍ مُبِينٍ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And there is no animal in the earth but on Allah is the sustenance
of it, and He knows its resting place and its depository; all things are
in a manifest book"***[^100]

### 23. Often the Little (Wealth) Becomes More Abundant Than What Is Much

A possession gained through unlawful and incorrect means may be much but
has evil consequences. Such unlawfully-gained assets are usually
short-lived for one thing and are a burden over the shoulders of the
possessor. But lawfully-gained assets may be small but they have
pleasant consequences.

Imam al-Kadhim (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِنَّ الحَرامَ لا يَنمَى واِن نَمَى لمَ يُبارَك لَهُ فِيهِ ومَا
اَنفَقَهُ لمَ يُؤجَر عَلَيهِ ومَا خَلَّفَهُ كانَ زَادَهُ اِلى النّارِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Unlawfully-gained assets will not increase in volume and value. Even
if they do, they will not last. If one gives charity from such
possessions, he will not be rewarded. (This, in fact, is another crime).
Whatever one leaves behind of such illegal assets, will be provisions
for one's Hell fire"*[^101]

Imam as-Sadiq (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن جَمَعَ مالاً مِن مَهاوِش اَذهَبَهُ الله في نَهابِر"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"A person who gains wealth through unlawful means, God will take it
away from him in places of destruction."*[^102]

Abu ‘Uthman says: I knew a father who loved one of his sons, but hated
the other. At the time of his death he endowed all his possession, which
was more than two hundred thousand Dirhams, to his beloved son and
deprived the other one of his possession. The man was an oil-seller.
After the death of both the brothers we saw the children of the rich
brother dependent on the children of the poor brother and being given
alms by them.[^103]

Each one of us comes across individuals who have amassed huge amounts of
wealth, but who have become wretched. On the other hand, we know
individuals who started from nothing but have been successful in life.
History is filled with such events.

### 24. There Is No Good In An Ignoble Helper Or A Friend Who Is Suspect (Whose Sincerity Is Suspect)

One of the benefits of friendship is to get help in solving problems. It
is for this reason that Imam ‘Ali (as) orders us:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"عَلَيكُم بِالإخوَانِ فإنَّهُم عُدَّةٌ في الدُّنيا والآخِرَةِ اَلا
تَستَمِعُونَ اِلى قَولِهِ تَعالى: فَمَا لَنَا مِنْ شَافِعِينَ وَلَا
صَدِيقٍ حَمِيمٍ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*‘Strengthen your bonds of friendship with your brothers in religion,
for they are a provision both here and in the Hereafter. Have you not
heard that Allah in the Holy Qur’an reports from the sinners who say:*

***“So we have no intercessors, nor a true friend.”’
(26:100-101)***[^104]

Imam ‘Ali (as) describes a friend as the closest relative and the best
agent for prosperity both here and in the Hereafter:

> "الصَّدِيقُ اَقرَبُ الأقارِبِ ـ الصَّدِيقُ أفضَلُ الذٌخرَينِ"690

*“The companionship of one who does not associate with you as a helper
against your self, will have evil consequences, if you but knew”!*

> "مَن لا يَصحَبُكَ مُعِيناً على نَفْسِكَ فَصُحبَتُه وبَالٌ عَلَيكَ اِن
> عَلِمت"691

For this reason, the great Prophet (S) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن لمَ تَنفَع بِدِينِهِ ودُنياهُ فَلا خَيرَ لَكَ في مُجالَسَتِه"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"There is no good in the companionship of one whose religion and world
is not of any benefit."*[^105]

It is for this reason that Imam ‘Ali (as) in his letter has emphasized:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لا خَيرَ في مُعِينٍ مُهِينٍ ولا في صَدِيقٍ ظَنِينٍ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“There is no good in an ignoble helper or in a friend who is (whose
sincerity is) suspect.”*

### 25. Patiently Benefit From Your Time

When life conditions are proper for us, we should patiently benefit from
it and we should not overtax ourselves. Some of the self-satisfied
individuals would go very fast when they are at the zenith of fame.
We may easily find examples in history. The communist government of
Russia (USSR) and the Baath party and Saddam Hussain in Iraq clearly
show that exerting pressure on people lead to the poverty and
wretchedness of people.

But the wise people continuously try to recognise the capacity and
potentials of their time and patiently benefit from them. Regarding
this, Imam ‘Ali (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"الحازِمُ مَن دَارى زَمانَهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"A prudent man is he who adapts to his time."*

Imam ‘Ali (as) emphasizes in his letter:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"سَاهِل الدَهرَ ما ذَلَّ لَكَ قُعُودُه"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"As long as time is in your grasp, take your share of it".*

Of course, this act of tolerance towards time, even when the conditions
are not favorable, like the twenty-five-year stay of Imam ‘Ali (as) at
home or the ten–year stay of the second Imam (as) at home or the cease
fire between Iran and Iraq by Imam Khomeini (as) is very hard to digest,
but this tolerance and prudence is necessary at times.

### 26. Do Not Put Anything At Risk Hoping For Something More Than It.

Man sometimes, in the hope to gain more profits, engages in some actions
the results of which are not clear to him.

But it should be observed that man’s actions should be based on reason
and wise probability is part of man’s procedure to safeguard higher
benefits. It is for this reason that man should not lose his capital for
the sake of assumed improbable benefits.

There are some people who do not make use of prudence and get themselves
involved in hazardous actions. For instance, without considering the
status of a merchandise item in business circles, he purchases those
goods in the hope to gain more profits. In this way the greedy merchant
easily goes bankrupt.

Imam ‘Ali (as) means by an adventurer merchant the one who keeps his
capital but in order to get more profits, he engages in wise
transactions. But when Imam ‘Ali (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"ولا تُخاطِر بِشَيئٍ رَجاءَ أكثَرَ مِنهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

"*Do not put anything at risk hoping for something more than it”.*

he means the greed-motivated actions of the businessman which are
harmful for him.

### 27. Do Not Be Stubborn

Being stubborn is one of the most hateful traits of human being. The
Holy Qur’an talks about the disclaimers of rightfulness, who suffer from
obstinacy; the Qur’an says: These people insist on their wrong ways
ignoring the blessings they enjoy:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَلَوْ رَحِمْنَاهُمْ وَكَشَفْنَا مَا بِهِمْ مِنْ ضُرٍّ لَلَجُّوا فِي
طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ وَلَقَدْ أَخَذْنَاهُمْ بِالْعَذَابِ فَمَا
اسْتَكَانُوا لِرَبِّهِمْ وَمَا يَتَضَرَّعُونَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And if We show mercy to them and remove the distress they have, they
would persist in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on. And We overtook
them with chastisement, but they were not submissive to their Lord, nor
do they humble themselves."***[^106]

Concerning these obstinate people, the Holy Qur’an says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"أَمَّنْ هَذَا الَّذِي يَرْزُقُكُمْ إِنْ أَمْسَكَ رِزْقَهُ بَلْ
لَجُّوا فِي عُتُوٍّ وَنُفُورٍ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Or who is it that will give you sustenance if He should withhold His
sustenance? Nay! They persist in disdain and aversion"***[^107]

Imam ‘Ali (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اللجَاجَةُ تَسلِبُ الرأيَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Obstinacy deprives man of correct judgment".*[^108]

At another case, he considers obstinacy as an agent for destruction:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِيّاكَ أن تَطِيحَ بِكَ مَطِيَّة الّلجاج"
  </p>
</blockquote>

"*Beware that the stubborn mount should run away with you”* (Avoid
obstinacy because it will destroy you).[^109]

In a letter which he has written to people in different cities
explaining what took place in Siffin, Imam ‘Ali (as) talks about the
nastiness of obstinacy in the following words:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"ومَن لَجَّ وتَمادَى فَهُو الراكِسُ الّذِي رانَ الله على قَلبِهِ
وصَارَت دَائِرَةُ السَوءِ على رَأسِهِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"One who is obstinate and persists (in straying from the right path) is
one who has turned himself backwards (to disbelief), whose heart Allah
has covered and he has become liable to evil calamities."*[^110]

Sometimes this state of obstinacy is so great that the stubborn person,
in order not to yield to justice, asks God for the descent of divine
chastisement so that he may get destroyed, but he is not ready to hear
the truth. In the occasion of the descent of the holy Surah of Ma’arij
we read: When the great Prophet (S) of Islam introduced Imam ‘Ali (as)
as his successor in al-Ghadeer, a man called Luqman Ibn Harith or Harith
Ibn Nu’man or Jabir Ibn Nasr asked the Prophet (S): “Did you do this on
your own or was it an order from Allah?" The Prophet (S) answered:

"I swear by Allah who is Unique, this act was done by His order."

When Nu’man heard this reply from the Prophet, he went away, saying:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اللَّهُمَّ إِنْ كَانَ هَذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِنْدِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ
عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِنْ السَّمَاءِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

"O God, if this is the truth from you, throw a stone from the sky upon
us."

At this moment, a stone fell from the sky, killing him on the spot. The
following Qur’anic verse was then revealed to the Prophet:

> "سَأَلَ سَائِلٌ بِعَذَابٍ وَاقِعٍ لِلْكَافِرينَ لَيْسَ لَهُ دَافِعٌ
> مِنْ اللَّهِ ذِي الْمَعَارِجِ"698

***"One demanding, demanded the chastisement which must befall the
unbelievers - there is none to avert it - from Allah, the Lord of the
ways of Ascent." [Qur’an 70:1-3].***

It is for this reason that we sometimes hear:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لَعَنَ الله الّلجّاج"
  </p>
</blockquote>

"May Allah curse the obstinate".

Imam ‘Ali (as) has also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"رَاكِبُ الّلجاج مُتَعَرّضٌ لِلبَلاء"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"One who rides the palfrey of obstinacy is exposed to
misfortunes"*[^111]

Imam ‘Ali (as) has also said:

> "ثَمَرةُ الّلجَّاج العَطَب"700

*"The fruit of obstinacy is destruction".*

Imam ‘Ali (as) in his letter has also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وايّاكَ أن تَجمَحَ بِكَ مَطِيَّةُ الّلجاج"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Beware that the stubborn mount should become ungovernable."*
