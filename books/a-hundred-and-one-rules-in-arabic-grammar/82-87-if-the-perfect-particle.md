87. If the Perfect Particle  قد
===============================

If the Perfect Particle  قد is used with a verb in the past tense, then
both are translated as a Present Perfect (has/have + Participle).

She has worked in this factory.** قد عَمِلتْ في هذا المَصنع ِ.**

When this particle is used with** کانَ** and a verb, then the whole
phrase is translated as a Past Perfect (had+participle).

**کانَ صديقي قد زارَني قـَبلَ سَنـَةٍ.**

My friend had visited me a year ago.
