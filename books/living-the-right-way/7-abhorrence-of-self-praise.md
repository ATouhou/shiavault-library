Abhorrence of Self-Praise
=========================

Another similar hateful trait is self-praise. In religion it has been
condemned and prohibited.

Allah the Most High said: ***“Have you not considered those who
attribute purity to themselves? Nay, Allah purifies whom He pleases; and
they shall not be wronged the husk of a date-stone.”***

He also said: ***“He knows you best when He brings you forth from the
earth and when you are embryos in the wombs of your mothers; therefore
do not attribute purity to your souls; He knows him best who guards
(against evil).”***

He also said: ***“And as for the favour of your Lord, do announce
(it).”***

About the second ayat mentioned above, Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (a.s.)
said: *“Nobody among you should boast about excessiveness in praying,
fasting, almsgiving and doing other religious duties. For Allah knows
him best who guards (against evil).”*

When Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (a.s.) was asked about it, he (a.s.) answered:
*“It is to say: ‘I have prayed, fasted, etc. in supererogation.”*

He (a.s.) was asked: ‘Is it permitted for man to speak of his
excellence?’ He (a.s.) answered: *“Yes, when it is necessary. Do you not
remember what the prophet Yusuf (Joseph) (a.s.) said to Pharaoh:*
***‘Place me (in authority) over the treasures of the land, surely I am
a good keeper,*** ***knowing well,’***[^1] *and what the prophet Hud
(a.s.) said to his people:* ***‘I am a faithful adviser to you?’”***[^2]
