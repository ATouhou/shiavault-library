Lesson 42: Mubtil Doubts that Invalidate the Prayer
===================================================

Eight kinds of doubts are such that if they occur then the Prayer is
rendered invalid. The prayer has to be offered again.  
 1. Doubt about the number of *rak’at*s in a two *rak’at* prayer like
Fajr, or *qasr* of Zuhr, Asr and ‘Isha.  
 2. Doubt about the number of *rak’at*s in a three *rak’at* prayer i.e.
Maghrib.  
 3. Doubt during a four *rak’at* prayer whether it was the first, the
second or the third *rak’at*.  
 4. Doubt during a four *rak’at* prayer before finishing the *dhikr* of
the second *sajdah* whether it was the second or the third *rak’at*.  
 5. Doubt during a four *rak’at* prayer whether it was the second, the
fifth or a higher *rak’at*.  
 6. Doubt during a four *rak’at* prayer whether it was the third, the
sixth or a higher *rak’at*.  
 7. Doubt during a four *rak’at* prayer whether it was the fourth, the
sixth or a higher *rak’at*.  
 8. To forget in a four *rak’at* prayer the number of *rak’at*s already
prayed.
