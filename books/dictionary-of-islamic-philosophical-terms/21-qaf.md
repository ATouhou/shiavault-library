al-Qatighuriyas
---------------

Categoriae or the Categories, the first book of Aristotle’s Organon
(al-Arghanun, q.v.) on logic. It deals with the ten categories
(al-maqulat al-‘ashr, q.v.), viz. substance (jauhar, q.v.), quantity
(kamm, q.v.), quality (kaif, q.v.), relation (’idafah, q.v.), time
(mata, q.v.), place (aina, q.v.), position (wad‘, q.v.), possession
(milk, q.v.), passion (’inf‘al, q.v.) and action (fi‘l, q.v.).

qarabadin
---------

The title of the first scientific book translated into Arabic in 64/683
from Syriac by Masarjawaih of Basra, a Jewish physician of Persian
origin; it was a kind of Materia Medica originally composed in Greek
(now lost) by a Christian (?) priest Aaron of Alexandria. See also Ahrun
al-Quss.

qarinah
-------

Lit. "Connection"; technically the connection between the two premises
of a syllogism (qiyas, q.v.) wherein they are united by a middle term
(al-hadd al-ausat, q.v.).

qadiyah
-------

An assertoric statement or proposition, i.e. a judgment expressed in
some particular language indicating the affirmation or denial of a
certain relation between two terms, one of which is called subject
(maudu‘, q.v.) and the other predicate (mahmul, q.v.).

al-qadiyat al-ihtimaliyah
-------------------------

A problematic or probable proposition, i.e. the proposition in which the
connection between the subject and the predicate, through not true of
all cases or in all circumstances is yet one which may exist in certain
cases or in certain circumstances like the statement "Politicians may be
trustworthy", "Cholera may not be fatal".

al-qadiyatan al-dakhilatan taht al-tadadd
-----------------------------------------

The two sub contrary propositions, i.e. the two particular propositions
having the same subject and predicate, but differing in quality -of the
form "Some S is P" or "Some S is not P". Such propositions can both be
true but cannot both be false, i.e. if one is true the other may be true
or false but if one is false the other must be true.

al-qadiyatan al-mutadakhilatan
------------------------------

The subaltern propositions, i.e. the two propositions having the same
subject and predicate, and of the same quality, but differing in
quantity; in other words the universal proposition and its corresponding
particular proposition of the same quality. In such propositions if the
universal is true the particular is also true and if the particular is
false the universal is also false. On the other hand, if the universal
is false the particular may be either false or true, and if the
particular is true the universal is either true or false.

al-qadiyatan al-mutadaddatan
----------------------------

The two contrary propositions, i.e. the two universal propositions
having the same subject and predicate but differing in quality -of the
form "All S is P" or "No S is P". Such propositions cannot both be true
though they may both be false.

al-qadiyatan al-mutaqabilatan
-----------------------------

The two opposite propositions, i.e. the propositions having the same
subject or predicate but differing in quality or quantity or both; they
are four kinds: (1) the two contrary propositions (al-qadiyatan
al-mutadaddatan, q.v.), (2) the two sub contrary propositions
(al-qadiyatan al-dakhilatan taht al-tadadd, q.v.), (3) the two
contradictory propositions (al-qadiyatan al-mutaqabilatan bi’l-tanaqud,
q.v.) and (4) the two subaltern propositions (al-qadiyatan
al-mutadakhilatan, q.v.). See also lauh al-taqabul.

al-qadiyatan al-mutaqabilatan bi’l-tanaqud
------------------------------------------

The two contradictory propositions, i.e. the two propositions having the
same subject and predicate but differing both in quality and quantity,
viz. A and O or E and I and vice versa. Such propositions cannot both be
true, nor can they both be false: if one is true the other must be
false, and if one is false the other must be true.

al-qadiyat al-basitah

al-qadiyat al-thana’iyah
------------------------

Secundi adjacentis, i.e. the proposition which consists solely of
subject and predicate with out a copula or the one which the copula
merges in the predicate like the statement in Arabic: "Zaid-un katib-un"

"Some stones are gems", etc.; also called al-qadiyat al-ba‘diyah (q.v.)

al-qadiyat al-hamliyah
----------------------

An attributive or categorical proposition in which the predicate is
affirmed or denied of the subject without positing any condition for
such an affirmation or denial like the statement: "Man is a rational

modern logic by the letter "O" and expressed in the form "Some S is not
P".

al-qadiyat al-salibat al-kulliyah
---------------------------------

The universal negative proposition, i.e. the proposition in which the
whole of the class denoted by the subject is excluded from the whole of
the class denoted by the predicate like the statement: "No men are

The singular proposition, i.e. the proposition the subject of which is a
definite individual like the statement: “Ibn Sina is a philosopher”, or
“This man is an Arab”; often called al-qadiyat al-mkhsusah (q.v.).

al-qadiyat al-shartiyah
-----------------------

The conditional proposition which consists not of two terms, subject and
predicate, but of two clauses or propositions related to each other as
antecedent (muqaddam, q.v.) and consequent (tali, q.v.) like the
statement: "If the sun shines, it is day" (al-shartiyat al-muttasilah,
q.v.) or as two disjunctives like: "Either this number is even or it is
odd" (al-shartiyat al-munfasilah, q.v.)

two clauses related to each other not as subject and predicate but as
antecedent

(muqaddam, q.v.) and consequent (tali, q.v.) like the statement: "If it
rains, the ground will be wet"; also called al-qadiyat al-shartiyah
[al-muttasilah](q.v.)

[ed. I am not sure what term the author is trying to convey. Having said
that I do believe that another name for the al-qadiyat al-muttasilah is
al-qadiyat al-shartiyah al-muttasilah.]

al-qadiyat al-muhassalah
------------------------

The proposition in which both the subject and the predicate are in the
affirmative like the statement: "Some men are writers"; opposed to
al-qadiyat al-ma‘dulah (q.v.)

al-qadiyat al-mahsurah
----------------------

The determinate proposition which has a quantifier (sur, q.v.), i.e. the
one in which the quantity of the subject is definitely indicated by the
use of such expressions as "all", "some", or "not all", "not some";
opposed to al-qadiyat al-muhmalah (q.v.)

al-qadiyat al-mkhsusah

al-qadiyat al-murakkabah
------------------------

The compound or exponible proposition, which as opposed to al-qadiyat
al-basitah (q.v.) expresses more than one judgment like the statement:
"All reptiles and birds are oviparous" or "Few people are rich". The
latter proposition also expresses a compound proposition, namely, "Most
people are not but some are", though the composition is only hidden in
it, i.e. it is an exponsible proposition.

al-qadiyat al-musawwarah
------------------------

The determinate proposition which has a quantifier (sur, q.v.), i.e. the
one in which the quantity of the subject is definitely indicated by the
use of such expressions as "all", "some", or "not all", "not some"; more
usually called al-qadiyat al-mahsurah (q.v.)

al-qadiyat al-mutlaqah
----------------------

An absolute or assertoric proposition, i.e. the one that has not
modality (jihah, q.v.). Such a proposition simply affirms or denies a
certain relation between subject and predicate as it is to be found in
our experience of matters of fact without referring to the necessity or
impossibility of that relation, for example the statements: "Ruminants
are cloven-footed" and "Horses are not blue".

al-qadiyat al-ma‘dulah
----------------------

The proposition in which, as opposed to al-qadiyat al-muhassalah (q.v.),
either the subject or the predicate or both the subject and the
predicate are in the negative; it thus may respectively be ma‘dulat
al-maudu‘ (q.v.), ma‘dulat al-mahmul (q.v.), or ma‘dulat al-tarafain
(q.v.).

al-qadiyat al-mumtana‘ah
------------------------

The impossible proposition, i.e. the proposition in which, as opposed to
al-qadiyat al-dururiyah (q.v.), the predicate or the subject is
universally and necessarily in the negative and the affirmative is
impossible to be considered like the predication of circularity to
triangles.

------------------------

The disjunctive proposition consisting of two clauses or sentences
related to each other not as subject and predicate but as two
alternatives which mutually exclude each other like the statement:
"Either the world is created or it is eternal"; also called al-shartiyat
al-munfasilah (q.v.)

al-qadiyat al-muhmalah
----------------------

Indesignate or indefinite proposition, i.e. a proposition without a
quantifier (sur, q.v.); in such a proposition, as opposed to determinate
proposition (al-qadiyat al-mahsurah, q.v.) the quantity of the subject
remains undefined or unexpressed like the statement: "Women are wise" or
"Students are lazy".

al-qadiyat al-mujibah
---------------------

An affirmative statement or proposition in which the predicate affirms
something about the subject, e.g. "Man is a rational animal".

al-qadiyat al-mujibah al-juz’iyah
---------------------------------

The particular affirmative proposition, i.e. the proposition in which
the class denoted by the predicate is affirmed of only a part of the
class denoted by the subject like the statement: "Some dogs are black,"
or "Some snakes are poisonous"; represented in modern logic by the
letter "I" and expressed in the form, "Some S is P".

al-qadiyat al-mujibat al-kulliyah
---------------------------------

The universal affirmative proposition, i.e. the proposition in which the
class denoted by the predicate is affirmed of the whole of the class
denoted by the subject like the statement: "All women are animals";
represented in modern logic by the letter "A" and expressed in the form
"All S is P".

al-qadiyat al-wujudiyah
-----------------------

The existential proposition, i.e. the statement denoting the existence
of something but without signifying anything about its necessity or
contingency.

qalb
----

Inversion, i.e. an immediate inference in which from a given proposition
we derive another proposition, having for its subject the contradictory
of the given subject; more often qalb is used for the proposition so
derived.

al-quwwat al-ba‘ithah
---------------------

The stimulative faculty, one of the two major kinds of he motive faculty
(al-quwwat al-muharrikah, q.v.) of the animal soul. It is constituted of
two powers or faculties: the attractive power (al-quwwat al-jadhibah,
q.v.) and repulsive power (al-quwwat al-dafi‘ah, q.v.) -this later
incites irascibility

(al-quwwat al-ghadbiyah, q.v.). The attractive power is further divided
into two powers: the concupiscible power (al-quwwat al-shahwaniyah) and
the appetitive power or desire (al-quwwat al-shauqiyah or al-quwwat
al-nuzu‘iyah). It is because of the simulative faculty (al-quwwat
al-ba‘ithah) that an animal is instinctively induced to move towards an
object which is profitable or that which gives pleasure and avoid an
object which is injurious or brings pain.

al-quwwat al-jadhibah
---------------------

The attractive faculty or power because of which an animal is
instinctively induced to be drawn towards an object which is for its
well-being or brings pleasure to it; it is divided into two kinds:
concupiscible power (al-quwwat al-shahwaniyah) and appetitive power or
desire (al-quwwat al-shauqiyah or al-quwwat al-nuzu‘iyah). See also
al-quwwat al-ba‘ithah.

al-quwwat al-hafizah
--------------------

The faculty of memory; see al-quwwat al-mutadhakkirah.

al-quwwat al-dafi‘ah
--------------------

The repulsive faculty or power because of which an animal is
instinctively induced to avoid an object which is harmful to it or is
likely to bring pain to it; if obstructed it arouses irascibility
(al-quwwat al-ghadbiyah) with which it is often identified. See also
al-quwwat al-ba‘ithah.

al-quwwat al-dhakirah
---------------------

The faculty of memory or reminiscence; see al-quwwat al-mutadhakkirah.

al-quwwat al-shauqiyah
----------------------

The appetitive faculty or desire; sometimes named as al-quwwat
al-nuzu‘iyah; see also al-quwwat al-ba‘ithah.

al-quwwat al-tabi‘iyah
----------------------

The natural powers or faculties, a term used collectively for the powers
or faculties of the vegetable mind (al-nafs al-nabatiyah, q.v.), viz.
the nutritive power (al-quwwat al-ghadhiyah, q.v.), the power of growth
(al-quwwat al-namiyah, q.v.) and the power of reproduction (al-quwwat
al-muwallidah, q.v.).

al-quwwat al-‘aqliyah
---------------------

The rational faculty specific to the human mind; it is primarily the
faculty of forming concepts or inferring the simple intelligible forms
from the sensible forms as perceived through the senses. When the
required concepts have been formed the rational faculty throws away the
yoke of the senses and the sensible forms and is sufficient unto itself
for all that it does. It compares and synthesizes various concepts and
thus forms judgments about them; it now enters into argumentation and
elaborate reasoning about these judgments and discuses physical and
metaphysical problems. All concepts and judgments, however, are not
obtained by the rational faculty; some are innate in it or are given to
it through a kind of divine inspiration these are

the self-evident truths -like the whole is greater than the part or that
contradictories cannot combine in the same thing at the same time.
Further, the rational faculty has two forms: one theoretical or
speculative (nazari) which enables us to have abstract thinking, and the
other practical (‘amali) on which morality depends.

al-quwwat al-ghadhiyah
----------------------

Nutritive power which when resident in a body changes another body into
the form of the first.

al-quwwat al-ghadbiyah
----------------------

The faculty or power of irascibility; see also al-quwwat al-dafi‘ah.

al-quwwat al-fa‘ilah
--------------------

The efficient faculty, one of the two major kinds of the motive faculty
(al-quwwat al-muharrikah, q.v.). It resides in the motor nerves and
muscles of the body and is the producer of all bodily movements: it
contracts the muscles and pulls the tendons and ligaments towards the
starting point of a movement or relaxes them and stretches them away
from the starting point.

al-quwwat al-mutakhayyilah
--------------------------

The faculty of imagination; located in the middle ventricle of the
brain. the faculty abstracts and combines the forms of the sensible
objects which it receives from the common sense (al-hiss al-mushtarik,
q.v.); it thus frees the sensible percepts from the conditions of place,
time and magnitude, and enables the mind to have images of objects even
after they cease to make impressions on the mind, which, to some extent,
is also the function of the formative faculty (al-quwwat
al-mutasawwirah, q.v.). The imaginative faculty, however, is to be
distinguished from the formative faculty in so far as the latter retains
the actual shape and form of the sensible objects ask now through the
external senses (al-hawas al-zahir, q.v.) while in the former the shape
and form of the sensible objects may be other than that disclosed by the
sense-organs. Hence, we can imagine objects which we have never
perceived and shall perhaps never perceive through our senses.

al-quwwat al-mutadhakkirah
--------------------------

The faculty of memory or reminiscence located in the posterior ventricle
of the brain. This faculty of the animal mind (al-nafs al-haywaniyah,
q.v.) retains and recollects or remembers the meanings of the sensible
objects which it has acquired through the estimative faculty (al-quwwat
al-mutawahhimah, q.v.); to be distinguished from the formative faculty
(al-quwwat al-mutasawwirah, q.v.) by the fact that whereas the formative
faculty perceives and retains merely the shape and form of the sensible
objects (say, a wolf), the faculty of memory apprehends and retains the
meanings of and judgements about the sensible objects (say, the
dangerousness of the wolf) as inferred by the estimative faculty
(al-quwwat al-mutawahhimah, q.v.). The faculty of memory is also
different from the faculty of imagination (al-quwwat al-mutakhayyilah,
q.v.) in so far as the latter allows us to imagine a thing not perceived
by the cognitive faculty (al-quwwat al-mudrikah, q.v.) or inferred by
the estimative faculty; the former

does not allow the image or notion of a thing which is not so perceived
or inferred.

al-quwwat al-mutasawwirah
-------------------------

The formative faculty or the faculty of representation, one of the
internal senses (al-mudrikat al-batinah, q.v.) located in the last
ventricle of the front brain. The function of the formative faculty is
to retain and store everything that the common sense (al-hiss
al-mushtarik, q.v.) forwards to it after having received it from the
five external senses. The common sense merely receives the various forms
of sensible objects and coalesces them together, it does not have the
power to retain those forms after the sensible object have disappeared,
just as water, though it can receive certain impressions, cannot retain
or store them. Retention or preservation of the form assembled by the
common sense is the function of the formative faculty; not to be
confused, however, with the faculty of memory for which see (al-quwwat
al-mutadhakkirah, q.v.).

al-quwwat al-mutawahhimah
-------------------------

The estimative faculty; located by Ibn Sina in the posterior part of the
middle ventricle of the brain. It is the faculty which constitutes what
may be said to be the “animal intelligence”. It is by this faculty that
the animal know instinctively what is dangerous and harmful and what is
profitable and useful, e.g. the sheep immediately know or infers by the
estimative faculty that it has to flee from the wolf. To be
distinguished from the formative faculty (al-quwwat al-mutasawwirah,
q.v.) which represents things only in their actual form and dimension
while the estimative faculty functions without this limitation or
restriction. A beast of prey, for example, seeing animal from a
distance, finds it smaller than its actual size and maybe also in
somewhat different form and yet infers its actual size and form through
estimative faculty and makes the appropriate attack. Also to be
distinguished from the imaginative faculty (al-quwwat al-mutakhayyilah,
q.v.) which functions without regard to the fact that things are or are
not what they appear

al-quwwat al-muharrikah
-----------------------

The motive faculty resident in the animal soul (al-nafs al-haywaniyah,
q.v.). It is constituted of two powers or faculties: simulative power
(al-quwwat al-ba‘ithah, q.v.) and efficient power (al-quwwat al-fa‘ilah,
q.v.). The simulative power is divided into attractive power (al-quwwat
al-jadhibah, q.v.) and repulsive power (al-quwwat al-dafi‘ah, q.v.),
which latter causes irascibility (al-quwwat al-ghadbiyah, q.v.); the
attractive power has further two forms: concupiscible power (al-quwwat
al-shahwaniyah) and the appetitive power or desire (al-quwwat
al-shauqiyah or al-quwwat al-nuzu‘iyah). the efficient power resides in
the motor nerves and the muscles of the body and is the producer of all
bodily movements. See also (al-quwwat al-ba‘ithah, q.v.).

al-quwwat al-mudrikah
=====================

The perceptive or cognitive faculty. It is of two kinds: external
(zahir) and internal (batin). The former includes the five senses
(al-hawas al-khamsah): touch, taste, smell, sight and hearing; and the
latter the inner senses, namely, common sense(al-hiss al-mushtarik,
q.v.), formative faculty (al-quwwat al-mutasawwirah, q.v.), memory
(al-quwwat al-mutadhakkirah, q.v.), imagination (al-quwwat
al-mutakhayyilah, q.v.) and estimative faculty (al-quwwat
al-mutawahhimah, q.v.). The objects cognised through the outer senses
are called mahsusat (percepts) and those by the inner senses wajdaniyat
(intuitions). What is perceived by the external senses first and then by
the internal senses is the form of the sensible objects, and what is
perceived by the internal senses alone is the meaning of a thing.

al-quwwat al-mustarji‘ah
------------------------

A term used by Mulla Sadra (Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Sadr al-Din al-Shirazi)
for the faculty of memory or recollection; see al-quwwat
al-mutadhakkirah.

al-quwwat al-musawwirah
-----------------------

A term used by Ibn Sina synonymous with (al-quwwat al-mutasawwirah,
q.v.) for formative faculty and by Mulla Sadra (Muhammad ibn Ibrahim
Sadr al-Din al-Shirazi) for the faculty of imagination (al-quwwat
al-mutakhayyilah, q.v.).

al-quwwat al-mufkkirah
----------------------

The cogitative faculty which works first by way of abstraction with
regard to percepts and then draws notions or concepts out of them. See
also al-quwwat al-‘aqliyah.

al-quwwat al-muwallidah
-----------------------

The power of generation or reproduction which by drawing from an animal
body a part similar to itself in potentiality is capable of producing
other bodies similar to it in actuality.

al-quwwat al-natiqah
--------------------

The rational faculty specific to human beings; See al-quwwat
al-‘aqliyah.

al-quwwat al-namiyah
--------------------

The power of growth resident in a living body by which it increases
without changing its form until it attains its full maturity. See also
al-nafs al-nabatiyah.

al-quwwat al-nuzu‘iyah
----------------------

Desire or appetitive faculty See also al-quwwat al-ba‘ithah.

al-quwwat al-wahmiyah
---------------------

The estimative faculty; see al-quwwat al-mutawahhimah.

Qaurniyah
---------

The school of Cyrenaicism founded by Aristippus (Aristifus, q.v.) of
Cyrene; hence the name. It holds the doctrine of enjoyment for its own
sake. As pleasure is the only intrinsic good, everything, including
virtue and philosophy, must be judged according to its capacity to bring
pleasure. All

pleasures are equal in value; they differ only in intensity and
duration. Hence, physical pleasures are preferable to intellectual or
moral pleasures, for the former are the keenest; and immediate pleasures
are preferable to the pleasures of the future, for the they are more
sure. Opposed to Kalbiyah (q.v.).

al-qaul al-jazim
----------------

An assertoric or declaratory statement as opposed to an exhortation,
command, request, or question.

al-quwa al-nafsaniyah
---------------------

The animal or sensual powers or faculties. The term is used collectively
for al the powers of the animal mind (al-nafs al-haywaniyah, q.v.), i.e.
those common with the powers of the vegetable mind (al-nafs
al-nabatiyah, q.v.) and those specific to the animal mind, viz. motive
power (al-quwwat al-muharrikah, q.v.) and perceptive power (al-quwwat
al-mudrikah, q.v.) and their different kinds and sub-kinds.

al-Qiyas
--------

The Arabic title give to Aristotle’s third book on logic, viz. Analytica
Priora; see Analutiqa.

qiyas
-----

Syllogism, i.e. a form of mediate inference in which a conclusion
(natijah, q.v.) necessarily results from the two given propositions
taken together, one of which is the major premise (al-muqaddamat
al-kubra, q.v.) and other the minor premise (al-muqaddamat al-sughra,
q.v.), because of a connection (qarinah, q.v.) between the two premises
wherein they are united through a common, i.e. middle term (al-hadd
al-ausat, q.v.). The conclusion, because it necessarily follows the
premises, is also sometimes called ridf, i.e. the consequent. The major
premise is that in which the major term (al-hadd al-akbar, q.v.) occurs,
and this is the one which occurs as a predicate (mahmul, q.v.) in the
conclusion; while the minor premise is that in which the minor term
(al-hadd al-asghar, q.v.) occurs, and this is the one which occurs as
subject (maudu, q.v.) in the conclusion. Thus in the stock syllogism:
"All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; hence Socrates is mortal", "All
men are mortal" is the major premise, "Socrates is a man", the minor
premise which together lead to the conclusion: "Socrates is mortal".
Qiyas has many forms for which see below. For the various kinds of
fallacies to be avoided in syllogistic argument, see in particular
mughalatah ishtirak al-lafzi and mughalatat al-’atraf al-’arba‘ah.

al-qiyas al-istithna’i
----------------------

Syllogism "by exclusion", i.e. the syllogism in which the major premise
is either a conditional conjunctive proposition (al-shartiyat
al-muttasilah, q.v.) or a conditional disjunctive proposition
(al-shartiyat al-munfasilah, q.v.) and the minor is arrived at by the
exclusion (’istithna’) of either of the two parts of the major. The
conclusion, either in the affirmative or in the negative, is actually
(bi’l-fi‘l) given in this kind of syllogism whereas in (al-qiyas
al-iqtirani, q.v.) it is not so give except potentially (bi’l-quwwah).
Al

qiyas al-istithna’i has two kinds: mixed hypothetical (al-sharti
al-muttasil, q.v.) and mixed disjunctive (al-sharti al-munfasil, q.v.):
the former, if the major premise, is a conditional conjunctive, i.e.
hypothetical proposition, the latter if it is conditional disjunctive
proposition.

al-qiyas al-’idmari
-------------------

An abridged form of syllogism, technically called enthymeme; see
al-qiyas al-mujiz.

al-qiyas al-iqtirani
--------------------

"Syllogism by coupling or by combination", i.e. the syllogism in which
two propositions or premises (kubra, q.v. and sughra, q.v.) are coupled
together, having one term in common (al-hadd al-ausat, q.v.) and the two
others different from each other, so that there necessarily follows from
this coupling or combination of the two premises or propositions
composed of two different terms as subject and predicate. It corresponds
to the categorical syllogism (al-qiyas al-hamli, q.v.). See also
al-qiyas al-istithna’i.

al-qiyas al-’iqna‘i
-------------------

Persuasive syllogism, a mode of reasoning to persuade or incite someone
to take a certain course of action: the stronger form of it like
al-qiyas al-jadali, (q.v.) is based on mashhurat (q.v.) and musallamat
(q.v.); and the weaker one like al-qiyas al-khitabi (q.v.) on  maznunat
(q.v.) and maqbulat (q.v.).

al-qiyas al-’ijazi
------------------

An abridged form of syllogism, technically called enthymeme; see
al-qiyas al-mujiz.

al-qiyas al-jadali
------------------

A dialectical syllogism consisting of the premises of the kind of
mashhurat (q.v.) and musallamat (q.v.) and for controverting the
standpoint or thesis of the adversary (khasm, q.v.) and establishing
one’s own.

al-qiyas al-jali
----------------

One of the two kinds of analogical reasoning in matters religious and
fiqhi (al-qiyas al-shar‘i, q.v.) employed by the jurists and the learned
of Islam. Wine, for example, has been forbidden in the Qur’an under the
word khamr, i.e. as a thing which intoxicates; it is therefore evident
(jali) through analogical reasoning that any other intoxicant, say,
opium, is also forbidden.

al-qiyas al-hamli
-----------------

(Pure) categorical syllogism, i.e. the one in which each one of the two
premises is a categorical proposition (al-qadiyat al-hamliyah, q.v.);
see also al-qiyas al-iqtirani.

al-qiyas al-khitabi
-------------------

A rhetorical syllogism grounded on maznunat (q.v.) and maqbulat (q.v.),
i.e. more or less probable premises; used for persuasion rather than for
instruction. See also al-qiyas al-’iqna‘i.

al-qiyas al-khafi
-----------------

One of the two kinds of analogical reasoning of religious nature
(al-qiyas al-shar‘i, q.v.) employed by the jurists and the learned of
Islam. In the Hadith, for example, it is enjoined that one goat in forty
must be given in charity; it is possible that some poor persons may be
more in need of money than of a goat; hence it may be argued on the
basis of al-qiyas al-khafi that it is permissible to give the value of
the goat rather than the goat itself in charity.

al-qiyas al-khulf
-----------------

Syllogism through reductio ad absurdum; a roundabout mode of argument by
which a proposition is proved by deducing a contradiction from the
negation of the proposition taken together with other propositions which
have already been granted or proved. This kind of syllogism is often
employed either to establish a proposition or premise by showing that
its contradictory involves impossible consequences or to disprove a
proposition by showing that its consequences are absurd.

qiyas al-daur
-------------

Argument in a circle like saying that "No S is P" and its converse "No P
is S" which remains a valid mode of reasoning so long as the terms
distributed in one proposition are also distributed in the other.

qiyas dhu’l-jihatain
--------------------

The dilemma, i.e. a complex syllogism in which the major premise is
constituted of two conditional conjunctive propositions (al-shartiyat
al-muttasilah, q.v.), the minor premise is a conditional disjunctive
proposition (al-shartiyat al-munfasilah, q.v.) the alternatives of which
either affirm the antecedents or deny the consequents of the major and
the conclusion is either categorical or disjunctive. This may be
illustrated by the following example:

If you marry, you will have responsibilities; if you remain single, you
will feel lonely.

Either you will marry, or you will remain single.

Therefore, either you will have responsibilities or you will feel
lonely.

The dilemma to be valid is to comply with the rules of the conditional
conjunctive syllogism (qiyas al-sharti al-muttasil, q.v.), that is
either there is the affirmation of the antecedent (wad‘ al-muqaddam,
q.v.) or the denial of the consequent (raf‘ al-tali, q.v.).

al-qiyas al-sufista’i
---------------------

Sophism, i.e. a mode of reasoning which appears to establish a
conclusion without really doing so with an intention to deceive the
adversary in discussion. See mughalatah and the various forms of logical
fallacies given under it.

al-qiyas al-sharti al-muttasil
------------------------------

The conditional conjunctive syllogism, one of the kinds of al-qiyas
al-istithna’i (q.v.). It is a complex syllogism which has for its major
premise a conditional conjunctive proposition (al-sharti al-muttasilah,
q.v.) of which in the minor premise the antecedent (muqaddam) is
affirmed or the consequent

(tali) denied; corresponds to the mixed hypothetical syllogism in modern
logic. See also (mughalatah raf‘ al-muqaddam, q.v.) and (mughalatah wad‘
al-tali, q.v.).

al-qiyas al-sharti al-munfasil
------------------------------

The conditional disjunctive syllogism, one of the kinds of al-qiyas
al-istithna’i (q.v.). It is a complex syllogism which has for its major
premise a conditional disjunctive proposition (al-sharti al-munfasilah,
q.v.), either one or the other alternative of which in the minor premise
is denied or affirmed: affirmation of one or the other alternative,
however, leads to a conclusion only and only if the two alternatives are
mutually exclusive (mani‘at al-jam‘, q.v.).

al-qiyas al-shar‘i
------------------

The analogical reasoning employed by the jurists and the learned of
Islam on the basis of the teaching of the Qur’an, the Hadith and ’ijma‘,
corresponding to tamthil (q.v.) in logic; it is of two kinds al-qiyas
al-jali (q.v.) and al-qiyas al-khafi (q.v.).

al-qiyas al-shi‘ri
------------------

Poetic syllogism, based on mukhayyallat (q.v.), i.e. imaginative data or
premises advanced to stir the soul of the hearer through the magic of
words, and thus often force upon his mind to imagine something to be
something else. See also al-qiyas al-’iqna‘i.

al-qiyas al-damir
-----------------

An abridged form of syllogism, technically called enthymeme; see
al-qiyas al-mujiz.

al-qiyas al-kamil
-----------------

The perfect syllogism, the name give to syllogism in the first figure
(al-shakl al-awwal, q.v.); for it is only form of syllogism which yields
the conclusion in any one of the four traditional propositions, viz.
universal affirmative (al-mujibat al-kulliyah, q.v.), particular
affirmative (al-mujibah al-juz’iyah, q.v.), universal negative
(al-salibat al-kulliyah, q.v.) and particular negative (al-salibat
al-juz’iyah, q.v.); more particularly it is the only form in which the
conclusion is available in the form of a universal affirmative or
general proposition which is needed for scientific purposes.

al-qiyas al-murakkab
--------------------

Polysyllogism, i.e. a combination of two or more syllogisms which are so
connected with one another that they ultimately lead to a simple
conclusion; see al-qiyas al-musalsal.

al-qiyas al-musawat
-------------------

Syllogism by equations in which the predicate of one premise becomes the
subject of the next, like saying: "A is equal to B; B is equal to C;
therefore A is equal to C". This form of syllogism is based on an
implicit presupposition, which it is necessary to prove before the
conclusion becomes established. The presupposition here that things
equal to the same thing are equal to each other, being axiomatically
true, validates the above

syllogism. Should we argue, however, that "A is half of B, B is half of
C, therefore A is half of C", it would be invalid (‘aqim, q.v.)
syllogism for the presupposition employed in this second case remains
unwarranted: the half of the half is not a half but a quarter.

al-qiyas al-musalsal
--------------------

A train of syllogism consisting of two or more syllogisms connected in
such a way that the conclusion of one becomes the premise of the other
so that at the end they lead to a single conclusion, for example:

(1)               All B is C

All A is B

Therefore, All A is C

(2)               All C is D

All A is C

Therefore, All A is D

(3)               All D is E

All A is D

Therefore, All A is E

(4)               All E is F

All A is E

Therefore, All A is F

al-qiyas al-muqassam
--------------------

Perfect induction, i.e. the process of arriving at a general proposition
by counting all the particular instances of a certain class like the
statement: "All the months of the lunar year have days less than
thirty-one." Perfect induction is perfect only in name: it is merely
perfect or complete enumeration and lacks two essential characteristics
of scientific induction, viz. inductive leap from the observed to the
non-observed instances and the causal connection between the facts
observed.

al-qiyas al-mujiz
-----------------

An Abridged syllogism or enthymeme, i.e. the syllogism in which one of
the premises, major (kubra, q.v.) or minor (sughra, q.v.), or conclusion
(natijah, q.v.) is not explicitly stated; for example, from a women
having milk (in her breasts) it is inferred that she has conceived.
Fully expressed it may be put in the following syllogistic form:

All women who have milk have conceived.

This women has milk.

Therefore, she has conceived.

Sometimes al-qiyas al-mujiz is named as al-qiyas al-’ijazi, al-qiyas
al-’idmari, al-qiyas al-damir, or mutarakmah.
