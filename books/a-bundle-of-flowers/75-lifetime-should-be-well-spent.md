Lifetime Should Be Well Spent
=============================

The holy Prophet (S) told Abu Dharr: "Take advantage of five
opportunities before five other things:

Your youth before your senescence, your health before your illness, your
wealth before your poverty, your leisure before your haste, and your
life before your death."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 77, p. 77

Imam Amir ul Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) said: "There is nothing worthier than
gold save what remains of a true believer's life."

Ghurar-ul-Hikam, p. 257

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "When it is the Day of Judgement, a group of
people stand and then come to the door of Heaven to knock on it. They
will be asked who they are and they will say: 'We are the people of
patience.' Then, they will be inquired upon what they were patient
about, and they will respond: 'We were patient with the obedience of
Allah and were patient with avoiding the sins against Him'. So Allah,
Almighty and Glorious, will say they are right and He will let them
enter Heaven. This is the word of Allah, Almighty and Glorious, Who
says: 'Those who patiently persevere will truly receive a reward without
measure!'" (Sura 39. Verse 10)

Al-Kafi, vol. 2, p. 75

Imam Amir ul Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) said: "Happy is he who has not great
expectations and wishes (in his life) and tries to make the most of his
remaining life-time."
