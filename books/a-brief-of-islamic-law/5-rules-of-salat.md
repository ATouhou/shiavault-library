Rules of Salat
==============

380.Salat is the best among all acts of worship. If it is accepted by
the Almighty Allah, other acts of worship are also accepet ed. And, if
prayers are not accepted, other acts are also not accepted.

Offering of prayers five times during day and night purifies us of sins
in the same manner as bathing five times during day and night makes our
body clean of all filth and one dirt.

It is befitting that one should offer prayers punctually. A person who
considers prayers to be something ordinary and unimportant is just like
one who does not offer prayers at all.

The holy prophet has said that a person who does not attach any
importance to prayers and considers it to be something insignificant
deserves chastisement in the hereafter.

Once, while the holy prophet was present in the Mosque (i.e.
Masjid-un-Nabi, a man entered and began offering prayer but did not
perform the Ruku’ and Sajdah properly. The holy prophet said: If this
man dies and his prayers continue to be this way, he will not depart on
my religion. Hence, one should not offer one’s prayer hurriedly. While
offering prayer one should remember Allah constantly and should offer
the prayers humbly and with all solemity. One should keep in mind the
Greatness of Almighty Allah with whom one communes while offering
prayers and should consider oneself to be very humble and insignificant
before His Grandeur and Glory. And if a person keeps himself absorbed in
these thoughts while perfoeming prayer he becomes unmindful and
oblivious to himself, just as when an arrow was pulled out of the foot
of the commander of the faithful, Imàm Ali (peace be on him) while he
was offering prayer, but he did not become aware of it.

Furthermore, one who performs prayer should be repentant and should
refrain from all sins and especially those which are an impediment in
the way of acceptance of one’s prayer (e.g. jealousy, pride, backbiting,
eating Halal (allowed) things, drinking intoxicating beverages,
non-payment of khums and Zakat). In fact, he should refrain from all
sins. Similarly, he should avoid acts which diminish the reward for
prayers like praying when one is drowsy or restless because of an urge
to urinate, and while offering prayer he should not look up towards the
sky. On the other hand, one should perform such acts which increase the
reward like wearing an ‘Aqiq ring (a ring with a signet of agate),
wearing clean clothes, combing the hair, pushing the teeth and using
perfume.

**Obligatory prayers**

The following six prayers are opligatory:

· DailySalats.
· Salatt-ul-A yat (signs pryar).
· Salatt-ul-Mayyit (funeral prayer).
· Salatt for the obligatory I\`awàf (circumambulation of the holy
ka’bah).
· Salatt-ul-Qad a’ of father which is, as a precaution, obligatory upon
his eldest son.
· Salatt which becomes obligatory on account of hire, vow or oath.
· Salatt-ul-jumu’ah (Friday prayer) is included the DailySalat.

**Obligatory DailySalats**

381. It is obligatory to perform the following five prayers during day
night:

· Dawn prayer (Fajr)- 2 Rak’ahs.
· Midday (Tuhr) and Afternoon (‘A?r) prayers-each one consisting of 4
Rak’ahs.
· Dusk prayer (Maghrib)- 3 Rak’ahs and Night prayer (‘Isha’)- 4
Rak’ahs.
382. While traveling, a traveller should reduce the prayers of 4
Rak’ahs to 2 Rak’ahs. The conditions under which the Rak’ahs are reduced
will be mentioned later.

**Time for Tuhr and ‘Aar prayers**

383. The time for Tuhr and ‘A?r prayers is from when the sun starts
declining (Ziwal)[^1] at midday till sunset. But, if a person
intentionally offers ‘Aar prayer earlier than Tuhr prayer, his prayer is
void. However, if a person had not prayed Tuhr till the end of time, and
the time left before the end allows only one Salat to be prayed, he will
first offer ‘A?r prayer in time and then his Tuhr prayer will be Qaèà’.
And if before that time a person offers complete ‘A?r prayer before Tuhr
prayer by mistake, his prayer is valid and he or she should offer Tuhr
prayer after it.

384. If a person begins offering ‘A?r prayer forgetfully before Tuhr
prayer and during the prayer he realises that he has committed a
mistake, he should revert his intention to Tuhr prayer, i.e. he should
intend that those parts offered before and those offered from now
onwards till the end of the prayer, would be Tuhr prayer After
completing the prayer, he will offer ‘A?r prayer.

**Friday prayer**

385. Friday prayer consists of 2 Rak’ahs like Fajr prayer. The
difference between these two prayers is that Friday prayer has two
sermons before it.Salat-ul-jumu’ah is obligatory in choice
(Wajib-ut-takhyiri), and we have an option to offer jumu’ah prayer, if
its necessary conditions are fulfilled, or to offer Tuhr prayer. Hence,
ifSalat-ul-jumu’ah is offered then it is not necessary to offer Tuhr
prayer.

The following conditions must be fulfilled for jumu’ah prayer to become
obligatory:

\*The time for jumu ah prayer shoyer set in. And thet means that the
middaytime should have begun to decline. The time for salat-ul-jumu ‘ah
is the earliest part of zuhe. If it is very much delayed, then
salat-ul-jumu ah time will beover, and Zuhr salat will hove to be
prayed

· The number of persons joiningSalat-ul-jumu’ah should be at least
five, including the Imàm. If there are less than five
people,Salatul-jumu’ah would not become obligatory.

· The Imàm should fulfil the necessary conditions for leading the
prayer.

These conditions include righteousness (‘Adalah) and other qualities
which are required of an Imàm and which will be mentioned in connection
with the congational prayer. In absence of an Imàm qualifying to
lead,Salat-ul-ujmu’ah will not be obligatory.

The following conditions should be fulfilled for theSalat-ul-jumu’ah to
be correct:

· The prayer should be offered in congregation. Hence, Friday prayer
cannot be prayed alone. If a person joinsSalat-ul-jumu’ ah before the
Ruku of the second Rak’ah his prayer will be valid and he will have to
add another Rak’ah to complete it. But, if he joins the Imàm in the Ruku
of the second Rak’ah then as an obligatory precaution the prayer may not
suffice, and Tuhr prayer should be prayed.

· Two sermons should be delivered before the prayer by Imàm.
· The distance between the two places whereSalat-ul-jumu’ah are offered
should not be less than one Farsakh (3 miles).

A Few Rules concerning jumu’ah prayer are as follows:

· As mentioned before,Salat-ul-Jumu’ah is not absolutely obligatory
during the time of Imàm’s (A.S.) absence. Then it is permissible Tuhr
prayer in the early part of its time.
· It is Makruh to talk while Imàm delivers the sermom. And if the noise
created by talking prevents others from listening to the sermon. Then it
is Halal (allowed) as a precaution.

· As an obligatory precaution, it is obligatory to listen to both the
sermons.

However, listening to the sermons is not obligatory upon those, who do
not underhand their meanings.

· It is not obligatory for a person wishing to join jumu’ah Sal at to
be present while Imàm is delivering the sermon.

**Time for Maghrib and ‘Isha’ prayers**

386. If a person doubts about sunset, and considers it probable that
the sun may be hidden behind mountains, buildings or trees, as long as
the redness in the eastern sky appearing after sunset has not passed
overhead, MaghribSalat should not be performed by him. However, as an
obligatory precaution, one should wait till that time, even if he or she
does not have any doubt about sunset.

387. In normal circumstances, the prescribed time for Maghrib and
‘Isha’ prayers is till midnight and night is from early sunset till
rising of fajr. But if forgetfulness, oversleeping or being in Haydh and
similar unusual situations prevent one from performing the prayers till
midnight, then for them the time will continue till Fajr sets in. In all
the cases, Maghrib must be prayed before ‘Isha’, and if one contradicts
their sequence purposely or knowingly, theSalat will be void. However,
if the time left over is just enough for ‘Isha’ prayer to be offered
within time, then ‘Isha’ will precede Maghrib prayer.

388. If a person begins ‘Isha’ prayer by mistake before Maghrib prayer
and realises during the prayer that he has made an error, and if he has
not yet gone into Ruku of the 4th Rak'ah he should turn his intention to
Maghrib prayer and complete the prayer. Thereafter he will offer ‘Isha’
prayer. However, if he has entered Ruka of the 4th Rak ah he can
continue to complete the ‘Isha’ prayer and thereafter pray Maghrib.

389. If a person in normal circmstances does not offer Maghrib or
‘Isha’ prayer till after midnight, he should, as an obligtoty precaution
offer the prayer in question before the dawn Adhan, without making an
intention of Ada’ (i.e in time) or Qaèà’ (i.e after the lapse of
time).

**Time for Subh (Fajr = Dawn) prayer**

390. Just before dawn a column of whiteness rises upwards from the
east. It is called the first dawn. When this whiteness spreads, it is
called the second dawn, and the prime time for Subh prayer. The time for
Subh prayer is till sunrise.

**Rules RegardingSalat Times**

391. A person can start offering prayer only when he becomes certain
that the time has sat in or when two just (‘Adil) persons inform that
the time has set in. In fact, one can rely upon the Adhan, or on advice
of a person who knows the timings and is reliable.

392. If a person is satisfied on the basis of any one of the above
methods that the time for prayer has set in and he begins offering
prayer, but then realises during the prayer that the time has not yet
set in, his prayer is void.

And the position is the same if he realises after the prayer that he
has offered the entire prayer before time. However, if one learns as he
prays that the time has just entered or if he learns after the prayer
that the time entered while he was in the process of praying, hisSalat
will be valid.

**Mustahab Prayers**

393. There are many Mustahab prayers which are generally called Nàfilah
but more stress has been laid on the daily Mustahab prayers. The number
of their Rak'ahs everyday excluding Friday, is 34. It is as follows:

\* 8 Rak'ahs Nàfilah for Tuhr
\* 8 Rak'ahs Nàfilah for A?r
\* 4 Rak'ahs Nàfilah for Maghrib
\* 2 Rak'ahs Nàfilah for Isha
\* 11 Rak'ahs Nàfilah midnight (Nafilat-ul-layl, Shaf and Watr)
\* 2 Rak'ahs Nàfilah for Fajr

As an obligatory precaution, the Nàfilah for Isha prayer should be
offered while sitting, and therefore its 2 Rak'ahs are counted as one.
But in Friday, 4 Rak'ahs are added to the 16 Rak'ahs of the Tuhr and the
A?r Nàfilahs, and it is preferable that all these 20 Rak'ahs are offered
before the Tuhr sets in, except for two Rak'ahs of it, which is better
be offered in the time of Ziwal.

394. Out of the 11 Rak'ahs of the midnight Nàfilah, 8 Rak'ahs should be
offered with the intention of the midnight Nàfilah, 2 Rak'ahs with the
intention of Shaf, and 1 Rak'ah with the intention of Watr (odd).
Complete instructions regarding Nafilat-ul-layl are given in the books
of supplications.

395. All Nàfilah prayers can be offered while sitting, even by persons
with option, and it is not necessary to count 2 Rak'ahs prayed while
sitting as one Rak'ah while standing. But it is better to perform all
Nàfilah prayers while standing, except for the Nàfilah for ‘Isha, while
showld, as an obligatory precaution, be performed while sitting.

396. Tuhr Nàfilah and A?r Nàfilah should not be offered when one is on
a journey, and one may offer Isha Nàfilah with the intention of Raja’.

**The Timings of the Daily Nàfilah Prayers**

397. The Tuhr Nàfilah is offered before Tuhr prayer. Its time is from
the commencement of the time of Tuhr, up to the time when it is possible
to offer it before Tuhr prayer.

398. The A?r Nàfilah is offered before A?r prayer, and its time is till
the moment when it is possibe to offer it before A?r prayer.

399. The Maghrib Nàfilah should be offered after Maghrib prayer, and
its time is till the moment when it is possible to offer it after
Maghrib prayer in time.

400. The time for ‘Isha Nàfilah is from the completion of Isha prayer
till midnight.

401. The Fajr Nàfilah is offered before the Fajr prayer, and its time
commences when a time required for offering Nafilat-ul-layl has been
passed from its time, till the time when it is possible to offer it
before Fajr prayer.

402. The time forSalat-ul-layl is from the begining of night till Adhan
for Fajr prayer, and it is better to offer it nearer to the time of fajr
prayer.

403. If a person gets up at the time of rising of fajr, he or she can
offerSalat-ul-layl without an intention of Ada or Qada.

**Ghufaylah Prayer**

404. Ghufaylah prayer is one of the Mustahab prayers which is offered
between Maghrib and Isha prayers. In its first Rak'ah after
Surat-ul-Hamd instead of the other Surah, the following verse should be
recited: Wa dhannuni idh dhahaba mughad iban fa-zanna an lannaqdira
alayhi Ahaadfa-nada fi-zulumati an la ilaha illa anta subhanaka
innikuntu min-az-zalimin, fa-stajabna lahu wa najjaynahu min-al-ghammi
wa kadhalika nunj-il-muminin. In the second Rakah after Surat-ul-Hamd,
instead of other Surah, the following verse should be recited: Wa indahu
mafatih-ul-ghaybi la ya'lamuha illa hu wa ya' lamu ma fil-barri
wal-bahri wa ma tasqutumin waraqatin illa ya-lamuha wa la habbatin fi
zulumat-il-wa laratbin yabisin illa fi kitabi mubin. And in Qunut this
suppliceation be recited:Allahumma inni as'aluka
bi-mafatih-il-ghybi-llati la ya'lamuha illa ant, an tusalliya'ala
Muhammadin wa ali Muhammad, wa an taf, ala bi..... (here one should
mention his wishes).

Thereafter, the following suppliceation should be read: x Allahumma
anta waliyyu ni'mat wal-qadiru'ala talibati, ta'lamu hajati fa-as'aluk
bihaqqi Muh mmadin wa ali Muhammad, alayhim-us-salam, lamma qad aytaha
li.

**Rules of Qiblah**

405. Qur Qiblah is the site of the holy Ka'bah ' which is situated in
Makkah, and one should offer one's prayers facing it. However, a person
who is far, would stand in such a manner that people would say that he
is praying facing the Qiblah, and that would suffice. This also applies
to other acts which should be performed facing the Qiblah, like while
slaughtering an animal etc.

406. A MustahabSalat can be offered while one is walking, or riding and
if a person offers Mustahab prayer in this two conditions, it is not
necessary to be facing the Qiblah.

407. A person who wishes to offer prayer, should make efforts to
ascertain the direction of Qiblah, and for that, he has to either be
absolutely sure, or acquire such information as may amount to certainty,
like testimony of two reliable persons. If that is not possible, he
should form an idea from the prayer niches (Mihrab) of the Masjid or
form the graves of the Muslims, or by other ways, and act acordingly. In
fact, if a non-Muslim who can determine Qiblah by scientific method,
indicates Qiblah satisfactorily, he can be relied upon.

408. If a person, who has a mere surmise about Qiblah, and is in a
position to have a better idea, he should not act on that guess work.
For example, if a guest has an idea about the direction of Qiblah on the
statement of the owner of the house, but feels that he can acquire a
firmer knowledge about Qiblah by some means, he should not sct on his
host's words.

409. If a person does not possess any means of determining the
direction of Qiblah, or in spite of his efforts, he cannot from an idea
about it, it will be sufficient for hom to offer his prayers facing any
direction.

410. If a person is sure or guesses that Qiblah is on one of the two
directions, he should offer pyayer facing both.

411. If a person who is not certain about the direction of Qiblah,
wishes to perform acts other thanSalat, which suold be done facing the
Qiblah like, slaughtering an animal, he should act according to his
surmise about the direction of Qiblah, and if that does not seem
possible, then performing the act facing any direction will be valid.

**Covering the Body in Prayers**

412. While offering prayer, a man should cover his private parts even
if no one is looking at him and preference is that he should also cover
his body from the navel to the knee.

413. A woman should cover her entire body while offering preayer,
including her head and hair. As an obligatory precaution, she should
cover herself even for her. Therefore, if she covers herself with a veil
in such a manner that she may see her body, it will be with an Ishkal.
It is not necessary for her to cover her face, or the hands up to the
wrists, or the upper parts of feet up to the ankles. Nevertheless, in
order to ensure that she has covered the obligatory parts of her body
adequately, she should also cover a part of the sides of her face as
well as lower part of her wrists and the ankles.

**Conditions for Dress Worn during Prayer**

**The first condition:**

The dress of a person who offers prayer should be Tahir. Therefore, if
he prays with Najis body, or dress, in normal situations, his prayer
would be void.

414. If a person did not care to know thatSalat offered with Najis body
or dress is void or that semen is Najis, and he prayed in that state,
his prayer, as an obligatory precaution, should be offered again, and if
its time had lapsed, he should offer its Qada.

415. If a person who who does not know the rule prays with Najis body
or dress, he does not have to offer it again or give its Qada, provided
that he has not been negligent to learn the rule.

416. If a person was sure that his body or dress was not Najis, and
came to know afterSalat that either of then was Najis, the prayer is in
order.

417. If a person forgets that his body or dress is Najis, and remembers
duringSalat, as or after completing salat an obligatory precation, he
should offer the prayer again, if his forgetting was due to
carelessness. And if the time has lapsed, he should give its Qada’. If
it was not due to carelessness, it is not necessary to pray again,
except when he remembers duringSalat, in which circumstances, he will
act as explained below.

418. If a person has ample time at his disposal while offering prayer,
and he realises during the prayer that his clothes are Najis, and
suspects that they may have become Najis after he started the prayer, he
should wash it, or change it, or take it off, provided that in so doing,
hisSalat does not become invalidated, and continue with theSalat to its
completion. But if he has no other dress to cover his private parts, or
washing the dress, or taking it off may invalidate hisSalat, he should,
as an obligatory precaution, repeat hisSalat with Tahir clothes.

419. If a person doubts whether his body or dress is Tahir, and if he
did not find anything Najis after investigation, and prayed, hisSalat
will be valid even if he learns afterSalat that his body or dress was
actually Najis. But if he did not care to investigate, then as an
obligatory precaution, he will repeat the prayer, and if the time has
lapsed, he will give its Qada.

420. If a person washes his dress, and becomes sure that it has become
Tahir, and offers prayer with it, but learns after the prayer that it
had not become Tahir, his prayer is in order.

421. A person who does not have any dress other than a Najis one,
should offer prayer with that Najis dress, and his prayer will be in
order.

**422. The second condition:**

The dress which a person uses for covering the private parts, while
offering prayer should, as an obligatory precaution, be Mubah. Hence, if
a person knows that it is Halal (allowed) to use a usurped dress, or
does not know the rule on account of negligence, and intentionally
offers prayer with the usurped dress, as a precaution, his prayer would
be void. But if his dress includes sush usurped things which alone
cannot cover the private parts, or even if they can cover the private
parts, but he is not actually wearing them at that time (for example, a
big handkerchif which is in his pocket) or if he is wearing the usuped
things together with a Mubah covering, in all these cases, the fact that
such extra things are usurped would not affect the validity of the
prayer ; although, as a precautionary measure, their use should be
avoided.

423. If a person purchases a dress with a sum of money whose Khums has
not been paid by him, but the transaction on the whole is in debt, like
most of transactions, the dress will beHalal (allowed) for him, but he
owes the Khums of the money paid by him. However if he purchases a dress
with the particular sum of money whose Khums has not been paid by him
then without the permission of a Mujtahib,Salat in that dress will
amount to theSalat in a dress which has been usurped.

**424. The third condition:**

The dress of the person which alone can cover the private parts, and
also, as an obligatory precaution, those which alone would not cover the
private parts, should not be made of the parts of the dead body of an
animal whose blood gushes when killed.

425. If the person, who offers prayer, carries with him parts from a
Najis carcass, which are counted as living parts, like, its flesh and
skin, the prayer will be in order.

426. If a person who offers prayer has with him parts from a carcass,
whose meat is lawful to eat, and which is not counted as a living part,
e.g. its hair and wool, or if he offers prayer with a dress which has
been made from such things, his prayer is in order.

427. The fourth condition: The dress of one who is praying, apart from
the small clothes like socks which would not ordinarily serve to cover
the private parts, should not be made of any part of the body of a wild
animal, nor, as an obligatory precaution, of any animal whose meat is
Halal (allowed). Similarly, his dress should not be soiled with the
urine, excretion, sweat, milk or hair of such animals. However, if there
is one isolated hair on the dress, or if he carries with him say, a box
in which any such things have been kept, there is no harm.

428. If the person offering prayer, doubts whether his dress is made of
the parts of an animal whose meat isHalal (allowed), or with the parts
of the animal whose meat is Halal (allowed), he is allowed to offer
prayer with it, irrespective of whether it has been made in Islamic
country or in non-Islamic country.

429. The fifth condition: The use of a dress empoidered with gold is
Halal (allowed) for men, and to pray in such a dress will makeSalat
void. But for women its use, whether in prayer or otherwise, is
allowed.

430. It is Halal (allowed) for men to wear gold, like hanging a golden
chain on one's chest, or wearing a gold ring, or to use a wrist watch
made of gold, and the prayers offered while wearing these things will be
void. But women are allowed to wear these things in prayers or
otherwise.
