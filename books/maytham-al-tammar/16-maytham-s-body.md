Maytham's Body
==============

Maytham did a lot of good for people. The people loved him very much.
They wanted to take Maytham's body to bury it. But the police strictly
prevented them from approaching it.

One night, seven dates-sellers came. They saw the policemen burning a
fire. Two of them sawed the trunk. The seven dates-sellers carried
Maytham's body outside Kufa. They buried it at a known place. Then they
came back home.

Six years passed. Mukhtar announced his revolution in Kufa. His army met
Ubaidullah's on al-Khazir Riverbank.

Ibrahim al-Ashtar could behead Ubaidullah bin Ziyad.

Some fighters brought Mukhtar the head of Ubaidullah. He stood up and
kicked Ubaidullah's head. He remembered Maytham's words in prison.

*Mukhtar, you'll get out of prison. You'll get revenge on Imam Husayn's
killers.*

Days passed. Imam Husayn's killers perished. People have cursed them
throughout history.

Today, when a visitor leaves the Holy City of Najaf and goes to see the
Kufa ruins, on the way he sees a beautiful dome. The dome decorates
Maytham's shrine.
