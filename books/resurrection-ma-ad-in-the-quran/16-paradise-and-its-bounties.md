Paradise and its Bounties
=========================

Paradise means a better world, a place with a pleasing atmosphere and
full of varying bounties, in which the righteous would live after death.
The Holy Quran has mentioned it as ‘Garden’, which denotes a place full
of greenery and trees. In Quran, there are numerous verses, which
promise Paradise to the believers and enumerate its different beauties
and bounties; some of which are as follows:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَبَشِّرِ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّلِحَتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ
جَنَّتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَرُ كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا
مِنْ ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ
وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَبِهاً وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا أَزْوَ جٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ
وَهُمْ فِيهَا خَلِدُونَ‏
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And convey good news to those who believe and do good deeds, that
they shall have gardens in which rivers flow; whenever they shall be
given a portion of the fruit thereof, they shall say: This is what was
given to us before; and they shall be given the like of it, and they
shall have pure mates in them, and in them, they shall abide. (2:25)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَكِنِ الَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْاْ رَبَّهُمْ لَهُمْ جَنَّتٌ تَجْرِى مِنْ
تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَرُ خَلِدِينَ فِيهَا نُزُلاً مِّنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ
وَمَا عِنْدَ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لِّلْأَبْرَارِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***But as to those who are careful of (their duty to) their Lord, they
shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding in them; an
entertainment from their Lord, and that which is with Allah is best for
the righteous. (3:198)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَتِ جَنَّتٍ تَجْرِى مِن
تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَرُ خَلِدِينَ فِيهَا وَمَسَكِنَ طَيِّبَةً فِى
جَنَّتِ عَدْنٍ وَ رِضْوَنٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ ذَ لِكَ هُوَ
الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ‏
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Allah has promised to the believing men and the believing women
gardens, beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them, and goodly
dwellings in gardens of perpetual abode; and best of all is Allah’s
goodly pleasure- that is the grand achievement. (9:72)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَّثَلُ الْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى وُعِدَ الْمُتَّقُونَ تِجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا
الْأَنْهَرُ أُكُلُهَا دَآئِمٌ وَ ظِلُّهَا تِلْكَ عُقْبَى الَّذِينَ
اتَّقَواْ وَّ عُقْبَى الْكَفِرينَ النَّارُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***A likeness of the garden which the righteous are promised; there now
beneath it rivers, its food and shades are perpetual; this is the
requital of those who guarded (against evil), and the requital of the
unbelievers is the fire. (13:35)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
جَنَّتُ عَدْنٍ يَدْخُلُونَهَا تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَرُ لَهُمْ
فِيهَا مَا يَشَآءُونَ كَذَلِكَ يَجْزِى اللَّهُ الْمُتَّقِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***The gardens of perpetuity, they shall enter them, rivers flowing
beneath them; they shall have in them what they please. Thus does Allah
reward those who guard (against evil). (16:31)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّلِحَتِ إِنَّا لَا نُضِيعُ
أَجْرَ مَنْ أَحْسَنَ عَمَلاً \* أُوْلَئِكَ لَهُمْ جَنَّتُ عَدْنٍ
تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهِمُ الْانْهَرُ يُحَلَّوْنَ فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ
مِن ذَهَبٍ وَيَلْبَسُونَ ثِيَاباً خُضْراً مِّن سُندُسٍ وَ إِسْتَبْرَقٍ
مُّتَّكِئِينَ فِيهَا عَلَى الْأَرآئِكِ نِعْمَ الثَّوَابُ وَ حَسُنَتْ
مُرْتَفَقاً
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Surely (as for) those who believe and do good, We do not waste the
reward of him who does a good work. These it is for whom are gardens of
perpetuity beneath which rivers flow,*** ***ornaments shall be given to
them therein of bracelets of gold, and they shall wear green robes of
fine silk and thick silk brocade interwoven with gold, reclining therein
on raised couches; excellent the recompense and goodly the resting
place. (18:30-31)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَلَا تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ
جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ‏
  </p>
</blockquote>

***So no soul knows what is hidden for them of that which will refresh
the eyes; a reward for what they did. (32:17)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ \* ادْخُلُواْ

  </p>
</blockquote>

***Those who believed in Our communications and were submissive: Enter
the garden, you and your wives; you shall be made happy. There shall be
sent round to them golden bowls and drinking-cups and therein shall be
what their souls yearn after and (wherein) the eyes shall delight, and
you shall abide therein. And this is the garden which you are given as
an inheritance on account of what you did. For you therein are many
fruits of which you shall eat. (43:69-73)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

***A parable of the garden which those guarding (against evil) are
promised: Therein are rivers of water that does not alter, and rivers of
milk the taste whereof does not change, and rivers of drink delicious to
those who drink, and rivers of honey clarified and for them therein are
all fruits and protection from their Lord. (Are these) like those who
abide in the fire… (47:15)***

***Hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and to a garden the
extensiveness of which is as the extensiveness of the heaven and the
earth; it is prepared for those who believe in Allah and His apostles…

***Surely the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is
camphor A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink; they
make it to flow a (goodly) flowing forth. (76:5-6)***

***And reward them, because they were patient, with garden and silk.
Reclining therein on raised couches, they shall find therein neither
(the severe heat of) the sun nor intense cold. And close down upon them
(shall be) its shadows, and its fruits shall be made near (to them),
being easy to reach. And there shall be made to go round about them
vessels of silver and goblets which are of glass. (Transparent as)
glass, made of silver; they have measured them according to a
measure.***

***And they shall be made to drink therein a cup the admixture of which
shall be ginger. (Of) a fountain therein which is named Salsabil. And
round about them shall go youths never altering in age; when you see
them you will think them to be scattered pearls. And when you see there,
you shall see blessings and a great kingdom. Upon them shall be garments
of fine green silk and thick silk interwoven with gold, and they shall
be adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord shall make them
drink a pure drink. (76:12-21)***

The above verses describe Paradise as a place of extremely high
standards and pleasing atmosphere in which different types of bounties
are ready. They include verdant trees below which streams of sweet water
flow; different delicious and fragrance fruits, which would be obtained
without any efforts; brooks of clean milk and honey and pure wine flow
there; whenever they want they can drink from it; fowl meat is ready for
them; they recline on comfortable sofas in beautiful palaces and
handsome servants continuously go around them entertaining them.

They wear dresses of fine and soft garments and stroll in the gardens of
Paradise; there would be Houries of Paradise for them, who are extremely
beautiful and no man has touched them before this and they have not even
looked at any man, except their consorts; and the righteous believers
would have to just mention whatever he wants and it would be made
available to him in Paradise.

It is mentioned that the above mentioned bounties are similar to the
bounties of the world and it is necessary to accept this fact, but it is
not necessary that we should consider them exactly as worldly examples
having all worldly aspects and defects; if it had been so, Paradise
would have been a part of the world, and not of hereafter. In the
circumstance that hereafter is a very lofty, world which is not in the
whole world; matters of the hereafter are pure of the defects of the
matters of the world.

In some verses and traditions also the same excellence is mentioned and
below we present some of them by way of examples:

The foods in the world are tasty, but along with it they have additional
matters which must necessarily be expelled in urine and feces; but the
foods of Paradise do not create excrement. Fruits of the world have to
be picked, but the branches of fruits of Paradise would themselves come
to the believer:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَدَانِيَةً عَلَيْهِمْ ظِلَالُهَا وَذُلِّلَتْ قُطُوفُهَا تَذْلِيلًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And close down upon them (shall be) its shadows, and its fruits shall
be made near (to them), being easy to reach. (76:14)***

Waters and milk of the world are prone to go bad if they are left for a
long time, and their taste undergoes a change, but the water and milk of
Paradise do not go bad:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فِيهَآ أَنْهَارٌ مِّن مَّآءٍ غَيْرِ آسِنٍ وَ أَنْهَارٌ مِّن لَّبَنٍ
لَّمْ يَتَغَيَّرْ طَعْمُهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Therein are rivers of water that does not alter, and rivers of milk
the taste whereof does not change. (47:15)***

Worldly drinks are tasty, but they also lead to intoxication and
addiction; as opposed to drinks of Paradise, which are tasty but are
pure of the defects of the worldly drinks.

Whatever is mentioned especially concerns bounties whose corrupted
versions are found in the world; but it can be concluded from Quran that
in Paradise there would be numerous bounties, which are much more
superior and so extraordinary that they were neither heard nor seen. Nor
the human heart had ever imagined them. The Holy Quran says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَلَا تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***So no soul knows what is hidden for them of that which will refresh
the eyes… (32:17)***

The Messenger of Allah (S) said:

“There are such bounties in Paradise that neither the human eye has seen
them nor the human heart has imagined.”[^1]

Bounties of Paradise would come in search of the believer and not that
the believer has to go out in search of them. Amirul Momineen (as) said:

“Tooba is a tree in Paradise; its roots are in the house of the
Messenger of Allah (S), and it will have a branch in the house of every
believer; whenever a believer desires something, it would be given to
him by that branch.”[^2]

The folks of Paradise would remain in perpetual youth and elegance.
Senility, disease, weakness, pain, sorrow, jealousy enmity and worry
have no place in Paradise. People of Paradise would enjoy the different
types of foods, but would not produce any excrement. They would live in
Paradise forever and death will never come to them.

The late Mulla Mohsin Faiz Kashani has mentioned the difference between
the bounties of Paradise and the bounties of the world:

Desire of man is under the control of things, which are beyond existence
but the matters of Paradise would be under the control of the folks of
Paradise. Whatever they desire would be given to them only by wishing
for it. The Almighty Allah says in the Holy Quran:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الْأَنفُسُ وَتَلَذُّ الْأَعْيُنُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***…therein shall be what their souls yearn after and (wherein) the eyes
shall delight… (43:71)***

Thus whatever they intend would be given to them immediately and not
that what is present at that time.[^3] Another difference is that the
growth of the hereafter is the growth of effulgence, perception, divine
proximity, life and appearance; matters of the hereafter are alive and
perceptible.

As mentioned in traditions, different fruits would tell the folks of
Paradise: ‘O Wali of Allah, eat me before you are inclined to something
else.’ And when the believer sits on his throne, it would become
extremely elated. And it is mentioned in Quran that:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَإِنَّ الدَّارَ الْآخِرَةَ لَهِىَ الْحَيَوَانُ لَوْ كَانُواْ
يَعْلَمُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***…as for the next abode, that most surely is the life- did they but
know! (29:64)***[^4]

Grades of Paradise
------------------

Paradise has different grades and ranks. The bounties of Paradise are
also not same for all the people of Paradise. All folks of Paradise are
not confined to the same place.

Some are placed in lofty positions and some inhabit the lower grades and
some occupy the middle stages.

Amirul Momineen (as) has said in description of Paradise:

“It has more and higher grades; it has different kinds of abodes and its
bounties are never exhausted. Its inhabitants never depart and one who
lives therein never becomes aged, its folks never fall in any need.”[^5]

The Quran says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
هُمْ دَرَجَتٌ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ‏
  </p>
</blockquote>

***There are (varying) grades with Allah, and Allah sees what they do.
(3:163)***

And it says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَا يَسْتَوِى الْقَعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِى
الضَّرَرِ وَ الْمُجَهِدُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ
وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَهِدِينَ بِأَمْوَ لِهِمْ
وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ عَلَى الْقَعِدِينَ دَرَجَةً وَكُلّاً وَعَدَ اللَّهُ
الْحُسْنَى وَفَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَهِدِينَ عَلَى الْقَعِدِينَ أَجْراً
عَظِيماً
  </p>
</blockquote>

***The holders back from among the believers, not having any injury, and
those who strive hard in Allah’s way with their property and their
persons are not equal; Allah has made the strivers with their property
and their persons to excel the holders back a (high) degree, and to each
(class) Allah has promised good; and Allah shall grant to the strivers
above the holders back a mighty reward. (4:95)***

And also says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَرْفَعِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مِنكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ
الْعِلْمَ دَرَجَاتٍ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Allah will exalt those of you who believe, and those who are given
knowledge, in high degrees; and Allah is Aware of what you do.
(58:11)***

Also it says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلِكُلٍ‏ّ دَرَجَاتٌ مِّمَّا عَمِلُواْ وَلِيُوَفِّيَهُمْ أَعْمَالَهُمْ
وَ هُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ‏
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And for all are degrees according to what they did, and that He may
pay them back fully their deeds and they shall not be wronged.
(46:19)***

The loftiest stage of Paradise is Rizwan; the Holy Quran says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ رِضْوَنٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ ذَ لِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ‏
  </p>
</blockquote>

***…and best of all is Allah’s goodly pleasure- that is the grand
achievement. (9:72)***

Therefore all the believers would go to Paradise and enjoy the bounties
of Paradise; but the abode of Paradise is not same for them all, neither
the bounties that they would enjoy. On the contrary there are so many
differences between them that our limited intellect cannot understand
them all. It is possible that these differences are due to the following
reasons:

One: How much divine recognition they have and what are their religious
beliefs.

Two: Their mental faculties and potential in observing moral values;

Three: How particular they are in performing their religious duties.

Four: Quantum of piety, refraining from evil traits and abstaining from
sins.

Although the people of Paradise would get whatever they intend or wish
for, immediately:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الْأَنفُسُ وَتَلَذُّ الْأَعْيُنُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***…therein shall be what their souls yearn after and (wherein) the eyes
shall delight… (43:71)***

But the desires of all the people are not same; on the contrary they are
dependent on their cognition and faith.

Access to Paradise and Enjoying Its Bounties
--------------------------------------------

Paradise is earned in this same world through faith and correct beliefs,
good ethics and deeds and through keeping away from sins and it would
become clear in the world of the hereafter. Paradise and its bounties
are as a result of the deeds of the world; on the contrary they would be
the deeds themselves.

Imam Ja’far Sadiq (as) said:

“Allah, the exalted and the blessed said: My true servants, enjoy the
bounties of My worship in this world, as you will enjoy the same in the
world of the hereafter.”[^6]

The Messenger of Allah (S) said:

“In Paradise there are transparent palaces of glass, which would be
occupied by those from my nation, who speak nicely with others, who feed
the poor, greet aloud and during the night when people sleep, they are
occupied in prayers.”[^7]

Imam Sajjad (as) said:

“Be blessed through reciting and acting on the Holy Quran. Indeed the
Almighty Allah has created Paradise with bricks of gold and silver. Its
mortar is musk; its sand is saffron and emeralds its pebbles. He has
made the stages of Paradise as numerous as the verses of Quran. One who
recited the Quran in the world (and acted on it) on Judgment Day he
would be told: Recite and continue to climb and anyone who enters
Paradise would not be higher than him, except the prophets and the
truthful ones.”[^8]

The Messenger of Allah (S) said:

“When on the night of ascension I entered Paradise, I beheld a white
plain where a number of angels were building palaces of gold and silver
bricks. Now they plied their work, and then they stood idle. I asked
them why their labors were interrupted. They replied, “We wait to be
paid for our labors.” “What payments?” I asked. They answered, “The
recital on earth by believers of such ascriptions as: Glory be to Allah,
and praise be to Allah, and there is no god except Allah, and Allah is
the greatest. Whenever they pronounce these ascriptions, we build; but
when they cease, our work also ceases.”[^9]

The Messenger of Allah (S) also said:

“Generosity is a tree of the trees of Paradise, with branches hanging in
the world; one who is generous is taken hold by one of those branches
and taken to Paradise. And miserliness is a tree from the trees of Hell;
it has branches in the world; thus one who is miserly takes up one of
its branches and enters Hell.”[^10]

Quran says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ أَطيعُوا اللَّهَ وَ الرَّسُولَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ \* وَ
سارِعُوا إِلى‏ مَغْفِرَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَ جَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا
السَّماواتُ وَ الْأَرْضُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْمُتَّقينَ \* الَّذينَ

الَّذينَ إِذا فَعَلُوا فاحِشَةً أَوْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ ذَكَرُوا

يَعْلَمُونَ \* أُولئِكَ جَزاؤُهُمْ مَغْفِرَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَ
جَنَّاتٌ تَجْري مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهارُ خالِدينَ فيها وَ نِعْمَ
أَجْرُ الْعامِلينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And obey Allah and the Apostle, that you may be shown mercy. And
hasten to forgiveness from your Lord; and a Garden, the extensiveness of
which is (as) the heavens and the earth, it is prepared for those who
guard (against evil). Those who spend (benevolently) in ease as well as
in straitness, and those who restrain (their) anger and pardon men; and
Allah loves the doers of good (to others). And those who when they
commit an indecency or do injustice to their souls remember Allah and
ask forgiveness for their faults- and who forgives the faults but Allah,
and (who) do not knowingly persist in what they have done. (As for)
these- their reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and gardens beneath
which rivers flow, to abide in them, and excellent is the reward of the
laborers. (3:132-136)***

That which is mentioned here was about the perfect Paradise, but as for
the Paradise of morals, good qualities and the Paradise of meeting the
Lord; it is another thing, to explain which is beyond the aim of this
brief treatise.

Our final statement is: Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds. O Allah
pity my old age, the termination of my days, the approach of my death
and my feebleness, my poverty and the scarcity of resources! Pity me
when my trace disappears from the world, my memory is wined off from
among the creatures and I be one who is forgotten!

My Lord, pity me at my resurrection and my rising (from the grave). On
that day, let my place be with Your friends, my exit among Your friends
and my dwelling in Your neighborhood, O Lord, of the Worlds! O my God,
discontinue Your goodness in my life and do not cut off Your favors on
me at my death Oh, the most merciful of the merciful ones.
