Fatima’s Fruitful Life:
=======================

What an insight Fatima (peace be upon her) had! What a great view and
outlook she had! What a home she made, and what great children she
educated; the children, who set a good example for humanity and took the
responsibility of a great historic mission.

Her life was short but fruitful, and all its processes were instructive,
exhilarating, lively, moving, virtuous, etc.

What great women she taught. Asma, Abubakr’s wife, being aware of the
plot of Ali’s assassination, made him aware by means of a the Quranic
verse. Fezeh, who went silent after the Karbala event and did not speak
except by the Quranic verses. Omme Aiman, known as a heavenly woman
according to the Prophet (peace be upon him and his descendants) and
other women, who were provided with education by Fatima (peace be upon
her).

-Once she opened her eyes to this world and made the Prophet (peace be
upon him and his descendants) delightful.

-Once she started her divine life according to Allah’s way with Ali
(peace be upon him).

-Once she closed her eyes to this world and joined her father in the
heaven.

-And once she will enter the Last Judgment while complaining the
oppressors and seeking for justice.
