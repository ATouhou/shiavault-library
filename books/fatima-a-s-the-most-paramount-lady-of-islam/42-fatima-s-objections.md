Fatima’s Objections:
====================

Fatima (peace be upon her) was endangering her life, because she had
disturbed their repose with her own objections and anger.

She objected to the Caliph’s status, their unjust actions, their
selfishness, Omma anxiety and disunity, their wrong bases, etc.

Yesterday, she observed the Prophet (peace be upon him and his
descendants) on the pulpit, but today Abubakr, being incompetent for
attaining this position, has sat there, and this irritated Fatima (peace
be upon her).

She objected just for the sake of Allah and endeavored to make the
oppressed of the society move and upraise as a volcano to burn and
annihilate any kind of injustice and take up the real way of human life.
