Where Is This God? / Where Is This Man?
=======================================

If you remember, we discovered that Allah has a few fingers, two legs
which are left leg and right leg, and a special sign on one of his leg
which is known only to my sunni brothers and they will know God in
Ghyamat (the other day) using this special sign on the leg of the God.

When searching for the creation of Eva (woman) and Adam (man), I
finally found out more about the almighty God. He is smaller than one of
the buildings in New York city, or a tree. He is only 30 meters.
Combining these signs of the almighty, I hope to become more familiar
with the God, the most high (!!).

I also urge islamic and nonislamic scientists to search for the first
human being on earth, named as Adam. He is 30 meters tall. Also, if
scientists carefully examine the remained skeletons along with history,
they have to be able to find a linear pattern for the hight of human
beings up to their father.

The reason is that human being is decreasing in its hight from 30
meters to 1.7 meters these days. I assure scientists that any other
results is wrong, and they have to investigate more about this before
finalizing their research. For example, if they find ice-man to be
almost as tall as the present man, they must be wrong. The older, the
taller the skeleton must be.

May Allah guide our scientists to the right path. (In fact, I wonder
why they do any research. They have to obey these traditions and issue
their scientific rules immediately. Although a hadith is not equal to
one verse of Quran, are we not supposed to listen to traditions and obey
them?)

Narrated Abu Huraira:

The Prophet said, "Allah created Adam in His picture, sixty cubits
(about 30 meters) in height. When He created him, He said (to him), "Go
and greet that group of angels sitting there, and listen what they will
say in reply to you, for that will be your greeting and the greeting of
your offspring." Adam (went and) said, 'As-Salamu alaikum (Peace be upon
you).'

They replied, 'AsSalamu-'Alaika wa Rahmatullah (Peace and Allah's Mercy
be on you) So they increased 'Wa Rahmatullah' The Prophet added 'So
whoever will enter Paradise, will be of the shape and picture of Adam
Since then the creation of Adam's (offspring) (i.e. stature of human
beings is being diminished continuously) to the present time."

Narrated Abu Huraira:

The Prophet said, "Allah created Adam, making him 60 cubits tall. When
He created him, He said to him, "Go and greet that group of angels, and
listen to their reply, for it will be your greeting (salutation) and the
greeting (salutations of your offspring." So, Adam said (to the
angels),

As-Salamu Alaikum (i.e. Peace be upon you). The angels said, "As-salamu
Alaika wa Rahmatu-l-lahi" (i.e. Peace and Allah's Mercy be upon you).
Thus the angels added to Adam's salutation the expression, 'Wa
Rahmatu-l-lahi,' Any person who will enter Paradise will resemble Adam
(in appearance and figure). People have been decreasing in stature since
Adam's creation.

Then you said:

Narrated Abu Huraira:

The Prophet said, "Allah created Adam in His picture, sixty cubits
(about 30 meters) in height. When He created him, He said (to him), The
"His" article here means Adam, which means that Allah created Adam in
his picture, i.e. Adam was not a child then grew up like other people.
This also means to refute darwinism: Adam was created in his known
picture (60 cubits...) and did not derive from any other animal
creature.

In the Hadith, the word which is used as "his picture" is :

Ala Soorateh

We know that Allah knew his plan for the entire world from the
beginning except that human beings are not aware of that. Such plan is
"PLAN". It is not a picture of something. When you say that you have a
picture, it means that you DO exist. You exist, hence, you have a
picture. So, picture is the attribute of an existing thing or human
being. That is why a photograph is called a "picture". If you see the
picture of an animal, you will say that such animal DOES exist, or it
DID exist.

When Allah wanted to created Adam, there was no Adam. There was no
picture of Adam, since there was no Adam. As the rsult of this
reasoning, "His" in "His picture" refers to the God, and does not refer
to Adam.

On the other hand, a plan which is not implemented yet remains a plan
and is never referred as picture. The hadith could have been spoken
as:

And Allah created Adam based on his plan, Or
And Allah created Adam by his knowledge, Or
And Allah created Adam by his power.

You can never find a single hadith anywhere (Even a garbage Hadith)
that is said:

And Allah created the earth in its picture.

And Allah created a cow in its picture.

There is no single verse in the so called Twisted bible or the book of
traditions where God has created an ass in its picture. There is,
however, some lines at the beginning of the old testement LIKE:

And Yahowah created Adam by his picture.

The reason is simple. When we are talking about a PLAN, it is a plan,
and it is not a picture. You doubt, ask 5 billion normal human beings
and they will tell you what they understand from this statement.
