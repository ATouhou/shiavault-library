Dedication
==========

To the pioneer of the human intellect;

To the establisher of human civilization;

To he who has filled the world with virtues and knowledge;

To the Imam and teacher: Jaâ€™far as-Sadiq.

I humbly offer to his highness this effort about his grandson Imam Abu
Muhammad al-Hasan al-Askari (a.s.)who had raised the banner of truth and
justice in the world of Islam, and I pray it will be accepted.
