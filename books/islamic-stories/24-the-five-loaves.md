The Five Loaves
===============

Zarr Bin Hobeish relates this story.

Two travellers sat together on the way to their destination to have a
meal. One had five loaves of bread. The other had three. A third
traveller was passing by and at the request of the two joined in the
meal.

The travellers cut each of the loaf of bread in three equal parts. Each
of the travellers ate eight broken pieces of the loaf.

At the time of leaving the third traveller took out eight dirhams and
gave to the first two men who had offered him the meal, and went away.
On receiving the money the two travellers started quarrelling as to who
should have how much of the money.

The five-loaf-man demanded five dirharns. The three-loaf-man insisted on
dividing the money in two equal parts.

The dispute was brought to Imam Ali lbn Abi Talib (the Caliph of the
time in Arabia) to be decided.

Imam Ali (a) requested the three-loaf-man to accept three dirhams. The
man refused and said that he would take only four dirhams. At this Imam
Ali (a) returned, â€œYou can have only one dirham. You had eight loaves
between yourselves. each loaf was broken in three parts.

Therefore, you had 24 equal parts. Your three loaves made nine parts out
of which you have eaten eight portions, leaving just one to the third
traveller. Your friend had five loaves which divided into three made
fifteen pieces. He ate eight pieces and gave seven pieces to the guest.
As such the guest shared one part from your loaves and seven from those
of your friend. So you should get one dirham and your friend should
receive seven dirhams.
