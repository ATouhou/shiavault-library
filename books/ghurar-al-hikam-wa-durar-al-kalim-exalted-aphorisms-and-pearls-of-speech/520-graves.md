Graves

**Graves-القبور**

1. Stay near (or pass by) the graves and you will learn a lesson.

> 1ـ جاوِرِ(جاوِزِ) القُبُورَ تَعْتَبِرْ.

2. How excellent a son-in-law the grave is![^1]

> 2ـ نِعْمَ الصِّهْرُ القَبْرُ.

[^1]: In the period of Jāhiliyya the Arabs would bury their daughters
alive and say “We have married them to the grave.” Later, in the time of
Islam, this expression was used in a general sense to remind people that
they will eventually die and be lowered into their graves.
