Part 7: Ahkam
=============

Muhaqqiq Hilli has given the above name to this category, since the
topics which fall under it are neither acts of worship nor contracts or
unilateral pronouncements. He has divided this into 12 chapters.

Chapter One:­ Kitab Al­sayd And Al­dhabaha
------------------------------------------

This chapter deals with hunting and slaughtering of those animals whose
meat we are allowed to eat. Sayd is hunting, dhabh is slaughtering. An
animal who has not been hunted as prescribed in Sharia, or has not been
slaughtered as guided by Islam, will be 'maytah', a corpse which is
najis, and haram to eat. This chapter also deals with the hunting of
wild animals by trained hunting dogs.

Chapter Two: ­Kitab Al­at'imah And Al­ashribah
----------------------------------------------

This chapter deals with those things which we are allowed to eat or
drink, and those which are forbidden. A detailed treatment is given to
animal food, sea food, non­-animal food and so on. It also explains and
categorises those animals which are Halal and those which are not. And
even in the Halal animals, it tells us of those parts of the body which
are haram to consume. It also gives rational treatment to those acts
which may be ordinarily permissible and harmless, but are harmful for a
particular person in a given circumstance.

Chapter Three: ­ Kitab Al­ghasb
-------------------------------

It means an illegal possession of property, or usurpation. As is known,
ghasb is Haram, but it must also be known that it involves a liability.
That means if a person usurps someone's property and if that property is
damaged or destroyed while still in his illegal possession, he is liable
for it, even if he did not directly damage or destroy it, but was
instrumental in causing the damage or destruction.

Chapter Four: ­ Kitab Al­shuf'ah
--------------------------------

Means the right of pre-emption. When a partner wishes to sell his share,
the remaining partner has a right of preemption for acquiring the share
by buying it at the price offered by others.

Chapter Five: ­Kitab Ihya Al­mawat
----------------------------------

Mawat refers to the barren, uncultivated land. A land which has been
developed, either by building upon it or by cultivation is called "Amir"
in Fiqh. The Prophet (s.a.w) said: "Whoever gives life to a barren,
uncultivated land, that land belongs to him". This has numerous
ramifications, explained under the chapter.

Chapter Six: ­Kitab Al­luqtah
-----------------------------

This refers to things which are picked up by chance, and the owner is
unknown. This can apply to animals and non ­animals. If a stray animal
is found which is not in anyway endangered, then one should not take it
into custody.

But if it faces any danger, then it can be possessed with the intention
to return it to its owner if found. If the owner is not found, then
Hakime Shara' has to authorise its use. This chapter also deals with
non­living objects, found in the sacred precincts of Haram or outside,
basing the guidelines on the value of the object.

Chapter Seven: ­Kitab Al­faraidh
--------------------------------

It is an elaborate chapter dealing with the laws of inheritance. Heirs
are divided in three categories:

(1) Parents, children, grandchildren (when the children are not
present).

(2) Grandparents, brothers and sisters (and in their absence, their
children).

(3) Uncles, aunts (both paternal and maternal) and their children.

The above heirs are by nasab (i.e. consanguinity). There are heirs who
inherit by Sabab (i.e. affinity) like husband and wife. This chapter
deals with various cases of succession in great detail.

The testator does not have the right to will for more than one third of
his or her estate, nor does he or she have any right to fix up the
shares of his or her heirs. The estate devolves on the heirs according
to Shariah.

Chapter Eight: ­Kitab Al­qadha
------------------------------

It is a chapter on judiciary, with elaborate sets of laws. There are
laws governing the appointment of judges, their rights, their
emoluments, and also about disqualifications. In Fiqh, it is stipulated
that a Judge must be an acknowledged Mujtahid.

Chapter Nine: ­Kitab Al­shahadah
--------------------------------

About the witnesses, who constitute the evidence to substantiate a
claim. The onus of providing the evidence does not rest on the
defendant. The chapter also explains how, in certain cases, the
defendant may be called upon to take an oath.

Chapter Ten: ­Kitab Al­hudood & Ta'zeerat
-----------------------------------------

Deals with punishment and retribution. These are of two types: hudood
and tazeerat. Hudood are fixed punitive measures prescribed for
specified offences, like sodomy, false accusation of fornication,
drinking alcohol etc., stealing, and belligerency and so on. Tazeerat
are such retributive measures which may vary according to the decision
reached by the judge who may aggravate or mitigate the sentence.

Chapter Eleven: ­Kitab Al­qisas
-------------------------------

It is a chapter on requitals. An elaborate discussion is carried out
about the crimes committed advertently or inadvertently, and in each
case the extent of requital is prescribed. Then there are laws of
recompensing for those who are murdered or are inadvertently killed.

Chapter Twelve: ­ Ilitab Al­diyat
---------------------------------

It is a form of requital, but unlike Qisas, it is only monetary
compensation. Interestingly enough, a doctor's responsibility towards
human life, and a disciplinary action by a tutor have a place under this
chapter. A doctor must be qualified enough to treat a patient. If he is
not and if the patient dies during the treatment, he is liable for
compensation.

In any case, a qualified and efficient doctor must absolve himself of
the liability beforehand. Similarly, a tutor carrying out corporal
punishment must be careful not to cripple or kill the pupil. If he does,
he is liable for compensation. These are dealt with in some detail.
