***So ask the Ahul Zikr if you do not know***

***(Surah Nahl 16:43)***


This international organization named “The Islamic Seminary”,
established under the patronage of His Eminence Ayatullah Khu’i, is
endeavoring to convey authentic Islamic Literature to the people of the
World.

The object of this organization is to meet the spiritual needs of the
present age, to draw the attention of the people to real and authentic
Islamic learning and to safeguard the valuable treasure of knowledge,
which has been entrusted to us by the seal of the Prophets, Muhammad and
by his holy Ahlul Bayt (Peace be upon them).

This organization has so far published more than 80 books in Urdu,
English, French, Sindhi and Gujarati and enjoys a high position among
the publications on Islamic literature. If Allah wills this process of
publication will continue and will show the right Path to the humanity.

Moreover, many madaris, which are being run under the Supervision of the
Seminary, are playing their role in spreading Islamic education among
the youths of the community.

Spreading the message of Islam is a task, which needs co-operation by
all of us. The seminary invites you to participate in this noble task so
that the teachings of Islam may be spread round the globe.
I pray to Almighty Allah to favor us with His kindness and Blessings.
