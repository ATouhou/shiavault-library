21. Belief in a redeemer
========================

In the view of the writer the belief in a redeemer is merely a Shia
belief which was rendered advantageous to Bani Abbas as well. As the
Sunni school of thought emerged, they held on to this belief which at
times was to their interest. This belief of a redeemer was that of all
Muslims. Who actually was and is this Redeemer? This stood the dispute
that divided the opinion among Muslims. Bani Abbas tried to show that
the Redeemer was one from them. They could only try when there existed a
general belief. Itself is a good proof that the Muslims commonly were
holding this belief without any reservations. Mansoor tried to introduce
his son Mohammad Bin Abdullah as the Redeemer. For this purpose he gave
him the title of Mahdi. The efforts in this field regardless from where
it came from did not succeed, because the people did not approve of
their reputation for such a post.
