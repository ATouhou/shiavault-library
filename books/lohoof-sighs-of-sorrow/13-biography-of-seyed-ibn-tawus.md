Biography of Seyed Ibn Tawus
============================

He is Seyed Raziyuddin Abul Qâsim Ali Ibn Sa?aduddin Abi Ibrahim Musa
Ibn Ja?far Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Tâwûs. His holy
ancestry reaches to Imâm Hasan al-Mujtaba (a.s.) from his father?s side
and upto Imâm Husain (a.s.) from his mother?s side and hence he is also
called Zul Hosnain.

He is known as Tâwûs (peacock) because one of his ancestors Abu
Abdullâh Muhammad bin Ishâq bin Hasan was a handsome man with ugly legs.
Therefore, they called him Tâwûs, and thereafter his progeny too got the
same title. He was born in the middle of Muharram 589 in Hilla. The
report that he was born in Rajab of 587 is weak. Ibne Tâwûs grew up in
Hilla and acquired the preliminary training there. He was in Hilla upto
year 602 where he was taught by many teachers and got certificates from
others who included:

His father Sa?aduddin Musa bin Musa. His grandfathers Warâm bin Abi
Farâs Nakhaee. As he himself says, his father and his grandfather, Warâm
had given special attention to his education and training and had taught
him the best of righteousness and courtesy. Abul Hasan Ali bin Yahya
al-Khiyât al-Hanât Sawrâvi Hilli.

Hussain bin Ahmad Sawrâvi Asad bin Abdul Qâdir Muhammad bin Ja?far bin
Hibbatullâh Hasan bin Alyud Darâbi Muhammad as-Sawrâvi Muhammad bin Ma?d
al-Musavi Fakhr bin Muhammad al-Musavi Haider bin Muhammad bin Zaid
al-Husaini Salim bin Mehfooz bin Azizat al-Hilli Jibraeel bin Ahmad
as-Sawrâvi Ali bin al-Husain bin Ahmad al-Jawâni Husain bin Abdul Karim
al-Gharvi Muhammad bin Abdullâh bin Ali bin Zahra al-Halabi Ibn Tâwûs
learned from non-Shia teachers and got permission (testimonial) and
explained the gracefulness of Shia through their narrations. Among such
teachers are: Muhammad bin Mahmood Najjâr Muaiyaduddin Muhammad bin
Muhammad Qummi.

Ibn Tâwûs married Zahra Khâtoon, daughter of the Shia Vazir of Nâsir
bin Zaidi. He was not pleased with that matrimony because it involved
tendency towards the world. We do not have enough information about the
said persons. We do not know whether or not she bore any child for the
Shaykh. The Seyed?s famous children were known by the names of their
mothers. The Seyed had good relations with the ruling diplomats like
Vazir Alqami Muhammad bin Ahmad, his brothers, and his son.

He also had good relations with Caliph Mustansir Abbâsi so that the
caliph built a house for the Seyed in the eastern part of Baghdad. The
caliph had tried to involve Seyed Ibne Tâwûs in political affairs and to
place all the Tâlibiyyin under his leadership but the Sayyid
emphatically rejected this. Mustansir also tried to send the Seyed as an
emissary to the Mongol ruler, which was not accepted. The first son of
the Seyed was born on the 9th of Muharram 643 in Hilla and the second on
the 8th of Muharram 647 in Najaf.

What we come to know from books of biography and translated works is
that the Sayyid had returned to Hilla in 641 and had gone to Najaf in
645 wherefrom he had gone to Kerbala in 649 and had proceeded on a
journey to Sâmarrah in 652 and on reaching Baghdâd he stayed there and
when Baghdâd fell to Moguls he was in that city.

When Holaku Khan arrived in Mustansariyah he asked the Ulamas
(scholars) this query: Who is better, a tyrant Muslim ruler or a Kâfir
judicious ruler? None gave a reply to this query but the Seyed said: A
Kâfir judicious ruler is better. All the ulama followed the Seyed?s
reply! It is obvious that the reply of Seyed saved and proteced the
lives of the people of the city. Only Allâh knows that any Muslim would
have remained alive in Baghdâd if he had not replied so.

It was on the 10th of Safar 656 A.H. that Holaku Khan called Seyed and
gave him protection and the Seyed left for Hilla.

On 9th Muharram 658 he was in Najaf in his house. On 14th Rabiul Awwal
658 he was in Baghdâd in his residence. It is mentioned that Holaku gave
the leadership of the Alawys to Seyed during 656-661, and it appears
that in 656 he was given the leadership of Baghdâd and in 661 that of
all the Tâlibiyyin. In the beginning, Seyed refused the leadership. But
Shaykh Naseeruddin Tusi told him that non-acceptance of it would result
in his death and thus he was compelled to agree.

The Seyed expired on the morning of Sunday, the 5 of Zilqad 664 A.H. in
Baghdâd, and his long time wish for being buried in Najaf was fulfilled.
th Information about his last days is difficult to obtain.

Some say that he died as the chief, and some state that in the last
days of his life he was dismissed from leadership or he and his brother
were martyred. He wrote the first part of his book Al-Malâhim on 15
Muharram 663 while leaving Baghdâd for Ziyarat in Najaf and during his
stay in Hilla.

In Jamâdiul Awwal 664 A.H. he gave Ijaza (Doctrinal authority
certificate) to some of his students. We have no information that he
left Iraq in 624 A.H. for a reason other than the Ziyarat of the House
of Allâh (Ka'ba).

Seyed?s economic condition was good and he reminded his children in his
will that, "following the traditions of the holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) and
Amirul Momineen (a.s.) he did not leave gold and silver as his heritage.
He invested his property and orchards as charity memorials.

It is famous that Seyed had Karâmat (Divine Miracles) some of which
have been mentioned in his notes and some have been written by his
biographers. It is also said that he had direct contact with Hujjatullâh
al- Muntazar (a.t.f.s.) and also that he was given Isme ?zam but was not
permitted to teach it to his children. Ibne Tâwûs had three brothers:

Sharfuddin Abul Fazl Muhammad Izzuddin Hasan Jamâluddin Abdul Fazâil
Ahmad, father of Ghayâsuddin Abdul Karim Ibne Tâwûs had four daughters,
the names of two; Sharful Ashraf and Fâtima are found in books. Seyed
always remembered his daughters with pride, because they had learnt the
holy Quran by heart. Sharaful Ashr?f had learnt it at the age of 12, and
Fâtima at 9. Seyed had willed two copies of the Holy Quran for them.

Seyed had willed many things whereby his children and the Shias
(friends) were urged to fear Allâh (taqwa), to be abstinent and to
remain away from people as far as possible because (excessive)
involvement with people results in getting distanced from the Almighty
Allâh.

Seyed Ibne Tâwûs owned a large library and a list of its books was
prepared. It is one of the important libraries in history. He always
maintained righteousness and regularity, and encouraged others to learn
about the holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) and the Ahle Bayt (a.s.). Because such
knowledge about the original sources of religion was the actual
understanding of religion (in practice). Seyed Ibn Tâwûs has written
many and various useful books. Some of them are as follow:

This was a brief story of the great and fruitful life of the Seyed,
which we have compiled from numerous books and most important of them
are the writings of ?le Yasin about the life, books, and library of
Seyed Ibne Tâwûs. Other writings are from Eton Kulburk about the library
and the life of the Seyed in English, which were later translated into
Persian.
