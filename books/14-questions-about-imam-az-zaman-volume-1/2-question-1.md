What is the purpose of the belief in “Mahdawiyyah” and when did it
originate?

**Reply:**

“Mahdawiyyah” is the belief about a universal saviour. All heavenly
religions like Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity and Islam make a
prominent mention about it. They hold that the last age will witness a
person who will emancipate the people from all corruption and evil.
Through him, the oppressed will regain their rights and breathe freely.

This creed is not limited to Islam but is an established faith of all
religions. Support for the weak, termination of oppression and
enlivening the dead are all matters related to the belief in the
promised Mahdi. Studies establish the archaism of “Mahdawiyyah”.

This matter has been subjected to distortion in all divine books except
the Holy Qur’an. But truth can never be eradicated completely. Some
sentences still remain in these ancient scriptures that help us in
tracing the belief about the Promised Mahdi in them. It is related to
prophecies and the Holy Qur’an testifies about it. Its origin is in
Divine revelation and beyond the reach of any human.

Many traditions prove the coming of the Mahdi, as evidenced by this
tradition from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.):

“Even if one day remains for the end of the world, Allah the Almighty
will prolong it to such an extent till a man appears from my family. His
name will be my name and his agnomen will be my agnomen. He will fill
the earth with justice and equity as it would be fraught with oppression
and corruption.”[^1]
