***And may the benedictions of Allah be upon***

The issue of “freedom” is one of the most controversial subjects in the
recent years, which has caught the attention of cultural and political
figures. So many scholars have delivered speeches or written articles
and books about “freedom.”

Undoubtedly, one of the most scholarly discussions of the issue of
freedom is the speeches of the eminent thinker, Ayatullah Misbah Yazdi
(may his blessings last), which were delivered in a series of talks on
“the Political Theory of Islam” and “the Legal Theory of Islam” prior to
the delivery of the Friday congregational prayers *khutbah*s [sermons]
in Tehran. In his speeches with such a rare precision, lucid expression
and scholarly approach, while discussing “Freedom and Its Different
Laws,” His Eminence has also clarified so many doubts.

In view of the importance of this talk, the Islamic Cultural Propagation
Office decided to extract subjects of the discussion regarding “freedom”
from the collection of Professor Misbah’s speeches, and present the same
to the interested readers in a new compilation and in the form of a
separate book.

Thanks to God, it was accomplished, and now the book, “Freedom: The
Unstated Facts and Points” is at your disposal, dear readers. We hope
the publication of this work could help those who have enthusiasm for
the pure Islamic culture in understanding better the religious
teachings, God willing.
