***In The Name of Allah, the All-beneficent, the All-merciful***

Presented at the feet of the most Noble and Immaculate Lady

Zainab bint Ali ibn Abi Talib (a.s.)

whose courageous eloquence,

in times of extreme suffering, while facing the tyrants,

has perpetuated the righteousness of the cause

and innocence of Imam Husayn (a.s.)

and those who were martyred with him.

Dedicated to my parents and my ancestors

who were rightly guided and who adored

the Immaculate and Infallible (Ma’soomeen) (a.s.)
