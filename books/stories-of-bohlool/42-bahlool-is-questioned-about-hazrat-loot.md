=======================================

People asked Bahlool, “Which nation was Hazrat Loot from?”

“It is clear from his name that he was the messenger for corrupt and
voluptuous people (Looters).”

The people said, “Why do you show such rudeness to the dignity of
Allah's Messenger?”

Bahlool answered, “I was not being rude towards the dignity of the
Prophet, I was speaking rudely about the nation, and I am not saying
wrongly.”
