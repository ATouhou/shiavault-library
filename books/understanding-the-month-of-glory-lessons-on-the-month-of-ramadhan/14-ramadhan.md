Ramadhan
========

Lo! Here once again is the blessed month of Ramadhan

Once again some of us find it difficult to fast

Once again we are fortunate to hear the Adhaan

Once again we could try and do better than last

O Companions, this month comes but once a year

Wake up my friends let us make it ever dear

Fasting is good for health, it chastens the mind

Beware Muslims! This glamorous world is making you blind

Remember the Holy Qur'an! Our book of guidance

The blessed Prophet received it this month, yes

It contains Laws, thoughts that make it ever radiant

Lo! It emphasizes fasts and prayers to keep us out of mess

O you who believe! Are we to neglect the words of Almighty Allah?

No, no, it should not be, come on Muslims, let us face the Kaaba

Forget the pie, forget the drinks, let them lay

Fasting is but a few hours a day

O ye faithful! Leave aside smoking, vices

This is Ramadhan, clean your hearts of vanities

Fast, pray, remember Allah and recite the Holy Book

Allah is Merciful, yes, He can give us all a new look.
