Dedication
==========

To him who has given a new life and knowledge to generations.

To the renewer of the intellectual renaissance in Islam.

To Imam Abu 'Abd Allah, Ja'far al-Sadiq, Peace be on him.

With both my hands I raise this humble effort with which I have been
honored through writing a research on the life of his son Imam Musa; his
testamentary trustee and his only successor in (taking) part in his
ordeal and affliction, hostage to prisons, ally of pain, like of the
Messiah, Isa b. Mariyam, in devotion, piety, and asceticism. So, be
bounteous to me, great Imam, through accepting (this research) that it
may be a store for me on the day of Coming to Allah.
