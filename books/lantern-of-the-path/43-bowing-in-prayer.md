Bowing in Prayer
================

   
 The bondsman of Allah does not truly bow (in ruku') but that Allah
adorns him with the light of His radiance, shades him in the shade of
His greatness and clothes him in the garment of His purity. Bowing is
first and prostration (sujud) is second: there is courtesy in bowing,
and in prostration nearness to Allah. Whoever is not good in the
courtesy is not fit for nearness; therefore bow with the ruku' of one
who is humble to Allah, abased in his heart and fearful under His power,
submitting his limbs to Allah like one who is fearful and sorrowful for
what he might miss of the benefits of those who bow.  
    
 It is related that Rabi' ibn Khuthaym used to stay awake all night
until dawn, in a single ruku'. In the morning he would sigh and say,
'Oh! The sincere have gone ahead, and we are cut off!' Make your ruku'
properly by keeping your back straight, coming down from your
aspirations in standing to serve Him which comes only with His help. Let
your heart flee from the whisperings, tricks and deceit of Satan. Allah
will elevate His bondsmen according to their humility to Him, and will
guide them to the roots of humility, submission and abasement according
to how well their innermost being is acquainted with His immensity.
