Preliminary Notes
=================

It is customary in Islam that each time the name of Allah, the prophet
Muhammad, prophets, or imams (descendants and successors of prophet
Muhammad) are enunciated, the following phrases are mentioned.

Allah- “Sabhanna wa-ta’alah.” Written abbreviations – SwT.

Prophet Muhammad- “Peace be upon him and his family.” Written
abbreviations- pbuh&hf.

After the names of prophets and imams from the family of the Holy
Prophet- “Peace be upon him/her.” Written abbreviations- pbuh.

With all due respect, admiration, acknowledgment, and praise we have
omitted the mentioned phrases for the sake of continuity and have stated
them in the beginning:

In the name of Allah, the most Merciful, the most Compassionate:

Subhanna wa-ta’alah.  
 Peace be upon him and his family.  
 Peace be upon the prophets.  
 Peace be upon the imams.
