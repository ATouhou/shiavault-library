Lesson Eighty Four: Two Things Cause Destruction Of People
==========================================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَهْلَكَ النّاسَ إِثْنانِ خَوْفُ الْفَقْرِ وَ طَلَبُ الْفَخْرِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Two things destroy people: fear of poverty and seeking of fanciful
honors![^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

If we consider the causes of increase in transgressions, larcenies,
thefts, cheating and plundering , we find that the above two factors are
at the root of these events. Some people, having everything, commit
offenses only for the fear of poverty and the obsession for securing the
future. And some others sacrifice their peace of mind and soul in order
to acquire fanciful honors. Giving up these destructive traits allows
man to enjoy inner peace and happiness.
