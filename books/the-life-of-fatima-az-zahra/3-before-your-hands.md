Before Your Hands
=================

O you the part of the messenger of Allah,  
 A fragrance from the soul of Muhammad,  
 The source of dignity in the world of Islam,  
 A flame from the light of Allah, and a flow from His mercy,  
 The mother of the two masters of the youth of Paradise,  
 The psalm of every noble lady from the daughters of Eve,  
 The light by which the confused are guided in the darkness of
ignorance,

O you who rejected the pleasures of life, and lived for abstinence,
virtuousness, and asceticism,

O my Lady, the aims of your father, the savior of humanity, lit in your
soul, and his values shone inside you, and so you set out from the
essence of the revelation and the mission into a great revolution
against deviation that Muslims were afflicted with after the departure
of your father to the better world.

You struggled stably and loftily to take them back to the path of the
mission that your father had made to save the nation from deviation and
from slipping into the abysses of this life. So you refuted suspicion,
lit the way, and showed the clear proof, but people admired this life,
were interested in its pleasures, and they insisted on erring and
stubbornness.

My lady, these are glimpses from your high ideals, which are as a Legion
of Honor to the Islamic nation, that I offer humbly and reverently to
your high standing expecting from Allah the Almighty that I shall obtain
your intercession that includes many many slack people like me!
