Muslims consider ***'ismah,*** infallibility, as an important quality
for the person who holds the position of prophethood. This quality is
not confined to the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace be upon him and
his progeny) but is also found in all the prophets and messengers of God
who came before Islam.

However, there are some verses of the Qur'an that apparently imply that
Prophet Adam and some other prophets had committed sins. This treatise
is an attempt to study the concept of ***'ismah*** in light of the
Qur'an.

This treatise is an expanded version of the lectures that I had given to
the weekly classes on Islamic theology at Toronto in 1995. I pray and
hope that this serves as a small but important step in studying the
Qur'an from the thematic approach.

***Rabbana taqabbal minna, innaka Samí'u 'd-du'a'.***
