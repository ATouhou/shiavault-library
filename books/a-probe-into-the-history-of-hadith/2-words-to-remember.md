Words to Remember
=================

Have you fully realised what Islam is? It is indeed a religion founded
on truth. It is such a fountain-head of learning that several streams of
wisdom and knowledge flow from it. It is such a lamp that several lamps
will be lighted from it. It is a lofty beacon of light illumining the
path of Allah. It is such a set of principles and beliefs that will
fully satisfy every seeker of truth and reality.

Know you all that Allah has made Islam the most sublime path for the
attainment of His supreme pleasure and the highest standard of His
worship and obedience. He has favored it with noble precepts, exalted
principles, undoubtable arguments, unchallengeable supremacy and
undeniable wisdom.

It is up to you to maintain the eminence and dignity granted to it by
the Lord, to follow it sincerely, to do justice to its articles of faith
and belief, to obey implicitly its tenets and orders and to give it the
proper place in your lives."

**Imam Ali (P)**
