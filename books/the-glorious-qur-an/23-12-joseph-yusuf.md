12: Joseph (yusuf)
==================

This chapter has 111 Meccan verses, except for vv. 1, 2.3 and 7 which
date from Madina.

It comprises twelve sections, and was revealed after the previous one
which is entitled Hud [the Messenger] 11 and before Stoneland 15. It
might almost be considered a short story, for it forms one of the
enduring tales in world literature, and a great theme that has been
known for millennia throughout the Middle East. It has even inspired
modern writers like Thomas Mann.

Joseph at the beginning is clearly a boy, a younger brother who will
relax and play while the rest of the family are out working (II). Thus
he provokes sibling jealousy He matures through trial and misfortune
until he ends as an advanced civil servant or statesman.

If this chapter carries any message, it is the need for trusting God
entirely through any period of trial. Moses' mystic journey (l8:IX-X)
serves as another example of this advice. Watch for the unkind cut when
Joseph was falsely accused of stealing (IX), and especially for the
noble figure of the here nameless elder brother who also appears at il
and x; the family was not all bad. It is interesting too that the ruler
of Egypt is here called a king rather than Pharaoh (VI-VII).
