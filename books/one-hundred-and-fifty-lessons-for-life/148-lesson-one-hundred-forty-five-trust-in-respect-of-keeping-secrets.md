Lesson One Hundred Forty Five: Trust In Respect Of Keeping Secrets
==================================================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اِذا حَدَّثَ الرَّجُلُ بِحَديث، ثُمَّ الْتَفَتَ فَهِىَ اَمانَةٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

When somebody says something and looks around himself, his speech is a
trust and secret (and we shall try to keep it).[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Trust has different forms in Islam, including faithfulness in keeping
people’s secrets. This is considered so important in Islam’s view that
disclosing a person’s secret is considered as one of the capital sins.
Moreover, for something to count as a secret, it is not necessary that
the speaker has said that it is a secret and requested that it be kept a
secret. Rather, the least sign or hint is sufficient for understanding
this reality. If , before speaking, somebody looks around himself to see
if another person is within hearing distance, this would be adequate to
give rise to the trust so that it becomes obligatory to treat what he
says as a secret of a Muslin brother.
