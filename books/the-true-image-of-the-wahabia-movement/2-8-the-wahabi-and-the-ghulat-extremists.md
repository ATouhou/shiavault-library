8 - the Wahabi and the Ghulat (extremists)
==========================================

The Ghulat or extremist are those who went to extremes in exalting a
person or persons to the extent of raising him or them above the ranks
of ordinary human beings.

At the same time of the rise of Wahabia in Najid, another person was
preaching a new doctrine which renewed much of what has disappeared of
the beliefs of the first Ghulats who deified Imam Ali and other members
of the Prophet Household. His teachings were similar to those of Ibn
Abdul Wahab in labeling his opponents as heretics. He actually went
further than the Wahabia founder by attacking most of the Prophet's
Companions and calling them heretics.

The name of that man was Shaikh Ahmed al-Ihsaie (died 1241 AH.) His
followers were thus known as al-Shaikhia. He was succeeded by Khathim
al-Rashti who established his headquarters at Kerbala in southern
Iraq.

The Wahabi's attitudes toward this movement is interesting. As history
report, the Wahabis attacked Karbala where al-Rashti and his followers
resided. As their custom in all their military campaigns, the Wahabis
sacked the city, slaughtering thousands of innocent men, women and
children and looting and destroying houses and shops.

But they guaranteed al-Rashti's personal safety and declared that
anyone entering his house shall be safe. This special treatment of this
group and their leader unveils the true nature of the Wahabi and exposes
the falsehood of their claim of opposing idolatry and defending divine
unity.

At this point, it may be useful to compare this position with a similar
one by Ibn Taimia, whom the Wahabis claim to follow, toward another
extremist group, namely the Yazidis. The Yazidis exalted Yazid ibn
Muawiya whose un-Islamic deeds were enumerated earlier. A branch of this
sect was named al-Adawia after Udai ibn Musafir whom they exalted along
with Yazid.

Ibn Taimia who was a contemporary of this sect maintained an
inexplicably untypical attitude toward this group. Famed for his extreme
opinions and fierce attacks on Islamic sects swiftly judging them to be
deviant and heretic, he wrote a letter to this group addressing them as
faithful Muslims. In this civil and well-wishing letter we find none of
his offending style and usual labels which he used in communicating with
or writing on other Islamic groups such as the Asharia, the Imamiya
Shia, the Zaidis, Mutazila, Murajia and others.

His letter to this group begins as follows: 26

From Ahmed ibn Tairnia to whoever receives this letter of the Muslims
who belong to the Sunna and follow the exemplary, blessed, and learned
shaikh Udai ibn Musafir al-Umawi. Allah has mercy on him and all those
who follow his path.. May Allah lead them to His path and obey Him and
His Prophet.

This shows that Ibn Taimia considered this deviant group as Sunni
Muslim in variance with the consensus identifying them as extremists,
heretics and idolaters who did not worship only Allah.


**9 - Whom does the Wahabi serve?**

Muslims are obliged to give first priority to upholding Muslims'
interest. But do the Wahabis actually adhere to this principle? Did they
ever oppose colonial and imperialist plots against Muslim countries?
What contributions did they make to counter the imperialist and Zionist
interests in Muslim countries? And finally is it true that they are
loyal to Western powers and have helped them to gain access to Muslims'
resources, and thus compromising their sovereignty and dignity?

It is clear to every Muslim that the Wahabis have faithfully served
Western interests in Islamic countries. Furthermore, history of this
group since the early days of its founder reveal not the slightest
concern for developing Muslim communities through fighting poverty and
illiteracy and upholding the rule of sharia and justice.

Instead the Wahabis concentrated on labeling Muslims as heretics and
idolaters who deserve to be put to death and their possessions looted.
Nothing catches their interest and fires their enthusiasm except finding
a grave which they believe must be destroyed or attacking anyone who
asks the Prophet for intercession with Allah.

Under this banner they launched a vicious campaign against Muslims,
murdering, looting and spreading discord and schism. But the safety of
Muslim countries and communities against foreign attack was never one of
their concerns. Thus, the Wahabi princes and religious leaders turned a
blind eye to the occupation of Jerusalem, the fate of Bosnian and
Lebanese Muslim and the American hegemony over Islamic countries and
exploitation of their oil resources.

At the same time they are outraged by the tomb of Hamza ibn Abd al-
Mutalib which the Companions visited and prayed at and by the shrine of
the Prophet's grandson, al-Hussain ibn Ali which the Companions and
early Muslims travelled long distances to visit it - and even during the
lifetime of Ahmed ibn Hanbal as mentioned earlier. It is also pertinent
to wonder why those Wahabis are not moved by the embargo imposed on the
Libyan people as they were by the gifts they found at the Prophet's
tomb.

It is regrettable that so much of their time, effort and financial
resources have been squandered on trivial issues which attract and
deceive only the simple-minded. Why the Wahabis choose to focus on such
issues can be answered in the following points:

First, their minds are closed and their thinking is rigid and
superficial. As their writings and arguments indicate, they appear to be
incapable of any profound thoughts.

Second, they fail to take into consideration basic facts about human
nature and current developments in human societies. This is clearly seen
in their disregard of religious, social sciences and scientific research
and their total devotion to secondary and trivial issues which have no
significance for the present times.

Third, their blunt language, strong criticism and obtuse viewpoints
indicate that they hold no good intentions for the Islamic nation and
its welfare.

Fourth, their open loyalty to Islam's enemies is a fact requiring no
further proof. It is now clear to all that the Wahabis are subservient
to the West more than any other faction. As a result of this blind
loyalty, the invading Zionist and imperialist forces have found it easy
to penetrate Islamic countries and to destroy or plunder their resources
and subjugate their populations.

The Wahabis have given these foreign powers all the support they needed
to realize their selfish objectives. This support has also made possible
the establishment of the Zionist entity in the heart of the Muslim
nation, and they continue to give it direct and indirect support. The
Wahabis have also consistently helped pro-West regimes to put down
liberation movements and to suppress the Islamic reawakening movement
which has given them and other unpopular regimes a strong cause for
worry.


**10 - The true faith regarding visiting the Prophet's**

**tomb and asking for his intercession**

First, on visiting the Prophet's tomb, the following evidence is
presented:

Prophet Muhammad said: «Whoever visits me after my death is as if he
had visited me in my lifetime.» 27

Prophet Muhammad said: «Whoever visits me at al-Medina I shall be his
witness and intercede on his behalf on Judgment Day.» 28

Prophet Muhammad said: «Whoever visits me at al-Medina shall be at my
side on Judgment Day.» 29

The Prophet also said: «Whoever visits my tomb will entitled to my
intercession.» 30

Imam Malik said: If a man wants to visit the Prophet's tomb let him
turn his back to the Qibla (i.e. the Kaba in Mecca), face the Prophet
and call a blessing on him and supplicate. 31

Followers of Imam al-Shafi advised visitors of the Prophet's tomb to
stand facing the tomb with their backs to the Qibla. This was also Ahmed
ibn Hanbal's instruction. 32

In his book entitled Al-Ilal wa al-Su'alat, Abdullah ibn Ahmed ibn
Hanbal (son of Imam Ahmed ibn Hanbal) wrote: «I asked my father if it is
permissible for a person to touch the Prophet's minber, i.e. pulpit, and
to seek blessings by touching and kissing it and do the same at the
Prophet's tomb, and he answered me: It is allowed.» 33

Al-Tabari said: «It is permissible to kiss and touch the [Prophet's]
tomb and that was the tradition of religious and pious persons.» 34

Imam Jafar al-Sadiq reported that Fatima, the Prophet's daughter, used
to visit her uncle's, Hamza, tomb every Friday. 35

Second, on asking for the Prophet's intercession, we present the
following testimonies: The Prophet said in his supplication: «O Allah,
by the right of supplicants ...» 36

Al-Sawi al-Hanbali wrote in his book Al-Mustawib on the subject of
visiting the Prophet's tomb: 'The visitor should approach the tomb's
wall, facing it with his back to the Qibla and the pulpit to his left.'
He also described the procedure for supplication at the tomb as follows:
«O Allah, you have addressed the Prophet in Your Book: 'And if when they
do themselves injustice by committing sins they can come to you to beg
Allah's forgiveness and the Prophet beseeches Allah to forgive them.' So
I have come to your Prophet to ask for forgiveness and I beseech You to
grant me forgiveness as You have granted it to those who visited him in
his lifetime. O Allah I ask You in the name of Your Prophet ...'

In the supplication of Imam Ali ibn al-Hussain he said: «O Lord,
deliver me from sadness by the right of Muhammad and his Household.»
37

The Hanbali shaikh Abu Ali al-Khala said: «Whenever something worries
me I would visit the tomb of [Imam] Musa ibn Jafar and ask for his
intercession, and Allah always granted me what I asked for.» 38

Imam al-Shafi said: «I seek blessings through Abi Hanifa by visiting
his tomb daily. If I need anything I would perform a short prayer, visit
his tomb and implore Allah to grant me my wish. My supplications were
always answered.» 39

Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn al-Mo'amal said: «We accompanied Imam Abi Bakr
ibn Khuzaima, Abi Ali al-Thaqafi and a group of religious scholars on a
visit to the tomb of [Imam] Ali ibn Musa al- Rida in Toos (Persia). I
was astonished by the high respect shown by Ibn Khuzaima towards the
tomb and his supplications at it.» 40

Ibn Taimai said: Ahmed ibn Hanbal, as reported in Minsak al-Mirwithi,
allowed asking for the Prophet's intercession and supplicating at his
tomb. Other sources such as Ibn Abi al-Dunia, al-Baihaqi, al-Tabarani
have also confirmed this, according to Ibn Taimia. 41
