Characteristics of the Religious Government :viewpoints of Imam Khomeini and Ayatollah Khamenei
===============================================================================================

One of the most important characteristics of religious government -
which also distinguishes it from other forms of government based on
materialistic cultures (non-religious governments) " is that it is
value-based, based on defense of truth and human dignity, and rejection
of wrong including inequity, oppression, infidelity, paganism,
exploitation, and colonization. Hence the religious government under the
leadership of Imam is meant to safeguard right and reject wrong, which
is a divine mission.

A review of the ideas of Imam Khomeini and Ayatollah Khamenei as well
as foreign and domestic policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran will
demonstrate the unceasing struggle of the Islamic system, as the
harbinger of right, against the camp of global arrogance, led by the
United States.

Establishment of United Islamic Ummah;Unity, Key to Victory and Glory
of Muslims

As a Muslim reformer and leader of the Islamic society, Imam Khomeini
always considered unity of word, solidarity and utilization of the rich
Islamic resources as the only strategy for the victory o the deprived,
disinherited masses over the arrogant powers as well as the restoration
of the magnificence and glory of the disinherited Muslims and always
recommended the Islamic government and ummah to observe these sacred
issues:

"I have repeatedly invited the Islamic governments to unity and
fraternity vis-à-vis the aliens and their agents who want to dominate
our dear territories and colonize them and exploit their spiritual and
material resources by diving the Muslims and Islamic governments." 13

Elsewhere, Imam Khomeini clearly states that the main reason for the
backwardness and depravation of the Muslims, particularly the
Palestinian Muslims, is lack of theoretical and practical unity among
the Islamic countries and Islamic ummah and once again underlines the
need for unity and solidarity of the world of Islam on the basis of
Islamic communalities as the only key to victory and success against the
camp of arrogance.

"If the heads of the Islamic countries give up their differences and
become acquainted with the sublime Islamic objectives and tilt towards
Islam, they will not become captives and slaves of colonialists as
such." 14

The Imam painfully warns that depravation, colonization, and
exploitation of the material and human resources of the Islamic world
will increase and there is no way for getting rid of from this problem
except return of the Muslims to the cultural, religious principles and
revival of Islamic unity of word.

"I have warned time and again that if the Islamic ummah does not wake
up and does not become aware of its duties, if the Islamic ulema do not
shoulder their responsibility and do not rise, if true Islam, which is
the result of unity and movement of all Islamic sects against the aliens
and is the guarantor of the mastery and independence of the Muslim
nations and governments continue to remain under the black veil of
colonialism, and if the flames of differences and disunity among the
Muslims flare up, darker and more miserable days await the Muslim
society and a destructive threat will endanger Islam and the Quranic
principles." 15

In order to perform its divine mission, the Islamic government of Iran
considers the establishment of the universal Islamic ummah as one of its
duties and will not spare any efforts in this regard. Article 11 of the
Constitution of the Islamic Republic states:

"On the basis of the Quranic verse, "Verily, this brotherhood of yours
is a single brotherhood, and I am your Lord and Cherisher: therefore
Serve Me," 16 all Muslims belong to one ummah and the government of the
Islamic Republic is duty-bound to base its policy on the coalition and
unity of Islamic nations and make incessant efforts to materialize
political, economic and cultural unity of the Islamic world."

Commenting on the unity of Islamic ummah, the Leader of the Islamic
Revolution Ayatollah Khamenei, states:

"The entire Islamic ummah must remember this profound, precise
recommendation of our dear Imam and should not forget unity of word on
the basis of Islam. "And hold fast, all together, by the Rope Which God
(stretches out for you)." 17

Hold fast to the rope of Allah and get united around the pivot of
Islam. This unity is remedy to all illnesses and demolisher of all
enemies." 18

Addressing the Islamic ummah in the Islamic world, while elaborating on
the role of unity in the glory of the Islamic nation of Iran, the Leader
mentioned Iran as a role model for other Muslims:

"Unity of word has been the key to the victory of the Iranian nation in
various stages and today it is the best means for the confrontation of
our nation with the provocations and plots." 19


**Defending the Disinherited and Downtrodden Against the Arrogance**

"The founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran paid special attention to
the protection of the disinherited masses against the arrogant powers so
that only few months after the victory of the Islamic Revolution, he put
forth the idea of the establishment of an international party called the
Party of the Disinherited." 20

In this regard, he states:

"I hope that one party called the Party of the Disinherited is
established in the world and all the downtrodden of the world cooperate
in this party to remove the problems existing in their way and rise
against the arrogant powers and plunderers of the East and West and will
no more allow the arrogant powers to oppress the downtrodden of the
world." 21

Clearly the Islamic system of Iran, in the light of its divine mission,
cannot keep silent against inequity and oppression and considers
campaign against oppression and support of the disinherited and
oppressed people of the world particularly the oppressed Muslims as one
of its objectives in the world and has full faith in the divine promise
on the rule of the disinherited over the world: "And We wished to be
gracious to those who were being depressed in the land, to make them
leaders and make them heirs." 22

Commenting on the same issue the Leader of the Islamic Revolution
Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei states:

"Whatever we have, we owe to the blessings of genuine, revolutionary
Islam, which is concerned about the fate of the oppressed and
disinherited classes… the Islam of the weak and barefooted. The Islam
that grants dignity and mastery to the low classes of the society and
rescues them from lowliness and wretchedness. The Islam that overthrows
the bullying thugs and powerful oppressors from their seat of power. The
Islam for whose spread our honorable Imam spent his entire life." 23

**All-Out Independence and Rejection of Dependence on Arrogant
Powers**

Genuine Islam is capable of guiding the Muslims towards dignity and
felicity and is able to empower them to confront the dominant
materialistic powers of the world without any dependence on the Eastern
and Western poles. The victory of the Islamic Revolution, which was a
manifestation of this concept of Islam, demonstrates this truth for the
entire world. Commenting on this issue, Imam Khomeini states: "If
instead of relying on the Eastern and Western blocs, the Islamic
governments and nations rely on Islam and hold fast to the illuminating,
liberating teachings of the holy Quran… they will not be frightened by
the United States nor will they fear the Soviet Union." 24

Commenting on the comprehensive independence of the country and its
preservation as well as its impact on the political insight of the
Muslims, and their faith and awareness of the capabilities of Islam, the
Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei,
states:

"Up to the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the Muslim masses
were told that Islam was not capable of bringing about dignity and honor
for them and that in search of felicity they should go after Western
models and European and American cultures or tilt towards imaginary
hollow Marxist theories; but after the victory of the Islamic Revolution
and establishment of the Islamic Republic in Iran, the honor and dignity
the materialization of Islam granted to the Iranian nation,

thwarted all the longstanding achievements of the colonial powers and
showed in practice that Islam can rescue a nation from indolence and
oppression and direct it towards the apogee of dignity, courage, and
self-confidence and also it is able to grant them a firm, independent
system, capable of challenging the materialistic powers of the world."
25

Once again it should be borne in mind that the formation and victory of
the Islamic Revolution, the establishment of an Islamic government in
Iran, its honorable resistance against various plots of the global
arrogance and its internal and external agents, in fact, demonstrated
the unlimited capabilities of Islamic thought and culture in
establishing the most perfect form of government system (Islamic
government) which meets the demands of various societies with their
indigenous cultures in all times and is capable of directing the
societies towards perfection and felicity.

On the other hand, the formation of the Islamic government could
represent the most prefect practical model of government for the
disinherited and oppressed peoples of the world, particularly the Muslim
masses, preparing the grounds for the revival of religious thought and
culture and putting forth the need for return of the Muslim masses to
the foundations of Islamic culture.

The Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khamenei has a clear
remark on this topic:

"The impacts of the victory of the Iranian nation in the face of the
world challenges did not remain confined to the Islamic world, rather,
the Islamic breeze started blowing even in the non-Muslim countries
where the iron cage systems of party dictatorship or ethnic oppression
had not allowed the Muslims of those countries to even feel being
Muslims; their dormant faiths started simmering and the herald of Islam
disturbed the tranquility of the evils… This is an Islamic resurrection
which has enlivened the dead souls and is preparing the grounds for the
day when in response to the question "Whose will be the Dominion?", it
is said: "That of God, the One, the Irresistible." (The Holy Quran, 40:
16). 26

**Hajj, Symbol of Unity and Islamic Might**

The divine religion of Islam appeared in the form of a complete
religious culture from the very beginning of its emergence. It succeeded
to establish a society with Islamic identity and an Islamic government
under the leadership of the Messenger of Allah and in the shortest
possible time it prepared the grounds for its spread across the globe.

A cursory look at the early years of the development of Islam shows
that the main divine mission of the Prophet (PBUH) was to implement the
Islamic culture and ideas and establish a religious society in order to
lead human beings towards felicity and perfection. As the founder of the
Islamic culture and religious, and given human-oriented nature of Islam,
27 the Prophet (PBUH) of Allah based his endeavors and struggles on
cultural activities and by relying on the principle of the call, he
tried to guide the people directly or indirectly (dispatch of
representatives to other territories).

The history of human civilization shows that propagation of a new
culture, particularly a new religious culture and advocacy of a new
method of life, which calls for fundamental changes in the principles
and pillars of the previous culture and civilization does not recognize
the traditional power structures of the society, always faces certain
problems and the first followers normally endure lots of hardship,
particularly inflicted on them by the power-wielders, who found their
interests endangered by the new religion.

The incessant struggles of the Prophet (PBUH) and his companions for
the propagation and introduction of Islam as well as the establishment
of the first bases of the Muslim communities and finally the
establishment of the first Islamic society and Islamic government along
with the hardships and difficulties they endured in this way bear
eloquent testimony to this very fact.

At this stage we witness that the efforts of the holy Prophet (PBUH)
and his companions for the establishment of the first perfect government
structure (Islamic government) bears fruit. However, with the passage of
time and as we go farther from the time of the departure of the Prophet
(PBUH), the government systems in the Islamic territories gradually
become alien to the religious government and get closer to monarchical
dictatorial systems.

Also simultaneous with the decline and deterioration of the Abbasid
dynasty and emergence of local governments which did not enjoy any
religious legitimacy (they were neither based on Imamate of Shiism nor
were they attributed to the Quraish " legitimacy in Sunnite school) 28
and hence the Islamic society and Muslim scholars started putting the
legitimacy of the government into question and the ruling sultan was
considered as an oppressor and usurper of the rulership in the Islamic
world. 29

By isolating and distorting the Islamic teachings, isolating the Muslim
thinkers from amongst the masses and interpreting the religion to
justify their own interests, the despotic rulers tried to consolidate
the pillars of their rule and in the process presented a distorted image
of religion to the society. However, by enduring hardships, the
veracious Muslim thinkers and scholars tried to preserve the Islamic
sources and spread Islamic teachings. Commenting on the role of the
veracious ulema of Islam in preserving the perimeters of the religious
principles, Imam Khomeini states:

"If the dear ulema were not there, it would not be clear what would
have been presented to the people today as the Quranic sciences, Islam
and the Household of the Prophet (PBUT). The collection and preservation
of the Quranic sciences and the sayings and traditions of the honorable
Prophet and the precept of the infallible Imams; as well as their record
and preservation at a time when … the sultans and oppressors had
mobilized all resources to eliminate them was not an easy task." 30

In the contemporary era too the invading Western governments and some
ruling systems spread a poisonous atmosphere 31 against the Islamic
world and level charges and accusations against Islam by relying no
their propaganda means. They also try to inculcate the idea that the
main reason for backwardness and shortages in the Islamic world is the
people’s commitment to religious principles. Therefore the committed
Muslim scholars and thinkers, particularly Imam Khomeini, shouldered a
heavy responsibility.

They had to purify the principles of religion and eliminate
superstitions in order to revive religious thought and hence launched
their cultural, propagation struggle in order to introduce genuine
Islamic culture and thought. They therefore had to innovate new
value-based intellectual concepts.

Among the most important, profound concepts which was created and whose
theoretical elaboration left an outstanding impact on the beliefs of the
Muslims and made them realize the need for return to religious
principles was genuine Mohammedan Islam which was introduced by the
greatest and most pious disciple of the school of Islam, Imam Khomeini,
that indeed introduced a new meaning of Islam to the world.

In this approach, Islam has been introduced as an anti-arrogance school
which rejects all manifestations of oppression and tyranny, supports all
the disinherited and oppressed peoples of the world, preserves
independence, rejects any kind of dependence, and safeguards such human
rights as freedom and social justice.

Without any doubt in the light of such an image of Islam, all religious
principles and decrees find a clear meaning, the rust of superstition is
wiped out from religious principles, and the clear image of Jamiat un
Nabi " the utopia of the Muslim in all stages of the Islamic
civilization " becomes clearly visible.

Among the Islamic decrees, which underwent a change in the light of the
introduction of sociopolitical thought of genuine Mohammedan Islam, was
Hajj ritual. Imam Khomeini introduced Abrahamic Hajj instead of the
"American Hajj", which in effect transformed Hajj ceremonies from mere
ritualistic ceremonies to a political-ritualistic ceremony. Thus the
Hajj occasion became a platform for the expression of the message of the
oppressed and wretched of the world and a manifestation of the Islamic
unity, cry of deliverance from the pagans and the arrogant camp and
ultimately a platform for the demonstration of the power of the Islamic
world in confronting the camp of arrogance.

**Characteristics of Abrahamic Hajj in Viewpoints of Imam Khomeini and
Ayatollah Khamenei**

In viewpoints of Imam Khomeini and Ayatollah Khamenei, religious rites
and rituals have various aspects. The raison d’etre of Islamic
principles can be studied from various aspects including individual,
social, ritualistic, and political ones. In other words, within the
framework of genuine Mohammedan Islam, Imam Khomeini depicted a
sociopolitical image of Islam.

Thus he rescued Islam from social isolation and changed it into a
dominant culture and idea in the society and elaborated on it
theoretically in order deepen religious concepts among the Muslims. In
this line, in the opinions of Imam Khomeini and Ayatollah Khamenei, Hajj
rituals have individual, social, ritualistic, and political aspects and
Hajj is rightly the manifestation of great power of unity of Islamic
ummah.

**A) Characteristics of Hajj and Its Spiritual Status**

Commenting on the spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hajj, Imam
Khomeini emphasized on the interconnection of this aspect with other
aspects:

"Spiritual position of Hajj, which is an eternal asset and brings about
closeness of man with horizon of monotheism and purity, will not be
achieved unless the ritualistic principles of Hajj are properly
performed and its political aspect is not fulfilled unless its spiritual
and divine aspects are accomplished.

... your labaiks (yes O Lord) should be a response to the call of the
Almighty God and wear the pilgrimage garment in order to get close to
the threshold of the Court of the Lord. While chanting labaik migrate
from self " a great source of infidelity " towards the Lord, glorified
is He." 32

The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei,
describes Hajj as an eternal source, a divine spring and a clear rivulet
for the Islamic ummah:

"Thanks be to Allah Who has ordained Hajj as an eternal source, a
divine spring and a clear continuous rivulet for the eternal ummah."
33

Elsewhere, he comments on the interrelations between spiritual,
ritualistic aspects of Hajj and its political, social dimensions: "Hajj
is a worship and chanting of prayers and repentance, but it is a worship
and a repentance aimed to resuscitate the pure life of the Islamic ummah
and liberate it from the chains of colonialism, dictatorship and mammons
of wealth and power... It is a Hajj which is among the pillars of
religion and in the Nahj ul Balagha, the Commander of the Faithful has
called it the banner of Islam, the holy war of every powerless, remover
of poverty and destitute, and a source of proximity of the believers to
each other." 34

The Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khamenei and Imam
Khomeini both lay emphasis on the importance of the city of Mecca and
the House of God (Bait ullah al Haram) " where the greatest culture and
civilization of the history of mankind was formed. Commenting on the
issue, Imam Khomeini stated:

"The holy Mecca and the holy sites are the mirror of great events of
the movements of the prophets, of Islam and mission of the holy Prophet
of Islam. Every spot of this territory is a place of emergence of great
prophets, the trusted Gabriel and reminder of the years-long sufferings
and hardships the Prophet (PBUH) endured in the way of Islam and
humanity. Presence in these holy sites while bearing in mind the
difficult, intolerable conditions of the appointment of the Prophet
acquaints us with the responsibility of preservation of the achievements
of this divine movement and mission."

Commenting on the same issue, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution
Ayatollah Khamenei, states:

"In this place, the pivot and center of every sanctity is God and
circumambulation, running between Safa and Marva, and staying [in holy
sites] as well as other rituals of Hajj each is a demonstration of
attraction to God and rejection, denial and deliverance from the enemies
of God." 35

27 Man’s status and the necessity of safeguarding his natural desires
such as freedom, and enjoying the right to elect, social justice, and
social participation in the Islamic culture, are so sublime that the
divine law giver has left the acceptance of Islam to the discretion of
human beings, recognizing their rights to elect. The Verse 256 of the
Chapter Caw states: "Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth
stands out clear from error…"

28 According to Islamic teachings sovereignty belongs to God alone and
after Him only those who have been directly or indirectly granted the
right to rule by God enjoy such a right (the Prophet, or those who have
been recommended by him to rule the Islamic society). In the Shia
philosophy they are called Imams of the ummah. Also after the Prophet
those who had the greatest record of rendering services to Islam had a
right to rule (the Guided Caliphs), or those who were closest relatives
of the Prophet or were closest members of his tribe, who are called the
righteous Caliphs in the Sunnite political philosophy.
