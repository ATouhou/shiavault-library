Concerning The Pond (al-Hawd)
=============================

**Concerning The Pond (al-Hawd)**[^1]

Says the Shaykh Abu Ja'far, the mercy of Allah be upon him: Our belief
concerning the Pond *(al-Hawd)* is that it is true. Its width is the
distance between Ayla[^2] and San'a', and it belongs to the Prophet, on
whom be peace. And verily in it there are as many pitchers as star in
the sky. And verily on the day of resurrection the giver of drink out of
it will be the Prince of Believers, 'Ali bin Abi Talib, on whom be
peace.

He will give his friends water to drink and drive away his enemies. He
who drinks of it once will never thirst again. And the Prophet said: A
group of persons among my followers will be dragged before me, when I
shall be at the pond (of *Kawthar*), and be taken towards the left side
(i.e. hell). Then shall I raise the cry: My companions, my companions, O
my Lord! And I shall be told: You do not know what they did after you.
