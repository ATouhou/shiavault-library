33. At The Time Of Sorrow And Grief
===================================

As said before, it is found in traditions that Imam az-Zaman (aj) prays
for one who supplicates for him. Thus, his (aj) prayer becomes the cause
of dissipation of sorrows of the believer. It has come in numerous
traditions that our Imam (aj) is aggrieved at the grief of his Shias and
undoubtedly, he prays for them in their moments of sorrow, as has
already been indicated in traditions. So, it is naught but becoming for
the Shias that they follow in the footsteps of their master by
supplicating for the removal of his sorrows, difficulties and grief, for
his grief is also the cause of the grief of his Shias, as can be found
in some traditions. Hence the significance of praying for him (aj) on
such occasions.

This can be supported by the statement of His Eminence (aj) in his
blessed epistle which we had mentioned previously that: “And pray more
for the reappearance, as in it lies your success.” On the basis of this,
the words ‘in it’ refers to ‘Dua’ that is: This Dua will cause you
success and ease of your affairs and solving of your problems and
removal of all griefs and sorrow, Insha Allah.
