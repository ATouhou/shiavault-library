Lesson Sixty Two: Do Not Dwell On The Past
==========================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لاتُشْغِلْ قَلْبَكَ الْهَمَّ عَلَى مافاتَ فَيُشْغِلَكَ عَنِ
الاْسْتِعْدادِ بِما هُوَ آت.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Do not preoccupy your heart with grief for the past because you will
lose out on preparation for the future. [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

One comes across two groups of people. Some of them waste their time
regretting for the past mistakes and lose their remaining energies in
this way. But others let bygones be bygones and only take some lessons
from them for organizing the future and use all of their powers
constructively to build a better today and tomorrow. Surely, they will
be the ones who will succeed.
