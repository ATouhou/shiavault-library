11.  Harmony With Nature
========================

• During the rule of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.), due to the piety and belief
of the general populace and the reign of the truthful ones, the earth
will throw up all its bounties and the skies will shower its
mercies.[^1]

• The earth will toss up its treasures.[^2]

• The hidden treasures and mines of the earth will come to the fore.
People will actually see these treasures above the ground.[^3]

• Mercy will rain for the skies. Trees will be loaded with flowers and
the earth will manifest its greenery.[^4]

• During this era, farming and cultivation will yield maximum possible
crops. One grain will yield 700 grains.[^5]
