Hadhrat Musa (as) Was Also Not a Salafi
=======================================

Allah says in Qur'an:

<p dir="rtl">
وَقَطَّع'نَاهُمُ اث'نَتَي' عَش'رَةَ أَس'بَاطًا أُمَمًا وَأَو'حَي'نَا
إِلَى مُوسَى إِذِ اس'تَس'قَاهُ قَو'مُهُ أَنِ اض'رِب بِّعَصَاكَ ال'حَجَرَ
فَانبَجَسَت' مِن'هُ اث'نَتَا عَش'رَةَ عَي'نًا قَد' عَلِمَ كُلُّ أُنَاسٍ
مَّش'رَبَهُم' وَظَلَّل'نَا عَلَي'هِمُ ال'غَمَامَ وَأَنزَل'نَا عَلَي'هِمُ
ال'مَنَّ وَالسَّل'وَى كُلُوا' مِن طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَق'نَاكُم' وَمَا
ظَلَمُونَا وَلَـكِن كَانُوا' أَنفُسَهُم' يَظ'لِمُونَ
</p>

[Yusuf Ali 7:160] We directed Moses by inspiration, when his (thirsty)
people asked him for water: "Strike the rock with thy staff": out of it
there gushed forth twelve springs: We gave them the shade of clouds, and
sent down to them manna and quails,

Did Prophet Moses (as) told his Ummah that:

They committed shirk by asking him (as) for water. They must have asked
Allah DIRECTLY for water, because He is the only Provider of every
thing. And why Allah kept quite on this shirk and not
threatened/corrected them upon it. Contrary to threatening them, Allah
bestowed them with Man-o-Salwa and His other blessings.

Prophet Yaqoob (as) was also not a Salafi

Allah says in Qur'an:

<p dir="rtl">
قَالُوا' يَا أَبَانَا اس'تَغ'فِر' لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا إِنَّا كُنَّا
خَاطِئِينَ قَالَ سَو'فَ أَس'تَغ'فِرُ لَكُم' رَبِّيَ إِنَّهُ هُوَ
ال'غَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ
</p>

[Pickthal 12:97-98] They said: O our father! Ask forgiveness of our
sins for us, for lo! we were sinful. He said: I shall ask forgiveness
for you of my Lord. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.

If Prophet Jacob (as) had been a Salafi, he (as) would have told his
sons why they had come to him. They must go and ask Allah DIRECTLY for
forgiveness of their sins.

And Allah is also not a Salafi. Had He been a Salafi, He would have
become double angry with Jacob (as) and his sons, instead of forgiving
them. Salafi Aqeedah vs. Our (Shia and Ahle-Sunnah brothers) Aqeedah
about asking Allah through Rasool Allah [saww]

We believe that Allah swt is closer to us than jugular vein, and He has
all the power to hear us directly and to fulfill our demands. And there
is no harm in asking Allah directly.

But we also believe if the intercession of Rasool Allah [saww] also
includes in our petitions to Allah, then it is a better way to approach
Allah. And this is a proved fact by Qur'an and Sunnah.

It is same as Allah also hears us when we pray in our houses. But if
the Dua is made in Holy Kaba, then barakah of Masjid-ul-Haram also
includes in it and chances of acceptance of our prayers increase.

If Salafi want to demolish this practice of Islam in name of Shirk
(while it goes against their self made Aqaed), then we are not ready for
this innovation.

Allah has promised Rasool Allah [saww] that He has raised high his
[saww] Dhikr along with His Dhikr. Allah says in Qur'an:

<p dir="rtl">
وَرَفَع'نَا لَكَ ذِك'رَكَ
</p>

[Yusufali 94: 4] And (didn't We) raised high the esteem (Dhikr) (in
which) thou (Muhammad) (art held)?

In comparison to Salafi's usage of Logic and behavior of neglecting
that part of Qur'an and Sunnah, which goes against their Aqaed, we don't
use our own Logic, and take guidance from whole Qur'an and Sunnah.

We don't make anything Haram on us in name of Shirk and Bidah, which
has been made Halal for us from Allah. Qur'an says:

<p dir="rtl">
قُل' مَن' حَرَّمَ زِينَةَ اللّهِ الَّتِيَ أَخ'رَجَ لِعِبَادِهِ
وَال'طَّيِّبَاتِ مِنَ الرِّز'قِ قُل' هِي لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا' فِي
ال'حَيَاةِ الدُّن'يَا خَالِصَةً يَو'مَ ال'قِيَامَةِ كَذَلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ
الآيَاتِ لِقَو'مٍ يَع'لَمُونَ
</p>

[Yusufali 7:32] Say: Who hath forbidden the beautiful (gifts) of Allah,
which He hath produced for His servants, and the things, clean and pure,
(which He hath provided) for sustenance? Say: They are, in the life of
this world, for those who believe, (and) purely for them on the Day of
Judgment. Thus do We explain the signs in detail for those who
understand.

May Allah give us the Taufeeq to act upon the whole of His guidance.
Amin.
