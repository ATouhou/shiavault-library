Chapter 12 : Chapter On Attribute of Essence (sifat Al-dhdhat) of Allah H 284, Ch. 12, H 1
==========================================================================================

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from Muhammad ibn Khalid al-Tayalisi from
Safwan ibn Yahya from ibn Maskan from abu Basir who has said the
following.

"I heard abu 'Abdallah (a.s.) saying, 'The Exalted, the Glorious,
Allah, our Lord, is Eternal. Knowledge is His self even if there is
nothing to be known. Hearing is His self even if there is nothing to be
heard. Seeing is His-self even when there is nothing to be seen. Power
is His self even if there is nothing to feel the power.

When He brought things into existence the perceptible objects became
the objects of His knowledge, His hearing applied to audible objects,
His seeing to visible objects and His power to the objects that feel
power.'"

Abu Basir adds; "I further asked, 'Has Allah always been in motion?" He
replied, "Allah is High Exalted above that. Motion is an attribute that
is created through action."

I asked, "Did Allah always have the ability to speak?" He replied, "
Speech is a created attribute and not an eternal one. Allah, the
Majestic, the Glorious, existed when there was nothing able to speak."

H 285, Ch. 12, h 2

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Muhammad ibn al-Husayn from ibn
abu 'Umayr from Hisham ibn Salim from Muhammad ibn Muslim who has said
the following.

"I heard abu Ja'far (a.s.) saying, 'Allah, to Whom belong Might and
Majesty, existed when nothing else existed. He eternally knows whatever
comes into being. His knowledge of things before their coming into
existence and afterwards is exactly the same.'"

H 286, Ch. 12, h 3

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Muhammad ibn al-Husayn from Safwan
ibn Yahya from al-Kahili who has said the following.

"I wrote to abu al-Hassan (al-Kazim) (a.s.), praising Allah in my
letter as, 'All praise belongs to Allah to the limit of His knowledge.'"
He wrote back to me, "Do not say, "To the limit of His knowledge because
there is no limit to His knowledge. Instead say, "All praise belongs to
Allah to the limit of His pleasure."

H 287, Ch. 12, h 4

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Sa'd ibn 'Abdallah from Muhammad
ibn 'Isa from Ayyub ibn Nuh, who wrote to abu al-Hassan (al-Thalith
(a.s.) asking him about Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious.

"Did He know all things before creating and giving them being, or did
He not know until He brought them into existence or until He willed
their creation and existence? Did Allah come to know what He created
during the process of their creation and what He originated during their
being originated?"

The Imam wrote in reply in his own handwriting, "Eternally Allah has
had full knowledge of all things, before as well as after their
creation."

H 288, Ch. 12, h 5

Ali ibn Muhammad has narrated from Sahl ibn Ziyad from Ja'far ibn
Muhammad ibn Hamzah who has said the following.

"I wrote to the man (Imam (a.s.), 'Your followers differ about the
knowledge of Allah. There are those who say that before creating all
things Allah had eternally full knowledge of them. Others say that we
should not say so because His knowing is like His action.

If we prove that His Knowledge is eternal we have also established
another thing eternal along with Him. May Allah take my soul in service
for your cause, if you would consider it proper, kindly enlighten me in
this issue so that I would have a firm stand and do not waver
therefrom."

He wrote in his own handwriting, "Eternally Allah , the Most Holy, the
Most High has had the Knowledge of all things."

?? and Allah's Positive Attributes such as His knowledge are the same
as His Essence without any duality between His Essence and His Positive
Attributes).' "

H 289, Ch. 12, h 6

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from al-Husayn
ibn Sa'id from al-Qasim ibn Muhammad from 'Abd al-Samad ibn Bashir from
Fudayl ibn Sukkarah who has said the following.

"I asked abu Ja'far (a.s.), 'May Allah take my soul in service for your
cause, if you would consider it proper please enlighten me about whether
Allah, Majestic is Whose face, had knowledge of His Oneness before He
brought the creation into existence?

Your followers differ on this issue. There are those who believe that
Allah did have knowledge of His Oneness before He created anything.
Others say His knowledge is His action.

Thus, now Allah has come to know that before He created things there
had been nothing besides He Himself. They say that if we believe in the
eternal knowledge of Allah of His Oneness, we have established another
thing eternal along with Him.

If you would consider it proper please enlighten me in this issue so I
may not waver here and there." He wrote, "Allah, the Blessed and Exalted
has always had the Knowledge of all things." (See Hadith No. 294 - 53)


**Chapter 13 : Another Chapter of The Previous Chapter H 290, Ch. 13, h
1**

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from Muhammad ibn 'Isa ibn 'Ubayd from
Hammad from Hariz from Muhammad ibn Muslim from abu Ja'far (a.s.) who
has said the following about being eternal.

"He, Allah, is One, the Self-sufficient. He is One and only One without
any multiplicity in different meaning." The narrator said that I further
inquired, "May Allah take my soul in your service, certain people in
Iraq think,

that Allah hears with something different from what He sees with, and
He sees with something different from what He hears with." The Imam
replied, "They have said a lie and have become atheists for considering
Allah similar to other things.

Allah, the Most High, indeed is above all things. He is All-hearing and
All-seeing. He hears with what He sees, and sees with what He hears."
The narrator has said that he further asked, "Those people are also of
the opinion that Allah is All-seeing in the same sense and in the same
way as they perceive." The Imam said, "Allah is High Exalted above all
such things. Only such things are perceived, which has the attributes of
created things. Allah is not created."

H 291, Ch. 13, h 2

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from al-'Abbass ibn 'Amr
from Hisham ibn al- Hakam, who about the debate with an atheist (see
Hadith No.225 - 6), has said the following. "He asked Imam abu 'Abdallah
(a.s.), 'Do you say that He is All-hearing and All-seeing?' Abu
'Abdallah said, "Allah is All-hearing, All-seeing.

He hears without any organ and sees without any instrument. He Himself
hears and He Himself sees. When I say He Himself hears I do not mean
thereby that He is One and His self is something different. I only try
to express what I have in my mind to answer a question and help you
understand the answer. So I say, "His whole self hears. This does not
mean that His whole has parts.

In our perception whole consists of parts. It is to make you understand
and express my thoughts. It all amounts to saying that He is
All-hearing, All-seeing, All-knowing and All-aware, without any
multiplicity in the meaning."
