Dedication
==========

I pray that Almighty Allah, His Prophet, and his immaculate progeny
accept this modest work. I have basically tried to present some
documented facts about a lady who led a revolution against oppression
and falsehood.

I dedicate this humble attempt to Imam al-Husayn bin Ali (a), the
individual most beloved to Lady Zaynab, for he had trained her to become
an exceptional character - a character that still stands out as unique.
Consequently, she passed the Divine Trial so remarkably and achieved all
goals of her brother.

To you, Imam al-Husayn (a), I dedicate this work Â­ hoping for
acceptance, because you have been the guide and inspirer to the seekers
of righteousness, justice and real humanity.
