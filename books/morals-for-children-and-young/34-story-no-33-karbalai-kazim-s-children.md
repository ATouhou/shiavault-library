Story no. 33: Karbalai Kazimâ€™s children
=======================================

Karbalai Kazim, after the Maghribain namaz, went to his house.  
 He saw his children busy reading Quran. He became very happy. After
sometime he also began reading the Quran.  
 When he finished reading Quran, one of his children asked him what was
the use of reciting the Quran?  
 Karbalai Kazim quoted many ahadith for his family on this topic and
told the use of reciting Quran.

Yes, youngsters, how nice of us if when we reach home in the evening,
after praying namaz, we recite Quran and become familiar to our God, and
if we have the means, to be also aware of the translation of the ayahs
of the Holy Quran.
