Bahlool Sits on Haroun Rashid's Throne
======================================

One day Bahlool arrived at Haroun's palace and saw that the throne was
empty. There was no one to stop him, so he unhesitatingly and fearlessly
went and sat in Haroun's place. When the court slaves saw this, they
immediately started whipping him and took him off the throne. Bahlool
started crying. Haroun came and saw this; he asked those nearby why
Bahlool was crying. A slave told him the whole story. Haroun scolded
them and tried to cheer Bahlool up.

Bahlool said he wasn't crying at his condition, but at Haroun's
condition. “I sat on the seat of Khalifate wrongfully for a few seconds
and received such a beating and endured such misfortune; but you have
been sitting on this throne all your life! What troubles you must
receive, yet you still don't fear the consequence.”
