Brief Description
-----------------

Human societies cannot be optimally organized without proper leadership.
For this reason, God has never left his servants without a leader.
Divine leaders have always existed among them.

Even during the occultation of Imam Mahdi (a.s.), may our soul be
sacrificed for him, first special deputies, and after termination of
their period, common deputies were selected by him for leadership of
people.

The leadership continues to be provided by those determined and faithful
men who are well versed in the knowledge of Islam’s holy book, the
Qur’an, as well as the teachings and practices of the Prophet (peace be
upon him and his progeny) and the school of the Prophet’s household.
Anyone who does not possess such credentials , under whatever name and
title , who assumes himself to be worthy of such a rank, must be
rejected.
