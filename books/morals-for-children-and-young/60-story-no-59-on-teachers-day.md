Story no. 59: On teachers’ day.
===============================

Sharifa and Siddiqa were two neighbours, they went to school together
and returned together.  
 After some days, Teacher’s day came. Each of the children either gifted
their teachers with a trumpet or a bunch of flowers.  
 Sharifa said to Siddiqa “All the children are giving their teachers
trumpets or flowers”.  
 Siddiqa said “What do we do now?”.  
 Sharifa said “How nice if we ask our parents to guide us”.  
 After taking a suggestion from their parents, they gifted their teacher
a moral book each.
