Their Belief About the Caliphs
==============================

**( 109 )**

They uphold the Caliphates of Abu Bakar and Omar, because according to
their view both of them were elected to the Caliphate through a fair
franchise. They did not even deviate from pursuing the right goal and
committed no transgression. They accepted the fairness of the elections
of Osman and Ali. Ultimately, they said that Osman from the end of the
sixth year of his Caliphate, deviated and ignored the interests of the
Muslims, hence he was (automatically) dismissed from the Caliphate and
as he continued in office hence a renegade and liable to be killed. And
as Ali accepted the proposal to arbitration and subsequently did not
repent, he "apostatized and became liable to death penalty. Thus they
disown Osman from the seventh year of his Caliphate and Ali from the
time of arbitration.

They expressed abhorrence against all of the other Caliphs and remained
at war with them.
