Account N. 2 : Jabir B. Yazid Al-ju`fi
======================================

The second account is attributed to Jabir b. Yazid al-Ju\`fi. He was a
well known Shi’i scholar and follower of the Imam al-Baqir. He died in
128[^13].

His account of the martyrdom of the Imam al-Husayn seems to have been
preserved by Nasr b. Muzahim on the authority of Jabir's pupil, \`Amr b.
Shamir. Extracts from Nasr's work are preserved by Abu al-Faraj
al-Isfahani. In fact Abu al-Faraj has cited very little of Jabir's
account. What little there is are the names of some of the killers of
the members of the ahl al-bayt, together with a verse which is included
in Abu Mikhnaf's account[^14].

The verse tells that the blood shed by the tribesmen will be reckoned
against them.

Ibn al-Kalbi also reports one narrative from Jabir. This is also on the
authority of Jabir's pupil, \`Amr b. Shamir. In this report Jabir's
authority is not given but it may well be the Imam al-Baqir again. The
report tells us how the Imam al-Husayn was thirsty, and was struck in
the mouth by an arrow shot by Husayn b. Tamim. The blood spurted from
his mouth, and he brushed it away into the air.

He then prayed: “O God, count their number, destroy their power and do
not leave one of them on earth”.[^15]
