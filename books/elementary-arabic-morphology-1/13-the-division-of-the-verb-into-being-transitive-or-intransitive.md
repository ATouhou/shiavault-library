The Division of The Verb Into Being Transitive or Intransitive
==============================================================

45. What is an intransitive verb?

46. What is a transitive verb?

45. An intransitive verb is a verb that suffices itself with its actor.
For example: جَلَسَ (he sat). So, for example, if one said**:** **جَلَسَ
زَیدٌ** (Zayd sat) it would be a complete sentence.

46. A transitive verb is a verb that does not suffice itself with its
actor. For example: **کَسََرَ** (he broke). So, if one said: **کَسَرَ
الخادِمُ** (the servant broke) it would be an incomplete sentence unless
one mentions the objective compliment afterwards. For example: **کَسَرَ
الخادِمُ ﺇبریقاً** (the servant broke a pitcher.)
