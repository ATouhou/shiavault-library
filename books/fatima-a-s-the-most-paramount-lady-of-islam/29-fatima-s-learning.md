Fatima’s Learning:
==================

Fatima (peace be upon her) is a bright student in the school of Islam.
She takes lesson from her father as the best teacher: the lesson of
humanity, morality, devotion, generosity, purity, benevolence,
restraining her anger, serving people, etc. And her father, who found
her ready tried to construct her character. He would try to teach her as
much as possible, each of them separately is the lesson of life for her
and the women community.

He taught her some practical lessons, concentrating her thought towards
new facts. The day when Fatima (peace be upon her) asked for a servant
to help her in the house chores, how the Prophet (peace be upon him and
his descendants) directed her thought towards another direction, and how
he taught her the praise (Tasbihat) after the prayer. She would take
lessons from the father and her husband. Even she had some writings from
what she had learnt, as she said once to Fizzah she compared those
writings with the value of Hassanain. It means that as a mother, a wife,
as well as an infallible, she was her father’s student and deserved
value for her father’s teachings.
