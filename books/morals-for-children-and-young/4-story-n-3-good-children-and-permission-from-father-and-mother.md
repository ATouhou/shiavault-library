Story n. 3: Good children and permission from father and mother
===============================================================

Suhaila was a five year old girl.  
 Slowly, she opened the door of the fridge, took an apple and started
eating it.  
 She was busy eating it when her mother entered the room from the garden
and saw her eating the apple.  
 “My daughter, from where did the apple come?”  
 “I got it from the fridge”.  
 “Suhaila dear, didn’t I tell you not to take things from the fridge
without my permission?”  
 Suhaila, realizing that she done wrong, said “sorry mother, I won’t do
this any more.

Yes. Good children always think it better to ask their parents before
any work they do.
