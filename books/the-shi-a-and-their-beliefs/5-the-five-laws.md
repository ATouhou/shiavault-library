The Five Laws
=============

There are five types of laws (ahkam):

1. Obligatory (w"jib).
2. Forbidden (9ar"m).
3. Recommended (musta9abb).
4. Reprehensible/Discouraged (makrY9).
5. Neutral (mub"9).

Obligatory acts are those which Islam has made compulsory such as
prayer, fasting, almsgiving, pilgrimage, and struggle. Forbidden acts
are those which Islam prevents such as drinking alcohol, eating pork,
gambling, dealing in usury, and adultery. Recommended acts are those
which Islam encourages with permissibility of not doing them such as
daily optional prayers (na filah, pl. nawa fil), recommended charity,
and fulfilling other people’s needs.

Reprehensible acts are those which Islam discourages without making
them forbidden such as divorce. Neutral acts are those the doing of
which or not doing are considered equal in the view of Islam such as the
drinking of water.

**Sources of Islamic Law**

The Sh:!a believe that the sources from which Islamic law is derived
are four in number and are:

1. The Holy Qur’"n.

2. The Traditions (sunnah). These are the sayings, actions and
ratifications of the Messenger of Alla\>h Mu9ammad (N) as well as that
of the infallible Imams of his household (Ahl al-Bayt) (a.s.).

3. Consensus (ijm"!).36

4. Reason. It is related that ‘Alla\>h has two proofs [over mankind] –
an outward proof which is the prophets, and in inward proof which is
reason.’37

Therefore, the Sh:!a take their legislation from the Holy Qur’"n and
the traditions of the Messenger (N) and his pure household (a.s.) acting
upon the tradition of the ‘two weighty things’.38 They also consider
these four to be the source of Islamic legislation and that no
individual or group may legislate a law which goes against them as any
other legislation is false. Almighty Alla\>h has said: eAnd whoever does
not rule by what Alla\>h has revealed, then they are the
unbelieversf39.

A great deal in the way of Qur’"nic exegesis, jurisprudence,
traditions, information about the beginning of creation and the end of
time, fundamentals and branches of the religion and other branches of
knowledge have been related from the Prophet Mu9ammad (N) and his
household (a.s.). The scholar Mu9ammad B"qir al-Majlis: collected a
large amount of these traditions in over 100 volumes and named the book
Bi9"r al-Anw"r (Oceans of Lights). In these traditions there is enough
to grant the Muslims, indeed the whole of humanity happiness in this
world and the next.

**Governance in Islam**

The Sh:!a believe that there are two aspects to ruling in the view of
Islam:

1. A permanent aspect concerned with the ‘ruler’ and the ‘law.’ Thus
the ruler must be male, a believer, of pure birth (not illegitimate),
and a jurist. The law must be derived from the four sources of
legislation.

2. A developing aspect concerned with the way in which the Islamic Law
is implemented. This aspect is subject to independent legal judgement
and it is the responsibility of the jurist-consults/authorities to make
their views known in this aspect according to stipulated legal checks
and balances.

**Power in Islam**

The Sh:!a also believe that holy struggle (jih"d) is a kifa\>’ie
(common) obligation whereas defence is an ‘ayni (individual)
obligation40. Hence, it is mandatory for the Islamic state to prepare
the requisite number of Muslims by the ways mentioned in Islamic law so
that it may have a preventative force which will protect them and their
interests wherever they are.

This power is not solely confined to military power but includes
intellectual, economic and industrial power so that the prophetic
tradition ‘Islam is above all and none shall be above it’41 may be
realised.

**Sources of Public Wealth**

The Sh:!a believe that the sources of public wealth are the khums
(tithes), zak"h (obligatory alms), jizyah (tax paid by non-Muslims
living under the protection of the muslim state), khar"j (tax paid on
certain categoriesof land), tij"rah (trading), and such like. This
wealth is spent in ensuring the public good and preventing individual
hardship so that under the reign of the Islamic government no public
good is left neglected and no one suffers from poverty or that his/her
essential needs are not met.

The Sh:!a also believe that Islam allows private ownership on condition
that the wealth is obtained legally and that the owner pays his dues on
it. Under no circumstances is the wealth of the people to be usurped. At
the same time, Islam protects the rights of the worker and the farmer as
well as those of the employer and landlord so that there is no inflation
or no feudal system, and no ‘cheap/free labour’ or oppression.

**Islamic Freedom**

The Sh:!a believe that freedom is one of the fundamental goals of
Islam; for Alla\>h sent his noble Prophet Mu9ammad (N) to: ePut off
their heavy burdens and the fetters that were upon themf42 The Muslim
then has full freedom to express his/her opinion in speech and in
writing as well as full freedom in his/her social contracts, to travel,
to marry, and to trade.

This wide scale freedom which Islam gives to its people prepares the
practical and psychological climate for success in its efforts so that
the Islamic society grows and flourishes. For this Islam, firstly,
combats the four causes of backwardness which are:

1. Ignorance. Islam works to make education general by making learning
compulsory as in the tradition: ‘The seeking of knowledge is an
obligation for every Muslim man and woman.’43 Islam also encourages the
learning of different sciences as in the tradition: ‘If the people knew
the benefits of seeking knowledge they would seek it even by crossing
the seas and shedding one’s blood.’44 Also amongst many other traditions
it is said that: ‘The Angels lower their wings to the seeker of
knowledge [in humility before them].’45

2. Poverty. Islam prohibits idleness, prevents unemployment, and
encourages those who are able to work to do so and makes the State
responsible for those who are incapable of work.

3. Illness. In Islamic Law there are many laws which are there to
prevent and cure many diseases. Furthermore Islam actively promotes
medicine to be widely available. In the traditions: ‘Knowledge is of two
types – knowledge of religion and knowledge of bodies (i.e.
medicine).’

4. Vice. Islam bases society in a way that no-one is forced to commit
vices and puts in place preventative punishments – under stipulated
conditions – for those who do.

Secondly, Islam works to promote peace and stability so that there is
an environment for the flourishing of industry, trade, agriculture, and
construction.

Islam also frees up all powers & energies to take part in encouraging
growth: it frees up human potential since it makes marriage easy and
prohibits adultery, it strengthens the pillars of the family and
encourages a high birth rate so that the Islamic nation may be the
largest as well as the most powerful. It also sets free the potentials
of land and water for ‘the land belongs to Alla\>h and whoever develops
it’46, and water belongs to whoever stakes it off and uses it, and any
Muslim can develop or plant what land he/she is able to.

Islam also frees up the potentials of labour since there should be no
borders between Islamic lands and all of Islamic lands are a wide area
for the use of all Muslims, and any Muslim may travel and work and live
anywhere he/she wishes.

All Muslims are also brothers in Alla\>h. Hence there are no
sectarianism, tribalism, nationalism, or racism in Islam. These are the
bare bones of the ideas of the Sh:!a in a number of fields and these are
the bases upon which the Muslim entity was raised when it was raised
high and touched the clouds and was so wide that the clouds did not
encompass it.

**3. The Islamic System in the View of the Shi!a**

The Sh:!a believe that the Islamic system consists of the laws which
regulate the life of a person from before birth until after death. They
also regulate society and strive to develop the land and advance life
and bring about the happiness of mankind in this life and the next.
These laws are such as the laws of selling, renting, trade, politics,
economics, the army, the State, agriculture, construction, mortgages,
travel, residency, security, marriage, divorce, the judiciary,
testaments, reparations, inheritance, etc.

To show the comprehensiveness of Islam and that it answers every need
of mankind and society we have selected from the Holy Qur’"n and the
traditions some texts which show the broad lines of Islamic thought in
all areas of life:
