Commentary : Verse 19
=====================

19. فَقَدْ كَذَّبُوكُم بِمَا تَقُولُونَ فَمَا تَسْتَطِيعُونَ صَرْفاً
وَلاَ نَصْراً وَمَن يَظْلِم مِنكُمْ نُذِقْهُ عَذَاباً كَبِير

19." (Allah will say to the idolaters:) 'So they shall indeed belie you
of what you say, so you shall not be able to avert (your penalty) nor
(get) help, and whoever of you be unjust, We will cause him taste a
great torment."

**Commentary:**

A polytheist will be supported by no one in the Resurrection and cannot
do any thing to rescue him. Thus, in this noble verse Allah addresses
polytheists:

"(Allah will say): to the idolaters:) 'So they shall indeed belie you
of what you say,..."

You said that they deviated you from the right path, but they count
what you say as a lie.

And since the fact is such and they themselves committed their own
deviation, therefore the verse says:

"... so you shall not be able to avert (your penalty) nor(get) help,
and whoever of you be unjust, We will cause him taste a great
torment."

Undoubtedly the Qur'anic word /zulm/ (oppression) has got an extensive
concept. Though the subject of the verse is polytheism,which is one of
the clear extensions of oppression, yet it does not abolish the
generality of the concept of the verse. Meanwhile the purpose of
'deities' is whether humane deities such as Christ, or devil deities
such as jinn or angels, each of which had been selected by a group of
pagans for worshipping.

Since they have common sense and intellect, they can be questioned. So,
in order to complete the argument and to prove the falsehood of the
statement of the polytheists, saying that these invited us to worship
them, they are asked whether this speech is right, and they explicitly
reject the polytheists' statement. Some points:

**1. The Motivation of Deviation from Monotheism:**

Deities counted the main factor of this group of pagans' deviation as
luxurious life. They say: ".. but you did provide them and their fathers
to enjoy until they forgot the Message and they were a people in
perdition", (instead of knowing blessings and thanking You for them,
they have forgotten You).

Verily comfortable life is, on one hand, causing those who can not take
welfare, and also their faith is weak, to feel conceited, for when they
are given a lot of blessings, they get too big for their boots and
forget Allah. Even sometimes, like Pharaoh, they cry: "I am the Lord".

On the other hand, such persons want to be as much as possible free and
to face no boundary in gratification of their desires. They want that
limitations and restrictions such as lawfulness, unlawfulness, legality
and illegality do not prevent them from achieving their aims, thus they
do not want to obey any rule or law and to accept the Resurrection and
Reckoning Day.

Also now there are not many adherents of Allah's religion and prophets'
teachings among rich people, this is the poor people who are willful
supporters and faithful friends of religion.

Of course, there are some exceptions in each group, but the majority
members of each group are as we said.

Meanwhile the above verse does not only put emphasis on their own
prosperity, but also it emphasizes their ancestors' prosperity, for when
a child grows up in affluence and wealth, it is natural that he mostly
discriminates against others and he will not easily get rid of his
interestand comfortable life.

While sticking with Allah's commands and religion programs need
sacrificing, sometimes migration, even holy war and martyrdom and
sometimes accepting kinds of deprivations and refusing to surrender
themselves to the enemy, which goes with temperament of rich people
less, unless their personality is superior to their material life. If
one day everything is good, they thank Allah, and if it is not good,
they do not get upset and unsteady. In other words, they dominate their
material life and they are not its servant and slave.

2. The Qur'anic word /bur/ is derived from the word /bawar/, which
originally means severity of stagnation of something. Since severity of
stagnation causes corruption, this word is also applied to mean
corruption and then to mean destruction. Since a land, which has no
tree, flower, and plant, is in fact corrupted and dead, it is called
/ba'ir/ (fallow).

Therefore, the sentence "... and they were a people in perdition"
refers to this matter that, because of luxurious life and forgetting
Allah and Resurrection, this group has been corrupted and destructed.
And, like a dried and fallow desert, the land of their heart gets empty
of flowers of humane values and fruits of virtues and spiritual life.

Studying nations that are blessed with this world's goods and know
nothing of Allah and other nations makes the vast meaning of this verse
more clear that how they are wallowing in moral corruption, and humane
virtues can no longer be found in weathered land of their entity.


**Commentary : Verse 20**

20. وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلآَّ إِنَّهُمْ
لَيَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشُونَ فِي الاَسْوَاقِ وَجَعَلْنَا
بَعْضَكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ فِتْنَةً أَتَصْبِرُونَ وَكَانَ رَبُّكَ بَصِير

20. " And We never sent any messengers before you but they certainly
ate food and walked in the markets; and We have made some of you a trial
for the others: will you bear patiently? And your Lord is
Ever-Seeing."

**Occasion of Revelation:**

A group of commentators have said that some chiefs of polytheists came
to the Prophet (p.b.u.h.) and said: "Oh Muhammad (p.b.u.h.)! What do you
want us to do for you? If you want to be a chief, we make you our chief,
if you like money and wealth, we will give you some of our wealth."

But when they saw that the Prophet (p.b.u.h.) did not give up against
their propositions, they started to cook up some pretexts and said:
"What a messenger of Lord are you that eat food and walk in the
market?"

They rebuked the holy Prophet (p.b.u.h.) for eating food, because they
wanted him to be an angel. They criticized him for walking in markets,
for they had seen Caesars and tyrannical kings who had never gone to
market, while the Prophet(p.b.u.h.) associated with and joined people
and, at the same time, he declared divine bans and orders. The
pretext-seekers criticized and said: "He wants to be our ruler,while his
custom and approach is different from kings' traditions."

The above verse was sent down and made clear that the method of the
Prophet of Islam (p.b.u.h.) has been the same as that of the former
prophets. Commentary:

In the past several holy verses, one of the pretexts of the polytheists
that why the Prophet of Islam (p.b.u.h.) eats food and walks in the
market was mentioned and it was answered concisely. The concerned verse
turns to that matter again and answers it more explicitly and in detail.
It says:

"And We never sent any messengers before you but they certainly ate
food and walked in the markets; and We ave made some of you a trial for
the others:..."

This trail may be in this way that prophets are to be human and
selected from oppressed people and this is a great test, for some people
refuse to obey and take order from their fellow creature, especially one
who is financially at a low level, and they are from this viewpoint at
high level or older or more famous in society.

Another possibility is that its purpose is to test people generally by
each other, for disabled people, the sick, and orphans are a test for
those who are rich and healthy, and, on the contrary, healthy and rich
people are a test for the poor and the sick. Are the members of the
second group contented by Allah's will? Do the first group shoulder the
responsibility for caring the second group?

Since these two commentaries are in line with each other, it is
possible that both of them are included in the extensive concept of the
verse.

Then, next to this statement, all people are addressed and are asked:

"... will you bear patiently? ..."

The most important pillar of victory and success in these trials is
patience and resistance. Resisting unrestrained desires that prevent
accepting the Truth, enduring difficulties that are faced at the time of
doing duties and performing missions, and being patient with calamities
and painful events, for man's life will not be empty of them.

In brief, in almost all cases it is only with the power of patience and
endurance that one can succeed in passing this great test.

In the end of the verse under discussion, as a warning, the Qur'an
says:

"... And your Lord is Ever-Seeing."

Never imagine that Allah sees none of your behaviors and deeds. His
knowledge operates in minute detail and nothing is hidden from Him. He
sees and knows everything precisely.
