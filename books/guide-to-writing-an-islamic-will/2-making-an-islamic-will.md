Making an Islamic Will
======================

1. Importance of Making an Islamic Will
---------------------------------------

The timing of death is uncertain, but death itself is certain. Most
people believe that their possessions will automatically pass on to
their immediate spouse/children/family with no complications and
everyone will receive what the deceased wanted them to. The fact is,
unless you have made a Will, there is no guarantee that this is always
the case. Yet, most people die without making one. Even if you have no
family, it is important that you make a Will so that what you own will
pass to whomever you wish. You will no doubt want to be sure that when
you die, your property and affairs be dealt with in accordance with your
wishes and in an efficient manner.

If you die without making a Will, the government appoints an executor
who will divide the estate among the heirs, as he/she seems fit. This
could mean that some of your dependants may be deprived of essential
financial security and possessions of particular sentimental value. The
pay of the executor for this job will come out of your estate, and the
government bureaucracy takes its time in getting things done.

Secondly, from the Shariah point of view, your heirs may get more or
less than the shares specified for them in Islam. By not writing a Will,
you are leaving the door open for a non-Islamic authority to distribute
your estate according to its own views. So not having a Will is costly
as well as problematic from both the State and the Islamic points of
view.

If you have no living relatives and have not made a Will leaving your
estate, say to a friend, a favourite charity or other organization, then
the State could receive everything on your death.

By making a Will, you can be sure that your estate is passed to the
named beneficiary/ies in the most tax-efficient way. If the country you
live in imposes inheritance tax, the may also take positive steps now to
limit your estate's liability to inheritance tax by making gifts, taking
out life assurance cover or by setting up a trust, which makes specific
provision for your family. To help achieve this, it is important that
you should make a Will and, having written it, check it regularly to
make sure that it always is still up to date. Times change, families
grow and yesterday's Will may not be right for today.

If any of the following apply to you, it may be advisable to seek
specialist advice when writing your Will:

• If you live, or own property or assets anywhere in the world.

• If you own a business.

• If you have previously been married and/or have children from a
previous marriage or relationship.

Our Holy Prophet Mohamed (S.A.W.) said:

“It is not proper for a Muslim to pass two nights except that his/her
(last) Will and Testament is near his/her pillow.”

“One who goes from this world after making a good Will dies the death of
a martyr.”

“A person who without making a Will, dies the death of a pagan.”

Although according to Islamic law a Will need not necessarily be in
writing or in any particular form of verbal declaration to constitute a
WASIYYAT**,** the present day world requirements and laws of the land
makes it obligatory upon a person to prepare a Will in**writing** to
ensure speedy disposal of wealth, to avoid unforeseen hardships to the
family members and to alleviate unnecessary problems for the
administrators.

If a Will is not made in writing, then:

The foremost problem arises as to who will administer and distribute the
estate and usually the nearest relative or friend takes over.

The administrators (Executors, Trustees) of deceased's estate cannot
easily obtain PROBATE (Power to distribute the wealth) from a Court of
Law, as it is time consuming, and in some countries like Kenya, in order
to obtain Grant of Letter of Administration, two SURETIES would be
required, each one having to give SURETY amounting to twice the value of
the deceased's gross estate. It is obviously difficult to get such
sureties, and going to a bank for surety would entail unnecessary
expenses.

Pending the receipt of Probate, the Bank account of the Deceased would
be frozen and the beneficiaries would not be in a position to draw from
the Bank for the Household maintenance, unless there is a joint account
and either party is surviving. However, one can always obtain an interim
or limited grant for specific purpose, say to operate a business or bank
account etc, with a view to preserving the deceased's estate pending
full grant.

There is a likelihood that certain acts for example Hajj, prayers and
fasts for so many days missed by the deceased during his lifetime, would
remain unperformed; and certain wishes of the deceased would remain
unfulfilled.

In case no one is willing to become a Trustee, the government (Public
Trustee Department) will take over the administration. Again this would
result in delay and would entail expenses.

So, although the law (the State as well as Islamic) does not say that
making of the Will is a must; but by looking at the consequences of not
having a Will, it is necessary – both from legal as well from Islamic
aspects, to have one and avoid misuse of ones estate after death.

Every man and woman should make a Will**.** The conditions regarding the
capacity of the testator making a Will are dependent upon the laws of
the country in which the testator lives, and subject to such
requirements, which may have an overriding effect.

2. The One-Third Option
-----------------------

After a person dies, there are certain possible relationships between
him and his estate. These are:

he has full control over it through a Will

he has partial control over it through a Will

he has absolutely no control over it

Islam has taken the middle position. It says that when a person dies, he
still retains the right to decide about up to one-third of his entire
estate. But as far as the two-thirds are concerned, the deceased person
loses the right to dispose according to his wish. The two-thirds must be
divided according to the shares specified by the Shariah. (Most of these
shares have been specified in the Holy Qur'an itself.) This law is part
of the overall system, which Islam has introduced for the distribution
of wealth in society.

**The right of disposing the one-third according to your own wish can be
exercised only by making a Will.** You can do whatever you like with the
one-third: give to a family member, a relative, a friend, a charitable
cause or organization, etc. For example, you can use the 1/3 or a part
of it to make – if you like – the shares of your wife or your daughter
equal to those of your other children.

When the Holy Qur'an talks about Wasiyyah, which is normally translated
as "Will", it refers to the Will covering mainly the one-third only. For
example, it says:

0 you who believe! It is prescribed upon you that when death approaches
one of you – If he leaves behind plenty – then he should make a Will
(Wasiyyah) for his parents and near relatives in the one-third. This is
a duty upon the pious people. (2:177)

Writing more than one-third to a person or a cause means depriving the
potential heirs of their rightful share in the estate; and, therefore,
it is considered unjust and wrong. The Holy Qur'an says, if a person
fears that the testator is [wrongfully] inclined [to one party] or is
sinning [by depriving the rightful heir in the Will, and so that person
intervenes between the testator and the potential heirs] and makes peace
between them—then there is no sin on him. All… is Forgiving, Merciful.
(2:182) What has been described in this verse as wrongfully "inclining
to one party" and "sinning by depriving the rightful heir" is related to
the two-thirds of the estate.

The one-third will be assessed after taking those expenditures, which
are incumbent upon the whole estate, like funeral expenses, and the
legal or religious debts.

Monetary obligations (Religious or Legal) are to be deducted out of the
whole estate whether the testator made a Will or not. Some examples are:
debts owed by him, property sold by him but not delivered to the buyer,
the price of articles purchased by him but not paid for. Sureties and
guarantees if necessary to be made up, fines, taxes, death duties,
Khums, Hajj, Zakat, Raddul-Madhalim, monetary retributions as those of
Kaffarra of Ihram and Saum, monetary Nazr like Nazr of Sadka, etc. When
all monetary obligations of the estate of the deceased are deducted,
then the one-third of the remaining property will be the subject of the
Will. (The testator can, however, specify that certain monetary
obligations be paid out of the one-third instead of the whole estate).

Since the testator has got the right to dispose of the one-third of the
net estate, he can bequest the same in accordance with his own personal
wishes.

In order to prepare a ‘Good Will’ (according to Ahadith), it is highly
recommended to bear in mind the following Mustahabat while making
bequest:

Bequest made for feeding poor and incapacitated people;

Bequest made in favour of relatives, for example children of one’s own
deceased son or daughter;

Bequest made in favour of other poor or incapacitated relatives;

Bequest made in favour of one’s own parents;

Bequest made for the maintenance of religion.

One could also make a bequest for Sadaqate Jariyah that is having
perpetual benefits, for example, donating to hospitals, schools,
mosques, building of wells, and the like.

Other ideas for the distribution of the one-third

Families usually have family trusts. In order to keep the perpetuity of
the main objectives of the trust created the trust could be in the name
of the Jamaat or the Regional Federation, or in the joint names of the
family and the Regional Federation, so that the trust is maintained and
used for what it was originally planned for. The other issues is that
the Jamaat can claim the trust because it is an institution whereas the
family members may not always be able to do that, especially if they
don’t live in the country in which the property is.

1/3 of the property can also be bequeathed to the Jamaat to which one
belongs. You could even take out a life assurance in the name of the
Jamaat like one would take out in the name of the family.  You can also
take out education policies in the name of the Jamaat and/or in the name
of your children.

For men, in today’s situation you could also give 1/3rd to your wife, to
increase her share of inheritance.

3. What is an "Estate "?
------------------------

An "estate" is the collective name for everything that you own. The
estate consists of the followings:

all properties, goods and investments that are in your name.

half or the specified portion of the goods and investments in which you
are a co-owner.

The first type of property is very straightforward—the entire estate
will be divided according to the will and the specified shares of the
heirs.

But there are certain cases in the second type which need explanation:

Joint Account: According to laws of some countries, with death of one
spouse, the money becomes the property of the surviving spouse. Such a
transfer of money is not valid in Islam: Islamically, half of the money
in that account belongs to the surviving spouse and the other half will
become part of the deceased's estate.

House: House are normally in the name of the couple. Such ownership can
be of two types' common ownership and tenants in common. "Tenants in
common" is also without any problem because when one spouse dies,
his/her share becomes part of the estate.

But in "common ownership", there is a problem because with the death of
one spouse, according to laws of some countries, the entire property
becomes that of the surviving spouse. This is contrary to Islamic laws,
which says that the surviving spouse gets his or her 50% and the
remaining 50% becomes part of the estate of the deceased.

We will talk more about this below.

4. Who can inherit?
-------------------

After disbursing the one-third according to your Will, your remaining
estate is to be divided among the heirs mentioned in the Holy Qur'an:
the surviving spouse and blood relatives.

No one can prevent the spouse from inheriting his or her specified share
from the estate of the deceased spouse.

As for the**blood relatives,** there are of different degrees.

First degree:                       your parents & children

Second degree:       your grandparents & siblings

Third degree:          both your maternal and paternal uncles & aunts
and their children

right of inheritance by virtue of matrimony appertains to the

individual heirs under all circumstances. A husband or wife is never
excluded from inheritance. A widow or widower is entitled to the
specific share before the estate is divided amongst the heirs succeeding
by virtue of blood relation (Nasab).

It is very important to note that the laws of the country in which the
Testator is domiciled, may have an overriding effect on the Shia
Inheritance Law, and upon such matter as classification of heirs, unless
and until that country also gives recognition to the Shia Inheritance
Law.

Whilst devising a Will it should be borne in mind that the Testator has
got a right to dispose**only one-third** of his estate according to his
own wishes. The remaining**two-thirds** must be distributed to the heirs
in accordance with the laid down rules of the Shariah. The Shariah is
very clear in this matter and has laid down specific shares and
proportions for distribution to each class/es and group/s as applicable.
For the classes and groups, see the diagram above.** **

5. Basic Shares of the Most Common Heirs
----------------------------------------

What you see below are the basic shares of your most common heirs. In
these examples, you have been considered as the deceased and the
relatives mentioned here are your heirs.

**Your Heirs**

**Their Shares**

YOUR FATHER

if you had a child    16.66% (1/6)

if you had no child whatever remains after share of the mother and/or
the spouse.

YOUR MOTHER

if you had a child or brother\* 16.66% (1/6)

if you had no child or brother\* 33.33% (1/3)

YOUR HUSBAND

if you had a child 25% (1/4)

if you had no child   50% (1/2)

YOUR WIFE

if you had a child    12.5% (1/8)

if you had no child   25% (1/4)

CHILDREN

whatever remains after giving the shares of the parents and/or the
surviving spouse.

a male child gets twice the share of a female.

***\* In presence of a parent (or a grandparent) or a child (or a
grandchild), the brother of the deceased does not get anything. However,
he affects the share of the mother: instead of 1 /3, it becomes 1/6.***

### (a) Will a female child gets half of a male child's share?

###

It is not a male versus female issue; it is not a sexist issue. If it
were a sexist issue than why do we have cases in inheritance where
females get the same percentage as their male counterparts. For example:

if daughter is the only heir from the first group, then she inherits
100% and she excludes her grandparents and her uncles.

a mother in most cases gets 1/6, the same share as that of a father.

So, why is there difference? The difference in inheritance is based on
economic responsibilities: those who have been given greater burden of
responsibility have been given greater share in inheritance. Rights are
tied to responsibilities. The son gets a larger share because he has his
family to take care of, while the daughter is taken care of by her
husband.

Another example of the inter-relation between responsibility and rights
is the case of the mother: if parents are the only heirs and the mother
has no other sons to take care of her, then her share increases from 1/6
to 1/3.

Objection: What if the daughter's family is not rich or that she is a
minor? Answer: The one-third option has made the Shariah laws quite
flexible. If you think that your daughter needs extra help, then you can
give up to the one-third of your estate to her:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>son</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p><strong>daughter</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>44.44</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>22.22</p></td>
<td align="left"><p><strong><em>out of the 2/3</em></strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>5.56</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>27.78</p></td>
<td align="left"><p><strong><em>Possible use of the 1/3</em></strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>50.00</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>50.00</p></td>
<td align="left"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### (b) Wife's Share:

###

The wife's share is 1/4 if the husband was childless or 1/8 if he had a
child. This is basically because of two reasons: it is possible for a
woman to marry again; and, if she has grown up children, then they are
responsible for her maintenance.

However, even in this case, the one-third rule makes the Shariah very
flexible. Look at the following example:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="25%" />
<col width="25%" />
<col width="25%" />
<col width="25%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>Wife</p>
<p>share in %</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Son</p>
<p>share in %</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Daughter</p>
<p>share in %</p></td>
<td align="left"></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>12.5</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>58.34</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>29.16</p></td>
<td align="left"><p><strong><em>out of 100%</em></strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>8.33 + 33.33 = 41.66</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>38.90</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>19.44</p></td>
<td align="left"><p><strong><em>possible use the 1/3 option</em></strong></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

6. Wife’s Share
---------------

Since the share of the wife is somewhat complicated, it is necessary to
explain a few points separately:

Firstly, as the definition of the "estate" shows, a house jointly-owned
by a couple is divided – according to the Shariah – into two: half
becomes part of the estate of the deceased, and the other half was from
before the property of the surviving spouse.

Secondly, according to the Shariah, the wife is not entitled to inherit
land of her husband (whether an agriculture land or a residential plot):
she only inherits the house on the land according to her proportional
shares in inheritance. In common ownership case, the wife is the owner
of 50% of the house and the land; the other 50% becomes part of her
husband's estate from which she will inherit only 6.25% of the house.

So in the end, the wife becomes the owner of 56.25% of the house and 50%
of the land. This creates practical problems in some parts of the world:
a house cannot be divided; if other heirs insist on their share in the
house, then it has to be sold and the price divided accordingly; it is
also difficult to assess the value of the land separate from the house,
etc.

Therefore, the following is suggested:

Either give the house to your wife during your life-time.'

Or, if the value of the 50% of the house plus the land is within the
one-third of your entire estate, then write the entire house to your
wife in your Will. In this way, half of the house plus the land is her
property from before and the other half will go to her on strength of
the 1/3 option in your Will. In theory, it will work out like this:

50% of the land and house belongs to your wife.

6.25% of the house is your wife's share of inheritance.

50% of the land + 43.75% of the house goes to her by using the 1/3
option.

Or, if the value of the 50% of the land is more than the one-third of
your estate, then discuss it with your other heirs (parents and
children) and ask for their consent to write the entire house for your
wife in the Will. If they give the consent (which is irrevocable), then
you can write the house to your wife in the Will even if it is more than
her proportional share of inheritance.

7. Executor or Executrix
------------------------

It is a normal practice to appoint your spouse or another family member
as the executor of your Will. There is nothing wrong with this. The only
conditions which are necessary for an executor/executrix is he or she
should be Baligh, sane, and a Muslim. It is not necessary for him/her to
be 'adil; Trustworthiness would be a sufficient quality for an Executor.

If you accept to be an Executor for someone's Will, then it becomes
Wajib for you to fulfil your duty. You can only reject this
responsibility while the testator is alive; but if the Testator dies
before such rejection, or without the information having reached him,
the retraction is null and void, and it is incumbent upon the Executor
to assume the responsibility. An Executor cannot reject this role after
his/her death.

Appointment of Executors (administrators, trustees)

A person has a right to appoint an Executor/s of his own choice. He has
the power to confide the execution of his last wishes to whomsoever he
likes, subject to the following restrictions:

Executor (Wasi) must be an adult. But, if a minor is made an Executor
together with an adult on the condition that the minor's rights and
duties would commence after his-attaining adulthood (Bulugh) the
appointment is valid.

A woman can be appointed as an Executor. An heir or even a blind person
can also be appointed as one.

The Executor must be sane (of sound mind).

The Executor should be a Muslim. If he renounces Islam, the executorship
will lapse and he cannot be reappointed as an Executor even after he has
re-embraced Islam.

The Executor must be trustworthy, though not necessarily ‘adil (i.e. of
approved probity according to Shariah).

Note that:

An Executor may apportion reasonable normal remuneration for his
services. But, when there is an express implied signs that services be
honorary, this Executor must perform his duties without remuneration,
provided he had accepted the nomination.

An Executor cannot appoint his own successor or cannot entrust the
management of the testator's property to his own Executor or to any
other person unless the testator had authorized him to do so.

**It is advisable,** therefore, to make a provision in the Will
giving**power** to the Executor/s to nominate successor/s and to enlist
assistance from others for the smooth management of the affairs of the
estate.

Why appoint an Executor?

Ensuring that your estate is distributed in the way laid down in your
Will is the duty of an Executor. Executors are responsible for dealing
with the affairs of someone who has died, in accordance with the terms
of the Will. They will collect all the assets, settle all debts and
liabilities, and distribute what is left to the beneficiaries.

When choosing your Executor(s), you should consider people you know,
trust and who you believe will be willing and capable of accepting the
responsibility when the time comes.

You can appoint anyone you wish to take this responsibility and many
people chose a relative or a close friend, however there are
disadvantages in doing this. The person appointed may die before you, or
may be a beneficiary under your Will, which can lead to awkward
situations with other beneficiaries. Some of the tasks involved in
administering an estate can be onerous, time consuming and often need
legal and taxation expertise. For some Executors, this may be a worrying
prospect.  The appointment of a professional specialist Executor with
the necessary skills and expertise to act with integrity and
impartiality will remove all these worries.

Nobody likes to contemplate the effect their death will have on their
family and friends. Yet, at a time of personal sorrow, perhaps the
heaviest burden one can leave behind is the administration of one's
estate.

8. Guardian of Children
-----------------------

It is very important to write in your Will about the guardian and
custodian of your children. Under normal circumstances, the surviving
spouse is made the guardian, and this is indeed, the best decision.

It is important to note here, for the sake of record, the conditions,
which must be found in the guardian of your children. The guardian must
be a Muslim, sane, and trustworthy. Those who have the right of custody
of children (in order of preference) are: father, mother; paternal
grandfather; and then anyone specifically appointed as the guardian of
the children. However, the duty of maintenance for the children falls
upon the following (in order of preference):  father; paternal
grandfather; mother; other grandparents collectively.

The last person in this list of custodians can be from outside the
family, but one must be very careful in selecting such a person. The
most important condition is that he/she besides being trustworthy must
also be a Muslim who will raise the children according to the teachings
of Islam.

9. Updating your Will
---------------------

Having made a Will it is important to ensure that it continues to meet
your requirements over time. If your circumstances change you may need
to amend the terms of your Will to reflect the new position. This is a
common situation and you should view your Will as something that can be
easily revised at any time.

Equally important to making a Will is that you review it regularly to
make sure that it reflects any changes in your circumstances or in the
names of those you would like to benefit.

Changes in financial or marital status, or a wish to include new family
members, are things that could lead to a need to change your Will.
During the review, you could also take into consideration any new
legislation, which may help reduce your inheritance tax liability.

10. Some Legal Matters
----------------------

For a written Will to be recognised in the Court of Law, must be:

dated,

hand written or typed,

signed by the testator, and

attested by**two** witnesses.

The testator must sign the Will in presence of the two witnesses. It is
not necessary for the witnesses to know the contents of the Will. The
witnesses MUST NOT be the heirs or beneficiaries of the testator,
otherwise the bequests to them could be void.

The names and addresses of the witnesses must be recorded against the
attestation clause/signature of the testator at the time of signing, not
later.

After the Will has been executed, no additions to, or alterations to it
may be made**.** Any addition or alteration to the Will can be made by
way of Codicil, (addition to Will) but it is not advisable to make a
Codicil, as this can create complications in the interpretation of the
provisions contained in the Will. It is better to prepare a new Will
rather than make additions or alterations to the original Will.

In some countries like Kenya, no stamp is required on a Will, but it can
be registered at the Land Office by paying stamp duty, but this
requirement will be dependent upon the laws of the country where one is
residing.
