Preface
=======

The fourth volume in this series contains answers to 105 questions,
most of which were asked during the period April 1975 to June, 1978.

When the third volume was compiled, it was noticed that it had become
somewhat bulkier than the previous volumes. It was therefore, decided to
omit subjects dealing with Taharah, Prayer and Fast. More important
questions relating to these themes havi now been incorporated in the
present volume.

This series is published for the benefit of our Shi'a Ithna 'ashari
youths.

The Mission is extremely grateful to Haji Muhammad Husseii Karmalli,
Dar es Salaam, for his help in checking the rnanuscrip and making useful
suggestions
