Rules Regarding Assisted Suicide
================================

Question 114: Assisted suicide is killing a terminally ill patient so he
does not have to go through any pain. What is the ruling regarding this
action?

Answer: Murder is not permissible in any case and one would have to pay
blood money and be physically punished.

Question 115: There are three ways to assist a terminally ill patient to
commit suicide. First, the doctor injects medicine into the body of the
patient that would kill him. Second, the doctor stops giving the patient
medicine that he needs which would result in death. Third, the doctor
gives the patient a fatal dose of medicine but the patient injects it
into his own body. Which one of these is permissible?

Answer: It is not obligatory to keep the dying person alive or delay his
death, so the second method would be permissible. But, any action that
would cause death would not be permissible, for example, the other two
scenarios.
