Islam And The Faith Of Three Caliphs
====================================

When Ahlul Sunnat consider the three Caliphs to be the rightful
successors of the Prophet, it is necessary to consider them Imams and
leaders and not only religious and faithful persons. Presently,
according to the opinion of Ahlul Sunnat the three Caliphs are superior
to all the Muslims. But we have no argument with the belief of Ahlul
Sunnat.

Here the argument is whether people of Shiite faith, believe that the
Caliphs were infidels? The belief of Ahlul Sunnat about this is that
according to Shias the three Caliphs were infidels. But seeing the
reference from Shia books, we come to know that Shias consider them
Muslim and not infidels.

According to Majalisul Mo-mineen[^1] of Qadi Nurullah Shushtari, the
great scholar Khwaja Nasiruddin Muhammad Tusi says in his Tajreed that
those who fight against Ali (a.s.) are infidels and those who oppose Ali
(a.s.) are transgressors. The three Caliphs did not fight against Ali
(a.s.), so they cannot be infidels; and when they were not infidels,
they were Muslims. According to Allamah Qaushiji in Sharh Tajrid[^2],
people of Shiite faith are not convinced of the infidelity of the three
Caliphs. Therefore, it is clear from both the books of Shia and Sunni
that according to Shias, the three Caliphs were Muslims.
