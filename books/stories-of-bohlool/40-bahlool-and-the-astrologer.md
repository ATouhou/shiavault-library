Bahlool and the Astrologer
==========================

It is said that a person came to Haroun Rashid, claiming knowledge of
astrology. Bahlool was also present at this assembly. Coincidentally,
the astrologer sat across Bahlool.

Bahlool asked him, “Can you tell who is sitting near you?”

“I don't know.”

“You don't even know who is sitting across you, then how can you tell
about the stars of the sky?”

The man was left speechless at Bahlool's statement, and left the
assembly.
