===================================

  <p>
عَنْ أَبِي عَبْدِ اللٌّهِ (ع) فِي رَمِي الْجِمَارِ قَالَ: لَهُ بِكُلِّ
حَصَاةٍ يُرمى بِهَا تَحُطُّ عَنْهُ كَبِيرَةً مُوْبِقَةً.
  </p>

 It has been narrated from Abi ‘Abdillah [Imam Ja’far Ibn Muhammad
as-Sadiq] (peace be upon him) in regards to the stoning of the Shaitan
that he said, “For every stone that a pilgrim throws, a major sin, which
would have led to his destruction, is averted from him.”
