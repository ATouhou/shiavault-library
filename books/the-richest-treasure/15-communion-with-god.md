Communion with God
==================

Do not forget to set apart the best of your time for communion with God,
although every moment of yours is for Him only, provided it is spend
sincerely in the service of your people. The special time that you give
to prayer, is to be devoted to the performances of the prescribed daily
prayers. Keep yourself engaged in these prayers both in the day and in
the night, and to gain perfect communion, do not as far as possible, let
your prayers grow tiresome.

When you lead in congregational prayer, do not let your prayer be so
lengthy as to cause discomfort to the congregation or raise in them the
feeling of dislike for it or liquidate its effect, for in the
congregation there may be invalids and also those who have to attend
pressing affairs of their own.

When, on receiving an order to proceed to Yemen, I asked of the prophet
of God, how I should lead the people there in prayer, he said “Perform
your prayers even as the weakest among you would do, and set an example
of consideration to the faithful”.
