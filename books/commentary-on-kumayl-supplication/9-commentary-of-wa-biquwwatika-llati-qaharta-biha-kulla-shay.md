Commentary of: “Wa biquwwatika’llati qaharta biha kulla shay”

*(And I ask You) by Your Strength, through which You dominate
everything.*

Allah’s Strength, just as His holy Existence, is infinite and other
abilities and strengths are insignificant before His Strength. No
strength is independent from His Strength, but is rather a ray of His
Power: “لا حول و لا قوه الا بالله “: “There is no Power but Allah’s.” In
the last section, the phrase “كل شيء” was briefly discussed and it was
concluded that:

“كل شيء” includes all the creatures and beings, which have been created
by Allah’s Mercy, and whose exact quality and quantity no one knows and
will not know until the Day of Judgment. Who is aware of the exact
number of the billions of heavenly galaxies, plants, animals, birds,
beasts, reptiles of the earth and sea, and the countless amoebas,
viruses, microbes, hidden beings and the angels?

The Compassionate Creator of the world, who has such unrelenting Power
over “everything in the world”, dominates everything, and nothing is out
of His embracing Strength.

Allah maintains the heavens and their kernels, the galaxies and the
stars, the systems and their inhabitants-some of which weigh more than
billions of tons-which have been floating in a certain orbit, with a
definite speed for billions of years and keeps them from falling down.
