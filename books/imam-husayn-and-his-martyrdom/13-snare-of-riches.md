Snare of Riches
===============

Meanwhile Persia came within the Muslim orbit. When Medain was captured
in the year 16 of the Hijra, and the battle of Jalula broke the Persian
resistance, some military booty was brought to Medina - gems, pearls,
rubies, diamonds, swords of gold and silver. A great celebration was
held in honour of the splendid victory and the valour of the Arab army.

In the midst of the celebration they found the Caliph of the day
actually weeping. One said to him, “What! a time of joy and thou
sheddest tears?” “Yes”, he said, “I foresee that the riches will become
a snare, a spring of worldliness and envy, and in the end a calamity to
my people.” For the Arab valued, above all, simplicity of life, openness
of character, and bravery in face of danger. Their women fought with
them and shared their dangers.

They were not caged creatures for the pleasures of the senses. They
showed their mettle in the early fighting round the head of the Persian
Gulf. When the Muslims were hard pressed, their women turned the scale
in their favour. They made their veils into flags, and marched in battle
array. The enemy mistook them for reinforcements and abandoned the
field. Thus an impending defeat was turned into a victory.
