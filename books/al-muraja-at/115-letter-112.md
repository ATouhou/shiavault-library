Appreciation
------------

**Jamadi al-Ula 2, 1330**

I bear witness that now you are acquainted with the matter, capable of
handling it. You have surpassed all others in comprehending it and
researching it minutely, scrutinizing it carefully, turning it to all
sides, discerning its inner implications, seeking its essence and
nature, without being swayed by nationalistic biases, nor motivated by
personal interests. So, the attributes of your clemency cannot be
harmed, nor can your mind be dominated.

You have dealt in depth researching it with a clemency that is more than
pleasing, and with a mind more spacious than this world, minutely
verifying, without minding the view of kith or kin, till what is hidden
has surfaced; truth has manifested itself, and morning rays have
appeared to all those who can see; so, all praise is due to Allah for
guiding us to His religion, and for being successful to attain what He
has enjoined us to attain of His Path: THE RIGHT PATH, and may He send
blessings unto Muhammad and the progeny of Muhammad, and many
salutations.

Sincerely,

*Sh*
