Don't Ridicule Others
=====================

***“One group of people should not make fun of another group of people.
May be they (the latter) are better than they (the former)”.***

(Surah al-Hujurat, 49:11.)

Some people make fun of others, and humiliate them in the eyes of their
fellow-beings. People who speak ill of others, are usually those whose
education and upbringing have not been up to the mark, and who have not
learnt proper social manners. They are not perhaps, aware that all human
beings are equal, and no one has the right to humiliate or hurt another.
They also forget that it is quite possible, that those whom they
ridicule may in fact be better people than themselves, because of their
good qualities.

It is the duty of every Muslim to respect others. If he observes any
defect in the body, dress or house of another, he should not laugh at
him or ridicule him.
