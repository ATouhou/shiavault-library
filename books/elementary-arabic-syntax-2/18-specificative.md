Specificative
=============

118. What is a specificative?  
 A specificative is a noun in the accusative state which explains the
goal of an unclear word that comes before it. For example: **إشتریتُ
رَطلاً زیتاً** (I bought a bucket of oil.)

119. How many types of specificatives are there?  
 There are two types of specificatives:  
 • essential specificatives, which clear up an unclear noun, for
example: **إشتریتُ رَطلاً عسلاً** (I bought a bucket of honey.)

• relative specificatves, which clear up an unclear sentence, for
example: **طابَ التلمیذُ نفساً** (The student was clean, himself.)

120. How many types of words precede a specificative in the accusative
state?  
 The words that precede a specificative in the accusative state are:  
 • words that denote weight, **اشتریتُ رطلاً سمناً** (I bought a bucket
of lard.)

• words that denote volume or weight of grains, **اشتریتُ مُدّاً
قَمحاً** (I bought a *mudd*[^1] of wheat.)

• Words that denote area, **اشتریتُ ذراعاً أرضاً** (I bought a
*dhirā‛*15 of land.)

• Numbers from 11 to 99, **اشتریتُ عشرین کتاباً** (I bought 20 books.)

121. Is it permissible for a specificative to be in a state other than
the accusative state?  
 It is permissible to put the specificative of a weight, volume, or
area:  
 • in the genitive case as a compliment to a prefixed noun, **اشتریتُ
رطلَ سمنٍ** (I bought a bucket of lard.)

• in the genitive case with the preposition *min*, **اشتریتُ رطلاً مِن
سمنٍ** (I bought a bucket of lard.)
