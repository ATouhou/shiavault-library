Question Thirtythree
====================

### Do the Shiites consider witr prayer a religious duty ?

Answer:
-------

*Witr* prayer is one of the supererogatory prayers of night, *nafilah*,
which are not obligatory on the followers of the Prophet (a.s) but which
are obligatory on the Noble Prophet (a.s), according to the Shiite
jurists.

In his book *Tadhkirat al-Fuqaha*, \`Allamah Hilli, the jurist,
enumerates almost seventy such things and says, Things which are
obligatory on the Prophet, but not only his followers are: brushing the
teeth, performing *witr* prayer, and sacrificing. (1) The noble Prophet
(a.s) is quoted as having said, Three things have been prescribed on me,
but not on you; these are: brushing my teeth, performing *witr* prayer
and sacrificing. *Witr* prayer, a duty of the Prophet, is thus a
recommended action for the Muslims.[1]
