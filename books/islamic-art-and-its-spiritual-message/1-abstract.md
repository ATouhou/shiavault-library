Abstract
========

*Islamic Art is the art of civilization based on Islamic religion.
Moreover, it not only concerned with particular region or particular
people rather it is a combination of different civilizations and
historical circumstances as painted with Islamic weltanschauung. The
Arab civilization is probably more important. Although the Arabs have
little art and even then, they developed Islamic art with spiritual
characteristics. They were expert in mathematics and geometry and
applied their knowledge to formulation of Islamic decoration. Turkish
also played important role in Islamic art and its spiritual message.
They ruled for a long period upon large part of Islamic world from 10th
to 19th century. The Persian art and literature emerged as the main
sources of the development of Muslim art of painting, architecture and
various forms of Islamic decorative arts. The spiritual aspect remained
the dominant factor in all art and thought of Islamic World. In
subcontinent, Mughals rulers contributed much to the various Islamic
art-forms such as architecture (both sacred and public), miniature art,
decorative arts and landscape paintings.*
