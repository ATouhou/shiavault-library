The Most Important Main Trends of the Speeches of Ahlu El-Bayt (R) on the Streets of Kufa
=========================================================================================

Thus the Family of the Prophet (R) had spoken to the people of Kufa with
a common main trend, which is that they all blamed the people of Kufa
and spoke to them as they are the murderers who had committed the crime
of killing the Master of martyrs (Q) and his family and supporters.
Since the people were the fuel for the fire that the mighty tyrants had
lightened its sparkle, they were the murdering tool, indeed they were
those who committed the crime, and this was pointed in many of the
narrations of the members of the purified family (R), part of it is this
paragraph from Ziyarat Ashura:

"… So God’s curse shall be upon the nation that set the basis for your
oppression, and God shall curse the nation that pushed you away from
your place and removed you from the ranks that God had appointed you for
them, and Allah shall curse a nation that killed you…".

Indeed the nation’s role is very important and effective, as the leaders
of goodness need the nation to achieve victory and without it they are
unable to achieve any of the goodness and reformation objectives, and by
the nation the leaders of wickedness win and without it they cannot
reach their evil objectives.
