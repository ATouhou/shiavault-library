The Feature of Sura Al-Furqan
-----------------------------

This Sura contains seventy seven verses and it has been sent down in
Mecca.

In the first verses of this Sura, the Qur’an has rendered it into
‘Furqan’ which means the separator of right from wrong; and that is why
this Sura has been called ‘Furqan’.

This Sura consists of some verses about the pretexts of the pagans and
the answers given to them.

They are also about the lives of the former peoples, such as; the people
of Rass, and the people’s regret in the Hereafter, the signs of Unity,
the greatness of Allah in nature, and the comparison of believers with
unbelievers; but the most important part of the verses of this holy Sura
is about the qualities of /‘ibad-ur-rahman/ (the servants of Allah) who
are the true servants of Allah, which begins from verse 63 up to the end
of the Sura.

We hope, by reciting these verses and contemplating on them, which
results the improvement of our behaviour and manner basing on these
qualities, we can pave the way of receiving the Divine grace and favours
in the world and Hereafter and entering Paradise.

The Virtue of Reciting Al-Furqan
--------------------------------

There is a tradition quoted from ‘Ishaq-ibn-‘Ammar from Hadrat
‘Abul-Hassan Musa-ibn-Ja’far who told him:

*“Do not abandon reading Sura /tabaraka/ (Al-Furqan) since if any
(believer) reads it every night, He will not punish him at all and He
will not reckon him and his abode will be in the Exalted Firdaus
(Paradise).”*[^1]
