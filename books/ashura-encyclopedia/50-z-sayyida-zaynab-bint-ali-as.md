================================

She is the one who carried the story of Karbala to the world and stayed
with Imam Husayn all his life. She was the daughter of Imam Ali and
Sayyida Fatimah Al-Zahrah. She was born on 5 Jamadi Al-Ulah, 5AH in
Madinah after Imam Husayn (as) and one of her names was: 'Aqeelat Bani
Hashim'. She was known for her courage and loyalty to her brother Imam
Husayn.

She was married to her cousin Jaâ€™far Ibn Abdullah and had two sons:
Muhammad and Awn who were both martyred in Karbala. Even after Imam
Husayn was slain, Sayyida Zaynab took care of the women until they came
back to Madinah. She went to Al-Sham with her husband and there she died
on 63/65 AH.
