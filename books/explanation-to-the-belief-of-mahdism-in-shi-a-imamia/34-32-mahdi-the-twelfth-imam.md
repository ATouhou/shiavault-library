32. Mahdi the twelfth Imam
==========================

The writer in this chapter has written what reflects his prejudice or
ignorance. The Imam will appear; the Imam will rescue the world from
tyranny; all this imagination is the product of the last decades of Bani
Ummayah’s rule. The tyranny of Bani Ummayah’s government invigorated
this belief more deep. But in no way did it create this supposition or
this fancy as the writer says. It is as old as Islam itself The Prophet
(S) himself had disclosed Mahdism and told the people what we now know.

It is a promise given by the prophet (S) and as is known, the Prophet
(S) did not utter out of his own desire or lust. It is God’s word and
Divine Revelation from which he speaks. So, it is a promise given to us
by God through the Prophet (S).

The writer says that the title of Mahdi was given to rescue the Shia
from dullness and hopelessness. To inject them with ray of hope or a
beam of anticipation towards a better future. As we have repeatedly said
it is a reality. The title has nothing to do with the disappointment of
a man or a group of men.

The title does not add anything to the personality of the Imam. His
responsibility is already foretold by the Prophet (S). The Shia did not
invent anything so far as religion is concerned. The title Mahdi is also
acknowledged by Sunni scholars. It was heard on the tongue of most
well-known Sunni authorities. As such, it seems that it is the writer
who is trying to invent something at this stage.
