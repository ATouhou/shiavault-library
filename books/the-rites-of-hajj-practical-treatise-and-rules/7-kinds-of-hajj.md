Kinds of Hajj
=============

Article 20
----------

Hajj can be performed in three ways: “Hajj al-Tamattu’”, “Hajj al-Qiran”
(Hajj al-Qiran involves combining Umrah and Hajj, with only one Ihram
for both) and “Hajj al-Ifrad” (Hajj al-Ifrad involves performing Hajj
only. A sacrificial animal is not obligatory when performing Hajj
al-Ifrad).

“Hajj al-Tamattu’” is to be performed by people who live forty-eight
miles (approximately seventy-seven kilometers) or more from Mecca and
the second and the third ways are for the people who live in great Mecca
or in a place closer than this distance.

Article 21
----------

Whenever a person who lives in Mecca travels out of Mecca and returns to
the city, then this person can perform Hajj al-Tamattu’, Hajj al-Qiran
or Hajj al-Ifrad.

Whenever a person who belongs to a place beyond the distance specified,
lives in Mecca for more than two years then he/she should act as the
people of Mecca, even if this person had been able to perform Hajj or
has gained this ability after staying in the town, and even if he/she
had stayed in Mecca for a lifetime or for a limited time.

Article 22
----------

According to the fact that most of Muslims in the world should perform
Hajj al-Tamattu’, then rulings which have been mentioned in these rites
are for performing Hajj al-Tamattu’.
