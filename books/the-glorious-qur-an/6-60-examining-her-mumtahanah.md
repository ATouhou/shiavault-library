60: Examining Her (mumtahanah)
==============================

This chapter was revealed after The Coalition 33 and before Women 4. Its
13 verses in two sections, which are noticeably longer than the
5ucceeding Meccan ones, date from the Madina period.

The chapter begins with Abraham's prayer (I) before it deals with women
converts (II). This chiefly concerns woman's role as Islamic society was
developing; at the end it gives the woman's profession of faith.
