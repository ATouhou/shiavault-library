Tragedy Of Karbala’ Demands Close Attention
===========================================

It should be clear that the incident of Karbala’ is such a tragedy that
has attracted the attention of writers, philosophers, historians and all
intellectuals. From the aspect of religion and ethics, it is such an
incident in Islam that its equal is not found. Rather, if it is compared
to other such incidents that are often recorded in war poems, we shall
see that it does not have any equal. Since it is a factual incident, it
is very much clear which people constituted the opposing groups and
which group was on the side of Yazeed and which one sided with Imam
Husayn (a.s.).
