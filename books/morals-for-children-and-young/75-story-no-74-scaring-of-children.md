Story no. 74: Scaring of children.
==================================

In some houses, children enjoy scaring others.  
 One boy, called Fahim scared every child in the neighbourhood.  
 For example, he said to one “Be careful, the Genie might take you!”  
 To another he said “Be careful of the dead! He may take you also!”  
 There was a boy called Humayoon who solved problems for the children.  
 One day he gathered them and said “You know what is imagination, don’t
you? Well, to avoid it, you should excercise so that you have strong
nerves.And also, that when you grow up, only be scared of the sins you
comitted because every sin has a punishment and a result and we do not
have  
 the strength to bear God’s punishment.
