Endcaution of Wilayat and Warning of Hazrat Zahra (s.a.) About the Beginning of Deviation in Belief of Imamate
==============================================================================================================

We close this chapter by referring to two points in the speech of Hazrat
Zahra (s.a.):

When a group of supporters of falsehood, in order to conceal the truth
and justify their usurpation, instigated a generation to head towards
the fire of hell, Siddiqa Tahira (Zahra) said regarding this perversion:

“What a surprise! Have you forgotten the Day of Ghadeer Khumm?”**[2]**

In the same way, Her Eminence (s.a.) in reply to justifications of the
betrayers of trust said:

“Did my father leave an excuse for anyone on Ghadeer Day?”**[3]**
