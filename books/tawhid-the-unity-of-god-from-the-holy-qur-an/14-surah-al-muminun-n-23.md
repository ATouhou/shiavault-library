Surah Al-Muminun, n.23
======================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا اتَّخَذَ اللَّهُ مِنْ وَلَدٍ وَمَا كَانَ مَعَهُ مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ ۚ
إِذًا لَذَهَبَ كُلُّ إِلَٰهٍ بِمَا خَلَقَ وَلَعَلَا بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَىٰ
بَعْضٍ ۚ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Never did Allah take to Himself a son, and never was there with him
any (other) god-- in that case would each god have certainly taken away
what he created, and some of them would certainly have overpowered
others; glory be to Allah above what they describe!(23:91)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَالِمِ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ فَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***The Knower of the unseen and the seen, so may He be exalted above
what they associate (with Him) (23:92)***
