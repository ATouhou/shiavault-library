Lesson Ninety Seven: Who Is Wise?
=================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) was asked to describe a wise man. He replied:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلْعاقِلُ هُوَ الّذِى يَضَعُ الشَّىءَ مَواضِعَهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The wise is one who puts everything in its right place.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

A lot is said about the meaning and concept of wisdom, but the above
definition says it all so succinctly in one short phrase. A better
interpretation will be hard to find. Wisdom is nothing other than
putting everything in its right place: giving everybody the place they
merit, showing grief and happiness, friendship and enmity, mildness and
harshness, kindness and severity according to the circumstances ,
adopting correct priorities in worship, work and healthy recreation . In
short, doing the right thing in the right way at the right time.
