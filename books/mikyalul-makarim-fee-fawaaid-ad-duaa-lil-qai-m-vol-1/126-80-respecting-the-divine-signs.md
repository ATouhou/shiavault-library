80. Respecting the Divine Signs
===============================

Allah, the Mighty and the High says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ذَٰلِكَ وَمَنْ يُعَظِّمْ شَعَائِرَ اللَّهِ فَإِنَّهَا مِنْ تَقْوَى
الْقُلُوبِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And whoever respects the signs of Allah, this surely is (the
outcome) of the piety of hearts.” (Qur’an, Surah Hajj 22:32)***

Tabarsi (r.a.) has said:

“And one who respects the signs of God, that is the standards of the
religion of God, and the signs that He has appointed for His
obedience.”[^1]

I say: Since the being of Imam (as) is one of these important signs and
indications, without any doubt, respecting His Eminence is one of its
important types. And among the types of paying respect is: Praying for
His Eminence.
