***41. And those on the Left Hand, how [unfortunate] shall be those on
the Left Hand!***  
***42. They are in fierce hot winds and boiling water,***  
***43. And shadow of black smoke,***  
***44. That shadow is neither cool nor pleasant,***

Following a treatment of the great Blessings of those nearest to Divine
Threshold and the people of the Right Hand, the blessed Verses in
question deal with the horrible and excruciating torments in store for
the people on the Left Hand in order to make a comparison between the
three groups, saying that the people on the Left Hand shall be so
unfortunate that the records of their deeds shall be given unto their
left hands symbolizing that they are sinners, impure, wrong-doers, and
worthy of being cast into Hellfire.

Then, three torments of theirs are being enumerated: They are in fierce
hot winds and boiling water; they are in a shadow of stifling and
burning smoke; the fierce hot winds on the one hand and the boiling
water and the stifling and hot smoke on the other side entangle them in
such manner that they may not bear it any longer. Even if they be not
chastised with further torments, their suffering suffices to punish
them.

The blessed Verse 44 is saying that they shall be in a shadow which
shall be neither cool nor pleasant. Shadows preserves man from direct
sunlight, winds, and showers at times, but it is manifest they their
shadows shall be unpleasant since they are but stifling black smoke
which may solely harm.

***45. Indeed, before that they indulged in luxury,***  
***46. And were persisting in committing grave sins.***  
***47. And they used to say: "When we die and become dust and bones
shall we then indeed be resurrected?***

The sources of the sufferings of the people on the Left Hand are
expressed tersely in three clauses. Firstly, they were vain and indulged
in the pleasures of the flesh in this world. The Arabic word mutraf is
applied to one who is vain and rebellious owing to indulgence in mundane
pleasures.[^1]

It is true that all the people on the Left Hand are not amongst those
indulging in affluence and those who disobeyed Divine Commands. The Holy
Qur’an refers to their chiefs. Likewise we notice that corruptions in
human societies are due to the vanity and obduracy of those who lead
others astray.

Such wrong-doers are the main sources of all the battles and bloodsheds
and concupiscent inclinations. Thus, the Holy Qur’an above all points at
them. It is worthy of note that Blessings include youth, health, and
long life besides material possessions which should be employed toward
Divine Satisfaction.

The blessed Verse 46 is saying that they persisted in committing grave
sins. The Arabic word hinth originally denotes any kind of sin, but the
word is mainly applied to breaking one's promise and turning away from
one's word, since they are manifest instances of sins.

Thus, the characteristics of the people on the Left Hand does not solely
lie in committing sins, but their persistence in committing grave sins,
since the people on the Right Hand may commit sins as well, but they
never persist in committing sins and when they see that they have
sinned, they immediately repent.

Some Qur’anic exegetes interpret the Arabic phrase hinth ‘adim as
polytheism, since it is the gravest sin as it is reflected elsewhere in
the Glorious Qur’an:

***"Indeed, Allah forgives not that partners be associated with Him in
worship, but He forgives except that anything else to whom He wills; and
whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has verily invented a
grave sin."***

Some also maintain that:

***"grave sin"***

is applied to lying which is the gravest sin and the source of
committing other grave sins, particularly instances which entail denial
of Prophets (as) and Resurrection. However, the general meaning of the
blessed Verse reflects that these are all instances of "great sin."

The blessed Verse 47 is saying that their evil deeds included their
saying that when they die and turn into bones and dust, they may not be
raised from the dead. Thus, denial of Resurrection is the source of many
a sin and the same constitutes another characteristic of the people on
the Left Hand.

The expression:

***"they used to say"***

reflects that they persisted in the denial of Resurrection even though
they witnessed the scenes of Resurrection in this world. They saw that
animate beings like plants withered away and turned into dust, but they
were rejuvenated.

They neglected the fact that One Who basically created the world in the
beginning shall be Omnipotent to recreate the world of existence, but
they persisted in the denial of Resurrection.

***48. "And also our forefathers?"***  
***49. Say: "Indeed, those of old, and those of later times,***  
***50. "All shall certainly be gathered together on an appointed Day.***

Addressed to the Noble Prophet of Islam (S), the blessed Verses in
question say unto him that the former and the later generations of them
from amongst their forefathers to their last generation see the light in
this world and they shall all get together on an appointed Day when
shall meet one another and the records of their deeds shall be
investigated.

The Arabic word miqat ("meeting place") is cognate with waqt denoting a
certain time appointed for carrying out something and it herein connotes
the appointed time for Resurrection, in which all mankind shall meet so
that their records of deeds be investigated.

The word miqat is also applied to a certain place appointed for carrying
out something, like those of pilgrimage to Mecca where pilgrims put on
their pilgrimage garbs (ihram). The blessed Verses in question clearly
reflect that all mankind shall be resurrected on the same day and the
same is also attested in other Qur’anic Verses.

It goes without saying that the appointed time of Resurrection is only
known by God Almighty and others, even His Messengers (as) and
archangels nearest unto Him, are unaware of it.

***51. "Then moreover, indeed you the erring deniers!***  
***52. "You indeed shall eat of the tree of Zaqqum.***  
***53. "Then you shall fill your bellies therewith.***

Proceeding with the enumeration of the chastisements of the people on
the Left Hand, the blessed Verses 51-53 address them saying:

"Then, O erring deniers! You shall eat of the tree of Zaqqum filling
your bellies by it."

The preceding Verses just treated of the dwelling place of the people on
the Left Hand in Hell, but the blessed Verses in question deal with
their food. In this respect, they stand in contrast to those nearest
unto Divine Threshold and the people on the Right Hand.

It is worthy of note that the phrase

***"the erring deniers"***

mentioned in the blessed Verse 51 is applied to those who besides erring
they are obdurate against Truth and persist in their error. As mentioned
above, Zaqqum is a bitter, foul of smell and taste, whose juice is
inflammatory. It is at times applied to any disgusting food given to the
people of Hell.[^2]

The clause:

***"Then you shall fill your bellies therewith"***

reflects that they shall be so hungry that they devour such disgusting
food and fill up their bellies with it.

***54. "And drink boiling water on top of it.***  
***55. "And you shall drink it like thirsty camels!"***  
***56. That shall be their preliminary entertainment on the Day of
Resurrection!***

The blessed Verses in question are saying that when they eat the
disgusting food, they become thirsty. But, what shall their drink be?
The blessed Qur’anic Verses reflect that they shall drink boiling water
on top of the disgusting food such that they are likened to thirsty
camels suffering from dropsy or edema. Camels afflicted with the disease
get so thirsty and drink so much water that they perish.

This is the fate of the erring and the deniers on the Day of
Resurrection. The Arabic word hamim denotes very hot and boiling water.
The Arabic phrase wali hamim is applied to a very intimate friend.

The word hammam ("bathroom") is a cognate of the same. The word him is
applied to burning thirst or dropsy with which camels may be afflicted.
Some Qur’anic exegetes maintain that the word is applied to sandy
deserts absorbing water even in large quantities.

The blessed Verse 56 makes another reference to the food and drink in
question saying that they shall be their means of entertainment. Au
contraire, the people on the Right Hand rest in very pleasant shades and
eat of the best fruits and drink of sweet spring water and pure wine and
are absorbed in Divine Love.

Thus, there shall be a great difference between the twain groups. The
Arabic word nuzul is applied to the preliminary entertainment provided
for the company who are ad hoc disbelievers and further excruciating
torments shall be in store for them.

Thus, God Almighty is Just and His Chastisements are Fair. All hardships
are the consequences of deeds and that Day shall be the Day of
Recompense and Reward.

***57. We created you then why do you believe not?***

Creator?***  
***60. We have decreed death to you all, and We are not
outstripped.***  
***61. To transfigure you and create you in forms that you know not.***

Resuming the treatment of deniers of Resurrection, the blessed Verses in
question deal with the arguments substantiating Resurrection. Such
arguments strengthen the pillars of faith and belief in Resurrection and
ensure man of the Divine Promises concerning those nearest unto Divine
Threshold, the people on the Right Hand, and the people on the Left
Hand.

They open with saying that God Almighty created you. Why do you not
believe in recreation? Why are you surprised on Resurrection and
physical raising of the dead after having been turned to dust? Did He
not create you from earth? Why do you deny it?

The argument is like the one attested elsewhere in the Glorious
Qur’an[^3] saying:

***"And he puts forth for Us a parable and forgets his own creation. He
says: "Who will give life to these bones after they are rotten and have
turned into dust?" Say: "He shall give life to them Who created them for
the first time! And He is the Omniscient of every creation!"***

The blessed Verses 58 and 59 read:

***"Have you seen what is emitted into wombs? Is it you who create it in
the form of man [through different embryonic stages], or are We the
Creator [Who each and every day turns the insignificant and worthless
semen into a new form and recreate everything]?"***

Do you cause all these astonishing developments perplexing all thinkers
or is it God Almighty Who causes them? Is the He Who is All-Able to
Recreate everything unable to raise the dead on the Day of Resurrection?

Furthermore, taking into account the findings of modern scientists
concerning this seemingly insignificant drop, it becomes manifest that
it is a combination of male sperm and female ovum. Sperm constitutes
microscopic cells and two to five hundred million spermatozoa, as large
as the population of a number of countries, upon each ejaculation.[^4]

It is a source of surprise that such microscopic cell grows with an
astounding speed following its intermingling with ovum and makes human
cells. Although all the cells are seemingly alike, but they immediately
divide and form the heart, the limbs, the ears and eyes and each of them
move to its particular place.

In short, semen undergoes drastic development in the embryonic stage
until the infant sees the light. All these developments occur in the
light of constant Divine Creatorship. It is worthy of note that the form
of human beings is simply made through the ejaculation of semen into
womb. Is it not a manifest argument for Resurrection substantiating that
Divine Omnipotence shall raise the dead?

The blessed Verse 60 is saying that God Almighty decreed death to all
and He is not outstripped by anyone. He shall never be vanquished.
Decreeing death does not mean that He cannot bestow everlasting life.

Consequently, the blessed Verse 61 is saying that decreeing death aims
at taking away some of you and substituting you with others and finally
at recreating you in another world unknown to you. Thus, the law of
death clearly reflects that the world is a passage rather than a
permanent abode. It is like a bridge rather than the destination, since
had it been the destination, it would have been intransient.

In short, based on these blessed Verses, one may draw three conclusions.
Firstly, the creation and emergence of human beings and all the world of
existence is dependent upon Divine Omnipotence and he is outstripped by
no one. Secondly, human survival and life span are dependent upon Divine
Will. Thirdly, God Almighty Who created you out of nothing is All-Able
to turn you into those like you.

It may intend to say that God Almighty is All-Able to make you perish
and recreate human beings like you. It may also indicate that He is
Omnipotent to turn you into beings upon Resurrection of whom you are
unaware. In other words, God Almighty is All-Able to make you appear in
your own dispositions and characters.

The last justification rests on the blessed Qur’anic Verse:

***"And We make you in forms of which you are unaware"***

and also many traditions reflecting that mankind shall enter the Plain
of Resurrection in the forms of their deeds.

Surah al-Waqi‘a - Verse 62
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْتُمُ النَّشْأةَ الْاُولَی فَلَوْلَآ تَذكَّرُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***62. And indeed, you have already known the first form of creation:
why then do you not believe in recreation?***

The blessed Verse 62 reminds man that he was created in this world and
proceeded through the course of all the developments of creation from
the time that he was a drop of semen to the last stage of development.
He proceeded through all the stages constantly from potentiality into
actuality and from deficiency to perfection.

Man comprehends through experiments and his experience that each and
every being proceeds on the path toward perfection such that they may
attaint to the goal of their creation. Now, why does he not acknowledge
that as the noblest of creatures, he is supposed to proceed on the path
of perfection to attain a certain goal?

It is evident that man may not attain to his final goal without another
creation such that he may attain to his last actuality and the final
goal of his existence. Failing to attain to such final goal, his
creation as well as that of the world which is created for his
perfection will be of no avail and the Absolutely All-Wise Creator may
never act unwisely.

Thus, it shall be on Resurrection that each and every being shall attain
to its final goal, perfection, actuality. Thus, man shall see the
Recompense of his deeds and shall find everlasting life.

***63. Have you ever thought about what you have sown in the
ground?***  
***64. Is it you that make it grow, or are We the Grower?***  
***65. Were it Our Will, We could crumble it to dry pieces and you would
be left in perplexity.***  
***66. Such that you say "Indeed, we are verily losers!***  
***67. "Nay, but we are deprived and unfortunate."***

The blessed Verses in question as well as the following ones refer to
three arguments each of which bear testimony to Divine Omnipotence in
human life: creation of seeds, water, and fire as the three pillars of
human life.

Seeds of crops constitute the most important elements of nutrition;
water is the most important drink; fire is the most important means for
the preparation of food and carrying out other life issue.

Thus, the blessed Verse 63 asks:

"What you ever thought about what you sow in the ground?"

The blessed Verse 64 further asks:

"Do you make it grow or We make it grow?"

It would be of interest to notice that the verbal form tahruthun ("you
sow seeds") derives from h-r-th "sow seeds and preparing them for
growth" but the verbal form tazra‘un ("you cultivate") is from the root
z-r-‘ ("to cultivate, to farm"). It is evident that man only sows but
God Almighty is He Who makes the seeds grow.

In this vein, a tradition is narrated from the Noble Prophet (S),
saying:

*"Do not say that you cultivated, but say that you sowed, since God
Almighty is the True Cultivator."*[^5]

The reason is that man's role in the process of agriculture is like that
of his in the process of procreation, namely he solely throws seeds or
ejaculates semen and It is God Almighty Who causes the growth of a
microscopic cell in favorable conditions. The seed uses the nutritive
elements available in it, sprouts, and develops roots; then it uses the
nutritive elements in the soil with an astounding speed.

The enormous laboratory of the plant functions and makes the stems,
leaves, and clusters and at times one single seed engenders hundreds or
even thousands of seeds. Scientists maintain that such laboratory is far
more sophisticated and perplexing than those used in a highly developed
industrial city with its numerous factories. Now, God Almighty Who
created such system through His Omnipotence is also All-Able to raise
the dead.

The blessed Verse 65 is saying:

***"Were it Our Will, We could crumble it to dry pieces and you would be
left in perplexity."***

God Almighty is All-Able to cause venomous winds blow onto seeds such
that they nip them in the bud or afflict them with other blights, like
locusts. He may even cause lightning destroy them such that a bunch of
withered pieces may remain. Then, you will be perplexed and regretful.

Now, were you the true cultivators, such things would have never
happened. Therefore, you should know that such Blessings spring from
another source.

The Arabic word hutam, deriving from h-t-m, originally denotes "breaking
something" but it is often applied to breaking dried up things, like
rotten bones or withered stems. The word herein connotes "hay."

Some Qur’anic exegetes also maintain that the word may ad hoc connote
rotting of seeds underneath the earth and thus impeding them from
growth.[^6]

The Arabic verbal form tafakkahun ("you are left in perplexity") is a
cognate of fakiha ("fruit") and fukaha ("witticism; jokes [as the fruit
of friendly assemblies]") derives from f-k-h which is at times, as in
the blessed Verse in question, employed in the sense of "to be
perplexed."

The blessed Verses 66 and 67 read:

"You are astounded saying that you are verily losers. But we are totally
deprived and unfortunate."

Were you the true cultivators, would you have the same fate? Such
instances clearly reflect that He is the One Who makes an insignificant
seed grow into a fresh plant which may engender hundreds or even
thousands of seeds. Such plants are the food for men and their leaves,
stems, and branches are fodder; even their roots and other parts may be
used as herbs in curing different ailments.

***68. Have you thought about the water that you drink.***  
***69. Is it you who cause it from the rain clouds to come down, or are
We the Causer of it to come down?***  
***70. If We willed, We indeed could make it salt: why then do you not
give thanks?***

These blessed Verses further treat of Resurrection reflecting Divine
Omnipotence over everything including raising of the dead.

The blessed Verse 68 asks:

***"Have you thought about the water that you drink?"***

The blessed Verse 69 poses the question:

***"Is it you who cause it from the rain clouds to come down, or are We
the Causer of it to come down?"***

The Arabic word muzn denotes white rain cloud. The Arabic word ujaj is
applied to salty and bitter water. These Verses make human conscience
encounter a series of questions and make them acknowledge Divine
Omnipotence. The blessed Verse 68 is asking men that have they ever
thought about the water as their means of subsistence.

Who is commanding the sun to shine upon the face of oceans, purify salty
and bitter water and make it into pure and sweet water and evaporate it?
Who commands vapors to condense into rain? Who commands winds to move
clouds and send them over scorched and dead lands?

Who has made higher strata of atmosphere to lose the capacity to absorb
the vapor when it is cold as a consequence of which vapors turn into
rain drops descending unfalteringly upon lands? If the sun ceases to
shine for one year, winds cease to blow, higher strata of atmosphere
keep vapors, and the heaven fails to send down rain, you shall die of
thirst and your animals, gardens, and farms shall die.

God Almighty who is All-Able to bestow such blessings easily upon you
through such means shall be Omnipotent to raise the dead like the dead
lands which are rejuvenated through absorption of rain. All these
instances reflect Divine Unity and Glory.

How is it that you do not show gratitude for Divine Blessings? Had He
willed, he would have allowed aquatic mineral to evaporate into the
heaven to form salty and bitter rain clouds raining bitter brine like
sea water, but it is through His Divine Omnipotence that he does not
allow minerals as well as noxious microbes to evaporate onto the heaven
thus polluting rain drops.

Consequently, if the air happens to be free from pollution, rain water
is the purest and sweetest water.

It is also worthy of attention that the Noble Prophet (S) when desiring
to drink water said:

*"Praise be to the Lord Who through His Graciousness, made pure and
sweet water available to us without making available bitter and salty
water unto us."*[^7]

Grower?***  
***73. We have made it a Reminder [of Hellfire] and an article of use
for the travelers.***  
***74. Then, glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most
Glorified.***

The blessed Verses in question treat of the last argument presented for
the acknowledgement of Resurrection. It is the creation of fire which is
the most significant means of human life and the most effective means in
all industries.

The blessed Verse 71 is asking:

"Have you ever thought about the fire which you kindle? Have you created
the trees wherewith you kindle fire or We have created them?”

The Arabic verbal form tawrun

***("you kindle")***

is cognate with wara and ira’ denoting "covering" and connoting the fire
potential in the means of making fire which appears through sparkling.
It is worthy of note that today we make use of matches, lighters, and
the like to make fire but formerly iron and flint were used for making
fire.

Arabs of Hijaz used two trees growing in deserts named murkh and ‘affar
for kindling fire such that the former was placed underneath and the
latter was struck against it and they sparkled like flint stones.

Some Qur’anic exegetes maintain that the blessed Verses in question
reflect Divine Omnipotence by saying that it is through His Will that
fire is potentially existent in the wood of such trees as He created
fire in the "green tree" (shajar akhdhar) despite the fact that trees
live by water.

God Almighty Who created fire and water beside each other or even one in
the other. Then, why do you say that He cannot raise the dead on the Day
of Resurrection?

The blessed Verse 73 further adds:

***"We have made it a Reminder [of Hellfire] and an article of use for
the travelers."***

Emergence of fire from green trees reminds raising of the dead on the
Day of Resurrection on the one hand and fire serves as a reminder for
Hellfire on the other; as it is narrated from the Noble Prophet (S):

***"The fire which you kindle***

*is one part of the seventy parts of Hellfire."*[^8]

Finally, fire is one of the most significant discoveries in making which
God Almighty makes all the contributions and human contributions are
quite insignificant. Furthermore, it was through the discovery of fire
that man entered another phase of civilization. The Glorious Qur’an
tersely alludes to all these truths by such brief clause.

It is also worthy of note that the immaterial benefit of fire, namely
reminding man of Hellfire and the Day of Resurrection, precedes the
material use of the same, since the former bears further significance
and plays the fundamental role in this respect.

The blessed Verse 74 draws a conclusion by saying:

***"Then, glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most
Glorified."***

God Almighty, the Creator of all these Blessings each of which serve as
a reminder of Resurrection and Divine Unity, Omnipotence, and Greatness,
deserves to be praised and glorified of any defect and fault. He is the
Lord and the Greatest, the All-Mighty, the Omnipotent. The blessed Verse
seemingly addresses the Noble Prophet (S), but it actually addresses all
mankind.

It would be of interest to make mention of three meaningful traditions
regarding the blessed Verses narrated from the Noble Prophet (S) and the
Commander of the Faithful, Imam ‘Ali (as).

1. According to Tafsir Ruh al-Ma‘ani, it is narrated from Imam ‘Ali (as)
that one night when he was establishing his prayer reciting Surah
al-Waqi‘a, he came unto the blessed Verses:

***"Have you seen what is emitted into wombs? Is it you who create it in
the form of man, or are We the Creator?"***

he said thrice:

*"Yes, You are the Creator of man, O Lord!"*

When he came unto the blessed Verse:

***"Is it you that make it grow, or are We the Grower?"***

he said thrice:

*"Yes, You are the Tue Cultivator, O Lord!"*

When he came unto the blessed Verse:

***"Is it you who cause it from the rain clouds to come down, or are We
the Causer of it to come down?"***

he said thrice:

*"Yes, You are the One Who send down rain from clouds, O Lord!"*[^9]

The tradition reflects that man is supposed to provide positive replies
against the rhetorical questions attested in the Glorious Qur’an, as if
God Almighty is speaking unto him. The, he is supposed to rejuvenate its
truth in his soul and refrain from reciting Qur’anic Verses without
paying attention to their significance.

2. It is narrated from the Noble Prophet (S):

*"Never withhold your available extra water, pasture, and water from
Allah's servants since God Almighty has placed it at the disposal of
travelers and the needy."*[^10]

3. It is narrated from the Noble Prophet (S) that upon the Revelation of
the blessed Verse:

***"Then, glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most
Glorified"***

he said

*"Use it as your formula of genuflexion (ruku‘) in establishing your
prayers,"*

namely say:

*"Glorified and Praised is my Great Lord" (subhan rabbi al-a‘la wa
bi-hamdih).*

***75. Therefore, I swear by the place of the stars and their places of
rising and setting.***  
***76. And indeed that is a great oath, if you but know.***  
***77. That is verily an Honorable Qur’an.***  
***78. Which is in the well-preserved Tablet.***

The blessed Verses in question treat of the significance of the Glorious
Qur’an, since the questions of Prophethood and Revelation of the Holy
Qur’an, in terms of doctrinal fundamentals, stand second in significance
to the questions of Creation and Resurrection. Furthermore, the Holy
Qur’an treats of profound discussions in the domains of the principles
of Divine Unity and Resurrection thereby it forms the solid bases of the
same.

The blessed Verses in this series open with a great oath, saying:

***"Therefore, I swear by the place of the stars and their places of
rising and setting."***

The majority of Qur’an exegetes maintain that the Arabic particle la is
herein employed in the sense of an emphatic particle rather than the
negative particle, as it is attested in other blessed Qur’anic Verses
regarding oaths taken to the Day of Resurrection, the concupiscent soul,
the Lord of easts and wests, and the like.

It is worthy of note that the Arabic phrase mawaqi‘ al-nujum designates
the resting place and motion of stars, since the oath taken to the
course of celestial bodies is far more significant than that taken to
them per se, as the greatness and vastness of the places of rest for
stars are thousands times more than planets.

Today, it is known to us that each of the stars has its own fixed place
and their orbits are determined and precisely calculated by the law of
gravity and repellence and the velocity of their courses is determined
by a specific order.

Although it is not possible to make precise calculations regarding
remote planets, but the same is quite possible regarding the celestial
bodies of the solar system and the order of their orbits is astoundingly
precise.

Paying attention to the fact that according to scientists, there exist
approximately one thousand million stars and planets in our galaxy and
the fact that there are many galaxies in the world each of which follow
a certain course, the significance of this Qur’anic oath is further
clarified.

Astronomers maintain (and it is reflected in the Book of Allah and
tradition sources) that these celestial bodies, whose number exceeds
billions and solely some of which are visible and may be photographed by
using astronomical equipment like telescopes, all move in their specific
orbits and they may not transgress the gravitation of others and cause
collisions.

Such scientific discoveries further clarify the significance of the
aforesaid oath.

Thus, the Holy Qur’an proceeds to say that

***"and indeed that is a great oath, if you but know."***

The Arabic verbal form law ta‘lamun ("if you know") clearly reflects
that human knowledge at that time failed to fully comprehend the fact in
question and it is regarded as one of the scientific miracles of the
Holy Qur’an, since at that time some people still considered stars as
silver nails driven into the firmament.

Thus, such expression is that milieu which is termed the age of
ignorance is quite extraordinary.

Now let us turn to the reason lying behind such great oath. The reason
is to be found in the blessed Verse 77:

***"That is verily an Honorable Qur’an."***

Thus, obdurate polytheists persisting in believing that such blessed
Verses were a kind of soothsaying and they sprang from madness, or they
had been inspired by devils as they thought that poets at the time were
thus inspired, but the Holy Qur’an is saying that the blessed Verses are
Divine Revelation reflecting greatness and originality and their
contents indicate that they are Revealed by God Almighty.

It is quite evident and one is needless to provide arguments for the
same. The Attribute karim employed for the Glorious Qur’an refers to God
Almighty, the Most Generous and the Most Benevolent and the same
attribute also designates a human virtue.

The Arabic word also reflects the great merits of the Holy Qura’n and
its eloquence and rhetorical figures as well as its interesting
contents; since it is revealed by the Lord Who is the Origin of
perfection and beauty. God Almighty is the Origin of the Revelation as
well as the Goal of the Holy Qur’an.

The blessed Verse 78 treats of the Attributes of the Holy Qur’an,
saying:

***"Which is in the well-preserved Tablet."***

The point is that Divine Omniscience is free from any error or
alteration and it is evident that such Book originating from such
Sublime Source whose original version is in the well-preserved Tablet is
far from any error and alteration.

***79. Which none can touch but the purified.***  
***80. A Revelation from the Lord of the worlds.***  
***81. Do you regard the Word, the Holy Qur’an possessing the aforesaid
Attributes insignificant?***  
***82. And instead of thanking Allah for the provisions He gives you,
you deny it?***

The blessed Verse 79 treats of the third Attribute of the Holy Qur’an,
saying:

***"Which none can touch but the purified.”***

Following traditions narrated by the Infallible Imams (as), many Qur’an
exegetes maintain that the Holy Qur’an may not be touched by the impure,
namely those who have not performed the minor and major ritual ablutions
(wudhu, ghusl).

However, some others hold that the blessed Verse refers to the pure
angels who know the Holy Qur’an or served as intermediaries of
Revelation conveying the Divine Message to the Noble Prophet's (S)
heart. It stands in contrast to the polytheists' belief as per which
such words were inspired by devils.

Some exegetes also believe that the sublime truths and meanings of the
Holy Qur’an may solely be comprehended by the pure, as it is reflected
elsewhere in the Holy Qur’an[^11]:

***"This is the Book whereof there is no doubt, a Guidance to the God
fearing."***

In other words, possession of minimum purity required for the spirit of
truth seeking is needed for the minimum comprehension of its meanings.
The purer one becomes, the more one may understand the meanings and the
contents of the Holy Qur’an.

It is worthy of note, however, that the three exegeses are not
inconsistent and the contextual meaning of the blessed Verse may reflect
all the three exegeses.

According to the traditions narrated from Ahl al-Bayt, Imam ‘Ali ibn
Musa al-Ridha (as) is quoted as saying:

*"Do not touch the Holy Qur’an without having performed the minor and
major ablution (wudhu, ghusl) as God Almighty says:*

***'None but the pure touch it.'"***[^12]

Similar traditions have been narrated from Imam Baqir (as) and Imam
Sadiq (as) with minor alterations.[^13]

Similar traditions are attested in Sunni sources amongst which mention
may be made of the tradition recurrently narrated from the Noble Prophet
(S):

*"None but the pure may touch the Holy Qur’an."*[^14]

A tradition is narrated from the Noble Prophet (S) on the authority of
Ibn ‘Abbas concerning spiritual touch:

*"The Holy Qur’an is in the Concealed Book [the Preserved Tablet]
recorded on pure pages and none but the pure, namely those nearest unto
Divine Threshold, may touch it."*[^15]

The point stands to reason as well since although the Holy Qur’an has
been revealed for guiding all mankind and we know that there were many
people who heard the Noble Prophet (S) recite Qur’anic Verses and had
access to the pure water of truth springing from the fountainhead of
Revelation, but they were preoccupied with bias, obduracy, and enmity as
a consequence of which they could not benefit from it in the least.

However, those who purified their selves and turned to Divine Revelation
through their truth seeking attitude, attained to Guidance. Thus, the
more one purifies himself and fear God Almighty, the more they
comprehend more profound meanings of the Holy Qur’an. Thus, the blessed
Verse in question applies to both material and spiritual dimensions.

It goes without saying that the Noble Prophet (S), the Infallible Imams
(as) and the Archangels nearest unto Divine Threshold are nearest to God
Almighty and further comprehend the Qur’anic truths, since they are the
treasures of Divine Secrets and the Trust of Divine Light and they are
the interpreters and expounders of the Holy Qur’an and eminent scholars
who have attained to the purity and knowledge emanating from the Light
of Divine Guardianship according to their capacities stand second to
them in the interpretation and exposition of Qur’anic knowledge and
learning.

The blessed Verses 80 and 81 treat of the last Attribute of the Holy
Qur’an saying that it is revealed by the Lord of the worlds, the Lord
and Fosterer of all the inhabitants of the worlds. The Holy Qur’an was
revealed to His Noble Prophet's (S) heart for the Guidance of mankind,
such that as He is the Owner and Fosterer of the world of existence, all
legislation is from Divine Source.

The blessed Verse 81 is asking whether disbelievers underestimate the
Holy Qur’an possessing the said Attributes, whereas the tokens of its
Veracity and Truth are crystal clear. Divine Word is supposed to be
acknowledged with utmost seriousness and encounter the same as a great
reality.

***"This word"***

(hadha al-hadith) refers to the Holy Qur’an and the Arabic verbal form
mudhinun ("you underestimate") derives from dahn denoting "oil," since
it is used for softening the body or other things.

The Arabic gerund idhan denotes toleration and gentility and at times
the same connotes softness and lack of serious encounter. Since liars
and hypocrites are often mild in their disposition, the word may connote
denial and belying and both meanings are possible for the blessed Verse
in question.

The blessed Verse 82 is saying that disbelievers, instead of showing
gratitude for Divine Blessings, particularly the great Blessing of the
Revelation of the Holy Qur’an, they deny it. Some Qur’an exegetes
maintain that the blessed Verse intends to say that their share of the
Holy Qur’an is denying it or that they make use of such denial to earn
their sustenance.

However, the former exegesis is further consistent with the preceding
blessed Verses. It may also mean that the Holy Qur’an is their spiritual
sustenance and it may rejuvenate their hearts and by attending to its
blessed Verses they may strengthen their hearts and their souls, but
owing to their denial and enmity, they deprive themselves of it.[^16]

***83. Then why do you not intervene when the soul of a dying person
reaches the throat?***  
***84. And you at the moment are looking on,***  
***85. But We are nearer unto him than you, but you see not,***  
***86. Then why do you not, if you are exempt from the reckoning and
recompense***  
***87. Bring back the soul if you are truthful?***

The last moments of life preoccupies man with serious thoughts, when
nothing may be done to bring the person back to normal life conditions,
when the people surrounding the dying person desperately look at them
and see that they are dying like a burnt out candle bidding farewell to
life and no one may do anything to restore their life.

Human weakness is reflected in such moments. Despite modern
sophisticated technical and medical equipment, such weakness is evident
like former times. To draw a conclusion out of the preceding discussions
on Resurrection and providing replies to liars and deniers, the Holy
Qur’an provides a telling depiction of the last moments, saying:

"Then why do you not intervene when the soul of a dying person reaches
the throat? And you at the moment are looking on".

The people surrounding the dying person are herein addressed. While
looking at the dying person, they see that they cannot do anything, but
notice that life and death are dependent upon Divine Will and they know
that the same fate is in store for all of them.

The blessed Verse 85 is saying that We are nearest unto him than you and
Our angels, prepared to take his life, are also nearest unto him then
you, but you fail to see;

***("But We are nearer unto him than you, but you see not").***

We are fully aware of what is happening in the soul and the perturbed
depth of his being as We have decreed that his life be taken at an
appointed time, but you see him outwardly unaware of the manner of his
departure for the other world and the violent tempests of that time.
Thus, the blessed Verse reflects that God Almighty is Nearer unto the
dying person.

Nonetheless, some Qur’an exegetes maintain that the blessed Verse may
reflect that the angels responsible for taking the life of the dying
person are here being intended. However, the former exegesis is further
consistent with the literal meaning of the blessed Verse. It is worthy
of note that God Almighty is Nearest unto us than anyone else, not only
at the time of dying, but at all times.

He is even Nearer unto us then ourselves, but we are far from Him owing
to our ignorance. Above all, the point in question is quite manifest at
the time of dying. It goes without saying that being near to God
Almighty or being far away from Him is spiritual rather than spatial or
temporal. It is like nearness to or remoteness from the Friends of God
Almighty in common usage of the term.

However, nearness unto God Almighty entails a more sublime significance
solely intelligible to

***"those deeply rooted in knowledge"***

(rasikhun fi al-‘ilm), namely the Ahl al-Bayt.[^17]

The blessed Verses 86 and 87 further emphasize and expound the same
truth by saying that if you shall never be recompensed for your deeds,
then bring him back if you are truthful. Your failure to carry out the
same reflects that you have no authority over life and death, but it is
God Almighty Who rewards and chastises you for your deeds and He is the
One who causes death and gives life.

It is worthy of note that the Arabic word madinin is the oblique plural
form of madin which is cognate with dayn ("recompense").

In short, the blessed Verses in question are addressed to deniers of
Divine Origin and Resurrection warning them that you imagine that you
may do anything, but when the soul of the dying person is at his throat,
you notice that you may not do anything to bring him back to life.

Then We are Nearer to him than you, but you do not comprehend the manner
by which We take his soul, whereas you have not authority over warding
off death and keeping your beloved alive.

***88. Then, if he [the dying person] be of those brought near unto
Allah,***  
***89. [There is for him] rest and Mercy and a Garden abounding in
Blessings.***

The blessed Verses 88 and 89 sum up the points discussed in the
preceding blessed Verses, thus depicting the differences between human
dispositions at the time of death reflecting that some people pass away
with utmost serenity, peace of mind, and happiness, whereas some others
depart the mundane world with anxiety and horror when they see Hellfire
from afar.

The blessed Verses are saying that if the dying person happens to be one
of those nearest unto Divine Threshold, he shall leave this world with
utmost peace and serenity since they know that they shall abide in
Paradise which abounds in Divine Blessings. According to lexicologists,
the Arabic word rawh originally designates breathing.

The word rayhan denotes sweet scented plant or something else. However,
the word connotes the cause of life and peace and in this context the
world is applied to Blessings. Thus, the words rawh and rayhan connote
all Blessings and the means of human comfort and peace.

In other words, it may be said that the former alludes to all the things
which rescues man from hardships such that he may feel peace and
comfort. In contrast to the former, the latter refers to the Blessings
granted to man following hardships and vicissitudes. Muslim exegetes
present different meanings for the twain terms, but since the number of
such interpretations amounts to ten, they are not mentioned for the sake
of brevity.

However, they are all applications of the general and comprehensive
meanings mentioned under the exegesis of the blessed Verse in question.

It is also worthy of note that following making reference to rawh and
rayhan, mention is made of janna na‘im ("Paradise abounding in
Blessings") which may reflect that rawh and rayhan shall be bestowed
upon the believers at the time of death, in the grave, in purgatory, and
in Paradise.

Regarding the blessed Verse in question, a tradition is narrated from
Imam Sadiq (as) according to which if the dying person happens to be one
of those nearest unto Divine Threshold, rawh and rayhan shall be
bestowed upon him in the grave and Paradise abounding in Blessings,
namely in the Hereafter.[^18]

***90. And if he [the dying person] be of those on the Right Hand,***  
***91. Then, it shall said unto him: "Peace be unto you from your
friends who are from those on the Right Hand."***

The twain blessed Verses in discussion is saying that if he happens to
be from the second group, those on the Right Hand, namely righteous good
doing men and women whose records of deeds shall be given unto their
right hands, symbolizing their victory and being admitted unto their
everlasting abode, thus they shall be addressed:

***"Peace unto you from your friends who are from those on the Right
Hand."***

Thus, the angels responsible for taking lives, convey the message of
peace unto them from their friends.

The same idea is reflected in the blessed Verse 26 of the same Chapter:

***"But only the saying of peace, peace!"***

The blessed Verse may as well reflect the saying of peace by angels:

***"Peace unto you! O you who are from those on the Right Hand!"***

In other words, they are saying that you are so honorable as you are one
of those on the Right Hand.

In short, the expression of

***"peace"***

uttered by angels or those on the Right Hand reflects rawh and rayhan
and any kind of peace, serenity, and Blessing.

However, some Qur’anic exegetes maintain that the contextual meaning of
the blessed Verse is:

***"O you who are from those on the Right Hand! Peace unto you since you
are saved from Divine torment."***[^19]

Surah al-Waqi‘a - Verses 92-96

***94. Then, it shall be his fate to enter Hellfire.***  
***95. Indeed, this is an absolute Truth with certainty.***  
***96. Therefore, glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most
Great.***

In the first three blessed Verses in question, mention is made of the
third group, aforementioned as ashab shamal:

***("those on the Left Hand"),***

saying:

"If he happens to be of the erring deniers, then for him is an
entertainment with boiling water and venomous winds. Then it shall be
his fate to enter Hellfire."

In other words, they taste Divine torments at the threshold of death.
They experience the bitter taste of the chastisements of Resurrection in
the graves and purgatory. Since the blessed Verses treat of the
disposition of the dying person, the phrase:

***"an entertainment with boiling water"***

(nuzulu min hamim) refers to torments in Hell, whereas:

***"it shall be his fate to enter Hellfire"***

(tasliyatu jahim) alludes to torments on the Day of Resurrection. The
same significance is also attested in numerous traditions narrated from
the Ahl al-Bayt (as).[^20]

It is also worthy of note that

***"the erring deniers"***

(mukadhdhibin al-dhalin) are mentioned together; "the erring" refers to
those who have deviated from the Straight Path, whereas "the deniers"
alludes to denying Resurrection, Divine Unity, and the Prophethood of
the Noble Prophet (S).

Such emphatic expression may also reflect that those in error may
include the oppressed, and the defaulters who entertain neither enmity
nor obduracy against the Truth and Divine Favors may be bestowed upon
them.[^21] In contrast, obdurate deniers shall have the aforesaid fate.
It is also worthy of note that the Arabic word hamim connotes boiling
water or hot and venomous winds and the word tasliya denotes burning and
entering fire.

The blessed Verses 95 and 96 are saying:

***"Indeed, this is an absolute Truth with certainty. Therefore, glorify
with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great."***

Qur’an exegetes maintain that truth of certainty ("haqq al-yaqin") is
appositive genitive, connoting that what was said about the three
groups, those nearest unto Divine Threshold, those on the Right Hand,
and the deniers is absolute truth and one of certainty.

It is also possible that since there are degrees as to certainty, the
most sublime of which is truth of certainty, namely the true, perfect
and undoubted certainty.

It is also noteworthy that the demonstrative pronoun:

***"this"***

(hadha) herein makes a reference to the states of the three
aforementioned groups. Some Qur’an exegetes also maintain that the
antecedent of the demonstrative pronoun is the entirety of the contents
of the blessed Chapter in question or that of the Holy Qur’an. However,
the former interpretation sounds more consistent with the meaning of the
blessed Verse in question.

Another noteworthy point is that the verbal form fasabbih

***("then glorify")***

with the ramification (tafri‘) particle fa’ alludes to the truth that
what was said above regarding the three groups is absolute justice.

Thus, man is required to glorify his Lord of any injustice. It may also
connote that if man intends to avoid the fate of the third group, he is
supposed to glorify God Almighty of associating any partners with Him or
ascribing injustice to Him which entails denial of Resurrection.

Finally, in their exegesis on the last blessed Verse, many Qur’an
exegetes maintain that following the Revelation of the blessed Verse,
the Noble Prophet (S) said:

*"Recite it in your genuflexions [in your prayers],"*

namely say

*"Praise be unto God, the Greatest, and to His Praise."*

When the blessed Verse 'Glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the
Most Great' he said:

*"Recite it in your prostrations [in your prayers] and say: 'Praise be
unto my Lord, the Most Sublime.'"*[^22]

*O Lord, place us amongst those nearest to Your Threshold, those on the
Right Hand, and Your close friends. Bestow upon us Your Rawh and Rayhan
and Your Paradise abounding in Blessings. Amen! O Lord of the Worlds!*
