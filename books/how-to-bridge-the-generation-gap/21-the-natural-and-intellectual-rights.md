The Natural and Intellectual Rights
===================================

The Father
----------

My child! My purpose of speaking about the religious issues was for you
to become familiar with a sample of the beliefs of you father and
mother, and to become certain that it is not without reasons that they
are fond of religion. Even, if these discussions did not convince you,
and if you still are of your old opinion about them, and should think
your parents are old fashioned and superstitious, this rights, to be
rude to them or to treat them disrespectfully. As the rights of your
parents are natural and intellectual and in any case they are inviolable

Have you not ever heard of a Christian youth by the name of Zakariya who
became Muslim and who went to Medina to Imam As-Sadiq (as) and said to
him:

*“I was a Christian, now I have become Muslim. My father, mother and
entire family are Christians also my mother is blind. Do you see it
advisable for me to stay with them?”*

The Imam (as) said:

*“Certainly, be good to your mother and pay attention to her.”* [^1]

The youth, upon the return to his home town of Kufa, started to render
his services to his mother. And more than ever before, he treated her
with kindness. So much so that it surprised his mother. She inquired
about the reason of his extreme kindness after becoming Muslim. He told
her of the Imam's advice. She was impressed and consequently, she too
accepted Islam.

The Child
---------

Of course the matter of religious beliefs has nothing to do with the
rights of parents. They exist whether the child is in agreement with
parent's principles and beliefs or not.
