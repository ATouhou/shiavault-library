performed in remembrance of the Israelis flight from Egypt or
(Passover). This is one of the most important Christian rites. They

("The Clans": 40) "Mohammad is not the father of any man among you, but
he is the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets...." Also
regarding His book (The Bee: 89) "And We reveal the Scripture unto thee
as an exposition of all things". Also (Cattle: 116) "Perfected is the
Word of thy Lord in truth and Justice. There is naught that can change
His words. He is the Hearer, and Knower". And ("Fusilat": 42) "It is an
unassailable Scripture. Falsehood cannot come at it from before it or
behind it".

86) The term Ijtehad also exist in the school of Ahlu'al bait but does
not have the meaning in practice that the caliphate school gave it:
Because in the Caliphate school it contained the meanings (Exercising
personal opinion) and (giving ones vote) but in the Imamate school it
only means striving to understand God's law, and a Mojtahed never allows
himself to exercise his own personal opinion. Of course as an
explanation of this term in Fundamentalist texts of both schools one
sentence is used. However in practice the Caliphate school allows the
interference in Religious law, the opinions of Scholars and Prophetic
companions other than the infallible. While the Imamate school only
gives validity to the words of and His Messenger.
