Chain of Guidance
=================

It is crystal clear that Imamat is the exclusive right of the Ahle Bait
(a.s.) and anyone who claims this right for himself/themselves is a liar
and an oppressor. There is a well-known tradition from the Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.a.) widely narrated by all scholars and traditionalists in their
books. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) prophesied,
'This nation will have twelve leaders and guides and all of them will
be from the Quraish. The one who leaves them will not harm them.' (i.e.
the one who has distanced himself will be among the losers, because his
death will be that of ignorance).
(Musnad-e-Ahmad b. Hanbal, vol.5, pg. 312)

The tradition of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) clearly highlights that
there will only be twelve Imams till the Day of Judgement and all these
leaders will be from the tribe of Quraish. Within the Quraish, the Imams
will be from Bani Hashim. From the traditions mentioned above we
conclude that after the demise of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) till the
Day of Resurrection, this nation will have twelve Imams and all of them
will be from Bani Hashim.

Regarding the tradition from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) - "I leave
among you two weighty things (Saqalain), the Book of Allah and my
progeny', Hazrat Ali (a.s.) was asked - Who is the progeny? He (a.s.)
replied:

Hasan (a.s.), Husain (a.s.) and the nine Imams (a.s.) from the progeny
of Husain (a.s.), of whom the ninth one will be the Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) and
the Qaim (a.t.f.s.). Neither will they separate from the Book of Allah
nor will the Book of Allah separate from them, till they meet the
Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) at the Pool ofKausar.'
(Kamaluddin, vol.1, pg. 240-241)

Aamir b. Kasir asked Hazrat Ali (a.s.): 0 Ameerul Momineen (a.s.)! You
have made us aware of the guides of disbelief and the caliphs of evil,
now introduce to us the guides of truth and the real guides after you.'
Hazrat Ali (a.s.) informed him, 'Yes, surely it is the promise of the
Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) to me that this religion will have twelve Imams
and leaders, nine of whom will be from the progeny of Husain (a.s.). The
Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) has narrated, 'When I went to the heavens
for Meraj, I saw written on the pillar of the Arsh-

'There is no god except Allah, Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) is His Messenger,
and I have aided him through Ali (a.s.) and I have helped him through
Ali (a.s.)'

And I saw twelve Lights. I asked: 0 My Lord! Whose lights are these ?
The reply was - These lights are of Imams from your progeny.

Then I (Ali (a.s.)) asked:

0 Messenger of Allah, will you not tell me their names?'

The Holy Prophet replied, 'Yes, certainly. You are Imam and Caliph
after me, you will repay my debts and fulfill my promises. After you
will be your two sons, Hasan (a.s.) and Husain (a.s.), and after Husain
(a.s.) will be his son Ali - Zainul Abedeen (a.s.), after All (a.s.)
will be his son Muhammad (a.s.) whose title is Baqir. After Muhammad
(a.s.) will follow his son Jafar (a.s.) whose title is Sadiq.

After Jafar (a.s.), will be his son Moosa (a.s.) whose title is Kazim.
After Moosa (a.s.), will be his son Ali (a.s.) whose title is Reza.
After Ali, his son Muhammad (a.s.) will succeed him and his title is
Zaki. After Muhammad (a.s.) will follow his son Ali (a.s.) whose title
is Naqi. After Ali (a.s.) will come his son Hasan (a.s.) whose title is
Ameen and Askari. After him will be the son of Hasan (a.s.), Qaim
(a.t.f.s.), whose name will be my name and who will bear maximum
similarity with me. He will fill the earth with justice and equity as it
would have been filled with oppression and injustice.'

There isn't just one tradition like this. We find several traditions on
these lines and the number goes up to 20. For instance, Hazrat Ali
(a.s.) recounts from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) who has categorically
stated that from the time of his (s.a.w.a.) death till the Day of
Qiyamat there will only be twelve Imams, and then each has been
mentioned by his name.

The entire arrangement was made so that people would know that Allah
and His Prophet (s.a.w.a.) had already selected the Imams. It was not
that anyone could be an Imam according to the wishes of the Islamic
nation. It was not that an Imam who was supposed to follow his father in
the chain of Imamat,

died in his father's lifetime, leaving the chain of Imamat suspended
until the people appointed the deceased's son as the Imam in his place.
All the above traditions, were narrated when Janabe Ismail b. Jafar
Sadiq was not even bom. The list of Imams (a.s.) narrated by the Holy
Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and Hazrat Ali (a.s.) does not show Janabe Ismail's
name. Therefore, if he was never destined to be an Imam then where does
the question of usurping his Imamat arise?

Another thing that is evident is that the twelve Imams (a.s.)
enumerated in the prophetic tradition mentions the first Imam as Hazrat
Ali (a.s.) and the twelfth and last Imam as Hazrat Wali-e-Asr
(a.t.f.s.), who is the Imam of our time and is alive on this earth today
and is amongst us but we are deprived of his meeting due to our sins and
disobedience.

Asbagh b. Nubata (r.a.) a very reliable companion of Hazrat Ali (a.s.)
narrates, 'I presented myself before Hazrat Ali (a.s.). I saw that he
was engrossed in some thought and marking with his blessed finger on the
earth. I queried, '0 Ameerul Momineen (a.s.)! What is the matter, I find
you today in some perplexity, making signs on the earth, do you love
this earth? He (a.s.) replied:

"I swear by Allah that it is not so. I have never befriended this
world, rather I was reflecting about that son, the eleventh one from my
progeny. He is the Mahdi (a.t.f.s.), who will fill the earth with
justice and equity as it was filled with injustice and tyranny. There is
an occupation for him in which some people will be deviated while others
will be guided.

(Kamaluddin, vol. 1, pg. 288-297, A'laamul Wara, pg. 400)

How clearly Hazrat Ali (a.s.) has described and illuminated the chain
of guidance and Imamat. Who could be more unfortunate and wretched that
despite such a clear and illumined chain of guidance and Imamat, rejects
it for those deviated guides who have usurped Hazrat Ali's (a.s.) right?
Those who have harassed and persecuted Janabe Zehra (s.a.), burned down
her door and waged war against her husband - the rightful Imam and
celebrated on his martyrdom and were the main protagonists of the
incident of Karbala. Their sons killed Imam Husain (a.s.) in Karbala,
they made captives the Ahle Bait (a.s.) and martyred them one after the
other.

Their lives were devoid of Islamic teachings, they opposed the Quranic
commands secretly and publicly, they were steeped in sins and prohibited
acts and abandoned the religious obligations completely. They were
prisoners of their carnal desires and neglected the hereafter and in
this manner deprived themselves of guidance. Then how was it possible
for them to guide others?

Guidance has only one path and that path is the way of Hazrat Ali b.
Abi Talib (a.s.), finally terminating in Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) who is
the Imam today. There is no other path leading to true guidance and
there is no other guarantee for success and happiness in the world and
the hereafter.

We end this discussion with the declaration of Hazrat Ali (a.s.)
inviting everyone to leave aside prejudices and rise above personal
interests, to purify the intellect and consciousness, to decide about
one's own end, lest the coming of the Angel of Death finds us perplexed
and uncertain. Today there is time and tomorrow could be too late. Our
decision will take us either to Paradise or to Hell. Let us not spoil
our hereafter for this fleeting world.

'Observe this world, which you desire, towards which you move with
desire and proximity, which sometimes angers you and at other times
makes you happy. It is neither your actual abode nor the station for
which you were created, nor is it the place towards which you are
invited.'

'Take lesson, for it is not going to remain for you, nor are you in it
forever. If it has beguiled you with its charm then it has also made you
fearful with its wickedness. Do not be influenced by its scare and do
not seek it greedily out of its fear.'

'Advance towards that abode towards which you have been invited and
turn your hearts away from this world. None of you should lament like
maids on deprivation of a thing of this world. Be patient on the
obedience of Allah and wish for the completion of the bounties by
safeguarding that which has been commanded by our Book to be
safeguarded.'

'Pay heed, if you have safeguarded your religious beliefs then loss of
anything of this world will not harm you. And if you have wasted and
destroyed your religion then none of the worldly things, which you have
safeguarded, can bring you any benefit.'

(Nahjul Balagah, Sermon 173, vol. 1, pg. 644, Ansariyan Publications)
May Allah turn our hearts towards truth and give us the blessing of
patience!

absence and must re-affirm our pledge with him.
