Occasion of the Revelation
==========================

VERSE NO.109ِ110

When the verse (S 17:84) revealed saying:ِ \`\`You have not been given
of knowledge but a little.'' A group of the Jews objected saying;
\`\`How can our knowledge be a little, when we do have the
Scriptures!?'' The above verse (NO.109) was sent down to answer that:ِ

Say:ِ \`\`If the sea was all ink for writing the words of God; the sea
would be consumed before the words of my Lord could be finished, even if
We add other seas for that purpose!'' In other word, this is to say; the
story of the Seven Sleepers, that of Moses and Khezr, and of
Zelgharnine, which We related to you in this chapter of the Cave; are
all of no importance compared with the knowledge and power of God.

The Arabic, \`\`KALAMA"T'' which is translated to, \`\`WORDS'' can also
imply any creature or anything that may exist. In Qura"n's literature,
even Jesus Christ has been called the, \`\`Word of Allah''.

The verse implies that, the existence is not limited to what we see or
feel. The creation, and God's power and knowledge has no limit, and
God's knowledge and power is not something other than His creation.
Therefore if we make all the trees that ever existed, into pens, and
turn all the supplies of water into ink, to write the words of God; the
seas and trees would be consumed before the words of God could be
finished. We may also add here that each tree itself, and each drop of
water is also a word of God, by which we intend to write other existing
words. This means that God lives in the realm of infinity in infinite
aspects. What do we know, and what can we know, of such infinite
power!?

Once again the next verse (NO.110) applies to Monotheism, and mentions
the Oneness of God. This is because, monotheism is the most [ 46 ]
important tenet on which God's worship is to be based. If we compare the
religion with a ROSARY; all the principles, and commandments, and ways
of prayers, are comparable to the beads of the rosary, and Monotheism is
the string which binds and holds them together. Another example can be
that, the rules and regulations of religion are like the limbs, parts,
and organs, of human body; and the Oneness of God is the soul of the
body.

The word of purity or Monotheism which is; \`\`LA"-ELA"HA-ELLA-LA"H''
is known to be the firm fence of Allah, and who enters the fence, can
live safe and secure. Therefore, if any one is willing to meet Allah
spiritually, he should do good deeds, and associate no one in the
worship of his Lord. The true worship of God should exclude the worship
of anything or anybody else, be they idols, deified men, or powers of
nature.

**THE COMMENTARY
THE ANSWERED PRAYER OF ZACHARIAS**

VERSE NO.1ِ6

For the abbreviated letters, please see volume one, page 30 of this
book. The chapter of Mary begins with the story of Zacharias who, when
incited and aroused to pray to God by Mary the Virgin, his prayer was
answered.

Zacharias was very sad for having no child; and one day in his sanctum
in the Temple, he privately prayed to God saying:ِ \`\`My Lord! My bones
have been weakened, and my head is inflamed with old age, and I have not
been unanswered in my prayers to you so far. I am anxious about my
kinsfolk after me, and my wife is old and barren. So have Your Mercy on
me and grant me a successor to inherit me and to inherit the posterity
of Jacob.''

**WHAT WAS HIS HERITAGE?**

Zacharias prayed for a successor to inherit him, but it is doubtful
whether he had any wealth or worldly property, so as to be anxious that
who would inherit him. He held a sacred religious mission as a high
priest, and wanted his holy mission to be continued after him by a
successor, and that was the object of his prayer. [ 49 ]

يَا زَكَرِيَّا إِنَّا نُبَشِّرُكَ بِغُلاَم اسْمُهُ يَحْيَى لَمْ
نَجْعَلْ لَّهُ مِنْ قَبْلُ سَمِيّاً(( 7 ))

7- O, ZACHARIAS! WE GIVE YOU THE GOOD NEWS OF HAVING A SON. HIS NAME IS
YAHYA". (JOHN) WE HAVE NOT NAMED HIM SUCH A NAMESAKE IN BEFORE.

قَالَ رَبِّ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لِى غُلاَمٌ وَكَانَتْ امْرَأَتِى عَاقِراً
وَقَدْ بَلَغْتُ مِنْ الْكِبَرِ عِتِيّاً(( 8 ))

8- HE SAID:ِ \`\`MY LORD! HOW CAN THERE BE A SON FOR ME, WHEN MY WIFE
IS BARREN, AND I AM FALLEN OF OLD AGE!?

قَالَ كَذَلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَىَّ هَيِّنٌ وَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ
مِنْ قَبْلُ وَلَمْ تَكُنْ شَيْئاً(( 9 ))

9- HE (THE ANGEL) SAID:ِ \`\`SO SHALL IT BE. YOUR LORD SAID; THAT IS
EASY FOR ME. AND VERILY I CREATED YOU BEFORE AND YOU WERE NOT A
THING!''

قَالَ رَبِّ اجْعَل لِى آيَةً قَالَ آيَتُكَ أَلاَّ تُكَلِّمَ النَّاسَ
ثَلاَثَ لَيَال سَوِيّاً(( 10 ))

10- HE SAID:ِ \`\`MY LORD! MAKE A SIGN (OF THAT) FOR ME.'' HE SAID:ِ
\`\`YOUR SIGN IS THAT, YOU CANNOT SPEAK TO PEOPLE FOR THREE NIGHTS (AND
THREE DAYS) BEING ALL RIGHT!''

فَخَرَجَ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ مِنْ الْمِحْرَابِ فَأَوْحَى إِلَيْهِمْ أَنْ
سَبِّحُوا بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيّاً(( 11 ))

11- THEN HE WENT OUT OF THE SANCTUM TO HIS PEOPLE, (AND BY HINTS)
INSPIRED TO THEM THAT, THEY SHOULD GLORIFY (THEIR LORD) IN THE MORNING
AND IN THE NIGHT. [ 50 ]

**THE COMMENTARY
ZACHARIAS GOT HIS EXPRESSED WISH**

VERSE NO.7ِ11 Allah answered the prayer of His servant Zacharias, and
in spite of his old age and barren wife, gave him a prophet son; and
named him \`\`YAHYA"'', (JOHN) who had not a namesake before. Of course,
it was not a name given for the first time. Perhaps it was the first
among the posterity of Jacob, or among the relative of Zacharias.
Evidently it was the first time that God had named one of His elects,
\`\`YAHYA"''.

The Arabic, \`\`YAHYA"'' for the English version, \`\`JOHN'' suggest
the meaning of giving new life, or to revive and return something to
life again, and it was really so in the case of \`\`JOHN THE BAPTIST''.
He was the forerunner of Jesus who paved the way for him, and with the
help of his father renewed the Message of God which had been perverted
and corrupted by the Israelites.

When Zacharias heard the angelic good news of having such a wonderful
son, he could not see the necessary natural means and preparation for
that curious birth; and therefore asked the angel for a sign from his
Lord, so that he could assure his heart by that:ِ \`\`Everything is
possible for God,'' was the answer, and that, everything was nothing
before its creation by God, and your sign is that you cannot speak to
people for three days, and three night, although you will be sound and
safe, and all right.''

After receiving the glad-tidings, Zacharias went out of his sanctum of
prayer to his people, but he could not speak! So, by hints, and points,
and expressions of head and hands, he inspired to them that, they should
glorify their Lord in the morning and in the night. [ 51 ]

**YAHYA", THE FREE OF ALL SORTS OF VAIN DESIRE**

The name of YAHYA" is found in five points in the Holy Qura"n. He was
one of the Messengers of God, who became a prophet when he was only a
child, having all the necessary wisdom and merits for that attainment.
Like Jesus Christ, he too, did not marry, and suppressed his carnal
desires. JOHN and JESUS were cousins, and it was John who baptized
Jesus. Islamic traditions imply that HAZRAT IMAM HUSSAIN (AS), had some
similarities with John. When he set out from Medina to KARBLA", in
places he repeated saying:ِ

\`\`How worthless is this world in the sight of God, that the head of
YAHYA" was put in a tray, and offered as a present to an unchaste
king!'' And we know that the same thing was done with the sacred head
of, HAZRAT IMAM HUSSAIN (AS).

John's martyrdom was as wonderful as his birth:ِ The whore-monger king
of Palestine (HEROD) fell in love with the daughter of his brother, and
decided to marry her, which was something awful and unlawful in the
Mosaic Law. John, the prophet of God was informed of that; and declared
the marriage to be unlawful and a heinous sin. When the girl heard that,
and knew John to be the main impediment to her marriage with her uncle,
she was filled with anger and hatred, and decided to take vengeance from
John the Baptist.

Using the influence of her love affair, she seduced her uncle to slay
John and to offer his head to her as the best of the king's present!
Herod, who was in a mad love with the daughter of his brother agreed
with her request, and the prophet was beheaded by his order! And the
sacred head of John, was put in a golden tray and offered to the
harlot! \*\*\*\*\* [ 52 ]

**ZACHARIAS IN THE BIBLE**

The story of ZACHARIAS has been cited in the GOSPEL, in the book of
LUKE, chapter one, a quotation of which is as follows:ِ Saint Zacharias,
a high priest in the Temple, was the father of JOHN THE BAPTIST. His
wife ELIZABETH was barren, and he had become an aged priest fulfilling
his duties in the Temple. He belonged to the priestly order of ABITAH.
His wife also was belonged to a priestly family. They both lived a good
life in God's sight, and obeyed fully all the Lord's law and commands.
Both of the couple had reached old age, and had no children. After a
fervent prayer to God, Zacharias received an angelic message, that;
Elizabeth would bear a son (LUKE 1:5ِ25).

An angel of the Lord appeared to him, and he was alarmed and felt
afraid: \`\`Don't be afraid,'' said the angel. \`\`God has heard your
prayer, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son! You are to name him
John. How glad and happy you will be, and how happy many others will be
when he is born. He will be a great man in Lord's sight.''

Zacharias said to the angel:ِ \`\`How shall I know if this is so? I am
an old man and my wife is also old.'' \`\`I am GABRIEL'', the angel
answered, \`\`Because you have not believed my message, you will be
unable to speak. You will remain silent until the day my promise to you
comes true.'' 22ِWhen he came out, he could not speak to people, and so
they knew that he had seen a vision in the Temple. Unable to say a word,
he made signs to them with his hands. 24ِSometimes later his wife
Elizabeth became pregnant, and did not leave the house for five months.
\`\`Now at last the Lord Has helped me,'' she said. \`\`He has taken
away my public disgrace.''

57ِThen the time came and Elizabeth gave birth to a child. Her
neighbours and relatives heard how wonderfully good the Lord had been to
her, and they all rejoiced. [ 53 ]

59ِWhen the baby was a week old they came to circumcise him, and they
were going to name him Zacharias after his father, but his mother said:ِ
\`\`No! His name is to be John.'' They said:ِ \`\`But you have no
relative with that name....'' 63ِZacharias then asked for a writing
tablet and wrote:ِ

\`\`HIS NAME IS JOHN''

**TRANSLATOR'S NOTE**

يَا يَحْيَى خُذِ الْكِتَابَ بِقُوَّة وَآتَيْنَاهُ الْحُكْمَ صَبِيّاً((
12 ))

12- O, YAHYA"! SEIZE THE BOOK FIRMLY. AND WE GAVE HIM JURISDICTION WHEN
HE WAS A CHILD.

وَحَنَاناً مِنْ لَّدُنَّا وَزَكَاةً وَكَانَ تَقِيّاً(( 13 ))

13- AND TENDERNESS FROM US, AND PURITY, AND HE WAS PIOUS.

وَبَرّاً بِوَالِدَيْهِ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ جَبَّاراً عَصِيّاً(( 14 ))

14- AND (BEING) GOOD TO HIS PARENT, AND HE WAS NOT TYRANT,
REBELLIOUS.

وَسَلاَمٌ عَلَيْهِ يَوْمَ وُلِدَ وَيَوْمَ يَمُوتُ وَيَوْمَ يُبْعَثُ
حَيّاً(( 15 ))

15- PEACE BE UPON HIM, THE DAY HE WAS BORN, AND THE DAY HE DIES, AND
THE DAY HE WILL BE RAISED TO LIFE. [ 54 ]

**THE COMMENTARY
YAHYA"'S DISTINCT QUALIFICATIONS**

VERSE NO.12ِ15

YAHYA" was born and grown, and Divine Instructions came to him. He was
not given a certain Book or new Law, but he was instructed by his Lord
to grasp the existing scriptures firmly:ِ \`\`O, YAHYA"! Seize the Book
firmly.''

Here in this verse, \`\`The Book'' is said to have been Towra"t. John
did not live long, and was beheaded by the order of Herod, a Roman Petty
king, who was seduced by a girl he loved. In his short life JOHN THE
BAPTIST did a lot of good and sacred works. He very boldly denounced
sin. He was kind and gentle to all the creatures for the sake of God. He
left the world and passions in behind and lived a simple, pure and
chaste life. As a result of such piety, God's peace and blessings were
always on him:ِ

\`\`Peace be upon him, the day he was born, and the day he was to die,
and the day he will be raised again.'' In the life to come, he is also
among the righteous friends of God.

وَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَابِ مَرْيَمَ إِذْ انتَبَذَتْ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا
مَكَاناً شَرْقِيّاً(( 16 ))

16- AND MAKE MENTION IN THE BOOK OF MARY. WHEN SHE LEFT HER FAMILY AND
WENT TO A PLACE IN THE EAST.

فَاتَّخَذَتْ مِنْ دُونِهِمْ حِجَاباً فَأَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهَا رُوحَنَا
فَتَمَثَّلَ لَهَا بَشَراً سَوِيّاً(( 17 ))

17- THEN SHE TOOK A VEIL (TO SCREEN HERSELF) FROM THEM. THEN WE SENT
OUR SPIRIT TO HER, AND APPEARED TO HER AS A PERFECT HUMAN! [ 55 ]

قَالَتْ إِنِّى أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمنِ مِنْكَ إِنْ كُنتَ تَقِيّاً(( 18
))

18- SHE SAID:ِ \`\`I SEEK REFUGE TO THE MERCIFUL FROM YOU, IF YOU ARE
PIOUS.''

قَالَ إِنَّمَا أَنَا رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ لاَِهَبَ لَكِ غُلاَماً زَكِيّاً((
19 ))

19- HE SAID:ِ \`\`I AM THE MESSENGER OF YOUR LORD (AND HAVE COME) TO
GRANT YOU A CLEAN SON.''

قَالَتْ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لِى غُلاَمٌ وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِى بَشَرٌ وَلَمْ
أَكُنْ بَغِيّاً(( 20 ))

20- SHE SAID:ِ \`\`HOW CAN THERE BE A SON FOR ME, AND NO MAN TOUCHES
ME, AND I WILL NOT BE UNCHASTE?''

قَالَ كَذَلِكِ قَالَ رَبُّكِ هُوَ عَلَىَّ هَيِّنٌ وَلِنَجْعَلَهُ آيَةً
لِّلنَّاسِ وَرَحْمَةً مِّنَّا وَكَانَ أَمْراً مَّقْضِيّاً(( 21 )) 21- HE
SAID:ِ\`\`SO SHALL IT BE. YOUR LORD SAID THAT, IT IS EASY FOR ME; AND
THAT, WE MAY MAKE HIM A SIGN FOR PEOPLE, AND A MERCY FROM US; AND IT WAS
AN ORDER DECREED.


**THE COMMENTARY
THE BIRTH OF JESUS CHRIST**

VERSE NO.16ِ21 Following the story of John the BAPTIST; here comes the
story of Jesus Christ, and his mother, who gave birth to him as a virgin
and without a husband! For that, her family abused her, and knew her [
56 ]

baby as a disgrace to her lineage. But her son in the cradle defended
his mother, and claimed to be a prophet of God; with wisdom, authority,
and Book! John was born of an old father and a barren mother, and
stranger than that; Jesus was born of a virgin mother, and had no father
at all! Both of them later proved to be the signs of God, and also a
Mercy from Him to His servants.

It happened so that Mary left the Temple, and found a privacy in the
east of the town for prayer and devotion. She then fixed a veil or
partition, to make an enclosure, so as to be safe from eyes and their
unlawful looks. But Lo! The angel of God personified, and appeared to
her in the form of a perfect and handsome young man, entering her
privacy without leave or welcome!

The chaste, pious, and God fearing, virgin trembled with fear, seeing
the young man intruded her seclusion!? So she at once shouted on him
saying:ِ

\`\`I seek refuge to the Merciful God from you, if you are a pious
man.''

Saying so, Mary waited for the young man to show his reaction. It was
no late, when the man said to her don't worry:ِ

\`\`I am a Messenger from your Lord, and have come to grant you a clean
pious son!''

Hearing that, Mary once again trembled with anxiety. She thought of the
natural way and means of being pregnant and having a child. Then she
took her decision, and frankly and firmly, relying on her piety, said to
the young man:ِ

\`\`How can it be possible when no man even touches me, and I will
never become unchaste and infidel?'' The young man who claimed to be an
angel indifferently said:ِ \`\`So shall it be, as I have already told
you. Nothing is ever impossible with your Lord. He wants to make your
son a sign, and a Mercy from Him to people. You will be pregnant
untouched by any man; and you will give birth to a son as our Lord will,
and this is an order decreed by God!'' [ 57 ]

فَحَمَلَتْهُ فَانتَبَذَتْ بِهِ مَكَاناً قَصِيّاً(( 22 ))

22- THEN SHE CONCEIVED HIM, AND WENT WITH HIM TO A DISTANT PLACE.

فَأَجَاءَهَا الْمَخَاضُ إِلَى جِذْعِ النَّخْلَةِ قَالَتْ يَا لَيْتَنِى
مِتُّ قَبْلَ هَذَا وَكُنتُ نَسْياً مَّنْسِيّاً(( 23 ))

23- AND THE PANGS OF CHILD-BIRTH DREW HER TO THE TRUNK OF A PALM-TREE.
SHE SAID (IN ANGUISH):ِ \`\`WOULD THAT I HAD DIED BEFORE THIS, AND HAD
BEEN UTTERLY FORGOTTEN.''

فَنَادَاهَا مِنْ تَحْتِهَا أَلاَّ تَحْزَنِى قَدْ جَعَلَ رَبُّكِ
تَحْتَكِ سَرِيّاً(( 24 ))

24- THEN (A VOICE) CALLED FROM BENEATH HER THAT:ِ \`\`GRIEVE NOT, FOR
YOUR LORD HAS MADE A FLOWING SPRING BENEATH YOU.''

وَهُزِّى إِلَيْكِ بِجِذْعِ النَّخْلَةِ تُسَاقِطْ عَلَيْكِ رُطَباً
جَنِيّاً(( 25 ))

25- AND SHAKE TOWARDS YOURSELF THE TRUNK OF THE PALM-TREE, FRESH RIPE
DATE WILL FALL ON YOU.

فَكُلِى وَاشْرَبِى وَقَرِّى عَيْناً فَإِمَّا تَرَيِنَّ مِنْ الْبَشَرِ
أَحَداً فَقُولِى إِنِّى نَذَرْتُ لِلرَّحْمَانِ صَوْماً فَلَنْ أُكَلِّمَ
الْيَوْمَ إِنسِيّاً(( 26 ))

26- SO EAT (OF THE FRESH DATE) AND DRINK (OF THE WHOLE SOME WATER) AND
ENLIGHTEN YOUR EYES (WITH YOUR BABY). AND WHEN YOU SEE ANY ONE OF THE
MANKIND, SAY (BY HINTS TO THEM):ِ \`\`I HAVE VOWED A FAST TO THE
MERCIFUL GOD, SO TO-DAY I WILL NEVER SPEAK TO ANY HUMAN BEING. [ 58 ]

**THE COMMENTARY
MARY IN HER HARDEST STORM OF LIFE**

VERSE NO.22ِ26

After her meeting with the angel of God, Mary became pregnant with
Jesus; but Qura"n does not mention how was it, and how did she conceive.
She lived for sometimes in a state of hope and fear, happiness and
anxiety. She considered how could people believe her that she was still
chaste and a virgin, with the baby in her bosom; and wondered how could
she suffer the blames and reproaches of her family. She thought that as
a virgin, she was a symbol of piety, virtue, and Godliness, throughout
her life; but now they would consider her as a weak point, and disgrace
to her lineage!

Anyhow the time, whatever of length, came when she had to give birth to
the extraordinary baby who was in her womb. She too was a human being,
and had to suffer the pangs and the pressures of a pregnant mother; with
no one to attend her, and her child being of a special case, she now had
gone to a far away distance and place from her own people. So, a great
anguish and anxiety seized her and made her to shed bitter tears,
saying:ِ \`\`O, would that I had died before this event, and had been
utterly forgotten.''

But this hard spiritual condition of her vanished soon, for, a voice
from beneath she heard, giving glad-tidings of many kinds! The
mysterious hands of God did not let her to suffer from hunger or thirst,
and dates for food, and water for ablutions and drink was provided for
her:ِ

\`\`Grieve not, for your Lord has made a flowing spring of water
beneath you! Also shake towards yourself the trunk of the palm-tree,
fresh ripe dates will fall on you to eat.'' She was also taught by the
Divine Voice how to encounter with people in her present situation:ِ [
59 ] \`\`And when you see any one of the mankind, say by hints to them:ِ
I have vowed a fast to the Merciful God, and to-day I will never speak
to any human being.''

She was ordered to stop any kind of conversation with people on the
plea of a vow to her Lord. Her fast was that of abstinence from
communications with people, and this sort of fasting was something
customary among them.

فَأَتَتْ بِهِ قَوْمَهَا تَحْمِلُهُ قَالُوا يَا مَرْيَمُ لَقَدْ جِئْتِ
شَيْئاً فَرِيّاً(( 27 ))

27- THEN SHE CAME WITH HIM TO HER FAMILY, CARRYING HIM (IN HER BOSOM).
THEY SAID:ِ \`\`O, MARY! YOU HAVE INDEED DONE A WONDERFULLY BAD
THING!''

يَا أُخْتَ هَارُونَ مَا كَانَ أَبُوكِ امْرَأَ سَوْء وَمَا كَانَتْ
أُمُّكِ بَغِيّاً(( 28 ))

28- O, SISTER OF AARON! YOUR FATHER WAS NOT A BAD MAN NOR WAS YOUR
MOTHER A WOMAN UNCHASTE.

فَأَشَارَتْ إِلَيْهِ قَالُوا كَيْفَ نُكَلِّمُ مَنْ كَانَ فِى الْمَهْدِ
صَبِيّاً(( 29 ))

29- THEN SHE POINTED TO HIM (SAYING; ASK THE BABY). THEY SAID:ِ \`\`HOW
CAN WE SPEAK TO HIM WHO IS A CHILD IN THE CRADLE?''

قَالَ إِنِّى عَبْدُ اللهِ آتَانِىَ الْكِتَابَ وَجَعَلَنِى نَبِيّاً(( 30
))

30- (JESUS IN THE CRADLE BEGAN TO SPEAK AND) SAID:ِ \`\`I AM THE
SERVANT OF ALLAH. HE HAS GIVEN ME BOOK, AND HAS MADE ME A PROPHET.'' [
60 ]

وَجَعَلَنِى مُبَارَكاً أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُ وَأَوْصَانِى بِالصَّلاَةِ
وَالزَّكَاةِ مَا دُمْتُ حَيّاً(( 31 ))

31- AND HE HAS MADE ME A BLESSING, WHEREVER I BE; AND ENJOINED ME TO
PRAY, AND TO (GIVE THE) ALMS, AS LONG AS I LIVE.

وَبَرّاً بِوَالِدَتِى وَلَمْ يَجْعَلْنِى جَبَّاراً شَقِيّاً(( 32 ))

32- AND DOING GOOD TO MY MOTHER, AND WILL NOT LET ME BECOME A VICIOUS
TYRANT.

وَالسَّلاَمُ عَلَىَّ يَوْمَ وُلِدْتُ وَيَوْمَ أَمُوتُ وَيَوْمَ أُبْعَثُ
حَيّاً(( 33 ))

33- AND PEACE IS ON ME, THE DAY I WAS BORN, AND THE DAY I DIE, AND THE
DAY I AM RAISED TO LIFE.

**THE COMMENTARY
JESUS PREACHES IN THE CRADLE!**

VERSE NO.27ِ33

At last Mary went back to her family with the baby in her arm! When her
family saw that; they were all struck with astonishment! They trembled
to see the baby in her arm, and thought the worst of her. They whispered
to one another; how shamelessly had she disgraced her lineage!? Some
near relatives reproached her saying:ِ

\`\`O, Mary! What a wonderfully bad thing have you done!?'' Another
with an ironical utterance said to her:ِ \`\`O, SISTER OF AARON! Your
father was not a bad man, nor was your mother a woman unchaste.'' That,
they called her the \`\`SISTER OF AARON'', various explanations have
been given. Some commentators think that, AARON here is an example, and
the symbol, of a virtuous man; and when someone was to be admired for
virtue and piety, the Israelites would call him or her, the brother or
the sister of AARON.

[ 61 ] Some expounders of Qura"n think that, the title of AARON'S
SISTER, given to Mary by her relatives is a heavy irony! Aaron was the
head of the lineage of the Israelites priesthood. Mary too was of a
priestly family, and the Jewish priests were supposed to be the brothers
and sisters of priests. So in a taunting language she is called, \`\`O,
PRIESTESS! or O, SISTER OF AARON.

But how could Mary answer the reproaches, and explain to them the event
as it had really happened? And how could her relatives accept her
curious explanation? She was seen to them very helpless, but, sure
enough she pointed to her child to mean, ask my baby any question you
have!

They said:ِ \`\`How do you want us to speak to a baby who is slept in
his cradle?'' And a miracle revealed, and her baby in the cradle began
to preach:ِ \`\`Leave her alone and don't blame my innocent mother! I am
the servant of Allah, and my Lord has given me Book, and has made me a
prophet! He has made me a blessing and useful wherever I be, and has
ordered me to perform prayer, and to pay alms, so long as I am alive;
and to honour my mother and do good to her.''

Jesus, defending his mother, strangely preached his audience with
calling himself the servant of God, in order to reject the later false
notions that he was God or the son of God.

Here we may comprehend the miraculous eloquence of Qura"n that, in a
few short sentences, illustrates the important story of Jesus Christ,
which is contaminated with all sorts of polytheism, and mingled with
superstitions, giving a clear cut truth of what the incident really was.
[ 62 ]

ذَلِكَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ قَوْلَ الْحَقِّ الَّذِى فِيهِ
يَمْتَرُونَ(( 34 ))

34- SUCH WAS JESUS THE SON OF MARY; (IN THE) WORD OF TRUTH, IN WHICH
THEY DOUBT.

مَا كَانَ للهِِ أَنْ يَتَّخِذَ مِنْ وَلَد سُبْحَانَهُ إِذَا قَضَى
أَمْراً فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ(( 35 ))

35- IT IS NOT BECOMING FOR ALLAH TO TAKE A CHILD. GLORY BE TO HIM. WHEN
HE DECREES (TO CREATE A THING) HE ONLY SAYS TO IT, \`\`BE'' AND IT WILL
BE.
