The Period of Short Occultation
===============================

Ibn Nadeem (died 380 AH) writes in his knowledge-packed offering,
Al-Fihrist:

A short time later a son of Naubakht family and a great intellectual of
School of Ahlul Bayt, Abu Sahal Ibn Ali (died 311 AH), made a distinct
addition to the “Doctrines of Fiqh” by writing Al-khusus wal-Umoom and
Abtalul Qias. Then his talented nephew, Abu Muhammad Hasan Ibn Musa
Naubakhti, took over the job of preaching and in addition to many other
books wrote the most valuable Alkhabrul Wahid wal Amal Beh. It should be
kept in mind that Hasan Ibn Musa had the honor of meeting Imam Hasan
Askari (as).

Now the short occultation of Last Imam (as) is about to end. This was a
time when the scholars (ulama) had the opportunity to work on
traditions, commentary, character and morals. Researchers (fuqaha) got a
chance to focus on researching the answers to new problems and issues
with full freedom and confidence. And other thinkers and intellectuals
were able to use their minds for securing and strengthening the
religion. This period also taught those, who were associated with Ahlul
Bayt, the ways of waiting for the Last Imam (as).
