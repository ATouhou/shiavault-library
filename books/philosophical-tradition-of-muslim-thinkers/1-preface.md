[Preface]
=========

Regarding religion, it is often assumed that by its very nature it is
difficult, or for some thinkers impossible, to interpret and investigate
it philosophically or scientifically. At the same time we find almost
all great religious thinkers of prominent religions, have also been
philosophers and many in Islam have also been scientists. They have
interpreted and examined religions far more than a dogmatic or
uncriticized faith, and have related their religious tenets to
experiences and rational judgments. They have subjected, even divinely
revealed tenets, to radical criticism. It is interesting to note that
many of the philosophers, and even scientists, who have appeared in any
history of knowledge at any time have also been believers in religion,
and in some cases theologians. This tells that there is always a need of
intellectual interpretation for religions. It also supports the fact
that religion is not an abstract idealism; it is concrete and practical;
that ideals are not only abstractly valid in the Platonic realm of
ideas, but are realizable in the world of actual existence. Religion,
just like philosophy and science, is related with the present and
visible world. Its perception, in many ways, leads humanity
intellectually toward the same everyday life experiences that philosophy
and science investigate and address rationally.
