Martyrdom in the Way of Truth
=============================

Al-Imam al-Husayn (a.s) was a man of faith and action. During nights,
he worshipped Allah in privacy while during the day he worked hard and
guided the people. He was constantly mindful of the poor and the needy,
and he used to visit them and cheer them up. He used to tell his
followers: "Be always in touch with the needy, for Allah does not love
the arrogant".

Al-Imam al-Husayn (a.s) always helped the poor as much as he could. at
night he would carry sacks of food to the houses of the poor and leave
them near the doors. He worked hard to eradicate poverty, establish
justice and aquaint the people with Allah.

During the time of al-Imam al-Husayn a tyrant called Yazid became the
ruler. Yazid called himself the successor of Muhammad (s.a.w) but this
was a lie. He used to spend the income of the Islamic realm on drinking,
gambling and wild parties. Public wealth was wasted for supporting his
regime and the rights of the poor were trampled upon. in this way he
totally scorned the instructions of Islam.

When Yazid became ruler of the Muslims he immediately demanded al-Imam
al-Husayn (a.s) to recognise him as the ruler and accept his leadership;
but al-Imam al-Husayn (a.s) was the true successor of Prophet muhammad
(s.a.w) and could not accept and endorse the leadership of an oppressor.
He began to enlighten and awaken the people about Yazid and exhorted
them to dissociate from him. He would tell them:

"Do you not see that the truth is being trampled upon and the falsehood
and oppression are prevailing? in such conditions, a muslim must be
ready for martyrdom in defence of the right. Martyrdom and
self-sacrifice for the sake of truth is victory and success, while life
with the oppressors is no more than shame and disgrace."

At that time the people of kufa (Iraq) were loving followers of al-Imam
Ali (a.s) who had been suffering at the hands of Yazid and his father
Mu'awiyah. they invited al-Imam al-Husayn (a.s) to Kufa to lead them
against Yazid and his wicked rule. Al-Imam al-Husayn (a.s) had indeed
decided to rise up and fight, and so he accepted the invitation and set
off for kufa. When the Imam (a.s) and his followers were near Kufa, they
were met by Yazid's troops. the troops wanted to arrest al-Imam
al-Husayn (a.s) and his followers and take them to Yazid. the Imam (a.s)
told them:

"Never will I accept disgrace and surrender to Yazid, Death for me is
superior to disgrace and I am ready to defend Islam and the Muslims
until I am Martyred."

At a place called Karbala al-Imam al-Husayn (a.s), his family and
helpers were surrounded by Yazid's troops. the Imam (a.s) and his
followers stood firm as they fought against the thousands of troops of
Yazid. Finally, on 10th Muharram, 61 AH (the day we call Ashura) they
were martyred.

Al-Imam al-Husayn (a.s) and his followers were martyred, but they did
not submit to injustice and oppression. they defended Islam and the
Muslims.

With their blood they saved Islam and the Qur'an from the danger of
annihilation at the hands of Yazid. Al-imam al-Husayn (a.s) fought
against oppression and defended the religion of Islam, and by doing so,
he taught the world the greatest lesson on freedom and righteousness.
For this reason we call al-Imam al-Husayn (a.s) "Sayyid al-Shuhada"
which means lord of the martyrs. Now the turn has come for us to
safeguard and defend Islam. We must shoulder this magnificent
resposibility.

**Protecting Religion**

The day of Ashura is a glorious day for truth and freedom. Ashura is a
model for every day of our lives, and the martyres of that day are the
forerunners and teachers for all the martyrs in the way of truth.

One of the self sacrificing yound men of that day was called Wahab. He
too gave his life for his Imam (a.s) and for the true teachings of the
Qur'an, and provided a lesson on martyrdom to all sincere youths of all
times and places. Wahab was in his tent when his mother entered. She was
obviously flustered and nervous; she said to her son:

"Wahab! what are you waiting for? Don't you know that Yazid's forces
have surrounded your Imam (a.s)? Rise and defend your Imam (a.s). Rise
and defend the Qur'an, freedom and honour. If you want me to be happy
and pleased with you, rise and give your blood for the sake of your
religion." Wahab was already busy putting on his clothes and armour for
the battlefield. He quickly finished and made his farewells to his
mother and to his young wife. He ran to the battlefield with the
permission of al-Imam al-Husayn (a.s).

Wahab fought like a valiant lion and his sword fell on the heads of the
enemy like lightening. But the day was hot and soon he became more
thirsty and tired. He withdrew from the battle to rest for a while, and
seeing his mother standing and watching the battle alongside one of the
tents, he rushed to her side. She kissed the bleeding face of her son,
and said:

"My son, I was watching you, but rest is not permissible. Our Imam's
(a.s) helpers are few; return to the battlefield and either defeat the
enemy or be martyred in the presence of your Imam (a.s). Only in this
case I will be content with you and pray for you. Go now, my brave
son."

With this encouragement, and after seeing his mother and wife, just
once more for the last time, Wahab returned to the battlefield with an
ardent desire for martyrdom. An enemy sword fell on his arm and wounded
him. Watching from afar, his mother let out an involuntary groan. She
picked up a stick and hurried to defend her son. Wahab's young wife also
saw what had happened and she too rushed off to help him. She arrived at
his side to find him lying, with blood spurting from his deep wound.

Wahab's wife wanted only to defend her husband and play her part in
defending the religion. While taking care of her wounded husband, she
too was attacked by the enemy troops and was martyred.

Defending Islam and the Qur'an is obligatory on both men and women.
When necessary, Muslim women must learn shooting and other techniques of
warfare. they must learn first aid and the art of nursing and attending
on the injured. they are to be ever vigilant guardians of the Islamic
homelands and honour.

In Iran, the brave Muslim women in Islamic Hijab (dress) followed the
instructions of their great leader and took part in the demonstrations
that freed the country. these freedom-loving women wearing their modest
Islamic dress entered decisively into arena, and with the cry of Allahu
Akbar on their lips they toppled down the imperial palace itself.

These Muslim women, following the instructions of Islam and observing
Islamic Hijab in accordance with the Islamic teachings, cooperated with
the men and delivered their country from the grip of traitors. Today,
the Muslim women of Iran are playing an important role in all the
organizations of the country.

These are the women who raised in the enviroment of Islam. Islam wants
women to be veiled, to wear plain clothes in public, to keep their
beauty and their adornments for their husbands and families, to avoid
unnecessary contacts with men who are not mahram (with whom marriage is
not permitted) and to maintain in this way their dignity and respect.

Allah tells us in the Qur'an that the believing women must not gaze at
men who are not mahram and must hide from their bodies and hair. the
women brought up in Islamic enviroment can grow spiritually and turn
into brave defenders of Islam, the Qur'an, dignity and honour. they can
play an impotant role in freeing and developing the great Islamic
nation.

**Who can be the Prophet's Successor?**

The passengers of this aeroplane have boarded, but the pilot hasn't
come yet. It seems he has fallen sick and is unable to come.

Who will be put in his place to fly the passengers to their
destination? One of the passengers?

... the Stewardess? ... A passer-by? ... Who?

Will they select someone to take the place of the pilot who doesn't
have the awareness and vision of this skill? Would the passengers have
confidence in him? Would they fly with him? Who can become the pilot's
replacement?

Definately it must be someone who knows how to fly a plane and has the
"insight and awareness" of this skill. Now, with regard to this example,
can you say: Who can be the "Imam"?

Who can be the Prophet's replacement?

How must the Prophet's replacement be?

Can someone who doesn't have the vision and awareness to guide the
people, be the Prophet's replacement? Is someone who doesn't know the
rules of religion properly, who sins and makes mistakes, be worthy of
successorship?

Would people have confidence in him? Who knows better which person is
capable of succeeding the Prophet?...God, or the people? Of course, God
knows better and that is why He appoints the capable person to be the
Prophet's replacement and orders the Prophet to place his divine vision
and awareness at his successor's disposal. the Prophet acts according to
God's command and picks the person out to be his successor and
introduces him to the people as such.

The successor of a Prophet is called an "Imam".

The Prophet, according to God's command, selects an honest and
trusworthy person to be his successor and to perform his tasks after
him. The Imam is a trustworthy and honest person selected by God for
Imamate and Leadership of Mankind. the Prophet, according to god's
command, introduces this person so that by words and deeds he guides
mankind towards God, and the people take example from him and follow him
in the way they live their lives.

The Prophet, with the permission of god, places his vision, knowledge
and awareness at the disposal of his successor for him to correctly lead
and guide the people. the Imam knows the laws and instructions of
religion (as God and the Prophet have taught him), and communicates this
to the people. the Imam, like the Prophet, is a perfect example of
religion and acts perfectly in accordance with religious instructions.

The Imam, like the Prophet, sees the ugliness and foulness of sin and
because of this vision and awareness he never commits sins, rather he is
disgusted by them. Because the Imam, like the Prophet, commits no sins
and makes no mistakes, people have confidence in him and are able to
follow his words and actions.

The Imams (twelve Imams) are all infallible. This means that:

They commit no sin, they are perfectly honest and trustworthy, and they
fully and correctly communicate the laws and instructions of religion to
the people. (That is, they never make mistakes or forget anything).

Nahjul Balagha : Sayings of Imam Ali (a.s.)

In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful
Salaam alaikum wa rahmatullah my brothers and sisters,
I was looking for something else yesterday, and I stumbled upon this
wonderful sermon of Imam Ali (as). What a guide for our lives!!

Somebody requested Imam Ali to advise him how to lead a useful and
sober life. Imam Ali thereupon advised him thus: "Do not be among those
people who want to gain good returns without working hard for them, who
have long hopes and keep on postponing repentance and penance, who talk
like pious persons but run after vicious pleasures. Do not be among
those who are not satisfied if they get more in life and are not content
if their lot in life's pleasures is less (they are never satisfied), who
never thank Allah for what they get and keep on constantly demanding
increase in what is left with them;

who advise others to such good deeds that they themselves refrain from;
who appreciate good people but do not follow their ways of life; who
hate bad and vicious people but follow their ways of life; who, on
account of their excessive sins hate death but do not give up the sinful
ways of life; who, if fallen ill, repent their ways of life and on
regaining their health fearlessly readopt the same frivolous ways;

who get despondent and lose all hopes, but on gaining health, become
arrogant and careless; who, if faced with misfortunes, dangers or
afflictions, turn to Allah and keep on beseeching Him for relief and
when relieved or favoured with comfort and ease they are deceived by the
comfortable conditions they found themselves in and forget Allah and
forsake prayers; whose minds are allured by day dreams and forlorn hopes
and who abhor to face realities of life; who fear for others the
enormous repercussions of vices and sins but for their own deeds expect
very high rewards or very light disciplinary actions. Riches make such
people arrogant, rebellious and wicked, and poverty makes them
despondent and lethargic. If they have to work, they work lazily and if
they put up a demand they do it stubbornly.

Under the influence of inordinate cravings, they commit sins in quick
succession and keep on postponing repentance. Calamities and adversities
make them give up the distinguished characteristics of Muslims
(patience, hope in future and work for improvement of circumstances).
they advise people with narration's of events and facts but do not take
any lesson from them. they are good at preachings but bad at practice,
therefore they always talk of lofty deeds but their actions belie their
words. they are keen to acquire temporal pleasures but are careless and
slow to achieve permanent (Divine) benefits. they think good for
themselves the things which are actually injurious to them and regard
harmful the things which really benefit them. they are afraid of death
but waste their time and do not resort to good deeds before death
overtakes them.

the vices which they regard as enormous sins for others, they consider
as minor shortcomings for themselves. Similarly, they attach great
importance to their obedience to the orders of Allah and belittle
similar actions in others. therefore, they often criticize others and
speak very highly of their own deeds. they are happy to spend their time
in society of rich persons, wasting it in luxuries and vices but are
averse to employing for useful purposes in company of the poor and pious
people: they are quick and free to pass verdicts against others but they
never pass a verdict against their own vicious deeds. they force others
to obey them but they never obey Allah. they collect their dues
carefully but never pay the dues they owe. they are not afraid of Allah
but fear powerful men".
