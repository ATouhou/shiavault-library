Lesson Three: What About the Soul's Food?
=========================================

Imam Hasan (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"عَجِبْتُ لِمَنْ يَتَفَكَّرُ فى مَأكُولِهِ كَيْفَ لا يَتَفَكَّرُ فى
مَعْقُولِهِ، فَيُجَنِّبُ بَطْنَهُ ما يُؤذِيهِ و يُودِعُ صَدْرَهُ ما
يُرْدِيهِ.”
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

I wonder about those who think about their body’s food, but do not think
about their soul’s food. They keep undesirable food away from their
belly, but fill up their heart with destructive subjects.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Our people are usually quite careful with their food and do not start
eating unless they know what it is. They avoid anything that looks
doubtful and some go to great lengths to ensure that the body receives
good, clean, healthy diet.

Yet, when it comes to the food for the soul, these same individuals will
throw caution to the winds. With eyes closed, unaware of the reality,
they would have no hesitation in pouring down any mental food into their
soul.

They harm their souls by accepting without question the speeches of
unsuitable friends, misleading press reports and suspicious or poisonous
propagation, and this is very surprising.
