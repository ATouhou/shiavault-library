The Contents of Surah Al-Hijr
-----------------------------

This Surah contains 99 verses and is generally believed to be
chronologically the fifty-second Surah. It was revealed to the Prophet
(S) in Mecca prior to his Migration. The Arabic term ‘Hijr’ is the name
of a town where the people of Hadrat Salih used to live.

The name of this Surah, Al-Hijr, is taken from the eightieth verse of it
which deals with the people of Salih, saying:

***“And indeed the inhabitants of Hijr (also) rejected the
messengers.”***

Most of the discussions in this noble Surah are about the accusations
and scoffs of the pagans unto the Qur’an and the blissful Prophet (S),
as well as some commandments to him to be patient and perseverant with
forbearance towards them.

It provided some kind of comfort and soothing effect as against the
pressure exerted by the invasion of the opponents after the death of
Hadrat Khadijah and Hadrat Abu-Talib , both of whom were dear to the
Prophet (S).

Some of the verses deal with the origin of the world of existence, and
belief in Him which are brought about by the study of the secrets of
creation. The story of man’s creation, and the disobedience of Iblis, as
well as his ultimate destiny, are also exposed.

There are also allusions made to the biography of such tribes as the
people of Lūt, the people of Salih, and the people of Shu‘ayb.

In the meantime, there are also some verses which are concerned with the
issues of Resurrection and the retribution of evildoers, each of which
will be explained.
