23: Believer's (moaminoon)
==========================

This chapter of six sections contains 118 late Meccan verses. all in
fact excep t for the very last one. It was revealed after Prophets 21
and before Worship 32 and The Inevitable 56. It takes its name from the
first sentence in the chapter (NOTE that Chapter 40 has an alternate
title, The Believer. with the same noun

used in the singular).

The mood here is somewhat poetic with its initial vision of creation and
man's reproduction; then it relates God's transcendent care in providing
for mankind and the Universe. Noah's mission is mentioned next (II),
followed by a description of the final reward in an inspiring scene
(IV). Then one follows on God in all His

Oneness (V), which continues to the end of the chapter.
