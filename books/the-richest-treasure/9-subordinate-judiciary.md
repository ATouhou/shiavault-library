Subordinate Judiciary
=====================

Beware! The utmost carefulness is to be exercised in its selection: for
it is this high office which adventurous self-seekers aspire to secure
and exploit in their selfish interests. After the selection of your
chief judge, give careful consideration to the selection of other
officers.

Confirm them in their appointments after approved apprenticeship and
probation. Never select men for responsible posts either out of any
regard for personal connections or under any influence, for that might
lead to injustice and corruption.

Of these, select for higher posts, men of experience, men firm in faith
and belonging to good families. Such men will not fall an easy prey to
temptations and will discharge their duties with an eye on the abiding
good of others. Increase their salaries to give them a contented life.

A contented living is a help to self-purification. They will not feel
the urge to tax the earnings of their subordinates for their own upkeep.
They will then have no excuse either to go against your instructions or
misappropriate state funds.

Keep a watch over them without their knowledge.

Perchance they may develop true honesty and true concern for the public
welfare. But whenever any of them is accused of dishonesty and the guilt
is confirmed by the report of your secret service, then regard this as a
sufficient to convict him. Let the punishment be corporal and let that
be dealt in the public at an appointed place of degradation.
