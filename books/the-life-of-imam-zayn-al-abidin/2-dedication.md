Dedication
==========

I dedicate this study to Imam al-Husayn, peace be on him. For he is the
conscience of the Muslim community and pioneer of its dignity and
awareness. He is the father of the free and lord of martyrs. He has
occupied a high social position. This study is about his son, Imam Zayn
al-‘Abidin, peace be on him, who has filled the world with his virtues,
his knowledge, and his piety.

the descendants of Amran above the nations. Offspring, one of the other;
and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.” Qur’an (3: 33 -34)***

***“Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you, O people
of the House, and to purify you thoroughly.” Qur’an (33: 33)***

***“Say: I do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near
relatives; and whoever earns good, We give him more of good therein;
surely Allah is Forgiving, Grateful.” Qur’an (53:23)***
