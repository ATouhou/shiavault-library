Imam Husayn [a] gets ready to fight.
====================================

Imam Husayn [a] and his companions began praying and reading the Qur'an,
for it was the last night in the world.

The tents were here and there. Imam Husayn [a] wanted to prevent the
enemies from penetrating them. So, he ordered his companions to tie them
to each other. He also ordered his companions to dig a trench at the
back of the tents to fight the enemies at one front.

The Imam met his companions and said:

*I praise Allah with the best praise! I am thankful to Him in all
conditions whether pleasant or otherwise! Allah, I thank you for making
my grandfather a prophet and teaching us the Qur'an! I thank you for
giving us ears, eyes and hearts. I thank you for you have not made us
polytheists!*

The Imam added:

*I don't think that there are companions better than mine, there's a
family more loyal than mine! May Allah reward you all. I think that
we'll face those enemies tomorrow! Now you may go!*

All refused and said:

*We'll sacrifice our lives, money, and families to defend you against
the enemies! We'll stand by you!*
