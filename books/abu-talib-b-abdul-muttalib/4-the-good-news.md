The Good News
=============

Abu Talib had heard good news from the people of the Book (the Jews and
the Christians). The good news was that a Prophet would appear very
soon. So, he took care of his nephew very much. He thought that he would
be a Prophet. So, he didn't leave him alone.

When Abu Talib wanted to go on a trade journey to Sham (Syria), he took
our Master Muhammad [s] with him. Muhammad was nine years of age then.

In Busra, a city situated on the road of the trade caravans, there was
an abbey. A monk lived in the abbey. The monk's name was Buhaira. He was
always looking forward to the appearance of a new Prophet whose time
approached.

When the monk looked at Muhammad, he realized that he would be the
promised Prophet because he had the personality and expression of a
Prophet.

The monk began looking at the Makkan boy's face very carefully.
Meanwhile, the good news from Jesus Christ sounded in his mind. The monk
asked Abu Talib about the boy's name. So, Abu-Talib said:

*“His name's Muhammad.”*

The monk became very humble at his holy name. So, he said to Abu Talib:

“Go back to Makkah. Protect your nephew from the Jews because he'll be
of great importance!”

Abu Talib came back to Makkah. He adored Muhammad. He was very careful
of his safety.
