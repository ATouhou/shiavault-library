Letter 5
========

**Thul-Qiâ€™da 9, 1329 A.H.**

I Admitting Our Argument,
-------------------------

1) Your letter has been quite clear, very well arranged, praiseworthy.
It is eloquent, powerful in determination, and strong in argument. It
spares no attempt to prove that it is not compulsory to follow the
majority's sects in the principles and branches of religion, saving no
effort to confirm that the doors of *ijtihad* must remain open.

Your letter, therefore, is strong in both matters, correct in proving
each one of them, and we do not deny your careful research in their
respect, your clarification of their obscurities, although we really
were not acquainted with them, and our view in their regard is identical
to yours.

II Asking for Detailed Proofs
-----------------------------

2) We had asked you about your reason for not accepting the sects
followed by the Muslim majority, and your answer was that because of
"judicial proofs," whereas you were expected to explain that in detail.
Could you please yield now to explaining them with positive proofs from
the Book (Qur'an) or the Sunnah which, as you mentioned, divert the
believer from following his own inclinations? Thank you, and peace be
with you.

Sincerely,

*S*
