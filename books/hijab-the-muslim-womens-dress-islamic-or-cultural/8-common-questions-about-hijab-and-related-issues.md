Common Questions about Hijab and Related Issues
===============================================

1. Meaning of Casting Down
--------------------------

**1.** What “**casting down** the glances” mean?

It means that a person should not look at the member of the opposite sex
except for those parts that may be uncovered.

So, for instance, a man is allowed to look at the face and hands of a
non-*mahram* lady who is not related to him provided it is not done in
with a lustful intention. (“Mahram” means person in whose presence
*hijab* is not required. See the list at end of this section.)

2. Shaking hands
----------------

**2.** Is it permissible to **shake hands** with a person of opposite
sex?

If the person is mahram, then it is permissible. But if the person is
non-mahram, then it is forbidden.

3. Beautification of Women
--------------------------

**3.** Is a woman allowed to line eyes with **kohl,** to put **mascara**
on her eyelashes, and to wear **rings** in both hands?

A woman is allowed to put kohl or similar cosmetics on her eyelashes and
also to wear rings provided it is not done with the intention of drawing
lustful attention of men towards herself.

4. Exposing the Chin
--------------------

**4.** A vast majority of Muslim women who observe *hijab* are used to
keeping their chins and a small part of the **under chin** exposed while
they cover the neck. Is this permissible? And how big an area of the
face can women expose; are the ears included in that?

The ears are not part of the face, therefore it is obligatory to cover
them. As for the part of the chin and the under chin that is seen when
putting on the common head scarf, it is to be considered as part of the
face and, therefore, can be exposed.

5. Facial Hair
--------------

**5.** Is it permissible for a woman who observes *hijab* to get rid of
her **facial hair**, to straighten her eyebrows, and to wear natural and
light **make up**?

Getting rid of facial hair, straightening of eyebrows, and wearing of
light make up do not prevent her from keeping her face uncovered
provided it is not done with the intention of drawing attention.

6. Wig as a Replacement
-----------------------

**6.** Can a woman put on a **wig** as replacement of the head-covering
(*hijab*)?

Since the wig is an item of beauty *(zinat)*, it must be covered in
presence of non-mahram men.

7. High heeled Shoes
--------------------

**7.** A Muslim woman wears **high heeled shoes** that hit the ground in
such a way that they draw attention. Is she allowed to wear them?

If it is intended to draw the attention of non-mahram men to herself, or
if it generally causes temptation for committing sin, then it is not
permissible.

8. Tight Fitting Shirt
----------------------

**8.** If a woman puts on a scarf and wears a **tight-fitting** shirt
and tight-fitting jeans or trousers or a tight-fitting *qamees* and
*shalwar* – is that considered an acceptable *hijab* in the presence of
non-*mahram* men?

Any dress that reveals the contours of her body or that would normally
arouse temptation is not permissible and does not fulfill the
requirements of *hijab*. It is a pointless *hijab*!

9. Men and Unisex Swimming
--------------------------

**9.** Is it permissible for a Muslim man to go to unisex **swimming
pools** and other similar places where people go about half-naked?

It is not permissible for a Muslim man to go to unisex swimming pools
and other similar places if it entails a *haram* act. Based on
obligatory precaution, according to Ayatullah Sistani, he must refrain
from going to such places even if it does not entail a *haram* act.

10. Defining those who are mahram
---------------------------------

**10.** Is the **brother-in-law** or a **cousin** included among the
list of the people in whose presence a lady does not have to observe
*hijab*? Is she allowed to shake their hands or hug them?

The brother-in-law or a male cousin is not included in that list and,
therefore, it is obligatory upon a Muslim lady to observe *hijab* in
their presence, and also it is not permissible for her to shake their
hands or hug them. The reverse will apply to a Muslim man in relation to
his sister-in-law or a female cousin.
