[Introduction]
==============

THERE is no domain in which change and transformation reign with the
same supremacy and totality as in that which concerns nature and man's
relation to it as well as his knowledge of it. Modern science, which has
acted as a catalyst during the past centuries for change in so many
other fields, is itself based upon change and impermanence. Were it to
become stationary and immutable it would cease to exist in its present
form. And since this is the only science of nature known to modern man,
the whole relation between man and nature, as well as the nature of man
himself and the Universe that surrounds him, is seen only in the light
of flux and change. The view that man's position in the Universe and his
knowledge of it, not to speak of the object of this knowledge, is
constantly changing has come to appear as so obvious and evident as to
make any other point of view seem absurd and well-nigh impossible to
understand. Modern man is bewildered at even the possibility of an
element of permanence in his relation with the Universe, not because
such an element does not exist, but because the problem itself is never
considered from the point of view of permanence.
