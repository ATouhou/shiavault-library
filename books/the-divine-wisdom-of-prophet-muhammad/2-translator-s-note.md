Translator’s Note
=================

The translation of Prophet’s (S) debates was inspired when we felt the
need to present to the world another divine image of our beloved Prophet
Muhammad (S) after continuous insults to this great personality by the
Western-Zionist media, the most diabolical one being the production of a
movie in the early September 2012. This divine image of Prophet Muhammad
(S) was that of an enlightened divine scholar and an expert in extempore
discussions who proved his superiority over scholars and leaders of
other religions at that time.

While doing translations, effort is made to keep language as simple as
possible. Footnotes are added and websites are mentioned if reader
wishes to have further information. Important Arabic words are in
italics. Key Arabic words explained in round brackets ( ) are described
further in glossary. Difficult or less commonly used Arabic words or
translated text are explained for the first time in square brackets [ ].
Prophet Muhammad’s (S) words are kept in double quotations “ ”, while
all others are in single quotation marks ‘ ’. The verses of Qur’an are
in italics.
