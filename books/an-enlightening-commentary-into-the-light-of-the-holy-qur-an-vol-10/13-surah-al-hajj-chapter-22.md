**Surah Al-Hajj**  
 **(The Pilgrimage),**  
**No. 22**

This Holy Surah was revealed in Medina and contains 78 verses.

The Contents of the Surah
-------------------------

Since some verses of this Surah are about Hajj pilgrimage, it has been
called Surah Al-Hajj.

In view of the fact that the commandment of Hajj pilgrimage accompanied
with some of its details, as well as the command of Holy War, which were
related to the circumstances of the Muslims in Medina, the verses of
this Surah are somehow like the Medinan Suras.

From the point of the contents, the matters recited in this Surah can be
divided into several parts:

Many verses of this Surah are about Resurrection and its logical
reasoning. They also consist of some warnings upon those people who are
negligent of the events of the Hereafter, and the like.

A considerable part of this Holy Surah speaks about the struggles
against idolaters and polytheists.

Another part of it invites people to verify the instructive fate of
those who passed away, and the painful Divine punishments which were
sent down upon them.

And, another part of it is about the Hajj pilgrimage and its historical
background.

Again, a part of it is rather about the struggles which were performed
against the hostile invaders.

And, finally, a part of the Surah contains some advices upon different
fields of life, and some encouragement to prayer, almsgiving, trust, and
considering Allah.

The Virtue of Reciting the Surah
--------------------------------

A tradition narrated from the holy Prophet of Islam (p.b.u.h) indicates
that he said:

*“Whoever recites Surah Al-Hajj, Allah will reward him both the reward
of pilgrimage and lesser pilgrimage of all those who have done them in
the past and all those who will do them in the future.”*[^1]

No doubt this great reward and virtue is not for a mere recitation of
the Surah in expression, but it is a recitation which provides
contemplation, and a contemplation which leads to action.

Also, Imam Sadiq (as) has been narrated who said:

*“Whoever recites this Surah every three days, he will not go out of the
year but he will be honored to go to the Sacred House.”*[^2]
