Regard for Kinship
==================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "He who wishes that his sustenance be
increased for him and his death day be delayed, then he should pay
attention to his kinsfolk."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 74, p. 89

Imam ‘Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha’ (‘a) said: "Wealth does not (excessively)
accumulate but by having five traits: extreme miserliness, high
expectations, overwhelming greed, breaking off ties with one's kindred,
and preferring this world to the next."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 73, p. 138

Imam Muhammad Baqir (‘a) said: regard for kinship causes (five
advantages):

1. The purification (and acceptance) of deeds.

2. Increase in wealth.

3. Repelling misfortunes.

4. Easiness in Reckoning, (in the Hereafter).

5. Prolonging life.

Usul al-Kafi, vol. 2, p. 150

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "There are three groups who will not (be
allowed to) enter Heaven: drinkers of wine, witches, and renouncers of
one's kindred."

Al-Khisal, p. 179
