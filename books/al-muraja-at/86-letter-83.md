Can You Compromise the Text's Accuracy With the Companions' Truthfulness?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Rabiâ€™ul-Awwal 2, 1330**

Those who are endowed with a discreet insight and keen comprehension
regard the companions as being above doing anything contrary to the wish
of the Prophet (pbuh) in whatever he bids or forbids, neither do they
permit anything other than such a policy.

Therefore, they could not have heard the text regarding the Imam once,
twice or thrice, then deviated therefrom. And how can you describe such
companions to be truthful had they heard the text about him then
refrained from following it? I do not think that you are able to
compromise both [contradictory] situations, Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*S*
