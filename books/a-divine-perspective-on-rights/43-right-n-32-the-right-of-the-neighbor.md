**And the right of your neighbor is that you should be a guardian for
him when he is absent, and you should honor him when he is present, and
you should assist and support him in both situations. You should not
pursue any of his imperfections, and you should not seek any of his
faults. But if you should discover any of his faults unintentionally,
you should take the role of a fortified stronghold and a veiling screen
regarding what you know.**

**You should guard them in such a way that none of his defects can be
discovered even if they are thoroughly inspected with spears. And you
should not eavesdrop on him, and you should not forsake him during times
of hardship. And you should not envy him when he receives a blessing.
Pardon his deviation and forgive his mistakes. And do not lose your
temper when he behaves out of ignorance with you. And do not stop to be
his supporter, and answer those who scold him. And divulge for him the
deception of those who counsel him, and associate with him in an
honorable manner. And there is no power or strength but in God.**

The Arabic word ‘jar’ meaning neighbor is used with several implications
in the Holy Qur’an. In some places, it is used to refer to neighbors -
close or far away. In the Holy Qur’an, it is also used to refer to those
who seek asylum as in the following verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَإِنْ أَحَدٌ مِّنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ اسْتَجَارَكَ فَأَجِرْهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“If one amongst the Pagans ask thee for asylum, grant it to him...”
[The Holy Qur’an, al-Tawbah 9:6]***

The above word used for neighbor has the deeper meaning of security.
That implies that neighbors are granted security by each other. The
right of a neighbor is great both intellectually and religiously. The
word ‘jar’ is used in any place where there is a great right as in the
following verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لاَ غَالِبَ لَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَإِنِّي جَارٌ لَّكُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“No one among men can overcome you this day, while I am near to you.”
[The Holy Qur’an, al-Anfal 8:48]***

Here in the phrase ‘I am near to you’ in Arabic the word ‘jar’ is used.
The Qur’an refers to close-by and distant neighbors. We shall discuss
this issue next.

The Rights of Neighbors as Viewed in the Qur’an
-----------------------------------------------

Consider the following verse of the Holy Qur’an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَاعْبُدُواْ اللّهَ وَلاَ تُشْرِكُواْ بِهِ شَيْئًا وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ
إِحْسَانًا وَبِذِي الْقُرْبَى وَالْيَتَامَى وَالْمَسَاكِينِ وَالْجَارِ
ذِي الْقُرْبَى وَالْجَارِ الْجُنُبِ وَالصَّاحِبِ بِالجَنبِ وَابْنِ
السَّبِيلِ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Serve God, and join not any partners with Him; and do good - to
parents, kinsfolk, orphans, those in need, neighbors who are near,
neighbors who are strangers, the companion by your side, the wayfarer
(ye meet), and what your right hands possess.” [The Holy Qur’an,
al-Nisaa 4:36]***

The verse refers to some of the rights in Islam including those of
neighbors. ‘Neighbors who are near’ in this verse has been interpreted
by various commentators to imply various things. Some consider it to
imply relatives. However, since the verses that have preceded this verse
in the Qur’an refer to the rights of relatives this interpretation seems
to be an unlikely meaning. Rather other implications seem to be more
appropriate. It may mean neighbors who are closer to us in religion.

“Neighbors who are strangers” implies physical distance. According to
traditions people living in up to forty houses away in either direction
are considered our neighbors. It may also refer to non-Muslim neighbors
who are not fighting with Muslims.[^1] Now that we have studied the
Qur’anic verses regarding neighbors, we will briefly review the
traditions on this issue.

Traditions on the Rights of Neighbors
-------------------------------------

There are many traditions about the rights of neighbors, their due
respect and their role in our security. The Prophet of God said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَن أغْلَقَ بابَهُ خَوفاً مِن جارِهِ عَلى أهْلِهِ وَمالِهِ فَليسَ
جارُهُ مُؤمِناً.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The neighbor because of whom one locks the door, out of fear for one’s
family and wealth, is not a believer.”*

The Prophet of God was asked: “O Prophet of God! What are the rights of
neighbors incumbent upon other neighbors?” He said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مِن أدْنى حُقوقِهِ عَليَهِ إنِ اسْتَقْرَضَهُ أقْرَضَهُ وإنِ
اسْتَعانَهُ أعانَهُ وإنِ اسْتَعارَ مِنهُ إعارَهُ وإنِ احْتاجَ إلى
رِفْدِه رَفَدَهُ وإنْ دَعا أجَابَهُ وإنْ مَرِضَ عَادَهُ وإنْ مَاتَ
شَيَّعَ جِنازَتَهُ وإنْ أصَابَ خَيراً فَرِحَ بِهِ وَلَمْ يَحْسِدْهُ
وإنْ أصَابَ مُصيبَةً حَزِنَ لِحِزْنِهِ وَلا يَستَطيلُ عَليهِ بِبِناءٍ
سَكَنَهُ فَيُؤذِيهِ بإشْرافِهِ عَلَيهِ وَسَدِّ مَنافِذِ الرّيحِ عَنهُ
وإنْ أُهْدِيَ إلى مَنْزِلِهِ طُرفَةٌ أهْدى لهُ قِسماً مِنها إذا عَلِمَ
أنَّهُ لَيسَ عِندَهُ مِثلُها أو فَليَسْتِرْها عَنهُ وَعَن عِيالِهِ إنْ
شَحَّتْ نَفسُهُ بِها. إسمَعوا ما أقُولُ لَكُم: لَمْ يُؤدِّ حَقَّ
الجارِ إلاّ قَليلٌ مِمَّنْ رَحمَهُ اللهُ، وَلَقَد أوصَاني اللهُ
بالجَارِ حَتىّ ظَنَنْتُ أنَّهُ سَيُورِّثُهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The least of a neighbor’s rights on him is that if he asks him for a
loan he should grant it to him. If he asks for help, he should help him.
If he wants to borrow something from him, he should lend it to him. If
he needs him to donate something to him, he should do so. If he invites
him, he should accept his invitation. If he gets sick, he should go and
visit him. If he passes away, he should attend his funeral procession.*

*If he receives some blessings, he should be happy and not envious of
him. If a tragedy befalls him, he should grieve for his grief. He should
not build a tall building in front of his dwelling which would trouble
him due to its overlooking his house and obstructing the passage of
breeze. If he is presented with some novelty in his house, then he
should present him a part of it if he knows that he does not have
something like it, otherwise he should conceal it from him and his
family if he desires it for himself.”*

*(The Prophet of God then added:) “Listen to what I tell you. Only a few
people who are blessed by God’s Mercy fulfil the rights of neighbors.
God enjoined on me the rights of the neighbor to the extent that I
thought He would appoint him as an heir.”*[^2]

There are three important points stressed by the Prophet in this
tradition. The first point is that each person’s house is his place of
peace and security, both for his property and for honor. Should one lose
his security at home, he has lost his most secure stronghold. This peace
and security is everyone’s certain right, and should not be violated by
anyone. If one lives in such a way that threatens the security of his
neighbors, then he is not a true believing Muslim.

The second point that is stressed here is not to build tall buildings
overlooking other people’s houses. We all know that at the time of the
Prophet there were no tall buildings in Arabia. However, the teachings
of the Prophet are universal, and for all times. Thus, he instructed us
not to build such buildings. This is one of the signs of the
completeness of Islamic teachings and a proof of Islam being the last
religion. Housing is still one of man’s major social problems.

The problem of finding a secure place to live is not only one of our
problems, but it is also one of most countries of the world. The
Westerners have chosen living in apartments with all its problems and
limitations. Our people are also following this practice. The third
point that is stressed is that one should not show what he brings into
his house to his neighbors, or give a little of what he brings home to
his neighbors if they are poor.

It is Forbidden to Hurt One’s Neighbors
---------------------------------------

Imam Sadiq said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَلعُونٌ مَن آذى جَارَهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“One who troubles his neighbor is cursed.”*[^3]

On the other hand, pleasing one’s neighbor is a cause of forgiveness. In
Lubb al-Lubab Qutb al-Rawandi quoted on the authority of God’s Prophet :

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَن مَاتَ ولَهُ جِيرانٌ ثَلاثَةٌ كُلُّهُم راضُونَ عَنهُ غُفِرَ لهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Anyone who dies with three neighbors pleased with him will be forgiven
(by God).”*[^4]  
 The Prophet of God said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَن كانَ يُؤمِنُ بِاللهِ وَاليَومِ الآخِرِ فَلا يُؤذِ جَارَهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Whoever believes in God and the Final Day should not trouble his
neighbors.”* [^5]

The Prophet also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حُرمَةُ الجَارِ عَلى الجَارِ كَحُرمَةِ أُمِّهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The reverence of a neighbor incumbent on the neighbor is like the
reverence due to one’s mother.”*[^6]

Complaining Against One’s Neighbor
----------------------------------

Imam Sadiq narrated that someone complained to the Prophet of God about
his neighbor. The Prophet turned his face away from him. He came back
again. Then the Prophet told Ali , Salman and Miqdad:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إذْهَبوا ونادُوا أنْ لَعْنَةُ اللهِ وَالمَلائِكَةِ عَلى مَن آذى
جَارَهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Go and publicly announce that the curse of God and the angels is on
one who troubles his neighbor.”*[^7]

Treating Neighbors with Kindness
--------------------------------

The Noble Prophet said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
البِرُّ وَحُسْنُ الجِوارِ زيادَةٌ في الرِّزْقِ وَعِمارَةٌ في
الدِّيارِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Treating one’s neighbors with kindness and being a good neighbor will
result in an increase in one’s share of daily bread and the development
of towns.”* [^8]

Imam Ridha has been quoted as having said the following in Fiqh
al-Ridha:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَأَحْسِنْ مُجاوَرَةَ مَن جَاوَرَكَ فإنَّ اللهَ تَعالى يَسْألُكَ عَنِ
الجارِ، وَقَد رُوِيَ عَن رَسولِ اللهِ صَلّى اللهُ عَليهِ وَآلِهِ: أنَّ
اللهَ تَبارَكَ وَتَعالى أوْصانِي بالجَارِ حَتىّ ظَنَنْتُ أنَّهُ
يَرِثُنِي.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Be a good neighbor for your neighbors since God will ask you about the
neighbour. God’s Prophet has been quoted as having said: God the
Almighty enjoined on me the rights of the neighbor to the extent that I
thought he will inherit from me.”* [^9]

Be Considerate With Your Neighbors
----------------------------------

It is quoted on the authority of God’s Prophet :

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا آمَنَ بي مَن باتَ شَبْعانَ وَجارُهُ جَائِعٌ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Whoever spends the night with a full stomach, while his neighbor is
hungry, does not believe in me.”*[^10]  
 He also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا آمَنَ بي مَن باتَ شَبْعانَ وَجارُهُ طاوٍ، مَا آمَنَ بي مَن باتَ
كاسِياً وَجارُهُ عارٍ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“One who spends the night with a full stomach while his neighbor is
hungry, has not believed in me. One who spends the night clothed, while
his neighbor has no clothes, has not believed in me.”* [^11]

In a letter to his governor Uthman ibn Hunayf, Imam Ali wrote:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أأبِيتُ مِبطاناً وَحَولي بُطونٌ غَرثَى وَأكْبادٌ حَرّى؟
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Should I pass the night with a full stomach while around me are hungry
and thirsty bellies?”*[^12]

Bad Neighbors
-------------

It has been quoted on the authority of God’s Prophet :

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أعُوذُ باللهِ مِن جارِ سوءٍ في دَارِ إقامَةٍ تَراكَ عَيناهُ وَيَرعَاكَ
قَلبُهُ، إنْ رآكَ بخَيرٍ ساءَهُ وإنْ رآكَ بِشَرٍّ سَرّهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“I seek refuge in God from an evil neighbor next to one’s place of
residence. His eyes see you and his heart watches you. If he sees you in
a good state, it grieves him, and if he sees you in a bad state, it
makes him happy.”*[^13]

Investigate Before Buying a House
---------------------------------

The Noble Prophet said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إلتَمِسوا الجَارَ قَبلَ شِراءِ الدّارِ وَالرَّفيقَ قَبلَ الطَّريِقِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Ask about the neighbor before buying the house, and the travelling
companion before starting the journey.”*[^14]

The Domain of Neighborhood
--------------------------

Imam Sadiq quoted on the authority of the Commander of the Faithful :

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حَريمُ المَسجِدِ أرْبَعُونَ داراً والجِوارُ أربَعون داراً مِن
أرْبَعَةِ جَوانِبِها.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The domain of the neighborhood of a mosque and a house is forty houses
in four directions.”*[^15]

Imam Sajjad said: “The people living in forty houses on either side of
your house are your neighbors. You must respect their rights, live with
them, and associate with them in peace. Seek God’s help to do so.
