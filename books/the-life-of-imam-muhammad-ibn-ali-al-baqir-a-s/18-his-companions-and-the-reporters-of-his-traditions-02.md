Kuhayl and al-Hakam ‘Utayba that they will find no authentic knowledge
in the East or in the West except the knowledge of the members of the
House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them.”

Abu Basïr reported. He said: “I asked Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir), peace be on
him: Is the witness of an illegitimate child permitted?” “No,” he, peace
be on, replied. I (Abu Basïr) said: “Al-Hakam bin ‘Utayba says that it
is permitted.” “O Allah, do not forgive him his sins,” al-Baqir prayed.
Allah said: “It is remembrance for you and your people,” al-Baqir added.
Let al-Hakam go to the right and to the left. By Allah, such knowledge
is not found except with the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace
be on them. Gabriel came down to them.

al-Tammar (Salim) have gone a stray. They are among those about whom

Allah, the Great and Almighty, said: ‘And some of the people say: We
have believed in Allah and the hereafter. And they are not
believers.’”[^47]

Zarara reported. He said: “When I was a young man, I went to Medina. I
entered the large tent of Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir), peace be on him. I saw
some people sitting in the tent. There was no one in front of the
assembly. I saw a man sitting on the side. The man was treating himself
by cupping. I was sure that the man was Abu Ja‘far. So, I walked towards
him. I greeted him. He returned the greetings. I sat in front of him.
The cupper was behind him. Then he asked me: “Are you from the sons of
A‘yun?” “Yes, I am Zarara b. A‘yun,” I replied. “I have recognized you
with resemblance,” he said. “Has Hamran performed the pilgrimage (to
Mecca)?” he asked. “No, he sends you his greetings,” I replied. “He is
among the true believers. He will never retreat (from the Imamte). When
you see him, send him my greetings. Say to him: Why have you related to
al-Hakam bin ‘Utayba.? The trustees (of the Apostle) are traditionists.
Do not tell him and those the same as him about such a tradition.” he
said.[^48]

‘Utayba and the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them.

those who declared the religion of Allah. We will mention some of his
affairs:

### His Scientific Rank.

###

Hamran was among the main religious scholars, who conveyed the message
of Islam, and knew it in detail. He learned his sciences from the Imams
of the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them. He studied
under Imam al-Baqir, peace be on him. Then he studied under Imam
al-Sadiq, peace be on him. He learned many of his sciences. Imam
al-Sadiq, peace be on him, supplied proof of his wide knowledge and
outstanding merits. The narrators said that a Syrian came to Imam
al-Sadiq, peace be on him, to test him. The Imam, peace be on him, asked
the Syrian:

“What is your need?”

“I have heard that you have knowledge of all questions,” replied the
Syrian.

The Imam smiled at him, and then he said to him:

“In what?” asked the Imam.

“In the Koran,” replied the Syrian.

The Imam turned to Hamran and said to him:

“Take the man.”

The Syrian became angry and said: “I want to (question) you, not
Hamran.”

The Imam smiled at him and said:

“If you overcame Hamran, then you would overcome me.”

The Syrian began questioning Hamran, who answered all his questions.
Then the Imam asked the Syrian: “What is your opinion of Hamran?”

“He is skillful. He has answered all my questions.”[^63]

This initiative of Hamran shows his wide knowledge and sciences. Abu
Ghalib al-Razi said: “Hamran was among the greatest Shi‘ite scholars. He
was among those who memorized the Koran by heart. Moreover, he was an
excellent grammarian and linguist.”[^64]

### His Rank with the Imams

###

Hamran had an honorable rank with the Imams of guidance, peace be on
them. Many traditions were reported on their authority. In the
traditions they praised and lauded him. The following are some of these
traditions:

1. Bukayr b. A‘yun reported he said: “I went to make the pilgrimage (to
Mecca) for the first time I arrived at Mina. There I asked (the people)
about the tent of Abu ‘Abd Allah (al-Sadiq). I entered the tent. I found
some people in it. I looked at their faces, but did not find him among
them. He was on the side in the tent. He was treating himself by
cupping. He said: ‘Come to me.’ Then he said: ‘O Young man, are you from
the children of A‘yun?’ I said: ‘Yes, may Allah make me ransom for you.’
He said: ‘Who are you?’ I said: ‘I am Bukayr b. A‘yun.’ He said to me:
‘What Hamran has done?’ I said: ‘He will not perform the hajj this year.
He is longing for you. He sends you his greetings.’ He returned the
greetings, and then he said: ‘Hamran is a believer. He is among the
people of the garden. By Allah, he has no doubt about (the Imamate).

2. Zayd al-Shahham reported. He said: [Abu ‘Abd Allah (al-Sadiq), peace
be on him, said to me:] “No one has put my words into effect, obeyed my
orders, and followed my example except two men, may Allah have mercy on
them. They are ‘Abd Allah b. Abï Yafoor, and Hamran b. A‘yun. They are
two sincere believers from our Shi‘ites. Their names are with us in the
book of the people of the right hand (ashab al-yemeen), which Allah gave
to Mohammed, may Allah bless him and his family.

3. Abu Khalid al-Akhras reported on the authority of Hamran, who said:
[I said to Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir), peace be on him:] “May I be your
ransom, I have sworn that I will not leave Medina till I know what I
am.” He, peace be on him, said: “O Hamran, what do you want?” I (Hamran)
said: “I want you to tell me what I am.” He, peace be on him, said: “You
are our follower (shi‘ite) in here and hereafter.”[^65]

Al-Kashi reported another group of traditions that show the high rank of
Hamran with the Imams of the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace
be on them.

### His intense Obedience to the Imams.

###

Hamran was very obedient to the Imams. He loved them from the bottom of
his heart. The narrators said: “When Hamran sat with his companions, he
mentioned the outstanding merits of the members of the House (ahl
al-Bayt), peace be on them. When his companions wanted to mix the
outstanding merits of the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be
on them, with other than them, he left them and went away.”[^66] Indeed,
this is the maximum degree of obedience and love for the Imam.

night” One day, I (Barïd) met Abu Ja‘far, peace be on him, and told him
about what Hamza had said. Abu Ja‘far said: “Hamza tells lies. May Allah
curse him. The Satan is unable to appear in the shape of a prophet or
the trustee of a prophet.”[^69] Traditions similar to this were

him.

137. Hamza al-Tayyar
--------------------

Shaykh al-Tusi numbered him as one of the companions of Imam al-Baqir,
peace be on him. Al-Barqi numbered him as one of the companions of Imam
al-Sadiq, peace be on him. Al-Kashi reported on the authority of Hamza
al-Tayyar, who said: “Abu ‘Abd Allah (al-Sadiq), peace be on him, asked
me about the recitation of the Koran. I (Hamza) said: ‘I am
inappropriate for that.’ He (Abu ‘Abd Allah) said: ‘However, your father
was appropriate for that.’ Then he asked me about the religious duties.
I said (I am inappropriate for that.)’ He said: ‘However, your father
was appropriate for that.’ Then he (Abu ‘Abd Allah) said: ‘ I had a
friend from Qurash. The friend was a scholar. He recited the Koran. He
and your father met in the house of Abu Ja‘far, peace be on him. Abu
Ja‘far said to them: ‘Question each other.’ They did that. The Qurayshi
man said to Abu Ja‘far: ‘I have understood what you wanted. You wanted
to tell me that there were persons the same as this one among your
companions’ Abu Ja‘far replied: ‘Yes, you are right. What is your
opinion of him.’”[^70] This account shows that Hamza had outstanding
merits and wide knowledge. The Narrators said: “Imam al-Sadiq, peace be
on him, prevented some of his Shi‘ites from debating with others on
theological problems. For they were not specialist in such problems.
Hamza heard of that. So, he hurried to Imam al-Sadiq, peace be on him.
He said to him: ‘I have heard that you debating with the people

on theological matters.’ The Imam said: ‘We do not hate your debating
with them.’”[^71] This narration shows that Ja‘far had excellent
abilities in theological debates. Rather, he was specialist in them. The
biographers said: “Hamza made many theological debates about the members
of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them.

Hamza was very obedient to the members of House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be
on them. He came to Imam Abu ‘Abd Allah al-Sadiq, peace be on him. The
Imam took him by the hand. Then he numbered for him the Imams whose
obedience Allah made obligatory. When he, peace be on him, came to his
father, Mohammed al-Baqir, he stopped. So, Hamza said to him: “May Allah
make me ransom for you, if you split open a pomegranate and made some of
it lawful and some of it unlawful, I would testify that what you
prohibited was unlawful, and what you made lawful was lawful.” The Imam
was pleased with Hamza’s words. He made him know that he (Abu ‘Abd Allah
al-Sadiq) would be the Imam after his father, al-Baqir. Then he said to
Hamza: “It is sufficient for to believe in his (al-Sadiq’s) words. I am
like them (the Imams). I have the same rights as they have. Allah, the
Exalted, said: ‘(Remember) the day when We will call every people with
their Imam.’ If you want to be among them on the Day of Judgment, then
follow his (Abu ‘Abd Allah’s) words.’”[^72]

Hamza, may Allah have mercy on him, had firm faith. He faithfully
defended the members of House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them. When Imam
al-Sadiq, peace be on him, heard of his death, he said: “May Allah have
mercy on Hamza. He may be pleased with him. Hamza faithfully defended
the members of House (ahl al-Bayt).”[^73]

164. Zarara bin A‘yun
---------------------

He was an outstanding Moslem. He was a signpost of the religion. He was
among the greatest jurists and scholars. We will take about some aspects
of his excellent character:

### His Lineage

###

Zarara was a Roman. His father, A‘yun b. Sansan, was the Roman slave of
a person from the Banu (sons of) Shayban. He learned the Koran. So, his
master released him. He asked him to join his (master’s) lineage.
However, A‘yun refused that. He said to his master: “Let me follow my
lineage.” Sansan was a monk in the country of the Romans.

As for Zarara, his real name is ‘Abd Rabah. Zarara was his nick-name. He
was given the kunya was Abu al-Hasan.[^100]

### His Scientific Rank

###

Zarara was the most famous of all the Moslem scholars in outstanding
qualities, piety, and cleaving to the religion. The historians said that
he had excellent abilities in jurisprudence. No one of the scholars of
his time had such abilities. He was among the founders of the
jurisprudence of the members of House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them.
The jurists rely on his narrations. They prefer them to other
narrations. They resort to them when they want to conclude religious
precepts. Zarara’s narrations are not confined to a certain
jurisprudential chapter. Rather, they include all the jurisprudential
chapters such as worship and dealings.

### His Narration from Imam al-Baqir

###

Zarara was the most prominent student of Imam Abu Ja‘far. He reported
1236 traditions on his authority. He also narrated 449 traditions on the
authority of Imam al-Sadiq, peace be on him.[^101]

### Who narrated from Zarara?

###

A large group of scholars and jurists narrated on his authority. Among
them was Abu Ayyub, Abu Basïr, Abu Jumayla, Abu Zyyad al-Hindi, Abu
al-Safa’ij, Abu ‘Ayniya, and the like.[^102]

### His Talents were praised.

###

Zarara’s talents are outstanding. A large group of thinkers and scholars
lauded them. The following are some of them.

### A. Jamïl Darrajj

###

Jamïl b. Darrajj praised Zarara’s talents and abilities. It was said to
him: “Who is the best one in your presence? Who is the adornment of you
assembly?” We were about Zarara as the young boys were around the
teacher,” he replied.[^103]

Jamïl Darrajj was among the prominent scholars. He was among the
numbered jurists. He admitted that he was nothing before Zarara. Rather,
he was the same as the young boy before his teacher.

### B. Al-Najashi

###

Al-Najashi said: “Zarara bin A‘yun b. Sansan was the retainer of the
Banu (sons of) ‘Abd Allah. He was the shaykh of our companions at his
time. He was the foremost of them. He was a reciter of the Koran. He was
a jurist, a theologian, and a poet. The excellent religious qualities
gathered in him. He was truthful in what he said.”[^104]

### C. Al-Kashi

###

Al-Kashi said: “The Shi‘ites agreed on the truthfulness of the early
companions of Abu Ja‘far and of Abu ‘Abd Allah, peace be on them. They
relied on them in jurisprudence. They (the Shi‘ites) said: ‘The most
knowledgeable of the early people in jurisprudence are six persons. They
are Zarara, Ma’ruf b. Kharbudh, Barïd, Abu Basïr al-Asadi, al-Fudayl b.
Yasar, and Mohammed b. Moslem al-Taaifi.’ They (the Shi‘ites) said: ‘The
most knowledgeable of the six persons in jurisprudence is
Zarara.’”[^105]

### D. Ibn al-Nadïm

###

Ibn al-Nadïm said: “Zarara is the greatest Shi‘ite in jurisprudence,
traditions, theology, and Shiism.”[^106]

These words show that Zarara had outstanding scientific abilities. These
abilities made him occupy the first position in knowledge.

### Imam al-Sadiq and Zarara

###

Imam al-Sadiq, peace be on him, respected and admired Zarara. For Zarara
was among the main scholars and jurists who studied under his
(al-Sadiq’s) father and preserved his cultural scientific wealth. Many
traditions reported on the authority of Imam al-Sadiq, peace be on him.
In the traditions, the Imam praised and lauded Zarara. The following is
some of the traditions:

A. Al-Fadl b. ‘Abd al-Malik reported. He said: [I heard Abu ‘Abd Allah
(al-Sadiq), peace be on him, say:] “The most lovable people, dead or
living, with me are four (persons). They are Barïd b. Mu‘awiya
al-‘Ajali, Zarara, Mohammed b. Moslem, and al-Ahwal.”[^107]

This narration shows the sincere love of the Imam, peace be on them, for
these four persons. For they raised the banner of Islam and enlightened
the life of Moslems through their sciences and morals.

B. Jamïl b. Darrajj reported. He said: [I heard Abu ‘Abd Allah
(al-Sadiq), peace be on him, say:] “Give good news to the humble about
the garden. They are Barïd b. Mu‘awiya al-’Ajali, Abu Basïr (layth b.
al-Bakhtari al-Muradi), Mohammed b. Moslem, and Zarara. They are
highborn persons. They are the trustees of Allah over His lawful and
unlawful. Were it not for them, the traditions of the Prophet would be
obliterated.”[^108]

These Mujahideen rendered excellent services to Islam and Moslems. For
they preserved the traditions of the Imams of the members of the House
(ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them. Such traditions represent the guidance
and essence of Islam.

C. Dawud b. Sarhan reported on the authority of Imam Abu ‘Abd Allah
(al-Sadiq), peace be on him, who said: “My father’s companions were
ornaments before and after their death. I mean Zarara, Mohammed b.
Moslem, Layth al-Muradi, and Barïd al-‘Ajali. It is they who are just
and truthful.”[^109]

These chosen persons were ornaments for the members of the House (ahl
al-Bayt), peace be on them. For they had good behavior and high moral
standards. They were a good example for those who wanted to follow them.
After their death, they are also ornaments for the members of the House
(ahl al-Bayt), peace be on him. For they have left behind them
scientific knowledge.

D. Sulayman b. Khalid al-Aqta‘ reported: [I heard Abu ‘Abd Allah
(al-Sadiq), peace be on him, say:] “No one has enlivened our fame and
our traditions except Barïd b. Mu‘awiya al-‘Ajali, Abu Basïr (layth b.
al-Bakhtari al-Muradi), Mohammed b. Moslem, and Zarara. Were it not for
them, no one would conclude (religious precepts). They are the
preservers of the religion. They are the trustees of my father over the
lawful and unlawful of Allah. They are close to us in the world. They
will be close to us in the next world.”[^110]

These jurists were the preservers of the religion. They were sincere
custodians over the lawful and the unlawful of Allah. Had it not been
for them the traditions of the Prophet and of the Imam would have been
extinguished. It was they who maintained the traditions of the Imams
when they recorded them. So, their services to Islam are wonderful.

E. Jamïl b. Darrajj reported. He said: [I entered the house of Abu ‘Abd
Aallah (al-Sadiq), peace be on him. He asked me:] “Have you seen the
person who has just left the house?” “Yes,” I replied,” He is among our
Kufan companions.” He, peace be on him, said: “May Allah not hallow his
soul nor may He hallow those who are like him. He mentioned persons whom
my father appointed as trustees over the lawful and the unlawful of
Allah. He said that they were the container of my father’s knowledge,
and

that they were the store of my secret. As for the real companions of my
father, Allah removes evil from the people of the earth through them.
They are the stars of my followers (Shi‘ites), whether they are dead or
living. They enliven my father’s reputation. Through them, Allah
discloses all heresies. They purify this religion from the claims of the
liars and the interpretation of the extremists.”

Then Imam Abu ‘Abd Allah (al-Sadiq), peace be on him, wept. Jamïl b.
Darrajj was astonished. So, he asked the Imam: “Who are they?”

The Imam, peace be on him, answered: “The blessing and mercy of Allah be
on them, whether they are dead or living. They are Barïd al-‘Ajali,
Zarara, Abu Basïr, and Mohammed b. Moslem. Jamïl, you will know the
affair of this man, who disparaged Zarara. He belongs to the companions
of Abu al-Khattab.”[^111]

This tradition show that Zarara and his learned companions were of great
importance. For they were the store of the secret of the Imamate. They
were the trustees of Imam Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir), peace be on him, over
the lawful and the lawful of Allah. They did their best to bring the
community to Allah.

F. Imam Abu ‘Abd Allah (al-Sadiq), peace be on him, said: “May Allah
have mercy on Zarara b. A‘yun. Were it not for Zarara and his
companions, my father’s traditions would be extinguished.”[^112]

Traditions similar to these praised Zarara’s outstanding qualities. The
showed his rank and position with the Imams of the members of the House
(ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them. They denoted that he was in their
hearts and feelings of the Imams of the members of the House (ahl
al-Bayt), peace be on them, for they loved him very much.

### Slanderous Traditions

###

Some traditions have been mentioned. The traditions damage Zarara’s
reputation. Surely, some of the traditions are fabricated, and some of
them were said by Imam Abu ‘Abd Allah (al-Sadiq), peace be on him. The
Imam said such traditions not to show malice towards him nor to damage
his reputation. Rather, he said them to save Zarara from the Umayyad
government. The following are some of these traditions:

A. Al-Dhahabi reported on the authority of b. al-Sammak, who said: “I
made a pilgrimage (to Mecca). Then Zarara b. A‘yun met me in Qadisiya (a
city in Iraq). He said to me : ‘I have a great need with you.’ ‘What is
your need?’ I asked. ‘When you meet Ja‘far b. Mohammed (al-Sadiq), send
him my greetings. Ask him to tell me whether I am from the people of the
fire or from the people of the garden,’ Zarara replied. However, I
blamed him for that. Then Zarara said to me: ‘The Imam knows that.’
Zarara insisted on that till I responded to him. When I met Ja‘far b.
Mohammed (al-Sadiq), I told him about what Zarara had said. So, he said
to me: ‘Zarara is among the people of the fire.’ Ja‘far (al-Sadiq’s)
words moved me. So, I asked him: ‘From where have you known that?’ He
replied: ‘Whoever says that I have such knowledge is among the people of
the fire.’ When I returned, I met Zarara. Then I told him that the Imam
said to me: ‘You (Zarara) are from the people of the fire.’ Thus, Zarara
said: ‘He (al-Sadiq) weighed to you from the bag of the lime.[^113]
‘What is the bag of the lime?’ I (b. al-Sammak)

asked. ‘Al-Sadiq put precautionary dissimulation into effect,’ Zarara
explained.[^114] This narration is unacceptable. For Zarara opposed b.
al-Sammak in beliefs. Besides Zarara was among the Moslem thinkers and
scholars. So, was it important for him to ask such insignificant
questions? Noteworthy, man knows his final result according to his deeds
in this world.

B. Al-Kashi reported on the authority of Masma‘ Kardïn b. Sayyar, who
said: [I heard Abu ‘Abd Allah (al-Sadiq), peace be on him, say: “May
Allah curse Barïd! May Allah curse Zarara!”[^115]

C. Al-Kashi reported on the authority of Layth al-Muradi, who said: [[I
heard Abu ‘Abd Allah (al-Sadiq), peace be on him, say: “Zarara will not
die but astray.”[^116] This narration is similar to the previous
narrations. It is either fabricated or the Imam said it to save Zarara’s
life from the Umayyad government that illegally shed the blood of the
Shi‘ites of the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them.
‘Abd Allah b. Zarara confirmed this idea when he said: [Abu ‘Abd Allah
(al-Sadiq), peace be on him, said to me:] “Send my greetings to you
father. Tell him: I (al-Sadiq) slander you to defend you. The people and
the enemy try to persecute and kill the persons we love and praise. They
praise the persons we dispraise. I find fault with you, for you are
famous for your love for us and your inclination to us. The people
dispraise you, for you love us and incline to us. I want to find fault
with you to make them praise your position in the religion. With that we
are able to drive their evil away from you. Allah, the Great and
Almighty, said: ‘As for the boat, it belonged to (some) poor men who
worked on the river and I wished that I would damage it, and there was
behind them a king who seized every boat by force.’ So, understand this
example, may Allah have mercy on you. By Allah, you are the most lovable
person with me.”[^117]

### Zarara is Immortal

###

Zarara faced many difficulties and misfortunes for his faith and
doctrine. Yet he was loyal to the Imams of guidance. He recorded their
sciences and jurisprudence. He related that to the scholars and jurists.
He strengthened the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on
them. For he had outstanding merits and high moral standrads.

The historians said: “Zarara became ill. He suffered from great pains
for several days. Then he passed away delighted. For rendered matchless
services to Islam. He died in the year 150 A. H. That was a month before
the death of Imam al-Sadiq, peace be on him. So, the Moselms lost a
signpost of knowledge and culture.” May Allah be please with him. Peace
be on him on the day when he was born, on the day when he died, and on
the day when he will be raised from the dead.
