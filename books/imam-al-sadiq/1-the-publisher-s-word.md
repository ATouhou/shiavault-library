The Publisher. S Word
=====================

Gentle reader,
--------------

This book, between your hands, is among the masterpieces of the late
shaykh Mohammed Husayn al- Muzaffar. The Shaykh was a prominent scholar
with outstanding merits. He rendered great services to the Muslim world.
Among them is this book he has written on Imam al- Sadiq, peace be on
him, to show his uniqe qualities.

The book, written in Arabic, was published several times by the
Theological School in Najaf. Then it has been published by the
Theological School in Qum.

Because of the historical importance of the book, we have decided to
publish it in English to avail Muslims all over the world. Besides we
have shortened some of its subject so as not to be boring.

So, gentle reader, read the book carefully and send us your viewpoints
and suggestions to put them into effect, for as they say:. Many heads
are better than one.. Thank you.
