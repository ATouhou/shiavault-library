19. Ashura Day
==============

The authors of Iqbaalul Aamaal, al-Mazaar and Zaadul Maad have narrated
a tradition from Imam Sadiq (as) on the authority of Abdullah Ibne Sinan
(Allah’s mercy be on him), which commences with the following sentence:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اللهم عذب الفجرة الذين شاقوا رسولك
  </p>
</blockquote>

“O Allah! Chastise the transgressors who bore enmity against your
messenger.....”

The secret behind this invocation is the enormous calamity and torture
that was afflicted on our master, Imam Husain (as) on this day at
Kerbala. Allah the Almighty has promised that He will take revenge from
those who oppressed him (as) through our master, Imam az-Zaman (aj), as
spoken in the traditions. Thus, when a believer remembers on this day
the calamities afflicted on the oppressed Imam (as) and that Allah the
Almighty has pre- destined somebody to avenge his blood, his belief and
love exhort him to invoke and ask for the reappearance of this avenger
from the King of the Heavens.

Hence, such a demand has been recommended in this supplication.
Moreover, one who prays for this day will find an occasion whose reward
cannot be measured by anyone except Allah the High and that is, seeking
the revenge of the blood of Imam Husain (as), the leader of the martyrs.
