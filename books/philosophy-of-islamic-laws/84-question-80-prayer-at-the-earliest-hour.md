Question 80: Prayer At The Earliest Hour
========================================

**Question:** In order to prove the merit of praying at the earliest
hour some scholars have said that Imam az-Zaman (a.s.) prays at this
time and then people who pray at this hour their prayer is also accepted
by Allah due to the barakah (bounty) of the prayer of Imam (a.s.).

But we also know that different areas fall in different time zones.
Leave alone the different countries sometimes one country has many times
zones. In this condition only the prayer of the people of that area is
with Imam (a.s.) where he is praying. Apart from this the Prayer timings
of other people cannot be same as that of Imam (a.s.). How can we solve
this problem?

**Answer:** Those who have presented this argument to prove the merit of
praying at the earliest hour, they mean to say that the prayer which is
prayed the earliest hour those prayers are equal to the prayers with
Imam (a.s.) because he (a.s.) also prays at the earliest hour. And it is
due to this equal value, the prayers of others are also accepted by
Allah.

This is in no way connected to the matter of time zones etc. In other
words it does not mean that prayers have to be performed at one single
time. Rather it denotes the fact that all the Prayers have been
performed at their respective earliest hours, which every person
performs according to his time zone.
