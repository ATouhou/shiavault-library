N - Nafi'i Ibn Hilal
====================

He is Nafi'i Ibn Hilal Ibn Jamal Ibn Sa'ad and one of the martyrs in
Kar- bala. He was a known figure in Kufa and an excellent reciter of
Imam Ali's narrations. He had been with Imam Ali in all three of his
battles: Siffeen, Nahrewan, and Al-Jamal. After Muslim was killed in
Kufa, he quietly hid himself and later on joined Imam Husayn and came
with him to Karbala. In Karbala, Nafi'i spoke with enthusiasm to â€˜Umar
Ibn Sa'ads army. They in return threw stones at him until they broke his
arm and then they came and took him to Shimr who killed him. Some say
his name was Hilal Ibn Nafi'i.
