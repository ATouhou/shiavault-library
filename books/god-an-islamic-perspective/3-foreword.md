Foreword
========

This booklet was initially written for the Bilal Muslim Mission of
Tanzania by the renowned Muslim scholar Sayyid Sa'eed Akhtar Rizvi as
the second unit of the Islamic Correspondence Course. It deals with the
first Article of Faith namely *at-Tawhid* or Divine Unity.

Since we found the booklet extremely interesting, and our first
publication of 5,000 copies was in such great demand by interested
readers, this issue was subsequently reprinted more than ten times in
large quantities for mass circulation.

Now, in this reprinted edition, the author has completely revised the
booklet and has added more facts and information to support his
theory.
Finally, we invoke the Almighty Allah for guidance and success in our
work.
