The Ninth Spurious Argument: Who is the family of the Prophet
=============================================================

Some people criticize the Shias for limiting the Prophet’s family to
Imam Ali, Fatima and their sons Hasan and Husayn (peace be upon them)
and excluding the Prophet’s wives and uncles.

The Answer
----------

The Prophet’s sayings prove that his family members are only those five
persons. Such sayings, narrated by some of the Companions are mentioned
in many Sunni books.

At-Tirmidhi mentioned in his book as-Sahih, vol. 13 p. 200 Egyptian
edition-, a tradition narrated by Umar bin Abu Salama where he said that
the Qur’anic verse,

***Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you, O people of
the House, and to purify you with a thorough purification. (33:33),***

was revealed in Umm Salama’s house. Then the Prophet (s) called for
Fatima, Hasan, Husayn and Imam Ali to come behind him. He then covered
themselves with a garment and said: O Allah, these are my family. Keep
away uncleanness from them and purify them thoroughly.

Umm Salama said, “am I with them?’ The Prophet answered, “You have your
standing and you will be to a good end.’

The author mentioned other relations that are narrated by Umm Salama,
Ma’qil bin Yassar, Abul-Hamra’ and Anas bin Malik.

Finally, the tradition concerning the Qur’anic verse of purification and
its being specifically about them (Peace be upon them), in the words of
al Haddad al Hadhrami is one of the correct, famous, widespread, and
well known traditions upon which all the umma has agreed and seventeen
of great Hadithists have confirmed that it was true.
