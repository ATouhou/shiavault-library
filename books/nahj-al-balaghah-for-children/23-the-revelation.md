The Revelation
==============

When **the Revelation** descended on the

Prophet, may God bless him and his

Household, I heard a wailing cry.

I said: “O messenger of Allah,

what is this wailing?”

He replied,

“This is Satan, who has lost

all hope of being worshipped.

O Ali, you see what I see,

and you hear what I hear,

only that you are not a prophet.

But you are a minister

and on the path of virtue.”

(Sermon 192)
