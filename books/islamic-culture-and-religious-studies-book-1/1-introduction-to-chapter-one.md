Introduction To Chapter One
===========================

In The Name Of Allah (S.W.T.), the Beneficent, the Merciful

**TAWHEED : Knowing God and Worshipping Him**

A Human being is constantly in search of knowing the Truth. He explores
different ways in which to confirm his beliefs and when he succeeds in
going back to his FITRA (Nature), he eventually reaches the point where
he realises the need of a Master and Creator - Allah (S.W.T.).

In the Islamic beliefs (Aqaidi-Islami), 'To Know God' is one of the
fundamental issues for Muslims. It is only after proving His existence
that a Muslim can believe in His divine system of Law and Order. All
other moral, spiritual and religious values are included in the essence
of Tawheed (Oneness) of Allah (S.W.T.).

In order to understand Tawheed and be able to submit to Him, it becomes
necessary for us all to undertake the spiritual journey towards Imaan
(Faith) and Taqwa (Piety). A person might believe that this is a
difficult path to walk on but it not impossible. All it requires is a
strong urge to know the great Maker of the Universe!

We must remember that by learning the true Islam, we will be able to
practise its valuable teachings.

It is necessary for us to understand that if we want to reach
perfection in both Imaan and Amal-e-Saaleh (Good Actions), we have to
study the lives of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) and Infallible Aimmah
(a.s.).

In this book, each and every chapter is directed towards appreciating
the deeper meaning of Tawheed (Absolute Oneness of Allah (S.W.T.)). The
ideas and rules we will study are all ways in which to discover the
truth and when we learn Akhlaaq (Moral Excellence) it is because our
good conduct will allow us to reach out to other people around the world
and call them back to the Truth.

We need to strive to have a deep understanding of our Lord. We also
need to reflect upon the teachings of the Holy Qur'an. Remember, our
main aim in studying the following chapters is to create a strong bond
with Allah (S.W.T.)!

May He make us all successful in this aim. Ameen.


**Lesson 1 : The Best of Lessons**

My class teacher is one of the best teachers in our school. She is
kind, friendly and has the most beautiful smile! She always makes sure
that we understand what she is teaching and never gets angry no matter
how many questions we ask! Mrs. Jawad is my favourite teacher!

Before she begins any lesson, Mrs. Jawad always recites Bismillahir
Rahmaan Rahim. It is a verse from the Holy Qur'an meaning 'In the Name
of Allah (S.W.T.), the Most Kind, the Most Merciful' and when we hear it
reminds of our Creator and our purpose in studying. This makes it easier
to concentrate and understand what she is teaching us. Isn't it amazing
what strength one Holy verse can give us?

The other day, Mrs. Jawad asked us, "Children! Do you think it would be
a good idea to study about ourselves?"

We all replied, "Yes!"

She smiled and told us, "Well then, let's go out and investigate the
Human Body!" How excited we were as we gathered our books, drawing
papers and pencils! Soon we were set to go. As we walked out of the
school gates, we met a builder and his crew at work.

We greeted the men and then Mrs. Jawad drew our attention to the tall
building next to our school and said, "Look at the building. See all the
construction work? Come a little closer and see how the bricks stick to
one another and form strong walls.

Isn't it amazing? You can obviously see that the workmen are very
skilled and the design must be that of a gifted architect. This is just
an example of the talent it takes to plan and create anything. When the
building is completed, it will look even better that it does today!"

As we were studying the building in a new light, she continued, "Did
you ever think of your own bodies and how delicate everything inside you
is? What about the various processes that go and the parts that work
like big machines every second? Think about it for a moment…

"Can you remember the names of each and every organ of your body? Can
you imagine the cells that are within your body? You all know that cells
cannot be seen by our naked eyes, they can only be seen through a
microscope because they are so tiny, and yet, they are so important that
without them we would not be alive!

"My dears! Do you know how each cell works? Do you know that each one
has its own unique shape and function? Yes! It does! The white blood
cells and the red blood cells are different but at the same time, they
work together in perfect harmony and do their task so well, it is
mind-boggling!"

By now, we were all captivated by what she was saying and each one of
us was straining to hear her soft voice above the noises from the
construction site. Mrs. Jawad looked at all of us and asked, "Have you
thought about the more complex systems in your body, like the nervous
and digestive systems?

Have you ever thought of how many muscles contract and expand in our
bodies when we perform the simplest actions? How about the hundreds of
messages that are sent to the brain all the time, which allow us to co-
ordinate our actions so easily? Sub'haana-Allah! Glory belongs only to
Allah (S.W.T.)! "Isn't it really amazing how complex our bodies are and
how they work! When you hurt yourself, the cells in your body
immediately react to cure the wound!

"Therefore, dear children, what do you understand from all this? What
do you learn from comparing the construction of the building with your
bodily functions?

Don't you think that just like the building there is a Master Planner
behind the workings of your body? And is this Planner anyone other than
the Supreme Creator who has designed everything - big and small - so
perfectly in the universe?

"When we realise and appreciate Allah (S.W.T.)'s favours, then we
understand that it is our duty to show obedience and gratitude to our
Merciful Creator.

"Children! I am very happy that we had this lesson today. I hope what
we have learnt will show you the importance of a Creator. Through such
simple examples we can increase our faith and certainty in our Supreme
Lord, Insha Allah."

After this we all headed back to class filled with thoughts about the
wonderful things Allah (S.W.T.) has created, most importantly,
ourselves!

A Holy Verse
The Qur'an says:

"And in the earth are signs for those who are sure in conviction, and
also in your ownselves; will you then not see? …"
Sura Zaariaat, Verses 20 & 21

SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT …

1. We, as Allah (S.W.T.)'s creation, must try to learn about and
investigate the human anatomy.

2. We need to find out more about the functions of various cells in our
body.

3. As Muslims, it is our duty to Allah (S.W.T.) is to:

a) Show thanks for His countless favours and
b) Try to follow His divine path even in simple ways.

Think and Answer

Name the smallest organ in the human body.
Name 5 different body cells and describe their characteristics and
functions.
How would you recognise your Creator from the examples discussed in the
lesson?

What is our duty towards our Kind Lord?

**ANECDOTE : FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE SUN**

A young man once asked a Wise Teacher, "Why is it that the sun is so
bright and charming and yet no one has ever fallen in love with it?"

The Wise Teacher replied: "It is because, it is seen every day in most
places. Where it is not seen often, it is really loved and anxiously
awaited."
