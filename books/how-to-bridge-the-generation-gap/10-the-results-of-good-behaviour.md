The Results of Good Behaviour
=============================

The Father
----------

My child! Think and see how do you wish your children to treat you and
what do you expect from them. Then you would know how your father and
mother want you to treat them, and you will understand that their
expectations from you are fair and justified.

My child! If you wish your children to treat you nicely, appreciate you,
and fulfil their obligations to you; and in the hard times, share your
sorrow; and in the good times, be the source of your pride, in short to
treat you with good behaviour, then do likewise for your father and
mother and set yourself as an example for them, Imam As-Sadiq (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بروا آباءكم يبركم ابناءكم
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Treat your fathers with benevolence, so that your children will treat
you with benevolence.” [^1]

The Child
---------

It is my ardent desire to have quite capable children to help me out,
and to cherish me. Thus, as they have said, I will have to improve
myself and to establish an equitable relationship between you and me so
that according to the principle of equal returns be worthy of having
favourite children. Right now, I pledge to treat you in no way but with
utmost benevolence.
