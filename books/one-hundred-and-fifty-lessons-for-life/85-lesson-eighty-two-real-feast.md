Lesson Eighty Two: Real Feast
=============================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنّما هُوَ عِيْدٌ لِمَنْ قَبِلَ اللّهُ صِيامَهُ وَ شَكَرَ قِيامَهُ وَ
كُلُّ يَوْم لايُعْصَى اللّهُ فِيهِ فَهُوَ عَيْدٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The day of feast following the month of fasting is the feast for those
whose fasts are accepted and their worship is favored by God, and any
day in which you do not commit a sin, is the day of feast (Eid). [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Feast and happiness after one month of fasting in the blessed month of
Ramadan is actually the feast of overcoming sensual desires, and of
obedience of God’s command. Thus, this is a day of feast only for those
who have been victorious in fulfilling this great divine duty and
understanding its true philosophy. However, for those shameless people
who have not respected this great month and its educational program, it
is nothing but a day of mourning and disgrace.
