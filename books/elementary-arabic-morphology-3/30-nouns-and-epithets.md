141. A noun is a word that can be used for a person, **یوسف,** animal,
**بهیمة,** or thing, **کتاب,** or a meaning, **إحسان**

142. An epithet is any word that describes a noun, for example:

143. All apalistic nouns can be described. The derived words that can be
described are adverbial nouns of time and place and instrumental nouns.
The rest of them are epithets.

144. Two types of words are added to the category of epithets: a
relative noun, for example: **بیروتي,** and an apalistic noun that
indicates the meaning of a derived noun, for example: **رأیت قائداً
أسد**اً, and lion here means brave. The epithet must follow the word it
is describing in number and gender.
