Part Six: The extent and Boundaries of Fadak
============================================

Fadak just as we have said was apparently a village near Khaibar that
was flourishing and fertile, and its extents were not of that which
would have been concealed from someone; but how strange when Haroon
al-Rashid says to Imam Mossa ibn Jafar:

“Clarify Fadak’s boundaries so that I may return it to you”

Imam (p.b.u.h.) refrained from giving a reply and Haroon continually
insisted on an answer;

Imam (p.b.u.h.) said:

“I will not say so unless by its true extent” Haroon said;

“What are its true boundaries?”

The Imam (p.b.u.h.) replied;

“If I tell its boundaries, surely you will not agree.” Haroon said;

“By the right of your grand-father (the Prophet (p.b.u.h.)) I swear, so
speak of its boundaries (I will give it!)

Imam (p.b.u.h.) said:

“But the first boundary of that land is Aden!”

When Haroon heard this his countenance changed and said; “You don’t say,
you don’t say!…”

The Imam (p.b.u.h.) said:

“And its second boundary is Samargand!”

The traces of uneasiness became more apparent in Haroon’s face.

Imam (p.b.u.h.) then said:

“And the third boundary is Africa!”

Here! Haroon’s face grew black with rage while he said;

“You don’t say…!”

Then the Imam (p.b.u.h.) said:

“And the fourth boundary is the shores of the Caspian sea and Armenia!!”

Haroon said:

“Then nothing remains for us, get up and come sit in my place and rule
over the people, (what you have said is the entire extent of the Islamic
world.)”

Imam (p.b.u.h.) said:

“I told you that if I determined its boundaries you would never give
it.”

It was at this time that Haroon decided to murder Moosa ibn Jaafar
(p.b.u.h.).**( old print, volume 8, page 106, narrated from the book )**

This meaningful tradition is clear proof of the intermingling of the
matter of Fadak with that of the caliphate. It shows of the Prophet’s
(p.b.u.h.) Caliph. If Haroon wished to turn over Fadak he would have
been forced to give up the Caliphate. This very matter made him realize
it possible that whenever Imam Mossa ibn Jaafar (p.b.u.h.) attained
power he could pull him down from the throne of the Caliphate. Therefore
he decided to murder that Hazrat.
