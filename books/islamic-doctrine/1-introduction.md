**What is Islam?**

Islam is the final religion revealed to humanity. The Islamic Message
was delivered through Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him and his
progeny). He received the first revelation in the year 610 after
Christ.

Islam is a principle. A principle is defined as a doctrine plus a
system of life in harmony. The system is in harmony with the doctrine
when the system is built upon and derived from the doctrine.

A person who does not believe in anything except in this world would be
inclined to care for his own pleasure regardless of other people's
welfare. Such a person would find no point in making sacrifices for
others, because materially this means a loss to him.

Yet there are some people who would be moved emo- tionally by
idealistic motives sometimes but such people are usually few and their
work is inconsistent and uncertain. On the other hand, a person who
believes in God and a life after death would provide for the
Hereafter.

He would refrain from bad deeds knowing that great punishment might be
inflicted upon him in the life after death. He would be willing to
sacrifice for others because there is a promise of a reward in the next
world. Hence the behaviour of people is moulded as soon as they decide
which doctrine they adhere to.

Islam is a direct enlightenment of the Creator to humanity. It deals
with all fields of their activity, whether on the individual or
collective level. Special care is given to individ- uals and their
behaviour in order that their spiritual side is strengthened and made
sublime.

This is done through explaining the ideology first, then binding them
to God in prayers, fasting, pilgrimage, etc. The collective aspect is
given due importance, where the social, eco- nomic and political systems
were clearly for- mulated and minutely explained.

Islamic legislation defines two kinds of laws, namely, the
constitutional type and the regulative type. The constitutional laws are
basic and permanent. For instance, the concept of defence against
enemies is a permanent law, but the means of defence are changing with
time and place.

In the past the means of transport and defence were horses, camels and
elephants, etc. But now rockets, aeroplanes, nuclear ships and weapons
are used. Therefore, the consti- tution is concerned with the basic
needs while the - regulative laws are concerned with the best means and
ways to satisfy these require- ments.
