The Real Guidance
=================

Turn to God and to His prophet for guidance whenever you feel uncertain
as to what you have to do. There is the commandment of God delivered to
those people who He wishes to guide aright:

***“O people of the Faith! Obey God and obey His prophet and those from
among you who hold authority over you. And refer to God and His prophet
whenever there is difference of opinion among you.” (4:59)***

To turn to God is in reality to consult the Book of God; and to turn to
the prophet is t follow his universally accepted traditions.
