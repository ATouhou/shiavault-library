Thanksgiving – A Prayer
=======================

**In the name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful**

***He Makes Whom He Pleases Enter into His Mercy***

***(Surah Dahr; 76:31)***

*Thank You, Allah T’aala*

*Is all that I can say*

*For who knows whether we’ll make it*

*With grit, come what may*

*And without Allah’s Mercy*

*We may try all night and day*

*Forgetting what we’re worth*

*A clot of blood, just clay*

*However, with His Mercy*

*A mountain can we move*

*With ease and no great effort*

*Just hope in Him, just love*

*So, Thank You Allah T’aala*

*Is all that I can say*

*Just help me share this blessing*

*With all who come my way*

***Bless Muhammad and his sacred Household***

*incon**s**equential me*
