Peace & Justice on Social Level
===============================

The Prophet of Islam was ahead of his times in promoting peace
and justice in society. It would be worthwhile to look at how he dealt
with non-Muslims minorities and with the enemies during the war time
because the true worth of a society manifests when it is put under
pressure.


With Non-Muslim Minority in Medina
----------------------------------



The Prophet and his followers were a persecuted minority in Mecca. When
the torture became unbearable, he migrated to Medina, a city in northern
Arabia, most of whose inhabitants had already accepted Islam. Once he
settled in Medina, the Prophet realized that there was a minority Jewish
community in that city that had no inclination to accept Islam. He met
them and invited them to a pact with the Muslims so that each religious
group in Medina knew its rights and obligations. Some relevant part of
the charter reads as follows:

• The Jews who enter into this covenant shall be protected from all
insults and vexations; they shall have an equal right as our own people
to our assistance and good offices. The Jews of the various tribes…and
all other non-Muslim residents of Medina shall form with the Muslims one
composite nation

• They shall practice their religion as freely as the Muslims.

• The allies of the Jews shall enjoy the same security and freedom. The
guilty shall be pursued and punished. The Jews shall join the Muslims in
defending Medina against all enemies. The interior of Medina shall be a
sacred place for all who accept this Charter. The allies of the Muslims
and of the Jews shall be as respected as the principal parties of this
Charter.


This agreement between the first Muslim community and the Jewish
community in Medina shows the sense of justice portrayed in the
Prophet’s character in dealing with minorities. It also clearly shows
that the Prophet did not spread Islam, even in the city of Medina, by
force; on the contrary, he promoted peaceful co-existence with followers
of other faiths, especially Jews and Christians. Out of the three
Abrahamic faiths, it is only Islam which has recognized Judaism and
Christianity on a theological level; the Jews and the Christians are
known, in Islam, as Ahlul Kitãb, the People of the Scriptures.

Following the example of Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.) many rulers in
Muslim history maintained peaceful and cordial relations with their
non-Muslim subjects. If we were to compare the attitude of the Muslim
rulers towards the minorities living under their rule during the
nineteenth century—with the attitude of the Europeans and the Americans
towards their minorities, I dare to say that the record of the Muslims
would be much better. Professor Roderic Davison, a prominent historian
of the Ottoman Empire, writes, “It might in fact have been argued that
the Turks were less oppressive of their subject people than were
Prussians of the Poles, the English of the Irish, or the Americans of
the Negroes…There is evidence to show that in this period [i.e., late
19th century], there was emigration from independent Greece into the
Ottoman Empire, since some Greeks found the Ottoman government a more
indulgent master [than their own Greek government].”[^1]

If you study the medieval history of Europe, you will see that
the only model of a peaceful multi-cultural and multi-faith society was
Spain under the Muslim rule—a Spain in which Christians, Jews and
Muslims lived in peace and harmony.


Non-Muslim Relatives & Neighbours
---------------------------------



An Islamic injunction about loving and caring for a neighbour covers all
kinds of neighbours:

***“Worship God and do not associate anything with Him, and be good to
the parents and to the relatives, the orphans, the needy, the neighbour
who is your relative, the neighbour who is not your relative, the fellow
traveler, the wayfarer and the slave. Verily God does not love one who
behaves proudly and boastfully.” (Surah an-Nisaa, 4:36)***

Even if a Muslim’s parents are idol-worshippers, Islam –the religion of
monotheism– instructs him to respect and be kind to them. Almighty God
says in the Qur’ãn:

***“And if they [that is, your parents] insist on you to associate (an
idol) with Me… then do not obey them; however, live with them in this
world kindly…”*** **(Surah al-Luqman, 31:15)**


With Enemies in the Battle Field
--------------------------------


The Qur’ãn instructs the Muslims to maintain justice even when dealing
with their enemies.

***“O you who believe, be maintainers of justice (and bearer of) witness
for (the sake of) God. Let not hatred of a people incite you to act
unjustly; be just—this is nearer to righteousness. And fear God surely
God is aware of what you do.”*** **(Surah al-Maida, 5:8)**

The first battle in the Muslim history is very significant. It took
place in the 2nd year of the Muslim calendar between the Muslims and the
polytheists of Mecca. Even though outnumbered and ill-equipped, the
Muslims defeated the Meccans and took seventy prisoners of war.

The norm among all societies at that time was to either kill the POWs
or make them slaves. But Prophet Muhammad instructed the Muslims to
treat the POWs humanely; they were brought back safely to Medina and
given decent lodging in the houses of the people who had taken them
prisoners. The Qur’ãn decreed that the POWs must not be ill-treated in
any way.

According to a Western biographer of Prophet Muhammad, Sir William
Muir, “In pursuance of Mahomet’s commands, the citizens of
Medina…received the prisoners and treated them with much consideration.
‘Blessings be on the men of Medina’, said one of the prisoners in later
days, ‘they made us ride, while they themselves walked, they gave us
wheaten bread to eat when there was little of it; contenting themselves
with dates.”


The way the Prophet dealt with the prisoners was very revolutionary. The
poor prisoners were released free; those who came from affluent families
of Mecca were returned for a specified ransom. (See the Qur’ãn: Surah
Muhummad, 47:4) But the most interesting case was of those prisoners who
were literate – the Prophet Muhammad made a deal with them that they
could go free if they could teach ten Muslim children how to read and
write.

Even the rules of engagement during war are also important. Whenever
Muslims embarked on the minor jihãd, a defensive jihãd, the Prophet
Muhammad (peace be upon him) had standard instructions regarding
non-combatants and also the environment:

• “Do not violate the treaties.”

• “Do not kill an old person or a child or a woman.”

• “Do not cut down a tree.”

• “Neither burn down the palm-trees nor drown them with water.”

• “Do not cut down a tree bearing fruits.”

• “Do not drown the plantations.”

• “Do not poison the water of the infidels.”[^2]


All this was done fourteen hundred years ago; long, long before
the Geneva Convention came about.

In background of the secret prisons run by the CIA, ‘the manual
of torture’ written by the US army to interrogate the prisoners, and the
disclosure of torture in Abu Ghuraib prison, I can proudly say that the
example and teachings of Prophet Muhammad about Prisoners of War (POWs)
are “definitively good and humane” even according to the standards of
the 21st century.

Prophet Muhammad also specified the rights of animals. He said: (1) Not
to burden it with a load beyond its ability. (2) Not to make it walk
more than its ability. (3) When you reach a rest area, first you, the
rider, must provide the fodder for your animal before taking care of
your own needs. (4) Whenever you pass by a poll of water or a river let
the animal quince its thirst. (5) Do not hit on its face because it also
praises its Lord.
