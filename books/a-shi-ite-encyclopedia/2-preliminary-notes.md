Please note that the addresses of Sahih al-Bukhari which are given in
the form of x.xxx match the Arabic-English version of Sahih al-Bukhari
which is available in most mosques. The first number before the point
indicates the volume number, and the number after the point indicates
the tradition number (not the page number). For example al-Bukhari
Hadith 8.578 indicates volume 8, tradition \#578 for the Arabic-English
version.
