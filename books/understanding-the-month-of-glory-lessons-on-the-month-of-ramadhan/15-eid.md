Eid Mubarak, O you who fasted

Edi Mubarak, brothers and sisters in Islam

Today is Eid, a day of good deeds

Today is Eid, indeed a time for treats

Today my friends, do your duty, pay your Fitr dues

Help the unfortunate, they'll find any of much use

Help the needy, give the zakat, collect the blessings

Allah is Supreme, He'll make your life ever befitting

Forget not the prayers, the Holy Qur'an, their value is astounding

Be ready on the call of Adhaan

Pray for yourself, pray for others, pray for good all the time

Say the prayers, recite the Qur'an, make your life sublime

Come on, Muslims, let us all converge on one ground

Let us all say the prayers together, with one command

Shoulder to shoulder we'll stand, together we'll bow

Allahu Akber, let the cry be heard all over now

Eid Mubarak, believers in One, Allah Almighty

Be joyous today, forget that anxiety

Cheer the sad, shake a hundred hands

Strengthen the weak, towards children be kind

Eid Mubarak, success be yours this day

All that you wish yourself I pray

May you shine, May you follow Allah's way

Happy Eid, may Islam advance this day
