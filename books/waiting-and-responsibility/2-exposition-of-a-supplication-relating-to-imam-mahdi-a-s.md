Exposition of a Supplication Relating To Imam Mahdi (a.s)
=========================================================

**This supplication begins thus**

It has been recorded by the eminent traditionalist, Shaykh Abbas Qummi
(r.a.), in his renowned compilation, 'Mafatihul Jinaan'. He has reported
this invocation on the authority of Shaykh Kafami from the latter's
'Misbahul Mutahajjid'. It is recommended that this supplication be
recited after every obligatory namaaz or for that matter at any other
time. (This supplication is mentioned in 'Mafatihul Jinaan' before the
fifteen supplications of Imam Sajjad (a.s. )). Considering the veracity
of this supplication, and with an eye on brevity, we have not mentioned
the chain of transmitters.

A supplication generally commences by invoking Allah as in 'Allahumma ,
which means 'O Allah'. The very next word arzokna' , means grant us
sustenance. The word sustenance is by and large associated with food and
succour. However, this word is also used to imply bounties associated
with both this world, as well as the hereafter. In other words, any
bounty, aid, assistance, etc., granted by Allah is dubbed as 'razk' and
this could be in the guise of 'taufeeq' to perform some action or it
could be some monetary benefit or an increase in knowledge and
recognition (ma'refat). Granting sustenance is the exclusive domain of
Allah as He Himself mentions in the Quran "Surely Allah is the bestower
of sustenance, the Lord of Power, the Strong.'
(Chapter of Zariyat, verse 58)

The word 'huva' that precedes 'arrazko' is an added emphasis on Allah's
prerogative in granting sustenance to man. This declaration affirming
Allah's sovereignty in the matter of succour in the very beginning of
this invocation is an admission of man's absolute helplessness and
dependence on Allah. (It must be noted that the Quran alludes to others
also like responsiblity for granting sustenance. However, these can only
perform this duty with permission and assistance from Allah and are by
no means His associates.)

It is pertinent to note what Imam Mahdi (a.s.) has beseeched from
Allah, under the heading of 'arzokna'. And what Imam (a.s.) has sought
under the heading 'arzokna'. 'Tawfeeq' is derived from 'Vafq', which
means to reform or to rectify. It also means success and fruition. This
is again the undisputed right of Allah as expounded in chapter of Hud,
verse 88.

"And with none but Allah is the direction of my affair to the right
issue."

Thus all success, honour and accomplishment is directly attributed to
Allah's assistance and aid. Then, one who wishes to advance in this
world as well as the hereafter, must constantly entreat Allah.
'Taufeeq'; plays a crucial role in the performance of actions. For
instance, there could be a youth, strong and capable, who is unable to
perform a simple action due to lack of 'taufeeq', while a man twice his
age may perform an even more formidable task, like say praying Namaze
Shab in severe wintry conditions, with 'taufeeq' from Allah' side.
However, it is relevant to note that Allah never acts impulsively. His
actions are governed by perfect wisdom and reasoning. In other words,
Allah will never grant man 'taufeeq' without some cause. And this cause
that draws 'taufeeq' is intention (neeyah). And that is why traditions
elucidate this concept thus;

'Taufeeq is in proportion with intention.'

'At-ta'a' means an attraction, inclination or preference towards
someone or something. It is commonly used to denote submission,
obedience or compliance. In this supplication 'At-ta'a' implies
obedience of Allah's commands and edicts. Indeed, submission to Allah is
the key to man's problems relating to the world, and the hereafter.

Submission to Allah's commands, is a precursor to man's success,
stifles social disputes, wards off Allah's wrath, grants man honour and
dignity and averts evil. Then one who obeys Allah's commands will accept
death matter-of-factly. He will show urgency in performing all
obligatory acts. However, regrettably, today we see the Muslims evading
obligatory deeds. Ameerul Mo'mineen (a.s.) protests against this strange
trait thus, "When their God invites them (towards goodness) they flee
and abscond. But when Satan entices them they heed his call with urgency
and rush towards him.'
(Nahjul Balaga, sermon 166)

One must never forget that all bounties are a direct consequence of our
obedience to Allah, for nothing can be achieved without His
satisfaction. Subservience to the Almighty gains precedence over all
other actions. ,

"And help us abstain from sin and disobedience." Verily abstinence from
sins is among Allah's greatest bounties. Disobedience is a result of
'asa'. 'Kazalan' means that Allah abandons the servant and deprives him
of His bounties;

i.e. He does not care about him. And this only adds to man's
depravation and debasement. A Muslim when he sins not only disobeys
Allah, but also infringes upon the rights of the Prophet and his progeny
(a.s.). That is why Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) declares, 'Undoubtedly the
friend of Muhammad (s.a.w.s.) is the one who obeys Allah, even if he
bears no blood ties with the Prophet (s.a.w.s.). And the antagonist of
Muhammad (s.a.w.s.) is the one who defies Allah even while he boasts of
blood ties with the Prophet (s.a.w.s.).'
(Nahjul Balaga sermon 96)

Indeed man's behaviour is astonishing. For he evinces urgency in
responding to the call of this world, that only invites him to trials,
tribulations and misery.

"And inculcate sincerity in my intentions".

Intention is the foundations of all our actions and in fact, the latter
are a consequence of the former. An unwavering intention can subdue the
weakness of the body. That is why traditions declare, 'The believer's
intention surpasses his action and the disbeliever's intention surpasses
his action."

In this supplication Imame Asr (a.t.f.s.) beseeches Allah to purify his
intentions from all blemishes like ostentation, vainglory, pride,
disbelief, etc. Such a level of purity in our intention is crucial, for
actions are accepted by Allah only if our intention is unfettered with
such blemishes; else regardless of the effort, our actions will never be
acknowledged by Allah. Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) proclaims, 'If one is
sincere in his intentions, then Allah will multiply manifold his
sustenance."

Imam Sadiq (a.s.) also declares, "One who has pure intentions will
experience serenity in his heart. For the heart can only get
tranquillity from actions that are performed for Allah's sake alone."
Insincere intentions deprive man of his sustenance, hurl him into
tribulations and seize 'barakat' from him.

'Irfan' and 'Marefat' imply recognition and comprehension. 'Al Horma'
means all those things that are prohibited by the Islamic Shariat. In
this supplication, Imam (a.s.) implores Allah to help him recognise the
forbidden actions, so that he may exercise restrain in this regard. For
surely among the signs of the intellect is that the person abstains from
prohibited deeds, especially consuming impure food by which blood is
produced in the body. Hence when a Muslim eats what is forbidden by the
Shariat, the angels in the heavens and the earth curse that person.

Moreover, worship on a stomach filled with prohibited food, is akin to
a house that is built on water. To the extent that traditions pronounce
that a person who forsakes a morsel of prohibited food will get reward
that exceeds that of two thousand recommended (mustahhab) units of
namaz. But this abstinence is possible only if man can clearly identify
the prohibited actions. Then one who abstains from the forbidden deeds
while he is having the ability and inclination, then Allah will avert
from him the fire of Hell and grant him entry in Paradise.

'And grant us honour through guidance and Steadfastness.'

Verily the best guidance is that of Allah. So critical is guidance that
Allah has not delegated it to anyone and has kept this responsibility
with Himself. In fact, Allah tells the Prophet (s.a.w.s.) in the chapter
of Qasas, verse 57,
"(O Prophet) surely you cannot guide whom you love, but Allah guides
whom He pleases."

Then if guidance is with Allah, how does man go about acquiring it? Who
are the ones fortunate enough to receive it and the wretched who are
deprived of it? There are certain actions the performance of which
invoke Allah's guidance and mercy, viz.,

a) belief in Allah,
b) piety,
c) repentance and contrition,
d) abstinence from sins,
e) endeavours in the way of Allah,
f) adherence to the Islamic Shariat,
g) concern and regard for religion,
h) patience and fortitude,
i) certitude,
j) sincere intentions,
k) consultation,
l) frequent remembrance of Allah,
m) acquisition of knowledge,
n) obedience of the Imams (a.s.).
On the other hand there are certain actions that repel Allah's mercy
and guidance viz.,
a) Injustice - be it on others, or on oneself by way of sins
b) Disbelief and apostasy
c) Transgression and unrestraint in the matter of sins
d) Extravagance
e) Falsehood
f) To accede to one's desires
g) To act without any ma'soom Imam's leadership.
h) Doubt and scepticism (after certitude)

Steadfastness connotes following the right path, the path of guidance,
as opposed to that of deviation and misguidance, as it is mentioned in
the first chapter of Quran thus, 'Keep us on the right path.' And the
chapter of Hud, verse 112 "Remain steadfast as you have been commanded."
Steadfastness and uprightness are among the distinctive features of a
believer. Allah has given glad tidings to those who observe fortitude
and Steadfastness in their affairs. In fact this is the best means of
leading one's life. Then one who wishes to succeed in the world and the
hereafter must embrace these characteristics. For as Ameerul Mo'mineen
(a.s.) declares,

'One who is steadfast shall get Paradise, but the one who is afflicted
with doubt and disbelief shall get the fire.'
(Nahjul Balaga, sermon 119)

Only after being graced by Allah with Steadfastness and guidance can
one truly comprehend the meaning of the word 'Akrimna' which means,
'honour us'. For surely One who is blessed by Allah with these two
traits will find honour and esteem in the eyes of Allah and His Prophet
(s.a.w.s.). 'Direct our tongues to speak truthful and prudent
discourses.'

Here 'sawab' means to enjoin upon the right path and 'alsanah' means
tongues. 'saddad' means honest and rightful discourses, while 'hikmat'
means reflections and talks marked with wisdom and discernment.

A man's tongue plays a crucial role in moulding his personality. Which
is why Ameerul Mo'mineen (a.s.) proclaims, 'The tongue determine man's
worth.'

Just as a woman's grace and beauty is reflected in her visage, a man's
character is (disguised) in his tongue. Indeed the tongue is the root of
all goodness and evil. A man can never achieve steadfastness in his
character unless he first observes this trait in his speech. That is why
Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) exhorts us to guard our tongues with the same
judiciousness with which we safeguard gold and silver. In fact in this
lies the security of man. For this little piece of flesh used with
abandon can cause damage more severe and destructive than swords and
lances. Hence we must beseech Allah to help us guard our tongues so
nothing comes forth from it but guidance and wisdom.

We must observe a lot of discretion and caution in our speech. As
Ameerul Mo'mineen has put it 'The wise man's tongue is hidden behind his
intellect, while a fool's intellect is hidden behind his tongue.'
(Nahjul Balaga, saying 40).

'And pervade our hearts with knowledge and recognition.'

Indeed knowledge and recognition are such profound concepts that to do
justice to them in this short exposition is well-nigh impossible. The
great traditionist, Allamah Muhammad Baqir Majlisi (r.a.) has discussed
knowledge, recognition and intellect in over two volumes of his
celebrated work 'Behaarul Anwaar'. To put it briefly, the Imams (a.s.)
have enjoined acquisition of knowledge upon every Muslim man and woman.
In fact few other things in Islam have been emphasised with such
vehemence by the Imams (a.s.). Despite all these exhortations Muslims
today cut a sorry figure steeped in ignorance and regression. And this
state of ignorance among his Shias pains Imame Asr (a.t.f.s.) more than
anything else.

Our responsibility then, is not only to acquire knowledge, but to
disseminate it. Now as far as recognition is concerned, it can only be
achieved by strictly adhering to the commands of Allah and His Prophet
(s.a.w.s.) as far as obligatory and recommended, prohibited and
abominable actions are concerned. And it is important that we always
recite the following invocation:

'O Allah, help us recognise ourselves, for surely if we fail to
recognise ourselves, we can never recognise Your Prophet. O Allah, help
us recognise Your Prophet, for surely if we fail to recognise Your
Prophet we can never recognise Your Proof (Imame Asr). O Allah, help us
recognise Your Proof, for surely if we fail to recognise Your Proof we
shall be deviated from Your religion.'

'And purify our bellies from impure and unclean food.'

The unclean food that finds its way in our bellies is deemed impure on
the basis of two criteria; first, it is either obtained from unlawful
livelihood or from a livelihood on which khums has not been paid.
Second, either the food by itself is impure or it has been acquired from
an unclean person. For instance, if one acquires some foodstuff from an
unbeliever that has been made unclean with the latter's sweat. Such
impure food once consumed sows seeds of rebellion against the Almighty.
That is why as mentioned earlier one who forsakes a morsel of prohibited
food will get reward that exceeds that of two thousand recommended
(mustahhab) units of namaz.

Apart from the effect on our spirituality, impure food has far reaching
repercussions on our issues. The impure blood that flows in their veins
incites them to revolt against Allah. However, we often find Muslims,
especially Indian Muslims, who are negligent about this aspect and
advance lame excuses like, it is not possible for any person living in
this country to totally avoid unclean food!! Of course that is not true.
We find instances wherein a doctor strongly recommends, say a
non-vegetarian patient from eating mutton.

The patient actually adheres to the doctor's recommendations and
completely stops consuming mutton. If man can go to such lengths to
preserve this temporal body, then he should make a more concerted effort
for success in the eternal life in the hereafter, and he should
constantly endeavour to attain Allah's satisfaction. In this regard it
is sufficient to say that impure food is a cause for repudiation of all
our prayers and supplications and a means of Imam's displeasure.

'And withhold our hands from injustice and theft.'
