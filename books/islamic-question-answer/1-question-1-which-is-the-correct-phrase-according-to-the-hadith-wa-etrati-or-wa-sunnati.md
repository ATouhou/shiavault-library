Question 1: Which Is the Correct Phrase According To the Hadith, "wa Etrati" Or "wa Sunnati"?
=============================================================================================

The narrations of the very well known "Thaqalain" have been recorded in
the books of tradition in two ways that we shall now illuminate so as to
find out which the correct one is.

**Question 2.What is meant by the term'Shia'?**

**ANSWER:**

'Shia', in the Arabic language means 'follower'. The Holy Quran says:

"And most surely Ibrahim was one of His Shia" (followed His way),

Meaning that Ibrahim (as) was one of the followers of prophet Noah.
However, in the Muslim terminology 'Shia' is used for a group who
believe that the prophet (saw) before his death, appointed the successor
and a caliph for the Muslims. He did so in many occasions among which
one of them happened to be on the eighteenth of Zilhajj which is known
as the day of 'Ghadeer'. This was a gathering consisting of thousands of
people where the prophet himself specified Imam Ali appointing him as
the political, religious and judicial authority.

**Explanation:**

After the demise of the honorable prophet, the Muhajir and Ansar
divided into two groups:

A group believing that God's messenger attended to the matter of
appointing a caliph making Ali to be his successor, who was the first
believer after him.

This group constituted from a group of Muhajir and Ansar headed by the
all the dignitaries of Bani-Hashim including a group of close companions
such as Salman, Abu dhar, Miqdad, Khabab bin Arr among others. This
group remained steadfast on the prophet's belief and were named as "Shia
of Ali (as)." Of course, this title was given by the Holy prophet
himself during his lifetime to the followers of the leader of the
faithful. This was when he pointed to Ali Ibn Abi Talib and said:

"I swear by the one who possesses my soul that surely, he and his
followers are the winners on the day of Judgment."

Therefore, the Shia are a group of Muslims during the early period of
Islam, who because of their belief in the appointment (by a specific
text) of the position of guardianship and leadership, were known by this
name, and this very group is still on the line of executorships and
following the prophet's household.

Thus, the position of Shia is determined in this way. With the above
explanation, the baselessness of the speech of some of the ignorant or
among the private motives of forgery based on the formation of Shia
creed to have come in the later Islamic era, becomes evident of it's
falsification. For further knowledge of the Shia's history, refer to the
books of 'Asl-Al-Shia wa Usuluha', 'Al-Murajia'at' and 'Aayan
Al-Shia.'

Another group believed that the position of caliphate is an elected
one; therefore, swore allegiance to Abu bakr. This group were later
known as 'Ahl sunnah' or 'Sunnis'. Thus, this finally resulted in the
difference between two Islamic sects. However these two sects seem to
have many common features between them. The difference in opinion arose
regarding the matter of caliphate, and the fact that who is to succeed
the Holy prophet. The initial source of conflict was however due to the
two very groups of Ansar and Muhajir.
(saffat, 83)

Jalal Al-Deen Al-Seuti, Dur Al-Manthur, vol.6, in interpretation of the
seventh verse of sura Bayyinah (as for) those who believe and do good,
surely they are the best of men.)


**Question 3. Why is Ali bin Abi Talib the guardian and successor of
the Holy prophet?**

**ANSWER:**

As we previously mentioned, the Shia have firm belief that the position
of caliphate is appointed by God (according to a text) and that Imamate
after the honored prophet is similar to prophet hood in some aspects;
the guardian has to be appointed by God as was the appointing of the
prophets.

The history of the prophet's life certifies this principle; because he
had appointed Ali (as) as his successor in several occasions of which we
shall mention three instances:

During the early period of the prophet hood of the prophet:

When the Prophet was commanded as the mission from God to call his
relatives inorder to create unity according to the verse "and warn your
nearest relations."

So he addressed the gathering saying that whosoever supported him in
this way, as dictated by Allah, will become the guardian, vizier, and
successor to him. His holiness said the following words:

"Who is ready amongst you to support me in this matter so that he be my
brother, vizier, guardian and successor?"

The only one to give a positive response to this heavenly call was Ali
bin Abi Talib (p). It was then that the prophet turned to his relatives
and said:

"He (Ali) is my brother, guardian and successor (caliph) among you, so
listen to him and obey him."

In the battle of 'Tabuk': The prophet (p) said to Ali (p):

"Aren't you pleased to be considered by me as Aaroon (was) for Moses,
except that after me there is no prophet."

That is, Aaroon was the immediate successor of Moses, you too are my
successor in the same manner.

In the tenth year of Hijrat:

God's messenger (p), when returning from Hajjat-ul-wida (last
pilgrimage of the prophet), stopped in an area known as 'Ghadeer Khum'
and introduced Ali (p) to a unanimous gathering as the guardian of the
Muslims and believers.

He said:

"Whosoever (until now) I was his guardian, (from now on) Ali is his
guardian."

The point worth mentioning and of paramount importance is that the
prophet (p) at the beginning of his speech said:

"Am I not more superior to you than yourselves?"

All the Muslims stood up in approval to his statement. Therefore, it
should be clearly noted that what the prophet (p) meant by the term
'Mawla'in his tradition is the position of superiority over them; this
result can be used as a deduction that his holiness approved for Ali (p)
the same position of superiority that he possessed.

The narration of Ghadeer is one of the most widely transmitted Islamic
narrations which in addition to the Shia scholars, about a number of
three hundred and sixty Sunni scholars have also narrated it; it's
narration reaches up to a hundred and ten companions, twenty six of the
great scholars have also written an independent book regarding its chain
of transmitters.

Abu-Jaffer Tabari, the renowned Muslim historian, has collected the
chains of transmitters of this tradition in two thick volumes. For more
information, refer to the book of 'Al-Ghadeer'
