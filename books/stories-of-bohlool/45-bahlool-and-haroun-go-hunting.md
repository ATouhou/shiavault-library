Bahlool and Haroun Go Hunting
=============================

One day Haroun Rashid and a group of his courtiers went hunting. Bahlool
was also with them. A deer was seen in the hunting area. The Khalifa
shot an arrow at it, but it didn't hit the deer.

Bahlool said, “Well done!”

The Khalifa angrily said, “You ridicule me!”

Bahlool replied, “I praised the deer that it was well-saved.”
