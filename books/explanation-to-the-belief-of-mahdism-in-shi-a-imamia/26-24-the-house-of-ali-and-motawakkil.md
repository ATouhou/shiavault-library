24. The House of Ali and Motawakkil
===================================

Alhamdulillah, the writer, sees and accepts the cruelty, and tyranny of
Motawakkil. He says without reservation; and this is, indeed,
appreciable. In the court, Motawakkil became upset, very much so that he
wept under the crushing strokes of his soul. The writer attributes his
inner disturbance to the recitation of Quranic Verses. He is wrong. Imam
Hadi spoke to him in poetry. Because part of the verse has been
translated from Arabic to English, some of the beauty has been lost;

***“Over the peaks of mountains, guarded they lived; Never saved them
the peaks they were deceived.”***
