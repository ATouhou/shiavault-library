Appendix 3: A Prayer
====================

[^1]Oh Lord! Be kind to us. Bestow upon us Your love and knowledge and
guide us from darkness towards illumination. If You Yourself make us
know You, we would certainly love You, because, we would love You. Your
Love would burn whatever falsehood, ignorance and arrogance there exist;
rather the fire of Your love will burn down whatever veils exist between
You and us. We would become the way -you want Your friends to be.

Oh our Lord, Master. Creator, God and Bestower of bounties. We have
inflicted tyranny upon ourselves. Admit our sins and before the Day of
Judgment cry:

 ***Is there a way to get out of the Hell*** **?**[^2]

With Your mercy and compassion we have rested all our hopes upon You so
that on the Judgment Day we are not doomed to utter the above cry and do
not combine for us the suffering of this world and Hereafter.
