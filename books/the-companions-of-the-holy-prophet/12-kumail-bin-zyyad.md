Kumail Bin Zyyad
================

On Thursday night the Moslems finish the night prayers. They sit down
in lines. They implore Allah, the Merciful Creator, to forgive them
their sins. They ask him to be pleased with them.

Sweet words flow out of the mosque minarets. The words fly high in the
clear sky full of stars:
Allah, I implore You with Your mercy that has included everything.
And with Your power with which You have overcome everything,
And every thing has.yielded to it...

Whose supplication is this? It's Kumail's.

What's the story of this supplication?

Who was Kumail?

He was Kumail bin Zyyad al-Nakhay. He was one of Imam Ali's companions.
He was a noble man. His people obeyed him. He came from Yaman. His
family inhabited Kufa during Imam Ali's Caliphate.

Abid al-Rahman bin al-Ashath led a revolution against alHajjaj. Kumail
joined the revolution. He led the Koran Readers' Battalion.

**The Beginning
**
Our Master Muhammad said:

I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate.

Imam Ali (A.S.) was a great scholar. He said: Allah's Apostle has
taught me a thousand doors of knowledge. Each door leads to a thousand
doors.

He also said: The Zakat (alms) of knowledge is to publish it.

So, Imam Ali (A.S.) taught his companions whatever they wanted. One
day, he took Kumail with him outside Kufa. It was night. The sky was
full of stars. Northern fresh breeze was blowing.

Imam Ali (A.S.) said to his companion: Kumail, these hearts are
containers (of knowledge). The best of them are those that best preserve
the knowledge. Therefore, preserve what I say to you:

There are three classes of people. The first class knows Allah. The
second learns knowledge as means of salvation. And the third is
rabble, - followers of every crower, who bend with every breeze. These
men do not seek to be illuminated by the light of learning, nor do they
resort to any authority.

Kumail, knowledge is better than wealth. Knowledge guards you while you
guard wealth. Wealth is diminished by expenditure while knowledge is
increased even by giving it away.

Kumail, those who amass wealth die even as they live, while those who
have knowledge will continue to exist for as long as time lasts.

Al-Khidr's Supplication

Imam Ali (A.S.) was sitting with a group of his companions. One of them
asked him about the explanation of the following Holy Verse:

"Therein every wise affair is made distinct"

The Imam said: It is on Shaban 15th.

Then he added:
By Allah, man faces his fate on Shaban 15th. So, man must implore Allah
at such a night He must read Al-Khidr's supplication. Certainly, Allah
accepts it.

The meeting was over and the Imam went home.

The evening came. Then it got dark. People went to bed. At that hour,
Kumail got up. He went to Imam Ali's house. He had a question.

Kumail knocked at the door. Imam Ali (AS.) said: Kumail what has
brought you?

Kumail, politely said: Amirul-Momineen, Al-Khidr's supplication

The Imam kindly said: Kumail, please sit down.

Then he added: I'll read you a supplication. Read it on Thursday
nights.

The Imam began reading the supplication. Kumail was writing it.
Nowadays, millions of Moslems read the supplication. They call it
Kumail's supplication.

Thursday night, when you are free, then read Kumail's supplication.
Faith will shine in your heart. It will illuminate the way of your life
as it had illuminated the way of Kumail's life.

**Al-Hajjaj
**
Imam Ali (A.S.) passed away. Maawyyah became a Caliph. Unjust rulers
succeeded him. Kufa lived unbearable life.

The rulers imprisoned and killed the God-fearing followers of
Ahlul-bait.

Zyyad bin Abeeh ruled Kufa. Then his son Ubaidullah succeeded him. The
latter killed the Prophet's grandson. Besides he killed seventy of his
companions and his family.

AI-Hajjaj did his best to please the Umayyad rulers. He filled his
prison with innocent men and women. In his prison, there were fifty
thousand men and thirty thousand women.

The prison was roofless. The prisoners were subjected to the sun heat
in summer. And they were subjected to rain and coldness in winter. In
summer their faces became as black as Negroes.

A person had been in prison for months. One day his mother went to the
prison to visit him. She was astonished to see him. She said: He's not
my son. My son is white. This young man is a Negro. I don't know him.

The young man reminded his mother of some marks.

The mother became certain of her son. She burst into tears. Then she
died of sadness.

The Revolution

AI-Hajjaj hated Ahlul-Bait and their followers very much. So, he filled
the prisons with Shias. They had no guilt but had loved Muhammad's
family.

AI-Hajaj was unjust. People hated him. They asked Abid al-Malik to
remove him from office. Abid al-Malik refused because al-Hajaj wanted to
strengthen the Umayyad rule with fire and sword.

AI-Hajaj was wicked. He sent people to fight and occupy lands. He
forced them to join the invading armies. He wanted them to get the booty
of the conquered lands. In the meantime, he wanted to get rid of them.

**Abid al-Rahman bin al-Ashath
**
King Ratbil ruled Turkey. AI-Hajjaj sent Abid al-Rahman bin al-Ashath
to Turkey to invade it. Abid al-Rahman went deeply into the Turkish
lands. He won victories at some battles. So, he sent al-Hajjaj a letter.
In the letter he asked him to stop fighting to refresh his fighters.

AI-Hajjaj's answer was full of abuses. Meanwhile, he ordered Abid
al-Rahman to go deeper into the Turkish lands.

Abid al-Rahman and his fighters knew al-Hajjaj's wicked aims. So, they
decided to revolt against al-Hajaj and Abid al-Malik.

After Abid al-Rahman had announced the revolution, he came back from
Turkey. Many people supported him. The Koran readers were the first to
support him.

The Koran readers formed a battalion. Kumail bin Zyyad led the
battalion.

Because the Kufians suffered from persecution, they also supported the
revolution.

The number of the revolutionaries was over one hundred people. This
number included the Koran readers, worshipers, poets, religious jurists,
and the common. Half the number were foreigners,. They suffered from
racial discrimination. 'Me Umayyads preferred Arabs to non-Arabs.

Saeed bin Jubair, the most famous jurist, was among the
revolutionaries. He made the people eager to start the revolution.

Poets urged Abid al-Rahman to go on revolting to end persecution.

**The Fights

** In 81 AH., Abid al-Rahman advanced towards Iraq. Violent fights took
place there. The revolutionaries defeated al-Hajjaj's army. They freed
many cities such as Sajestan and Kirman (in Iran), Basra and Kufa (In
Iraq).

Abid al-Malik sent a man to Abid al-Rahman to hold talks with him. He
accepted some conditions such as removing al-Hajjaj from office.

People rejoiced at freedom and victory. So, they insisted on removing
Abid al-Malik from the office, for he appointed al-Hajjaj ruler over
them.

Abid al-Malik sent military supplies to support al-Hajjaj. The army in
Khurasan joined him, too.

The Battle of Deer al-Jamajum

The two armies met at Deer al-Jamajum. A violent fight took place
between the two sides. AI-Hajjaj defeated Abid al-Rahman.

Abid al-Rahman's army scattered. Some fighters escaped. Some passed
away. Abid al-Rahman himself took refuge in Turkey. Some revolutionaries
such as Saeed bin Jubair and Kumail bin Zyyad disappeared.

AI-Hajjaj began looking for the revolutionaries. He executed some of
them. And some were afraid of him.

The End

After Deer al-Jamajum Battle, Kumail bin Zyyad was far away from
spies.

The police were looking for Kumail everywhere.

AI-Hajjaj used a new way to arrest Kumail. He ordered the police to
annoy Kumail's followers. He deprived them of money. So, their economic
condition was bad. Kumail heard about that. Thus, he decided to
surrender. The police took him to al-Hajjaj.

**Kumail's Memories
**
Kumail bravely walked with the police. In the meantime, he recalled the
beautiful days with his teacher and leader Imam Ali (A.S.).

Kumail remembered the days when he was a soldier in the Imam's Army. He
remembered his fights against the disloyal, the unjust and the
apostates.

Kumail remembered the day when he led an army of four hundred fighters
to face a raid by Maawyyah's Army.

Kumail remembered the day when he chased the invaders in Kirkeesya. He
remembered the Imam's scolding letter because he left the borders of his
country without soldiers.

The Imam's letter read as follows:

Certainly you have deeply gone into Kirkeesya. And you have left the
positions without protection. The idea is incorrect You have become a
bridge for your enemies to attack your friends.

Why did Kumail surrender?

Kumail believed in Allah and the hereafter. He loved all people. He
loved his family and his tribe.

AI-Hajjaj mistreated Kumail's family and tribe. So, Kumail surrendered
to save them from persecution.

Kumail remembered Imam Ali's (A.S.) words:
Kumail, order your family to do good. Order them to help people at
night ..

Before Al-Hajjaj

Kumail's face was bright. His beard was white. His heart was certain.

Kumail came into al-Hajjaj's palace. He saw al-Hajjaj sitting and his
guards standing around him. He saw a headsman carrying a sword.

Kumail new that al-Hajjaj would kill him, for Imam Ali (AS.) had told
him about that.

Paying not attention to al-Hajjaj, Kumail said:

My master Imam Ali (A.S.) has told me that you will kill me. Allah's
enemy, do whatever you like! And know that the Judgement Day will be
after killing.

Al-Hajjaj said: Disown Ali to save your soul.

Kumail said: Show me a religion better than Ali's.

AI-Hajjaj ordered the headsman to behead Kumail.

**Kumail Shrine
**
Nowadays, the visitor sees Kumail shrine on a hill at Wadi al-Salam in
Holy Najaf. Sweet perfume spread in Kumail shrine.

On Thursday nights, sweet words fly high in the sky full of stars. The
words remind people of that great martyr whose name has connected with
the supplication. So, his name will be immortal.
