21. Tooth extraction
====================

Article 158
-----------

The ruling for tooth extraction is that if it causes bleeding then as
the same as past article, it means that this act is Makrooh. But if does
not cause bleeding then it is not a problem, although Mustahab
precaution is to renounce that.
