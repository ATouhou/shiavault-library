In Conclusion…
==============

It would be right to argue that the material presented in this book is
in no way exhaustive. There is much more benefit in the recitation of
the Holy Qur’an than can be imagined or perceived. What you have read is
just a drop in the ocean, but it should be enough to convince anyone to
read Qur’an more regularly and try to ponder over it.

In conclusion, we all pray to Allah (S.w.T.) to make our hearts attached
to the Holy Qur’an and make us able to understand its teachings and
guidance.
