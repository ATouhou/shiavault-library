32. After Renewing Of Every Blessing And Passing Away Of Every Calamity
=======================================================================

Surely, Imam-e-Asr (aj) is the medium of every bounty and through him,
calamities are dispelled. We have already mentioned that praying for his
reappearance is a method of expressing our gratitude to him for he is
the medium of all the bounties that are conferred on us. We should also
not forget to send salutations on the Holy Prophet (S) and his progeny
(as) on receipt of every bounty because surely they are the authorities
on the divine bounties, as mentioned in Ziyaarah al-Jaameâ€™ah and
reliable and Mutawatir traditions.
