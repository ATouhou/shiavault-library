2) Phase Two of the 14 Phases of the Life Hereafter
===================================================

The Adeela at the Time of Death
-------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
العديله عند الموت
  </p>
</blockquote>

It means one turning from right to wrong as he dies due to the presence
of Satan at the time of his death who will cast doubts in his heart
through his evil insinuations in order to get him out of the right
creed. There are many supplications to seek protection for such
\`adeela. For example, the pride of all critics, may Allah‎ have mercy
on his soul, has said that if one seeks security against Satan, he must
bring into his presence the proofs of conviction and the five basic
principles of Islam through irrevocable evidences, with ease of
conscience, then he hands them all over to Allah‎ Almighty so He may
return them to him at the time of his death. Having stated all the right
doctrines, he should say the following:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
«اللّهمَّ يا أرحم الراحمين انّي قد اودعتك يقيني هذا وثبات ديني وأنت
خير مستودع قد أمرتنا بحفظ الودائع فردّه عليّ وقت حضور موتي».
  </p>
</blockquote>

"O Lord, the most Merciful of those who show mercy: I have entrusted You
with this conviction of mine, with the firmness of my creed. Since You
are the best of trusted ones, and You commanded us to safe keep the
trusts, do return it to me at the time when I am to die." What also
helps is performing the prayer rites on time; doing so helps during such
a critical stage.

According to one tradition, the angel of death looks at all people five
times a day, that is, during the five daily prayers, so he may teach
those who perform them on time the shahada and spare him the evil of the
cursed Satan. It is also highly recommended to recite the following
supplication/ Qur'anic verse on every Sunday during the month of
Thil-Qi'da:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
رَبَّنَا لاَ تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا وَهَبْ لَنَا
مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْوَهَّابُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Our Lord!” (they say,) “do not let our hearts deviate now that You
have guided us, but grant us mercy from Your Own Presence, for You are
the Giver of unlimited bounties" (Qur'an, 3:8).***

Other Qur'anic Chapters that have the same effect include Suras 23 and
109.
