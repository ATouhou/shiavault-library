The Head of the Jews in the General Assembly of Yazeed
======================================================

After the arguments that went on between Imam Zein El-Abedeen (Q) and
Yazeed, a rabbi among the Jewish rabbis

was there so he turned to Yazeed and said: "O prince of believers, who
is this young man?"

So Yazeed said: "This head belongs to his father"

Then the rabbi said: "and who is the owner of this head, O prince of
believers?"

Yazeed said: "Al-Hussain Bin Ali Bin Abi Taleb".

The rabbi asked: "and who is his mother?"

Yazeed said: "She is Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad (P)”

So, the rabbi said: "Glory is to Allah! This is the son of your
Prophet’s daughter, and you were this quick to kill him! What a bad way
to repay him in dealing with his pedigree, By God, if Moses Bin Omran
had left us one of his grandchildren, I believe we might have worshiped
him instead of God, and you, your Prophet had just died, so you attacked
his grandson and killed him, what a bad nation you are…"
