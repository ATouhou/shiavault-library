25. Carrying weapons
====================

Article 169
-----------

A Muhrim should not carry weapons with himself/herself even if they are
cold weapons or firearms, but it is a precaution not to use defensive
weapons like shield etc. But in the cases of necessity, danger and fear
from thieves, ferocious animals and enemies, using any necessary weapon
is permitted.

Article 170
-----------

The thing, which is Haraam, is to carry the weapon like having a sword
on the waist or having a gun on the shoulder or carrying it by hand. But
if these are placed in the house, tent or trunk of a car of a Muhrim
then it does not harm his/her Ihram although it is a mustahab precaution
to abstain from that except in the case of necessity.

Article 171
-----------

Whenever a Muhrim carries a weapon deliberately, then the atonement of
this act is one sheep as a precaution.
