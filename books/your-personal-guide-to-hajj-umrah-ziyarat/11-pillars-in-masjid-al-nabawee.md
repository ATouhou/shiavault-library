Pillars in Masjid al-Nabawee
============================

Pillar of Hannaana
------------------

Adjoining the Mehrab al-Nabawee is the pillar of Hannaana. The Prophet
of Allah used to lean against a date palm tree and give Khutba. After
the Mimber was built, however, the Prophet (SAW) used the mimber for
giving khutba. The date palm tree complained and cried because of
loneliness. The Prophet of Islam reassured the date palm tree that it
would accompany the Prophet in Jannat.

A pillar was erected where the pillar of Hannaanaa was.

Pillar of Aisha
---------------

It is narrated that the Prophet (SAW) was heard saying that there was
one place in this Masjid where to say Salaat was great thawab but he did
not say where the place was. After his death, Aisha pointed out this
place where the ‘Pillar of Aisha” now stands.

Pillar of Tawba
---------------

The pillar that is right in front of Kabre Mubarak is the Pillar of
Tawba. It is narrated that Abu Labbaaba spied on the Prophet of Islam
and went and told the Jews that there was a plan to kill them.

Abu Labbaba then repented for this mistake and he came to Masjid
al-Nabawee and tied himself to a date tree, crying desperately for
forgiveness.

One day when the Prophet of Allah was resting in the hujra of Umme
Salma, Jibra’el came with the ayah of Quran which mentions the
forgiveness of Abu Labbaaba. The Prophet untied him and gave him the
good news that Allah had forgiven him. Here the Pillar was erected, it
is recommended that one should try to pray two rakaats Salaat and ask
for forgiveness at this pillar.

Pillar of Mahras
----------------

This pillar stands where Imam Ali A.S. used to stand guard over the
Prophet of Allah when he slept at night.

Pillar of Wufood
----------------

Whenever people from outside Medina came to visit the Prophet (SAW), he
would receive their delegation here.

House of Imam Hassan A.S.
-------------------------

When you come out through Bab al-Jibra’el and look straight towards the
Qibla, you will see a white dome (silver) but now it is turned into a
library and known as ‘Maktab al-Sheikh-Arif Hikmat’

House of Abu Ayyub Ansari
-------------------------

This is the famous hadith that when the Prophet of Allah first arrived
in Medina, several Ansars wanted to be his host. It was difficult for
the Prophet (SAW) to decide which Ansar to choose so he announced that
he would stay wherever his camel stopped.

The camel stopped in front of the House of Abu Ayyub Ansari. This is the
first house in Medina where the Prophet (SAW) stayed. The house has been
demolished and (now stands) in it’s place the ‘Court of Justice’.
