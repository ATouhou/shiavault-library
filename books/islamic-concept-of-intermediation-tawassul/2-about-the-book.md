About the Book
==============

Islamic Concept of Intermediation is the most comprehensive work
available on the topic in English. Maximum effort has been made to make
the book stylistically simple, so that it may facilitate the readers to
understand it clearly. Materials and contents are taken from the most
authentic sources.

Dr Tahir-ul-Qadri deserves a lot of praise for his keen insight into the
subtleties and nuances of the religion of Islam, as this is the only
book of its kind available in English language, both in terms of the
quantity and the quality of its contents.

Most importantly any errors found in the book are mine, the praise is
His, and the writer, in any case, is not to be blamed for the mistakes
whatsoever. Suggestions will highly be welcomed and appreciated. I am
sure they will certainly work as a catalyst in improving the book and
making it more authentic and comprehensive.
