A Word From the Compiler
========================

There are numerous mentionings of Masoomeen (asws) in the Quran. During
our translations, we have been blessed to come across a great many
hadiths narrated by Masoomeen (asws) which explain various Quranic
ayahs. We have made this humble attempt to share a few of our findings
with you.

It is our hope that inshaAllah as we continue our translations we will
continue to compile these hadiths and share them with all of you.

Please keep us in your prayers and duas

Syed Jazib Reza Kazmi
