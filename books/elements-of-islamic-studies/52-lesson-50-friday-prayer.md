Lesson 50: Friday Prayer
========================

In the presence of Imam (A.S.) or his specially appointed authority,
Friday prayer is *wajib al-‘ayni* in place of Zuhr. Zuhr is not recited
on such occasions.  
 In ghaybah (occultation) of the Imam (A.S.) when there is no one
specially appointed by Imam (A.S.) to lead in this prayer, Friday prayer
and Zuhr become *wajib al-takhyiri*.  
*Wajib al-takhyiri* means that a man has an option to choose between two
obligatory acts, but he cannot leave both. For example, in the 3rd and
4th *rak’at* of the daily prayers, a man has to recite either *Tasbihat
Arba’ah* or Surah al-Hamd. He has to choose anyone of these two
alternatives, but cannot leave both. Thus these two things are "*wajib
al-takhyiri*" in these two *rak’at*s. Likewise, on Fridays, Zuhr and
Friday prayer are *wajib al-takhyiri*. It means that a man has the
option to choose between these two prayers. But he cannot neglect
both.  
 There are certain conditions for Friday prayer:-  
 1. Friday prayer must be prayed in *Jama’ah* (congregation).  
 2. There must be at least 5 (better 7) persons including the Imam.  
 3. Only one Friday prayer may be prayed in a radius of 3 miles 720
yards. If two prayers are held within this distance, the later will be
null and void.  
 According to the fatwa of Ayatullah al-Khu’i, if Friday prayer of even
the Sunnis or other sects is held within the said radius of 3 miles 720
yards, and begins before the Friday prayer of the Shi’as, then those
Shi’as who are followers of Ayatullah al-Khu’i cannot do *niyyah* of
*wajib* for their Friday prayer. In such cases, they may pray Friday
prayer with *niyyah* of *qurbatan ilal-Laah* (in the hope that may be
the Shari’ah likes them to pray such Friday prayer) .  
 4. There must be two sermons delivered by the Imam before the prayer
and attentively listened to by at least 4 (or 6) persons.  
 5. As explained earlier, it is not obligatory to hold Friday prayers
specially. Instead, Zuhr may be prayed. But if Friday prayer is held by
an ‘adil (just) lrnarn, then it is obligatory *(ihtiyat wujubi*) to
participate In that prayer; and there will be no need to pray Zuhr
afterwards. .  
 6. Friday prayer is two *rak’at*s: In the first *rak’at* it is sunnat
for the Imam to recite Surah al-Jumu’ah and in the 2nd *rak’at* Surah
al-Munafiqun, after Surah al-Hamd. .  
 7. Two *qunut* are *mustahab* in this prayer: In the 1st *rak’at*
before *ruku’*; in the 2nd *rak’at* after rising from *ruku’*. There is
a special *qunut* for Friday.  
*"Allahumma Inna ‘abidam min ‘ibadikas saleheena qamu bikitabika wa
sunnati Nabiyyika fajzihim ‘anna khayr al-jaza".* (O Allah, verily, some
servants from among thy pious servants stood firm with Thy book and the
traditions of Thy Prophet; Thou reward them with the best reward from
us.)
