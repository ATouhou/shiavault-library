Sura 2 : Surat Al Fil the Elephant
==================================

In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful

This surah refers to the event that took place, as far as we know, in
the year of the birth of the Prophet, salla-llihu alayhi wa alihi wa
sallam. Although many people talked about it at the time, very few of
the actual details of the event have come down to us. We know that
people were very jealous of the residents of Mecca and the Quraysh, who,
as guardians of the house of Sayyidna Ibrahim, alayhi-s-salam, that is,
the House of God, held a position of great honor among the Arabs. One of
their rivals was the Emperor of Abyssinia. Through his viceroy Abraha in
the Yemen, he built what he believed was another Ka'bah, this time in
San'a, to compete with the one in Mecca. This second ka'bah did not
attract pilgrims in the numbers the Emperor had hoped for, and so he
sent a huge army, headed by elephants, to de­stroy the Ka'bah in Mecca.
He believed that San'a could thus become the most important center of
pilgrimage in that part of the world.

1 Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the possessors of
the elephant?

What is of relevance here is the confrontation between apparent
strength and power of great magnitude with its direct opposite. The
lesson is that real power is not measurable by ordinary means. The
destruction of the army which had been sent to destroy the Ka'bah was
not a miracle but, rather it was a natural phenomenon which heralded the
birth of the Prophet, salla-llahu 'alayhi wa alihi wa sallam, the
shining forth of that great Light in the midst of darkness.

To understand the significance of the elephant we must realize that
what weapons people possessed at that time were flimsy and scarce. In a
land where warriors had, at most, a few thin spears and bent swords, the
possession of an elephant meant that its possessor was regarded almost
as an emperor.

2 Did He not cause their strategy to end in confusion?

Kayd means "an artful plot," or "scheme." Did Allah not make their plot
go awry?

3 And send down flocks of flying creatures onto them,

Ababil means "flocks," and it does not necessar­ily only refer to birds
but also to large, overwhelming numbers.

4 Pelting them with stones of baked clay.

Sijjil means "stones like lumps of dry clay." It is related to the verb
sajala, which means "to record, write down," or "document." There are
many interpretations of this ayah. We do not know what this phenomenon
was, whether an actual storm brought a swarm of tiny creatures that
inflicted this large army with sijjil, which penetrated their flesh, or
whether a disease sud­denly came upon them (many illnesses such as
measles and small pox were not identified in those days), perhaps
brought by birds and in­sects. Despite the fact that this occurrence was
widely known and dis­cussed, we still do not know the nature of the
affliction, because at that time people's understanding of natural
phenomenon was not as ours is now. We know only that this mighty army
was suddenly, to­tally, and utterly devastated, just as it was
approaching the Ka'bah.

5 So He made them as devoured straw.

The result of the attack was that the enormous army became like
leftover stalks and leaves of grain or grass after having been beaten to
a stubble and was razed to the ground. In some of the numerous
descriptions, it is said that after this destruction the ground appeared
as if a flat sheet made up of the thousands of men of the enemy army and
their elephants had been laid down on it.
