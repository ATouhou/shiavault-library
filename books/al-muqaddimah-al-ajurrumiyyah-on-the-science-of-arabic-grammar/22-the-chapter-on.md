**Know that "لا" declines Asmā’ Nakirāt (indefinite nouns) according to
Naṣb without a Tanwin when it is directly connected to the Ism Nakirah
and "لا" is not repeated, like:**

لارجلَ في الدار           (There is absolutely noman in the house)

If it is not directly connected to it (i.e. the Ism Nakirah), then Raf‘
becomes incumbent as well as the repetition of  "لا", like:

لا في الدار رجلٌ ولا امرأةٌ           (There is no man and no woman in
the house)

If it (i.e. "لا") is repeated it is permissible for it to be an ‘Āmil
(such that it performs the function of "إنّ") or Mulghāh (i.e. such that
it loses that function thus becoming null and void).

Therefore, if you wish, you can say[^82] :

لارجلَ في الدار ولاامرأةَ            (There is absolutely noman in the
house and nowoman )

and if you wish, you can say:

<p dir="rtl">
لارجلٌ في الدار ولاامرأةٌ
</p>
