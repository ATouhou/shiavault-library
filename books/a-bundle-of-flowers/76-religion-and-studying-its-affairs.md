Religion and Studying Its Affairs
=================================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Fie upon that Muslim who does not allocate
(at least) one day a week to the study of the details of his religion
and to explore (the affairs) of his religion."

sufficient to remove his grief and provides him with sustenance from
whence he could never imagine."

instructional programs.) If I see a young one from Shi'ah who does not
have this program, I will teach him a lesson."
