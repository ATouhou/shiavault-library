His Dignity and Veneration
==========================

Imam al-Hasan’s personality filled the eyes and dominated the hearts
due to the fact that all the elements of the prophethood and the Imamate
gathered in him, and the dignity of the Prophet presented itself in him.
Wasil bin Ataa’[^3] has narrated: “The signs of the prophets and glory of
kings appeared on the face of al-Hasan.”[^4]

Ibn al-Zubayr has said: “By Allah, women have never born anyone similar
to al-Hasan bin Ali in dignity and is high position.”[^5]

[^1] Ibn ‘Asakir, Tarikh, vol. 4, p. 212.
[^2] Muhammad bin Ali bin al-Husayn bin Musa bin Babawayh al-Qummi is
among the great Shi‘ite figures and head of the traditionists. None
among the people of Qum was similar to him in his memorizing and
abundant knowledge. He was the teacher of al-Sheikh al-Mufid. He has
written three hundred books. He died in al-Ray, in the year 381 A. H.
This has been mentioned in the book al-Kuna wa al-Alqab, vol. 1, p.
212.
[^3] Wasil bin Ataa’ al-Basri was a declamatory, eloquent theologian. He
lisped the letter r. It has been narrated from him that he abandoned and
avoided the letter r during his orations. It has been said in respect of
him:

He changed al-bir (wheat) into qamh (wheat) during his adaptation And
he opposed al-raa’, to the extent that he employed tricks in poetry.

He was not able (to pronounce the word) matar (rain), so he sought
protection with al-ghayth (rain) out of fear (of saying the word)
al-matar. He has written several books of which are: Asnaf al-Murji’a,
al-Tawba, and Ma‘ani al-Qur’an. He had doubt about the justice of those
who took part at the Battle of al-Jamal. He was the Sheikh of the
Mu‘tazilites and was among their great figures. He was born in Yathrib
(Medina) in the year 80 AH. He died in the year 131 A. H. This has been
mentioned in the book Lisan al-Mizan, vol., 6, p. 214.

[^4] A‘yan al-Shi‘a, vol. 4, p. 12. Al-Manaqibin
[^5] Ibn Kuthayr, Tarikh, vol. 8, p. 37.

Imam al-Hasan was so dignified that some rugs were spread at the door
of his house. When he went out and sat down, none would walk through the
street because all the people sat down out of admiration and respect for
him. When he noted that, he entered his house.[^1] Imam al-Hasan was so
solemn and he had a great social rank in the souls of Muslims. When he
and his brother al-Husayn passed by some riders during their going to
make the hajj to the Kaaba, the riders dismounted as a sign of
admiration and respect for them. The masses of hajjis found it difficult
to perform the hajj on foot. So they talked to Sa’d bin Abi Waqqas in
this respect, and he went to Imam al-Hasan and said to him: “O Abu
Muhammad, the hajjis have found it difficult to perform the hajj on
foot. When they see you, they are not pleased with riding their camels.
If you please ride (a camel) as a sign of showing mercy towards them”

The Imam answered: “We will not ride, for we have made a covenant with
Allah that we go to His House on foot, but we will avoid the public
way.”[^2] Imam al-Hasan put on an excellent garment, rode a brisk mule,
and walked through a street of Yathrib. His holy face shone with light.
His servants and retinue surrounded him. A stupid Jew saw him and said
to him:

-O son of Allah’s Apostle, I have a question. -What is it?

-Your grandfather, Allah’s Apostle (a.s) has said: “The world is the
prison of a believer and garden of an unbeliever!” You are a believer
and I am unbeliever. The world is but a garden for you. You enjoy it,
while you are a believer. As for me, it is just a prison; its heat has
destroyed me; and its poverty has exhausted me. - In the hereafter Allah
has prepared for me and believers things of which no eye has ever seen,
no ear has ever heard, and that which has not come to someone’s mind. If
you looked at that, you would come to know that I had been in prison
during this condition and before my moving to it. And if you looked at
that which Allah had prepared for you and the unbelievers in the
hereafter such as the flame of the Hellfire, severe, everlasting, and
painful chastisement, you would see that you were in a wide garden and
an inclusive blessing.[^3] Then the Imam went away, while the Jew was
bursting with rage and malice.

[^2] Al-Manaqib, vol. 2, p. 142. A‘yan al-Shi‘a, vol. 4, p. 20.
[^3] Ibn al-Sabbagh, al-Fusool al-Muhimma, p. 161.

A stupid, spiteful person saw the Imam’s veneration and dignity, and
then he said to him: “You have greatness (haughtiness)!” The Imam
answered him, saying: “I have might (honor)!” Then he recited these
words of Him, the Exalted: “And to Allah belongs the might and to His
Apostle and to the believers.[^1] ”[^2]

Al-Hasan was similar to his grandfather the Prophet (a.s) in his
veneration, righteousness, and noble natures.

**His Scientific Talents**

Imam al-Hasan (a.s) was from the sources of intellect, and the founts
of wisdom and knowledge in Islam. He practically and positively had
participated in forming the human reason and developing the scientific
and intellectual life in his age. It was narrated that, ‘Al-Hasan and
al-Husayn poured knowledge…’[^3] Biographers agreed that Imam al-Hasan
(a.s) was from the authorities of fatwas in the Islamic world. The
Prophet’s companions crowded to listen to his speech and ladle from his
sciences. Many narrators narrated from him. We will talk about this
matter in one of the following chapters. The wonderful scientific
heritage transmitted from his is the best proof on his abundant
knowledge.

**His good Style and Eloquence**

All the perfect qualities presented themselves in Imam Abu Muhammad
(al-Hasan), and his noble personality was distinguished by them. From
among his wonderful qualities was eloquence and good style in speech. He
(a.s) was the most skillful of the eloquent in saying correct speeches
during the ceremonies, the ablest of them in abridgement, inimitability,
and creativity of speech. Indeed he was such, for he branched from the
tree of the good style, eloquence, and sound judgment. His grandfather,
Allah’s Apostle (a.s) was the most eloquent of those who spoke Arabic,
and his father, Imam Ali, was the master of the eloquent and
eloquence.

Imam al-Hasan (a.s) was similar to his father in his good style and
eloquence. He (a.s) has left behind him an excellent inheritance and
eloquent, wise sayings containing the principles of social morals,
advice, guidance, and immortal preachments. They have been inlaid with
pretty pronunciation and high meaning. We will mention some of them.

[^1] Qur’an, 63, 8.
[^2] Al-Manaqib, vol. 2, p. 149.
[^3] An-Nihaya by Ibnul Atheer.

**Social manners**

Imam Ali (a.s) asked al-Hasan some questions related to the principles
of morals and virtues, and he (a.s) answered him with spontaneous
intuitions and thoughts. His answers were among the signs of eloquence
and inimitability. Imam Ali: O my little son, what is rightness?
Al-Hasan: O father, rightness is repelling evil deeds with good deeds.

-What is honor?
-It is choosing a tribe and avoiding guilt. -What is manhood? -It is
chastity, and that man should set right his property. -What is vice? -It
is looking into the small and preventing the insignificant. -What is
meanness? -Man heaps up money for himself and degrades his
honor.[^1] -What is munificence? -It is giving generously in good days
and bad days. -What is stinginess? -It is that you see what is in your
hand as an honor and what you spend as waste. -What is brotherhood? -It
is loyalty during hardship and ease. -What is cowardice? -It is audacity
toward the friend and recoiling from the enemy. -What is gain? -It is
the wish for piety and renouncing the world. -What is clemency? -It is
suppressing rage and controlling self. -What is riches? -It is that the
soul is satisfied with what Allah apportions even if it is little, for
riches is that of the soul. -What is poverty? -It is that the soul is
greedy toward all things.

[^1] Al-Bustani, Da’irat al-Ma‘arif, vol. 7, p. 39. -What is power?

-It is strong courage and fighting with strong people. -What is
humiliation? -It is the fear during telling the truth. -What is
boldness? -It is the agreement with the associates. -What is
hardship? -It is that you speak in respect of that which does not
concern you. -What is glory? -It is that you should pay debt and pardon
(someone’s) sin. -What is reason? -It is that it memorizes all that
which you want it to memorize. -What is foolishness? -It is that you
show enmity toward your Imam and raise your voice before him. -What is
laudation? -It is that you do favors and give up the ugly. -What is
determination? -It is patience, leniency toward governors, and caution
of people through mistrust. -What is honor? -It is the agreement with
brothers (friends). -What is impudence? -It is following the mean and
making friends with the misguided. -What is inattentiveness? -It is that
you abandon the mosque and obey the mischief-maker. -What is
deprivation? -It is that you refuse your luck when it is put before
you. -What is a master? -A master is he who takes care of the affairs of
the tribe.[^1]

The soul stands perplexed before these spontaneous answers of Imam
al-Hasan. He answered without affection. He has knowledge of the meaning
of [^1] Ibn Kuthayr, Tarikh, vol. 8, p. 39.

these important questions. Therefore, the soul cannot but admires. It
has a good impression, admits this greatness, and yields to these
scientific talents.

**Noble Moral Traits**

Jabir has said: “I have heard al-Hasan (a.s) saying: ‘Noble moral
traits are ten. They are the truthfulness of a tongue, the truthfulness
of courage, giving to the beggar, good manners, the reward for a favor,
retaining kinship, protecting the neighbor, regarding the right of a
friend, entertaining a guest, and the head of them is modesty.” [^1] One
day Mu’awiya turned to Imam al-Hasan (a.s) and said to him:

-O Abu Muhammad, I have found none to give me an answer about three
qualities. -What are they?

-manhood, generosity, and courage. -As for manhood, it is that man
should set right the affair of his religion, undertake his properties
well, spread al-salaam (greetings), and show affection to people. As for
generosity, it is that man should give before he is asked, do favor
willingly, and give food at the appropriate time. As for courage, it is
that man should defend his neighbor, resist during a misfortune, and be
patient during hardships. A man came to Imam al-Hasan and asked him:

-O son of Allah’s Apostle (a.s) who is the best of people?
-He who takes people as partners in his livelihood.
-Who is the wickedest of people?
-He who takes none as partner in his livelihood.[^2]

**Vices**

Imam al-Hasan (a.s) has said: “Three (vices) destroy people:
haughtiness, greediness, and envy. As for haughtiness, it destroys the
religion; and Iblis was cursed because of it. As for greediness, it is
the enemy of soul; and because of it Adam was taken out of the Garden.
As for envy, it is the pioneer

[^1] Al-Ya‘qubi, Tarikh, vol. 2, p. 201.
[^2] Ibid., p. 202.

of evil deeds; and because of it Qabil (Cain) killed Habil (Abel).”[^1]
Without doubt these vices, which Imam al-Hasan has urged people to avoid
and of whose damages he has given some examples, are the origins of
crimes and mothers of vices.

**Urging to seek Knowledge**

Imam al-Hasan (a.s) has said to his children: “Seek knowledge, for you
are the young of the people and their grown-ups tomorrow. Whoever of you
does not memorize, then he must write down.”[^2] He (a.s) has said:
“Teach people and learn the knowledge of other than you, and then you
must master your knowledge and have known what you had not known.”[^3] He
(a.s) has said: “A good question is the half of knowledge.”[^4]

**The Excellence of Reason**

He (a.s) has said: “Whoever has no reason has no good manners. Whoever
has no determination has no cordiality. Whoever has no religion has no
modesty. The head of reason is associating with people in a good manner.
The happiness in the two abodes (this world and the hereafter) are
obtained through reason; whoever is deprived of reason is deprived of
them all.” [^5]

**The Excellence of the Qur’an**

He (a.s) has said: “Most surely the Qur’an has the lamps of light and
cure of hearts; therefore, man should purify his heart with it and tie
this quality to his heart, for thinking gives life to heart endowed with
insight just as one walks through the shadows of darkness using
light.”[^6] Supplication He (a.s) has said: “When Allah, the Great and
Almighty, opens for someone the door to request, He does not close the
door to response. When He opens for someone the door to deed, he does
not close the door to acceptance. When He opens to someone the door to
giving thanks, He does not close the door to an increase.”[^7]

[^7] A‘yan al-Shi‘a, vol. 4, p. 88.

**Politics**

Someone asked Imam al-Hasan about his viewpoint of politics, and he
answered him: “Politics is that you should take care of Allah’s rights,
the rights of the living, and the rights of the dead. As for Allah’s
rights, they are that you should perform what He has commanded, and
refrain from what He has prohibited. As for the rights of the living,
they are that you should fulfill your obligations towards your brothers.
You should not fall short of serving your community. You should be loyal
to the ruler as long as he is loyal to his community, and shout at the
top of your voice when he deviates from the straight path. As for the
rights of the dead, they are that you should mention their good deeds
and overlook their evil deeds, for they have the Lord Who will reckon
them.”[^1]

Mu’awiya asked Imam al-Hasan:

-What is obligatory on us in respect of our authority?
-That which Sulayman bin Dawud (Prophet Solomon) has said.
-What has Sulayman said?

-He has said to a companion of his: “Did you know what is obligatory on
the king in respect of his power? He should fear Allah secretly and
openly. He should be just during anger and pleasure. He should economize
during poverty and riches. He should not take the properties by force,
nor should he spend them wastefully.”[^2]

This is the correct policy. If rulers followed it, they would remain
forever, and peoples would lead a life of ease and comfort. Imam
al-Hasan (a.s) stated these valuable opinions before his opponent
Mu’awiya for the sake of public interests, that his opponent might
follow the light of the truth.

A Companion

Imam al-Hasan (a.s) has said: “Shall I tell you about a friend who was
the greatest of people in my sight? The head of that which made him
great in my sight was that the world was insignificant in his sight. He
was away from the power of his stomach. He had no desire for the
unlawful, nor did he heap up what he found. He was outside the authority
of ignorance, so he did not stretch out a hand unless he was sure that
it was for a profit. He did not complain nor did he grumble. He always
kept silent. When he spoke, he surpassed and overcame the speakers. He
was weak and was deemed as weak.

[^1] Al-‘Urfan Magazine, vol. 40, part 3.
[^2] Al-Ya‘qubi, Tarikh, vol. 2, p. 202.

When seriousness came, he was a running lion. When scientists gathered,
he listened more than he spoke. When his speech was overcome, his
silence was not overcome. He did not say what he did not do, nor did he
do what he did not say. When two affairs occurred to him, and he did not
know which of them was nearer to the truth, he pondered on the closer of
them to his desire and he opposed it. He did not blame anyone for
anything for which he might apologize. He said nothing unless he saw a
just judge and witness.”[^1]

He (a.s) has said to a son of his: “O my little son, do not make
friends with anyone unless you know his manners. The close one is he
whom affection makes close, and the far one is he whom affection makes
far even if his lineage is close.” A man asked him to make friends with
him and sit with him, and he (a.s) said to him: “Beware of praising me,
for I am more knowledgeable of my self than you are. Beware of accusing
me of lying, for a liar has no opinion. Be ware of backbiting someone in
my presence.” Accordingly, the man said: “Permit me to go away!” He said
to him: “Yes, if you wish.”[^2]

**Munificence and good Deeds**

While Imam al-Hasan (a.s) was circumambulating the Kaaba, a man asked
him about the meaning of “generous one”. He answered him, saying: “Most
surely your speech has two meanings: If you are asking about the
creature, then the generous one is he who performs what has been made
obligatory on him, and the miser is he who withholds from performing
what has been made obligatory on him. And if you are asking about the
Creator, then He is Generous if He gives, and He is Generous if He
deprives. If He gives a servant something, He gives him that which does
not belong to him, and if He deprives him, He deprives him of something
which does not belong to him.”[^3] He (a.s) has said: “The good deed is
that which is not preceded by postponement and not followed by
reminding, and the giving before asking is the greatest kind of
righteousness.”[^4]

[^1] Ibn Qutayba, ‘Uyun al-Akhbar, vol. 2, p. 55. Others have mentioned
it in a different expression.
[^2] Tuhaf al-‘Uqool, p. 55.
[^3] Majjma‘ al-Bahrain, Chapter on Munificence.
[^4] A‘yan al-Shi‘a, vol. 4, p. 88.

**Miserliness**

Imam al-Hasan (a.s) has said: “Miserliness includes bad deeds and
defects, and cuts off affection from hearts.” He (a.s) was asked about
miserliness, and he answered: “Miserliness is that man regards what he
spends as wastefulness and what he withholds as honor.”[^1]

**Humbleness
**
He (a.s) has said: “The most knowledgeable one of his brothers’ rights
and the best in carrying them out is the best of them to Allah. Whoever
shows humbleness toward his brothers in this world is near Allah among
the very truthful and among the followers of Ali bin Abi Talib
(a.s).”[^2] Relying on Allah It was said to him: “Abu Tharr often said:
‘Poverty is more lovable to me than riches and illness is more lovable
to me than well-being.’ He said: ‘May Allah have mercy on Abu Tharr. As
for me, I say: ‘Whoever relies on Allah’s good choosing does not desire
for a condition other than that which Allah has chosen for him.”[^3]

Refuting Compulsion

The people of Basra sent a letter to Imam al-Hasan (a.s) and asked him
to give his viewpoint about compulsion[^4] , and he (a.s) replied:
“Whoever does not believe in Allah, His decree, and His determination is
an unbeliever. Whoever ascribes his own sin to his Lord is dissolute.
Most surely Allah is not obeyed unwillingly, nor is He disobeyed out of
overcoming. He possesses what He has made them possess and the Powerful
over that which He has

[^1] Nihayat al-Irab fi Funun al-Adab, vol. 3, p. 398.
[^2] Warram, Majjmu‘a, p. 312.
[^3] Ibn Kuthayr, Tarikh, vol. 8, p. 39.
[^4] The research on compulsion (jabr) and authorization (tafwidh) is
among the most important and difficult theologian problems. In respect
of them the scientists’ viewpoints are disorderly and different. The
thought of compulsion (jabr) was famous in Basra because of al-Hasan
al-Basri and Abu al-Hasan al-Ash‘ri, the grandson of Abu Musa al-Ash‘ri.
Generally speaking, the thought of compulsion (jabr) is that the action
issues from a servant is not created by him or her; rather it is created
by Allah, the Most High. The servant’s intention and ability have
nothing to do with finding action whether it issues from him willingly
or unwillingly. Aayat Allah, professor, Sayyid Abu al-Qasim al-Khu’i,
may Allah have mercy on him, has fully discussed the subject matter. He
has indicated that compulsion (jabr) and authorization (tafwidh) are
corrupt. He has established that the intermediate position, which the
Shi‘ites maintain, is correct. I (the author) have written what he, may
Allah have mercy on him, has mentioned in a separate book.

made powerful. Therefore if they act with obedience, He does not come
between them and what they do. If they do not do, then it is not He Who
compels them to do that. If Allah compelled the creation to obey Him,
then He would drop from them reward, and if he compelled them to disobey
Him, then he would drop from them punishment. If he neglected them, then
there would be feebleness in His capability. But He has in them the will
He has made absent from them. Therefore if they performed the acts of
obedience, then He did a kindness for them, and if they performed the
acts of disobedience, then He had the proof against them.”[^1]

**Fear of Allah**

Imam al-Hasan (a.s) has said: “Most surely Allah has not created you in
vain, nor will He vainly leave you. He has determined your terms of
death and apportioned among you your livelihoods, that every owner of a
position may come to know his position, and that what He decrees for him
befalls him, and what He turns away from him does not befall him. He has
sufficed you the burden of the world, given you free time to worship
Him, urged you to thank Him, made obligatory on you remembering Him,
commanded you to fear Him, and made the fear of Him the utmost of His
pleasure. Fear of Allah is a door to all kinds of repentance, head of
wisdom, and honor of deeds. Through the fear of Allah the Allah-fearing
have succeeded. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has said: ‘Surely for
those who guard (against evil) is achievement.’ [^2] And He has said:
‘And Allah shall deliver those who guard (against evil) with their
achievement; evil shall not touch them, nor shall they grieve.’[^3]
Therefore, fear Allah, O servants of Allah. You should know that whoever
fears Allah, Allah will find for him a way to get out of discords. He
will direct him in respect of his affairs, prepare for him guidance, and
make him successful in his proof. He will whiten his face, give him his
wish to be with those upon whom Allah has bestowed favors from among the
prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the good, and a goodly
companion are they.”[^4]

**Preaching and Guidance**

Imam al-Hasan (a.s) has said: “O son of Adam, refrain from the things
made prohibited by Allah, and you are a worshiper. Be satisfied with
what Allah apportions, and you are rich. Neighbor well those who
neighbor you, and you

[^1] Rasa’il Jamharat al-‘Arab, vol. 2, p. 25.
[^2] Qur’an, 78, 31.
[^3] Ibid., 39, 61.
[^4] Tuhaf al-‘Uqool, p. 55.

are a Muslim. Associate with people in the same manner you want them to
associate with you, and you are just. The people before you collected
(money) very much, built houses, and hoped for the far-fetched things,
but their collecting has become waste, their deeds have become
vainglory, and their graves have become their houses. O son of Adam, you
have demolished your lifetime since you were born. Therefore give
generously from that which is in your hands. A believer makes provision,
and an unbeliever enjoys.” After this speech of his, Imam al-Hasan, used
to recite these Qur’anic verse: And make provision, for surely piety is
the best (kind) of provision.[^1]

And he (a.s) has said: “O servants of Allah, fear Allah, be earnest in
requesting (good deeds), and hurry to (perform good) deeds before death,
for the ease in the world does not last, the tragedies wherein can come
anytime, and the evil deeds wherein are not avoided. It (the world) is a
changeable deception and an inclined pillar. Therefore, O servants of
Allah, learn from the lessons, take an example from the Prophetic
traditions, be restrained by the favors, and make use of the sermons.
Sufficient for a place of protection and helper is Allah! Sufficient for
an arguer and opponent is the Book! Sufficient for a reward is the
Garden! And sufficient for punishment and harm is the Fire!”[^2]

Imam al-Hasan (a.s) consoled a man for the death of a relative of his.
He said to him: “If this misfortune brought about a lesson to you and
made you gain a reward, then it is good and well; otherwise your
misfortune in respect of your own self is greater than your misfortune
in respect of your dead one.”[^3]

A rich man went to Imam al-Hasan and said to him: “O son of Allah’s
Apostle, I am afraid of death.” “That is because you have delayed your
property,” replied the Imam (a.s) “if you advanced it, then you were
pleased to follow it.”[^4] Imam al-Hasan (a.s) passed by some people
playing and laughing on the day of Eid al-Fitr. He (a.s) stopped, turned
to them, and said: “Allah has regarded the month of Ramadan as a field
where His creatures compete with each other for obeying Him to obtain
his pleasure. Some people preceded and succeeded. Some other people fell
short and failed. Therefore, I fully wonder at one who laughs and plays
on the day when good-doers are rewarded, and evil-doers

lose. By Allah, if the cover (between them and the unseen) was removed,
they came to know that the good-doer is busy performing his good deeds,
and the evil-doer is busy performing his evil deeds.” Then he (a.s) left
them and went away.[^1] He (a.s) has said: “I advise you to fear Allah
and think continually, for thinking is the father of the free and the
slave.” He (a.s) has said: “Whoever knows Allah loves Him, and whoever
knows the world renounces it. A believer does not play lest he (or she)
should become inattentive. When he (or she) thinks, he (or she) becomes
sad.”[^2] He (a.s) passed by a dead person prepared for burial and said:
“Most surely the affair whose end is this, its beginning is worthy of
renunciation. And the affair whose beginning is this, it is appropriate
(for one) to fear its end.”[^3]

He (a.s) has said: “People are in the abode of inattention and
heedlessness. They work but they do not know. When they reach the
hereafter, they will reach the true abode where they know but they do
not work.”[^4]

**Seeking Livelihood**

He (a.s) has said: “Do not strive for livelihood with the striving of
the victor, and do not rely on fate with the reliance of the submissive.
Seeking livelihood is recommended, and moderation in respect of seeking
livelihood is of chastity. Chastity does not repel livelihood, nor does
greediness bring it about, for livelihood is apportioned, and using
greediness is similar to using sins.”[^5] Mosques He (a.s) has said:
“Whoever frequently goes to mosques obtains eight qualities: a firm
(clear) verse, useful brotherhood, original knowledge, expected mercy, a
word leading him to guidance or preventing him from misguidance, and
giving up sins out of shyness or fear.”[^6]

**The manners of Having Food**

He (a.s) has said: “Washing the hands before having food removes
poverty, and after it removes worry.”[^1] He (a.s) has said: “There are
twelve qualities in respect of having food. It is incumbent upon a
Muslim to know them. Four of them are obligatory, four are recommended,
and four are moral. As for the obligatory qualities, they are:
knowledge, satisfaction, saying “in the name of Allah, the Beneficent,
the Merciful”, and giving thanks. As for the recommended ones, they are:
performing the ritual ablution before having food, sitting on the left
side, eating with three fingers, and licking the fingers. As for the
moral ones, they are: eating from the food which is in front of you,
making the bite small, chewing it well, and little looking at the
people’s faces.”[^2]

**Devotion to the Ahlul Bayt**

A man said to Imam al-Hasan: “O son of Allah’s Apostle, I am from your
Shia.” The Imam (a.s) said: “O servant of Allah, if you obey our
commands and prohibitions, then you are truthful. If you are contrary to
that, then do not increase your sins through claiming a high position to
which you are not entitled. Do not say that you are among our Shiaites;
rather say that you are among those who support us, show love for us,
and show enmity toward our enemies, and you are in good and will be to
good (end).”[^3]

Warning against those who distort Allah’s Book

He (a.s) has said: “O people, whoever is loyal to Allah and uses His
words as a guide for guidance toward that which is the most straight,
Allah grants him success for guidance and show him the way to good. The
neighbor of Allah is safe and guarded, and his enemy is fearful and
deserted. Therefore guard against Allah through remembering Him too
much, fear Allah through piety, and seek nearness to Him through obeying
Him, for He is Near and Answering. Allah, the Most High, has said: And
when My servants ask you concerning Me, then surely I am very near; I
answer the prayer of the suppliant when he calls on Me, so they should
answer My call and believe in Me that they may walk in the right way.[^4]
Therefore, respond to Allah and

believe in Him, for whoever knows His Greatness should not show
greatness (before Him). Indeed the highness of those who know Allah’s
might is that they should be humble (before Him). Those who know Allah’s
greatness should lower themselves (before Him), and the safety of those
who know Allah’s power is that they should yield to Him, nor should they
deny their own selves after the knowledge (of Him), nor should they go
astray after the guidance. You certainly should know that you do not
know piety unless you know the quality of guidance. Nor do you hold fast
to the covenant of the Book unless you know him who leaves it, nor do
you recite the Book with a true recitation unless you know him who
distorts it. If you know that, you know innovations and affection, you
see fabricating lies against Allah, and see how he falls who falls. Do
not let those, who do not know, make you ignorant. Seek that from its
people, for they are a special light from whom light is sought, and they
are Imams who are followed. Through them knowledge lives and ignorance
dies. It is they whose clemency tells you their knowledge, wise speech
(tells you) of their silence, and their outward (tells you) of their
inward. They do not oppose the truth nor do they differ over it.
Precedence from Allah in respect of them has passed, and a decree from
Allah in respect of them has elapsed. Most surely in that there is a
reminder to the mindful. And understand it when you hear it with the
understanding of carefulness, and do not understand it with the
understanding of narration. The narrators of the Book are many, but
those who understand it are few. And we seek help from Allah.”[^1]

**Al-Shahid and al-Mashhood**

A man went to the Mosque of Allah’s Apostle (a.s) to ask about the
meaning of these words of Him: “Wa Shahidun wa Mashhood.” The man saw
three persons sitting in the mosque. A group of people surrounded each
of them, and they told about what they had heard from Allah’s Apostle
(a.s) such as the religious precepts and good manners. The man went to
one of them and asked him about his question. He said to him: “Al-Shahid
is Friday, and al-Mashhood is the Day of Arafat.” Then the man went to
the second person and asked him the same question. He said to him:
“Al-Shahid is Friday, and al-Mashhood is the Day of Immolation.” Then
the man went to the third person and asked him his question.
[^1] Tuhaf al-‘Uqool, p. 53.

He said to him: “Al-Shahid is Allah’s Apostle (a.s), and al-Mashhood is
the Day of Resurrection.” He confirmed his speech with some proofs,
saying: “Have you not heard Allah say in His Holy Book: O Prophet,
surely we have sent you as a witness (shahid), and a bearer of good news
and as a warner. And He, the Most High, has said: And this is a day that
shall be witnessed (mashhood).”

The man asked about the first person, and it was said to him that he
was Abdullah bin Abbas.[^1] He asked about the second person, and it was
said to him that he was Abdullah bin Umar.[^2]

[^1] His full name is Abdullah bin Abbas bin Abd al-Muttalib bin Hashim,
the uncle of the Prophet (a.s.). His mother is Umm al-Fadhl, daughter of
al-Harith al-Hilali. He was born three years before the emigration, and
it was said that he was born five years before it. Allah’s Apostle
(a.s.) supplicated Allah for him, saying: “O Allah, make him understand
the religion and teach him the interpretation.” And he (a.s.) has said:
“O Allah, increase him in knowledge and understanding.” So he-due to the
blessing of the supplication of Allah’s Apostle (a.s.)-was among the
great religious scholars. Masruq has said: “When I saw Abdullah bin
Abbas, I said he was the most handsome of the people. When he spoke, I
said he was the most eloquent of the people. When he talked, I said he
was the most knowledgeable of the people.” It was said that if the
Persians, the Romans, and the Turks had heard his speech, they would
have been Muslims. He became blind at the end of his lifetime, so he
said:

If Allah has taken the light of my eyes, then I have light of them in
my tongue and my heart. My heart is clever, my mind is sound, and in my
mouth there are sayings as sharp as the sword.

He died in al-Ta’if in the year 68 A. H. That was during the days of
Ibn al-Zubayr. He was seventy years old. It was said that he was
seventy-one years old, and it was said that he was seventy-four years
old. Muhammad bin al-Hanafiya performed the prayer over him and said the
takbeer (Allah is great!) over him four times. He said: “Today the
divine person of this community has died.” This has been mentioned in
the book al-Isti‘ab, vol. 2, p. 350.

[^2] His full name is Abdullah bin Umar bin al-Khattab. He was born
three years before the day when the Prophet was appointed as a prophet.
He died in the year 84 A. H. Other than that has been said. This has
been mentioned in the book al-Isaba, vol. 2, p. 347. It has been
mentioned in the book al-Isti‘ab, vol. 2, p. 343: “He (Abdullah bin
Umar) did not follow (Imam) Ali. He refrained from (paying allegiance to
him), but he felt remorse for that. When he was about to die, he said:
‘I find in my soul (nothing) except that I did not fight along with Ali
bin Abi Talib against the rebellious group.’” In his book Muruj
al-Dhahab, vol. 2, p. 238, al-Mas‘udi has mentioned: “Some people did
not pay allegiance to Ali.” He has mentioned Abdullah bin Umar as among
them. The reason for their refraining from pledging allegiance (to Ali)
was as a rebellion against the power and as an apposition to Ali, peace
be on him.

He asked about the third person, and it was said to him that he was
al-Hasan bin Ali.[^1]

**Some of al-Hasan’s Sermons**

Imam al-Hasan (a.s) was an eloquent orator. He was the most skillful
and capable of orators in improvising and creating speeches. We will
mention to noble readers some of his sermons.

He (a.s) has said: “We are the successful party of Allah, and the
closest family of the messenger of Allah (to Allah), and his pure, good
household. We are one of the two weighty things (Thaqalayn) that Allah’s
Apostle (a.s) has left behind him. The second is Allah’s Book, in which
there are details about all things, falsehood shall not come to it from
before it nor from behind it[^2] , and depended on. We do not make
mistakes in interpreting it; rather we are sure of the facts in it.
Therefore obey us, for the obedience to us is obligatory if it is
coupled with the obedience to Allah, the Apostle, and those in
authority. Then if you quarrel about anything, refer it to Allah and the
Apostle.[^3] If they referred it to the Apostle and those in authority
from among them, then those who conclude it from among them would know
it. I warn you against listening to Satan’s call, for he is your clear
enemy, lest you should be like his friends to whom he has said: No one
can overcome you this day, and surely I am your protector. But when the
two parties came in sight of each other, he turned upon his heels, and
said: Surely I am clear of you, surely I see what you do not see.[^4]
Therefore, you throw strength before the spears, slaughtering before the
swords, errors before intention, and a target before the arrows. Then
its faith shall not profit a soul which did not believe before, or earn
good through its faith.[^5] And Allah is more knowledgeable.”

One day Imam Ali fell ill, and he ordered Imam al-Hasan to lead the
people in the Friday Prayer. He (a.s) went up on the pulpit, praised and
lauded Allah, and then said: “Allah did not send a prophet unless he
chose for him a self (associate), a group, and a household. By Him who
sent Muhammad with the Truth, when someone decreases something of our
right, Allah decreases his lifetime equal to that. When the time turns
against us, the end will be to us. And most certainly you will come to
know about it after a time.[^6] ”[^7]

His short, wise Sayings

Death has exposed the world.[^1]
Be with your body in this world and with your heart in the hereafter.
Regard that which you seek in the world and do not obtain as like that
which does not come to your mind.
When people consult each other, they reach their rightness.
Whoever seeks worship must purify himself for it.
Joking spoils respect. The silent get more gravity.
The boons are ignored when they last. When they go, they are known.
Promise is an illness in the generous, and its cure is in fulfilling
it.
An asked one is free until he promises, and he is enslaved by promise
until he fulfills it.
Do not hasten sin with punishment, and make between them a way for
apologizing.
Definite knowledge is the excuse of the learned.
Certainty is the refuge of safety.
The wise do not cheat whoever consults them.
When superfluous prayers harm obligations, then leave them.
Opportunity quickly passes and slowly comes back.
Someone asked him about silence, and he (a.s) said: “It covers
tiredness and adorns honor. Its doer is comfortable, and his companion
is safe.”
Missing something is better than requesting it from unworthy people.
Bad manners are worse than misfortune.
Whoever remembers a distant travel gets ready.
A close one is he whom affection makes close even if he is far in
lineage, and a far one is he whom affection makes far even if he is
close in lineage.

He (a.s) said to a man who recovered from his illness: “Allah
remembered

[^1] Warram, Majmu‘a, p. 201. Khalid bin Safwan has said: “The most
eloquent of people is al-Hasan bin Ali due to his saying this golden
statement representing inimitability, creation, and conciseness.”

you, so remember Him, and he forgave you, so thank Him.” If your soul
does not obey you in that which you force it to do what it dislikes,
then do not obey it in that which it forces you to do what it likes.
Whoever starts speaking before greeting, do not reply to him. Disgrace
is easier than the Fire. He (a.s) has said to his companions: “Have you
ever seen an oppressor as oppressed?” “How is that, O son of Allah’s
Apostle?” they asked. “The envier,” he replied, “for he is tired, and he
whom he envies is comfortable.” The generosity of contentment and
satisfaction is greater than that of giving. Completing favor is better
than beginning it.

**His composing of Poetry**

As for his composing of poetry, it is little. In the previous chapters
of the book, we have mentioned some poetry ascribed to him. However, Ibn
Rasheeq has numbered Imam al-Hasan (a.s) as among poets. He has
mentioned the poetry that the Imam said when he was dressed in black: We
blacken the top of them (hair), but their origins refuse that. I wish
that their origins became black.[^1]

In the book A‘yan al-Shi‘a it has been mentioned that he (a.s) has said
in respect of preaching: Leave the troubles of days. Most surely their
clearness went along with the bygone days of delight. How does time
deceive him between whom and nights there are firm experiences? In the
book al-Manaqib it has been mentioned that he (a.s) has said:

If a time saddened me, I would determine to be patient; and every
tribulation that does not last is easy. And if it delighted me, I would
not rejoice at its delight; and every delight that does not last is
mean. With this subject matter we will end our talk about Imam
al-Hasan’s inheritance and ideals.
