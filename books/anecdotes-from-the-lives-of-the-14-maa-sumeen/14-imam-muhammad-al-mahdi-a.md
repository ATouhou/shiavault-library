Imam Muhammad Al-mahdi (a)
==========================

There was a pious man called Syed Muhammad Jabal Amili who was
travelling through the desert with a caravan of people, when he got
lost.

Syed Amili searched and searched for the caravan but could not find
them. It became dark as night set in. He was all alone in the hot
desert, tired, hungry and frightened.

He was about to give up and prepare himself for death when he suddenly
saw some water. He went to the water drank some and then did wudhu and
offered his Salaat.

After his Salaat he did not have anymore strength and lay there waiting
for death.

All of a sudden he saw a person riding a horse getting closer and
closer to him.

When the horse rider reached Syed Amili he said Salaam to him and asked
him what the matter was. Syed Amili explained that he had lost his
caravan and was hungry.

The rider asked him why then did he not eat the melons that were lying
beside him. Syed Amili asked the rider not to make fun of him as he had
searched all over for food.

The rider said he was not joking, and to look behind him. Syed Amili
looked and there were three melons.

The rider then told him to eat one of them and to take the other two
with him and pointed out the direction he was to go in. He also told
Syed Amili that at about sunset he would reach a tent and from there he
would be guided to his caravan.

Then the rider disappeared. Syed Amili says that that was when he
realised that it was our 12th Imam, Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi (A).

Syed Amili did as he was told and sure enough the next day at sunset he
reached the tent and was directed to his caravan.

**Moral:**

Although we can not see our 12th Imam (A) he can see us and knows when
we are in need of his help and comes to help us.

Many people ask what is the use of an Imam that can not be seen. Just
as the sun is still of use to us even when it is hidden behind the
clouds, Imam (A) is of benefit even when hidden.

Although we can not see our 12th Imam, Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi (A) can
see us. He is aware of our prayers, deeds actions and troubles. Any
believer who truly asks him for help receives his assistance.

The ghaybat (concealment) of Imam (A) is in two stages:

1. Ghaybate sughra - minor concealment.
2. Ghaybate kubra - major concealment.

Ghaybate sughra started from after Imam (A) led the funeral prayer of
his father (Imam Hasan al-Askeri (A)) until the death of his 4th deputy.
All in all 68years.

Ghaybate kubra started from the death of his 4th deputy till this
day.

During Ghaybate sughra although the Muslims could not see Imam (A) they
could communicate with him through his deputies:

1. Uthman bin Said
2. Muhammad bin Uthman
3. Husain bin Rauh
4. Ali bin Muhammad Samry.

During Ghaybate kubra although there are no special deputies. The
Mujtahids are his representatives.

There have been many examples in history of where Imam (A) has guided
and helped his followers:

There once lived a great Mujtahid named Allama Majlisi. Once this
Mujtahid was asked what to do with the body of a pregnant woman who had
died. Should the dead woman be buried as she was or should she be cut
open and the child removed, then the woman buried.

Allama decided that the woman should be buried as she was, with the
child.

When the people were carrying the coffin to the grave, a horseman
appeared and said that Allama had decided that the baby should be
removed. This was done.

A few years later Allama Majlisi was visited by a man with a small
child. The man told Allama that this was the same child that had been
cut from his mother after Allama had sent the horseman telling the
people that he had changed his instructions.

Allama immediately realised that the horseman must have been Imam
Muhammad al-Mahdi (A) who had come to his help, preventing him making a
grave mistake.

From that day Allama stayed in his house refusing to give anymore
advise to the people, in case he made another mistake. In a few days he
received a letter from Imam (A) telling him that he should not worry and
should continue to guide the people. If by any chance he made a mistake
Imam (A) would come to help him rectify it.

The duties of each and every Muslim in the time of Ghatbate kubra is:

1. To be the caretakers of Islam.
2. To pray for the safety of Imam (A) and give sadaqa for his safety.
3. Ask Allah to make Imam (A) appearance soon, so that he may come and
fill the world with truth and peace.
4. Whenever the name of the12th Imam is said, you should stand, placing
your right hand on your head and bow your head. You should also recite
Salawaat after his name.

**Moral:**

The Holy Prophet (S) has said that if someone dies without knowing the
Imam (A) of his time, his death is that of an unbeliever. We must
therefore carry out our duties to our 12th Imam who is still alive and
in Ghaybate(concealment).

As soon as our 12th Imam, Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi (A) was born, he did
Sajdah.

Soon after his birth one of the maids went to see Imam Muhammad
al-Mahdi (A), who was lying in his cradle. The maid said "Salaam" to the
Imam (A) and the Imam (A) answered her salaam.

The maid was surprised. The maid then sneezed and Imam Muhammad
al-Mahdi (A) said from the cradle:"Yarhamukallah, it is a blessing from
Allah and you can be sure to live for the next 3 days."

**Moral:**

1. When anyone says Salaam to you it is Wajib on you to answer and you
should try to answer more than what was said to you.
2. When anyone else sneezes you should say Yarhamukallah; when you
yourself sneeze you should say Alhamdulillah.
