Wife and Her Dower
==================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "The bad omen of a woman is her expensive
dower and her ill temper."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 58, p. 321

Imam Abu 'Abdullah said: " Thieves are of three divisions:

1. Those who hinder giving alms;

2. Those who consider the withholding of women's dower sum as lawful;

3. Those who take loans and have not decided to pay it back."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 96, p. 12

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "Verily, one of the blessings of a woman is the
inexpensiveness of her dower, while one of her bad omens is the
heaviness of her dower."

Man La Yahdurulul Faqih, vol. 3, p. 387

Imam Amir ul Mu'mineen (‘a) said: "Do not make the women's dowers heavy,
because it creates enmity."

Wasa'il-ush Shi'ah, vol. 21, p. 253

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "The worst sins are three:

Labouring animals as murder, restraining the dower of a woman, and
withholding the wage of a worker."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 64, p. 268
