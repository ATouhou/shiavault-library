14) Hadith Al-Thaqalayn: Clarifying The Confusions Of Ibn Taymiyyah (Part 2)
============================================================================

Shaykh Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 728 H) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وفي لفظ لا يزال الإسلام عزيزا إلى أثنى عشر خليفة كلهم من قريش وهكذا
كان فكان الخلفاء أبو بكر وعمر وعثمان وعلي ثم تولى من اجتمع الناس عليه
وصار له عز ومنعة معاوية وابنه يزيد ثم عبد الملك وأولاده الأربعة وبينهم
عمر بن عبد العزيز
  </p>
</blockquote>

And in a text “Islam will never cease to be strong till twelve
khalifahs, all of them from Quraysh”, and this was exactly how it was,
for the khalifahs were Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, ‘Ali and then those
upon whom the people agreed, who were strong and invincible, ruled:
Mu’awiyah, his son Yazid, ‘Abd al-Malik, and his four children, and
‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Aziz was one of them.[^1]

Here, our Shaykh tells us that:

• Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, Mu’awiyah, Yazid, ‘Abd al-Malik and others
were Imams from the offspring of Ibrahim.

• They all held the Covenant of Allah, which was Imamah, and guided
humanity with His Command.

• None of them was a wrongdoer, to himself or to others.

• None of them was a wrongdoer who violated any of the laws of Allah,
before and during his Imamah.

• All of them were directly appointed by Allah, as He appointed their
father, Ibrahim and all the Imams before them.

• All of them were kings who ruled by kingdom, and held the kingdom over
the Ummah.

• If we take Hadith al-Thaqalayn and Hadith al-Khalifatayn into
consideration, then the submissions of Ibn Taymiyyah also imply that:

• Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, Mu’awiyah, Yazid, ‘Abd al-Malik and the
others were all from the offspring of Prophet Muhammad.

• They were his offspring, his Ahl al-Bayt, who never contradicted or
violated the Qur’an for even a single second.

Of course, Abu Bakr and the other Sunni khalifahs were:

• not from the offspring of Muhammad or his Ahl al-Bayt;

• not appointed by Allah;

• not holders of the Covenant or Command of Allah;

• wrongdoers who wronged themselves and others by disobeying Allah and
committing sins on several occasions;

• not kings who ruled by kingdom, except for Mu’awiyah and the
subsequent Umayyads (and Abbasids); and

• not holders of kingdom over the Ummah, except for Mu’awiyah and the
subsequent Umayyads (and Abbasids).

The bottom-line is: it is impossible to fit Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Uthman,
especially, into the descriptions of the true khalifahs mentioned in the
Qur’an and the authentic Sunnah. Undoubtedly, they were rulers.

But, certainly, they were neither khalifahs nor Imams. The difference
between political or military rule and khilafah is highlighted in the
story of Harun, ‘alaihi al-salam. His blessed brother appointed him as
his khalifah over his Ummah during the former’s absence from them:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وقال موسى لأخيه هارون اخلفني في قومي
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Musa said to his brother, Harun: “Be my khalifah over my
people.”***[^2]

Meanwhile, al-Samiri overthrew Harun and installed himself, with the
help of the masses, as the ruler of Israel:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال فإنا قد فتنا قومك من بعدك وأضلهم السامري
  </p>
</blockquote>

***He (Allah) said: “Verily! We have tried your people in your absence,
and al-Samiri has led them astray.”***[^3]

We also read:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال ابن أم إن القوم استضعفوني وكادوا يقتلونني
  </p>
</blockquote>

***He (Harun) said, “O son of my mother! Indeed the people judged me
weak, and were about to murder me.”***[^4]

Yet, Harun remained the true khalifah of Israel, even though al-Samiri
had seized power. This is how things work in Islam. What confers
legitimacy is not power, but divine appointment. The Prophet appointed
the Book of Allah and his offspring as his joint khalifahs till the Day
of al-Qiyamah.

Imagine if all Muslims the world over rejected the authority of the
Qur’an, would that cancel out its khilafah? Of course, its khilafah
continues over the Ummah, whether they recognize it or not! It is the
same with the Ahl al-Bayt. They are the joint khalifahs over humanity
along with the Kitab – and remain so till the Hour – whether anyone
obeys them or none does:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وانهما لن يفترقا حتى يردا على الحوض
  </p>
</blockquote>

Verily, both shall NEVER separate from each other until they meet me at
the Lake-Fount.

Another error of our dear Shaykh is his confusion of these two
sentences:

• Islam is strong.

• The Ummah is strong.

This is why he declares:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وهذا تصديق ما أخبر به النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم حيث قال لا يزال هذا
الدين عزيزا ما تولى اثنا عشر خليفة كلهم من قريش وهؤلاء الاثنا عشر
خليفة هم المذكورون في التوراة حيث قال في بشارته بإسماعيل وسيلد اثنى
عشر عظيما
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ومن طن أن هؤلاء الاثنى عشر هم الذين تعتقد الرافضة إمامتهم فهو في غاية
الجهل فإن هؤلاء ليس فيهم من كان له سيف إلا علي بن أبي طالب
  </p>
</blockquote>

This is a confirmation of what the Prophet, peace be upon him, had
prophesied when he said: “This religion will never cease to be strong as
long as twelve khalifahs rule, all of them from Quraysh”. These twelve
khalifahs are those mentioned in al-Tawrah, when He (Allah) said in His
glad tiding concerning Isma’il: “He will give birth to twelve great
people”. Whoever these that these twelve are those who are accepted as
Imams by the Rafidhah is in the worst level of ignorance, for there was
none among them who held military authority except ‘Ali b. Abi
Talib.[^5]

Ibn Taymiyyah apparently equates the might of the Ummah with that of its
religion. Meanwhile, it is perfectly possible to have a strong Islam but
a weak Ummah. The strength of the Ummah is obviously in its unity and
military prowess. However, that of the religion lies only in its ability
to “stand” on the surface of the earth. This has been explicitly stated
in another hadith:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لا يزال الدين قائما حتى تقوم الساعة أو يكون عليكم اثنا عشر خليفة كلهم
من قريش
  </p>
</blockquote>

The religion will never cease to STAND until the establishment of the
Hour or as long as there are twelve khalifahs over you, all of them from
Quraysh.[^6]

There are always forcing struggling to push Islam to the ground.
However, it will never fall. It shall remain standing on the earth till
al-Qiyamah. This is the meaning of its strength. The inability of its
enemies to terminate it is its invincibility. This is also indicated in
yet another hadith documented by Imam Ahmad (d. 241 H):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا عبد الله حدثني أبي ثنا حماد بن أسامة ثنا مجالد عن عامر عن جابر
بن سمرة السوائي قال سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم يقول في حجة
الوداع إن هذا الدين لن يزال ظاهرا على من ناوأه لا يضره مخالف ولا مفارق
حتى يمضى من أمتي اثنا عشر خليفة قال ثم تكلم بشيء لم أفهمه فقلت لأبي ما
قال قال كلهم من قريش
  </p>
</blockquote>

‘Abd Allah (b. Ahmad) – my father (Ahmad b. Hanbal) – Hammad b. Usamah –
Mujalid – ‘Amir – Jabir b. Samurah al-Suwai:

I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, saying during the
Farewell Hajj: “Verily, this religion will never cease to be victorious
over whoever opposes it - no opponent or defector will be able to harm
it – as long as twelve khalifahs pass from my Ummah.” Then, he said
something which I did not understand. So, I said to my father, “What did
he say?” He replied, “All of them will be from Quraysh.”[^7]

Al-Arnaut says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حديث صحيح
  </p>
</blockquote>

It is a sahih hadith[^8]

All praise be to Allah: our religion has continued to stand upon its two
feet since the departure of our Prophet, despite the persistent
aggression and subversion of its hardened foes to bring it down.
Interestingly, as long as Islam breathes on our planet, there is one of
the twelve khalifahs from the offspring of Muhammad, placed over
humanity by Allah as their master and guide.

Contrary to the hallucinations of Shaykh Ibn Taymiyyah, the first of the
true royal khalifahs of this Ummah was none other than Imam ‘Ali b. Abi
Talib. Imam Ibn Abi ‘Asim (d. 287 H) records:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ثنا محمد بن المثنى، حدثنا يحي بن حماد، عن أبي عوانة، عن يحيى بن سليم
أبي بلج عن عمرو بن ميمون، عن ابن عباس قال: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه
وسلم لعلي: أنت مني بمنزلة هارون من موسى إلا أنك لست نبيا وأنت خليفتي
في كل مؤمن من بعدي.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Muhammad b. al-Muthanna – Yahya b. Hammad – Abu ‘Awanah – Yahya b.
Sulaym Abu Balj – ‘Amr b. Maymun – Ibn ‘Abbas: The Messenger of Allah,
peace be upon him, said to ‘Ali: “You are to me of the status of Harun
to Musa, with the exception that you are not a prophet. And you are my
khalifah over every believer after me.”[^9]

Dr. al-Jawabirah says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اسناده حسن.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Its chain is hasan.[^10]

And ‘Allamah al-Albani (d. 1420 H) backs him:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إسناده حسن
  </p>
</blockquote>

Its chain is hasan.[^11]

A quick question that comes to mind here is: was ‘Ali from the offspring
of Muhammad?

The answer is simple: there are instances where a person or thing is
included within a foreign category for a specific purpose. For instance,
Iblis was counted among the angels by Allah in His Order to them to
prostrate to Prophet Adam, ‘alaihi al-salam[^12]. However, he was only a
jinn[^13]. So, for the purpose of that Divine Command, Iblis was
regarded as an angel, even though he was not.

A similar situation existed between Prophet Ibrahim, ‘alaihi al-salam,
and Prophet Lut, ‘alaihi al-salam. Allah says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وتلك حجتنا آتيناها إبراهيم على قومه نرفع درجات من نشاء إن ربك حكيم
عليم وهبنا له إسحاق ويعقوب كلا هدينا ونوحا هدينا من قبل ومن ذريته
داوود وسليمان وأيوب ويوسف وموسى وهارون وكذلك نجزي المحسنين وزكريا
ويحيى وعيسى وإلياس كل من الصالحين وإسماعيل واليسع ويونس ولوطا وكلا
فضلنا على العالمين
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And that was Our Hujjah which We gave Ibrahim against his people. We
raise whom We will in ranks. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise,
All-Knowing. And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Ya’qub, each of them We
guided – and We guided Nuh before (him) – and among his offspring were
Dawud, Sulayman, Ayub, Yusuf, Musa, and Harun – thus do We reward the
good-doers – and Zakariyyah, Yahya, ‘Isa and Ilyas – each one of them
was of the righteous – and Isma’il, al-Yasa’, Yunus and Lut; and each
one of them We made superior above the*** ***worlds.***[^14]

Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir (d. 774 H) explains:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فالضمير في قوله ومن ذريته عائد على إبراهيم على المشهور. ولوط وإن كان
ابن أخيه إلا أنه دخل في الذرية تغليبا. وهذا هو الحامل للقائل الآخر إن
الضمير على نوح كما قدمنا في قصته والله أعلم.
  </p>
</blockquote>

The pronoun in his statement “and among his offspring” refers to Ibrahim
according to the popular opinion. As for Lut, even though he was his
nephew, he was part of the offspring as a minority entry. This is the
problem of those who hold the second opinion that the pronoun refers to
Nuh, as we have explained in his story. And Allah knows best.[^15]

Imam al-Qurtubi (d. 671 H) says a similar thing:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
}ومن ذريته {أي ذرية إبراهيم .وقيل: من ذرية نوح، قاله الفراء وأختاره
الطبري وغير واحد من المفسرين كالقشيري وابن عطية وغيرهما .والأول قاله
الزجاج، واعترض بأنه عد من هذه الذرية يونس ولوط وما كانا من ذرية
إبراهيم .وكان لوط ابن أخيه .وقيل :ابن أخته .وقال ابن عباس :هؤلاء
الأنبياء جميعا مضافون إلى ذرية إبراهيم، وإن كان فيهم من لم تلحقه ولادة
من جهته من جهة أب ولا أم، لأن لوطا ابن أخي إبراهيم .والعرب تجعل العم
أبا كما أخبر} الله عن ولد يعقوب أنهم قالوا نعبد إلهك وإله آبائك
إبراهيم وإسماعيل وإسحاق {وإسماعيل عم يعقوب. وعد عيسى من ذرية إبراهيم
وإنما هو ابن البنت. فأولاد فاطمة رضي الله عنها ذرية النبي صلى الله
عليه وسلم.
  </p>
</blockquote>

***{And among his offspring},*** that is the offspring of Ibrahim. It is
also said: among the offspring of Nuh – this opinion belonged to al-Fara
and was adopted by al-Tabari and many of the mufassiroon like
al-Qushayri, Ibn ‘Atiyyah and others. Al-Zajjaj held the first opinion,
and he is opposed with the statement that part of those counted among
the offspring were Yunus and Lut, and they both were not from the
offspring of Ibrahim. Lut was his nephew. And Ibn ‘Abbas said: “All of
these prophets are counted among the offspring of Ibrahim, even though
there are among them who were not his descendants, for Lut was the
nephew of Ibrahim.”

The Arabs consider the uncle to be a father too, as Allah informs
concerning the children of Ya’qub, when they said (to Ya’qub), ***“We
shall worship your God, the God of your fathers – Ibrahim, Isma’il, and
Ishaq – One God, and to Him we submit.” [2:133]*** Isma’il was the uncle
of Ya’qub. Also, ‘Isa is counted among the offspring of Ibrahim, while
he was only the son of the daughter. Therefore, the offspring of
Fatimah, may Allah be pleased with her, are offspring of the Prophet,
peace be upon him.[^16]

So, Lut was counted among the offspring of Ibrahim for some specific
purposes, most likely al-nubuwwah. In this same manner, this hadith
apparently includes ‘Ali within the offspring of Muhammad, for the
specific purposes of khilafah and Imamah:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أنت خليفتي في كل مؤمن من بعدي
  </p>
</blockquote>

You are my khalifah over every believer after me.
