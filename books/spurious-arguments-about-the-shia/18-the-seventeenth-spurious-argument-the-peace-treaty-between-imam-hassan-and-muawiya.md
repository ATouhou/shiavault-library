The Seventeenth Spurious Argument: The Peace Treaty between Imam Hassan and Muawiya
===================================================================================

Some criticize the Shias saying that Imam Hasan had made peace with
Mu’awiya (the first Umayyad caliph) and put an end to the conflict
between them, and that he did not listen to his Companions who wanted
instead to involve him in sedition. To them this indicates that the
policy of the Prophet’s family towards his Companions was not a hostile
policy at all as the Shia claim.

The Answer
----------

When Imam Hasan bin Ali set about making peace with Mu’awiya and ending
the war with him, he was not going against the policy of his father
(Imam Ali). Imam Hasan’s army by that time had become weak, discord had
erupted within the ranks, and many of them refused to obey him. Many men
were overcome by greed and sided with Mu’awiya. Imam Hasan (a) knew that
the war with Mu’awiya would not be for his benefit and it would cause
the shedding of Muslim blood and the killing of the followers of the
Prophet’s family; therefore, he was obliged to make peace with Mu’awiya
in order to spare their blood.

However Imam Hasan was never agreeable with Mu’awiya being the caliph of
the Muslims. His exalted personality could never have accepted such a
claim. Anyone who knows anything about the circumstances of the peace
treaty between Imam Hasan and Mu’awiya would be certain that Imam Hasan,
his father, and his brother (Imam Husayn) thought that Mu’awiya and all
the Umayyads were of the same ilk without any difference.
