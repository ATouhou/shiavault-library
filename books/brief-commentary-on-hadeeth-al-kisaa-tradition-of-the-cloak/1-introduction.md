*Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Raheem*

The *Tradition of the Cloak* (Hadeeth Al Kisaa) is an authentic and
frequently narrated (Mutawatir) tradition that has been cited by
recognized Islamic sources in the major schools of thoughts in Islam in
the books of exegesis, tradition, and history. The *Tradition of the
Cloak* is further validated by its agreement and consistency with the
Holy Qurâ€™an and its teachings, direction, and essence.

No one can deny or doubt that this great tradition came to us from the
Holy Prophet (SA) in honor of his purified Household (AhlulBayt). There
are slight variations in the way that this tradition is relayed;
however, the core of the tradition in its meaning and essence is the
same. The significance behind this event points to the fact that the
Prophet (SA) intended to apply the verse of Purification (Ayat Al
Tat-heer) on these holy personalities under the cloak, as he aimed to
confirm that they are the ones meant and intended in the holy verse and
not anyone else.

Some of us hear this tradition being recited in gatherings at the mosque
or at the commencement of Islamic programs. But do we all recognize and
fully understand the obvious and latent meanings behind the details of
this of this great event? We take this opportunity to begin in the name
of Allah (SWT) in an attempt to shed the spotlight on this beautiful
narration with the hope of extracting some jewels of lessons for our
benefit and the benefit of our fellow believers.
