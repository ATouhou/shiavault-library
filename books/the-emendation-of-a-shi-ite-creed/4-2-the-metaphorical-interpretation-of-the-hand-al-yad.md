2. The Metaphorical Interpretation of "The Hand (Al-Yad)"
=========================================================

Abu Jaâ€˜far, may Allah have mercy upon him, similarly explains "hand" in
the sense of strength, and adduces, to support his view, the verse:

***And remember Our servant David, possessed of strength (ayd)
[38:17].***

And he says: dha'l-ayd, means possessed of strength (quwwah).

ash-Shaykh al-Mufid says: The word yad has another interpretation which
denotes grace. The poet says:

*He has bestowed favours on me which I do not deny;*  
*For indeed denial of favours is but ingratitude.*

So, it is possible that the saying of Allah, the Exalted, Dawuda dha
'l-ayd, means Dawud (David), a bountiful man. Similar, also, is the
saying of Allah:

***Nay, but both His hands are outspread [5:64].***

Here, by "The two hands", are meant the two favours of this life and the
life hereafter.
