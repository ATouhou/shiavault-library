Chapter 18 : the Uprising of the Mahdi- (‘a)
============================================

Ibn Hanbal says:

A. Hajja-j and Abu Na‘i-m have related from Fitr from Qa-sim bin Abi-
Bazzah from Abi- al-Tufayl from (Imam) ‘Ali- [(‘a)], who quoted the
Messenger of Allah (S) as saying:

Law lam yabqa mina al-dunya- illa- yawmun laba‘atha Allahu rajulan
minna- yamla’uha- ‘adlan kama- muli’at jawran (If only a day were to
remain for the end of the world, Allah will raise a man from my progeny
who will fill it [the earth] with justice as it was filled with
oppression)”[^67]

Ibn Hanbal says:

B. Fazl bin Dukayn has related to us from Ya-si-n al-‘Ijli- from
Ibra-hi-m bin Muhammad bin Hanafiyyah from his father (Imam) ‘Ali-
[(‘a)], who quoted the Messenger of Allah (S) as saying:

“al-Mahdi- minna- Ahla al-Bayt yuslihuhu Allahu fi- laylatin (The
Mahdi- is from us the Ahl al-Bayt, Allah will set right his affairs in
[the course of] one night).”[^68]

Ibn Hanbal says:

C. Sufya-n bin ‘Uyaynah has related to us from ‘Asim (bin Abi-
al-Najud) from Zirr (bin Hubaysh) from ‘Abdulla-h (bin Mas‘ud) who
narrates from the Messenger of Allah (S):

“La- taqum al-sa-‘ah hatta- yalia rajulan min Ahli Bayti- yuwa-tiu
ismuhu ismi- (The Day of Resurrection will not come until a man who is
from my Ahl Bayt and whose name is my name, will rise).”[^69]

Ahmad Sha-kir has termed the isna-d of all three hadith as sahi-h, and
has criticised the North African scholar ‘Abd al-Rahma-n bin Muhammad
bin Khaldun (1332-1406) for rejecting the reports concerning the Mahdi-
(‘a). It is worth noting that Ibn Khaldun in his famous Muqaddimah or
Introduction to History has embarked on a lengthy discussion on the
aha-di-th concerning the Mahdi- (‘a), and writes:

It has been well known (and generally accepted) by all Muslims in every
epoch, that at the end of time a man from the Ahl al-Bayt (of the
Prophet) will without fail make his appearance, one who will strengthen
the religion and make justice triumph. The Muslims will follow him, and
he will gain domination over the Muslim realm. He will be called the
Mahdi-...Evidence for this matter has been found in the aha-di-th that
religious leaders have published. They have been discussed by those who
disapprove of (the matter) and have often been refuted by means of
certain (other) akhba-r.[^70]

Ibn Khaldun in his discussion on the aha-di-th concerning the Mahdi-
(‘a) says that those who reject the coming of the Mahdi- have criticised
these reports, which he acknowledges have been narrated on the authority
of some of the prominent companions of the Prophet and have been
recorded in all authoritative Sunni books, whose names he has
mentioned.

He writes:

Hadith scholars acknowledge negative criticism to have precedence over
positive criticism. If we find that some person in the chain of
transmitters is accused of negligence, poor memory, weakness or poor
judgement, it affects and weakens the soundness of the hadith. It should
not be said that the same faults often affect the persons (mentioned as
authorities) in the two Sahi-hs (Bukha-ri- and Muslim). The general
consensus of hadith transmitters confirms the soundness of the contents
(of the two Sahi-hs) as presented by Bukha-ri- and Muslim. The
uninterrupted general consensus in Islam also confirms the acceptibility
of (the two Sahi-hs) and the necessity of acting in accordance with
their contents. General consensus is the best protection and defence.
Works other than the two Sahi-hs are not on the same level with them in
this respect...[^71]

He goes on to quote, one after another, several of the aha-di-th from
the Prophet concerning the Mahdi- (‘a), along with the chain of
transmitters as found in the orginal sources, and tries to find fault
with them in a manner which is clearly artificial. One of the aha-di-th
which he criticises is the narration that Ibn Hanbal has recorded on the
authority of ‘Abdulla-h bin Mas‘ud. Ibn Khaldun then directs his attack
at ‘Asim bin Abi- al-Najud even after acknowledging him to be “one of
the seven authoritative Qur’a-n readers.”[^72] To deflect criticism from
his assumption, he writes:

Were someone to argue that (Bukha-ri- and Muslim) published traditions
of his, (we should reply that) they published them when there were also
other (authorities for the same tradition), and that they did not use
him as their basic authority.[^73]

The annotator of the Musnad, Ahmad Muhammad Sha-kir, finds the
criticism of Ibn Khaldun unconvincing and rejecting it, writes:

Ibn Khaldun attempted something for which he was not qualified and
ventured into an arena which was not his domain. His preoccupation with
state and political affairs and his serving of kings and nobles
dominated his thought and speech, and as a result induced him to imagine
that the report of the uprising and revolution of the Mahdi- [(‘a)], was
a (purely) Shi‘ite belief. However, it is worth noting that first Ibn
Khaldun has not properly understood the statements of hadith compilers
that negative criticism (jarh) takes precedence over positive criticism
(ta‘di-l). If he had properly understood their statements he would not
have commented in this manner. It is also possible that he understood
their purpose but since his thoughts were profoundly influenced by the
political views of his times, he has tried to weaken the aha-di-th
concerning the Mahdi- (‘a).

Second, ‘Asim bin Abi- al-Najud is considered one of the reputed
reciters of the Holy Qur’a-n and is also regarded as a trustworthy
transmitter of hadith. Maybe he has made mistakes in some aha-di-th but
these are not to the extent that his narration should be rejected. The
strongest criticism against him is that he was not of good memory. But
on the basis of such a single criticism, could we ignore him and
consider this as a means of rejecting a report whose authenticity has
been confirmed through various other chains and narrated in the words of
several companions (of the Prophet)? The soundness of this report is to
the extent that no one has any doubts about it, because among the
transmitters could be seen just, truthful and candid persons. Moreover,
since this hadith has been narrated by other transmitters as well, the
likelihood of a slip concerning someone whose memory being sharp is
somewhat under doubt, is completely eliminated.[^74]

These were some of the examples of the large number of hadith
concerning the virtues of the Prophet’s Ahl al-Bayt (‘a) found in the
Musnad of Ahmad bin Hanbal. The writer of the article had to limit his
selection in view of the space. It is hoped that this article would
serve the purpose of bridging the gap between the Muslims and promote
better understanding of each other.
