Disappearance of the Excuse
===========================

If the excuse permitting iftar ceases--such as on recovery of a sick
person, maturing of a child, homecoming of a traveller, or termination
of the menses--it is mustahabb in the view of the Imamis and the
Shafi\`is to refrain*(imsak)* from things that break the
fast*(muftirat)* as a token of respect. The Hanbalis and the Hanafis
consider imsak as wajib, but Malikis consider it neither wajib nor
mustahabb.
