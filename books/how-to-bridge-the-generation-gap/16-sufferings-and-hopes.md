Sufferings and Hopes
====================

The Father
----------

My child! Your father and mother have suffered a lot, gone through many
ups and downs and thicks and thins, joys and sorrows in raising you and
bringing you up to this stage, Look now! If you prove to be a bad
person, you have spoiled all their sufferings and hopes.

The Child
---------

Whenever, in appearance, I disagree with you, in reality internally, I
feel ashamed and sorrowful. The more I disobey you, the sorrier I
become. I pledge that from now on, I would be beneficial to you. If not
that, at least I would not cause you any harm.
