Ali (peace be upon him) in Fatima’s Burial:
===========================================

According to Fatima’s will, Ali (peace be upon him) buried her at night.
While burying her, Ali (peace be upon him) said to the Prophet (peace be
upon him and his descendants), “O, the Messenger of Allah, your daughter
joined you so soon. Now, I have remained lonely with the grief of Fatima
(peace be upon her)’s death; the clouds of grief have fallen their
shadows over my heart, and the nights will pass to me with anxiety and
restlessness. I will company this heart vending grief until Allah
invites me to Himself. O, Messenger of Allah! Ask your daughter how a
group of your Omma allied together to oppress and usurp her right…. Ask
her about her black arm, and broken side,….”
