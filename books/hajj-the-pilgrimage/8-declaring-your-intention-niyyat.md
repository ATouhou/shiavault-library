Declaring your Intention (Niyyat)
=================================

Before entering Miqat, which is the beginning of a great change and
revolution, you must declare your intention. What does this encompass?
It is the intention of a "transferral" from your house to the house of
people, from life to love, from the self to Allah, from slavery to
freedom, from racial discrimination to equality, sincerity and truth,
from being clothed to being naked, from a daily life to an eternal life
and from selfishness and aimlessness to devotion and responsibility. In
summary, it is a transferral into the state of "Ihram" .

Therefore, your intention must be strongly asserted. You will grow out
of your "shell" as do the seeds of dates. Being extremely conscious, you
must have faith in your heart. Enlighten your heart with the flame of
love; "shine" and "shine". Forget all about yourself! In the past, your
life was characterized by "negligence" and "ignorance" You were helpless
in all aspects of existence. Even in the realm of your job, you became a
slave, working either as a habit or by force! Now, shed this pattern of
life! Become genuinely "conscious" of Almighty Allah, the people and
yourself! Choose a new job, a new direction and a new "self"!
