Responsibility 96: Visiting the Righteous Lovers of the Imam
============================================================

Another responsibility is to visit those righteous people who love and
have a strong affinity for Imam al-Mahdi (ajtf) as such a visit will
give a person the same reward as performing the Ziyarat of the Imam
himself!

This responsibility can be fulfilled with those who are alive or those
who have left this world especially the scholars in the religion who are
amongst those with the taqwa of Allah!

Imam Musa b. Ja’far al-Kadhim (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ لَمْ يَقْدِرْ أَنْ يَزُورَنَا فَلْيَزُرْ صَالِحِي مَوَالِينَا
يُكْتَبُ لَهُ ثَوَابُ زِيَارَتِنَا
  </p>
</blockquote>

“A person who is not able to perform our Ziyarat should instead visit
the righteous people from among our followers and the reward of visiting
us will be written for him.”[^1]
