Responsibility 64: Safeguarding One’s Faith Part 1
==================================================

Another responsibility for those living during the period of occultation
of the Imam is to supplicate for the protection of one’s faith and to
show humility while in the presence of Allah.

We must seek assistance in the protection of our religion from the
devils which are from among the Jinn and mankind, the disbelievers and
hypocrites, the enemies of the Ahlul Bayt (as) and from the doubts and
uncertainties which may strike us and affect our faith.

In this regards, reciting the supplication which is mentioned in the
next responsibility is sufficient to protect ourselves.
