Need Of Unity Among Muslims
===========================

It is regretful that within a short time of the passing away of the Holy
Prophet (S) a lot of controversies arose among the Muslims regarding
principles of faith and practical laws. Now the situation is such that
any sort of agreement between the sects is impossible.

Two such powerful sects have come into being that it is impossible for
anyone of them to disappear. Now, if only Allah removes the differences
from the Muslims can there be a fresh unity among them. Presently the
conditions of Muslims require reconciliation, but no one has any idea
how this could be achieved.

Till the time Muslims themselves do not strive to patch up, there is
every possibility that they would never unite. This cannot be achieved
by debates and argumentations. The truth cannot be unraveled without
forgoing bias. However, to get rid of bias, itself requires good sense
given by Allah, which is a great bounty bestowed by Allah on whomsoever
He wishes.
