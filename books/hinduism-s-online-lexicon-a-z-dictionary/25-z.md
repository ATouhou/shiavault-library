**Zoroastrian:** Of or related to Zoroastrianism, a religion founded in
Persia by Spenta Zarathustra (ca 600 bce). It has roughly 150,000
adherents today, mostly near Mumbai, where they are called Parsis. The
faith stresses monotheism while recognizing a universal struggle between
the force of good (led by Ahura Mazda) and evil (led by Ahriman). The
sacred fire, always kept burning in the home, is considered the only
worshipful symbol. Scripture is the Zend Avesta.
