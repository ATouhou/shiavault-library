The Reality of Evil
===================

Before considering the different versions of the problem of evil, it
would be helpful to say something about the Islamic philosophy's view on
the reality of evils. Confronting the apparent evils around us, one may
primarily raise the question whether these evils are real things or they
are mere illusions. Contrary to an uncommon view (sometimes attributed
to certain Hindu schools of thought) which considers evils as mere
dreams and illusions, most people including philosophers and theologians
follow their common sense judgment and endorse the reality of evils. It
is clear that according to the former view, the problem of evil (if it
can be formulated at all) will find a very trite and commonplace
solution: the so-called evils are just in our dreams and not real!

Muslim philosophers, however, do not deny that there are really some
evils. And thus, considering the other facts concerning God and His
attributes, the problem of evil emerges for them as a genuine
philosophical problem.
