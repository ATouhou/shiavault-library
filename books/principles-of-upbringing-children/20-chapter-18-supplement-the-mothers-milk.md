Chapter 18: Supplement the Mothers Milk
=======================================

The principal food of the baby is no doubt the mother’s milk but it is
better to supplement judiciously with a little fish oil and fruit
extracts. This will ensure that the feed is complete and the child grows
in a better way. As the child grows its requirement of food increases.
It reaches a stage when the mother’s milk becomes insufficient for the
child.

At this stage other food materials are included in the child’s diet to
provide optimum level of nutrition. After four months of delivery, or
latest by six months, the child must be trained to eat other foods. It
is important that the baby’s feed is soft and succulent. Juices of
different fruit can be ideal at this stage.

Water strained after boiling vegetables in it can be a good source of
nutrients for the child. Soups are good for the growth of the child.
When the child starts setting teeth the diet can have boiled potatoes,
boiled eggs, biscuits, fresh cheese, bread, butter and fresh fruits.
There should be variety in the diet of a child, but care has to be taken
that it is not over fed.
