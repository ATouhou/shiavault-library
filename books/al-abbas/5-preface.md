Preface
=======

Al-’Abbas has a full-dimensional history of ancestry, honorable lineage,
knowledge, clemency, courage, munificence, adoration, and asceticism as
well as all nobilities and virtues.

Al-’Abbas is the son of the sinless Imam Amir ul-Mu’minin ‘Ali ibn
Abi-Talib.

Al-’Abbas is the brother of the two Imams al-Hasan and al- Husayn the
grandsons of Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w).

Al-’Abbas is the uncle of nine Imams - ‘Ali Zayn ul-Abidin, Muhammad
al-Baqir, Jaffar as-Sadiq, Musa al-Kadhim, ‘Ali ar- Ridha, Muhammad
al-Jawad, ‘Ali al-Hadi, al-Hasan al-Askari, and al-Mahdi.

Al-’Abbas was a good student of the best four immaculate teachers - his
father, his two brothers, and his nephew. How great the teachers were
and how great their student was!

About him, Imam ‘Ali (a) predicted:

*“Choose for me a woman who is the descendant of the Arab heroes so that
I will marry her and she will give birth to a horseman.”*

To him, Imam al-Husayn (a) addressed Al-’Abbas:

*“Ride on, may I be your sacrifice.”*

About him, Imam Zayn ul-Abidin (a) said:

*“Allah may have mercy upon my uncle, al-’Abbas. He preferred his
brother to himself, did well, and sacrificed himself for his brother
until he lost his two hands for sake of such.”*

About him, Imam as-Sadiq (a) said:

*“My uncle al-’Abbas was clear-sighted, steadfastly faithful… etc.”*

About him, Imam al-Mahdi (a) said:

*“Salaam be upon Abul-Fadhl al-’Abbas, son of Amir ul- Muminin. He
preferred his brother to himself, supplied himself with (opportunities
of) today for (rewards of) tomorrow, sacrificed himself for his brother,
protected him, hurried for fetching him water, and his two hands were
cut (for such).”*

Al-’Abbas, after all, was the righteous servant of God and the epitome
of heroism.
