Adverbial Qualification
=======================

92. What is an adverbial qualification?  
 An adverbial qualification is an infinitive which is mentioned after
the verb in order to describe the cause of the verb. For example:
**وَقَفَ الجُندُ إجلالاً للإمیرِ** (The army stopped in order to respect
the commander.)

93. Is an adverbial qualification always in the accusative state?  
 The adverbial qualification can either be:  
 • in the accusative state with the accusative sign, for example:
**هربتُ خوفاً** (I fled out of fear.) This is usually the case when the
infinitive does not have an *alif-lām* and is not prefixed to another
word.

• in the accusative state with the genitive sign, for example: **ضربتُ
وَلدي لتأدیبهِ** (I hit my son to teach him manners.) This is usually
the case when the infinitive does have an *alif-lām* and is prefixed to
another word.
