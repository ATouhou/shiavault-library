Specificative
=============

35. What is a specificative?  
 A specificative is a noun mentioned to explain what is meant by the
noun mentioned before it because of its obscurity. For example:
**اشتَرَیتُ** **رطلاً** **زیتاً** (I bought an amount[^1] of oil.) If
one only said: “I bought an amount,” the listener would not know what
was meant. He could have bought an amount of soap, oil or anything else.
But, when he mentions the word oil, the word amount becomes clear and in
this sentence oil is an specificative.

[^1]: A specified weight, in English around 450 grams.
