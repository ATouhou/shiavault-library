Lesson Twenty Nine: Counsel
===========================

Imam Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إِتَّعِظُوا بِمَنْ كانَ قَبْلَكُمْ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَتَّعِظَ بِكُمْ مِنْ
بَعْدَكُمْ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Take counsel from your predecessors before the posterity takes counsel
from your life and destiny.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

History is full of lessons, full of examples and advice . The
consequences of injustice, oppression, stagnation and neglect of the
needs of changing environment and times are all reflected in the mirror
of history. Imam ‘Ali., with his extensive knowledge of human history,
warns us to take counsel and learn lessons from the actions and mistakes
and fate of our predecessors rather than repeat the same mistakes and
leave a trail of misfortunes for the posterity to learn from.
