Introductory Note
=================

The original work in Persian, recently published under the title
“Arba’in, ya chihil *hadith*” was written by Imam al-Khumayni forty-six
years ago and was completed in the month of Muharram 1358 (April-May,
1939).

The manuscript of this work, together with that of two other unpublished
works of the author, Sharh Du’ae sahar, and Adab al-*salat*, were
recovered from the library of the late Ayatullah Akhund al-Hamadani. All
the three works have now been published.
