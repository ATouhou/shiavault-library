Lesson 35: Wajib (obligatory) Sajdahs of the Qur’an
===================================================

In four Surahs of the Qur'an (*Alif Lam Meem Sajdah*. *Ha Meem*
*Sajdah*, *Najm* and.*’Alaq*) there is one verse which is called verse
of *sajdah*. Anybody who recites that verse or listens to it must do
*sajdah* at the end of that verse. If while listening to it he was
reciting it also, he should do two *sajdah*s.

The place where he does the *sajdah* must be *mubah* (not *ghasbi*) and
the place of forehead should not be more than 3" lower or higher than
the place of knees or toes. The rules about the things upon which
*sajdah* of prayer is allowed must be followed in this *Sajdah* also.

It is not *wajib* to say any *dhikr* in this *sajdah*. Still it is
sunnat to recite the following *dhikr*:

*La ilaha illal-lah haqqan haqqa; la-ilaha-illal-lahu Imaanan wa
Tasdiqa; La ilaha illal-lah ‘ubudiyatan wa riqqa; Sajadtu laka ya Rabbi
ta’abbudan wa riqqan; La mustankifan wa la Mustakbiran; bal ana ‘abdun
dhalilun da’ifun kha’ifun mustajir.*

It is not necessary to do *wudhu* etc., or to face towards qibla in this
*sajdah*.
