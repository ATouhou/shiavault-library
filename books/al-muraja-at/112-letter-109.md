Why do Some Fanatics Question the Derivation of the Shi’a School of Muslim Law from the Imams of Ahl al-Bayt (as)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Rabi’ al-Thani 23, 1330**

We, in our Letter No. 19, had indicated that some fanatics question the
derivation of your school of thought, in its roots and branches of
religion, from the Imams of Ahl al-Bayt, and we wished to ask you about
this matter. Now is the time to ask such a question; so, could you
please answer it in a way that would refute their claim? Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*S*
