How to Distinguish Between the Doctrine and Science
===================================================

In order to avoid misunderstanding this question, we shall elaborately
explain the difference between the economic doctrine and the science of
economics. In fact, the difference between them is significant.

The economic doctrine, as we have come to know, takes upon itself to
discover a method for the regulating of the economic life according to
the principle of equity. As for the science of economics, it does not
provide a method for such regulating; rather, it derives its approach
from the followed paths of societies, studying their outcomes and
consequences, just as the naturalist studies the results and effects of,
say, heat generating.
