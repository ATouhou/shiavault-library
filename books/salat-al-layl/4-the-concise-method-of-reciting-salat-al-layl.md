The Concise Method of Reciting Salat al-Layl
============================================

Salat al-Layl is 11 Rak\`at in which:

1. The first 8 Rak*\`*at are prayed in four Salat of two Rak*\`*at each
with the intention of *Salat al-Layl* (after each two Rak\`at, give the
Salam, finish the Salat and then stand for the next set of Salat.)

2. Following this, two Rak*\`*at would be read with the intention of
Salat ash-Shaf*\`* (this Salat is performed exactly as Salatul Fajr).

3. Once this is recited, one Rak*\`*at with the intention of Salat
al-Witr would be recited. In this Salat, recite Surah Al-Fatiha once,
Surah al-Ikhlas three times followed by Surah al-Falaq and Surah al-Nas
once each.

Once this part of the Salat is finished, we raise our hands in Qunut
such that our palms are facing the sky and our hands are level with our
eyes and perform the following.
