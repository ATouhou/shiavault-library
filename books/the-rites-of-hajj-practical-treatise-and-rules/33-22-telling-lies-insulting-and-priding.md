22. Telling Lies, Insulting and Priding
=======================================

Article 159
-----------

Lying and insulting are Haraam in any condition, but these are inhibited
especially in the state of Ihram, it means these are from the act of
which a Muhrim should renounce in performing them. It is an obligatory
precaution to abstain from expressing the superiority of himself/herself
to others or expressing the weakness of others against himself/herself,
and these three acts have been collected in the term “Fosuq” according
to some Hadees quoted from the infallibles (a.s.) in the holy verse;

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَلا رَفَثَ وَ لا فُسُوقَ وَ لا جِدالَ فى الْحَجّ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Let there be no obscenity, nor wickedness, nor wrangling in the Hajj.
(2:197)***

Thus whenever a Muhrim perform these acts, he/she has done wrong but the
Ihram is not invalidated, and the atonement of that is Istighfar (asking
forgiveness from Allah). It is better than a person abstain from saying
anything bad, evil and incompatible to the soul of Hajj and say nothing
other than good words.
