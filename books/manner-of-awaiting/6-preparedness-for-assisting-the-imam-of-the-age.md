Preparedness for Assisting the Imam of the Age
==============================================

Allah, the Almighty says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اصْبِرُوا وَصَابِرُوا وَرَابِطُوا
وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“O you who believe! Be patient and excel in patience and remain
steadfast, and be careful of*** ***(your duty to) Allah, that you may be
successful.” (Surah Ali- Imran, 3:200)***

Imam Baqir (a.s.) interpreted this verse as follows:

*“Adopt patience while following the religious laws and forbear the
harms inflicted by your enemies and be ready for serving your Imam for
whom you are awaiting.”*

The necessity for preparing oneself for assisting the Imam of the age
(a.t.f.s.) at the time of his advent arises from his armed uprising by
which he shall cleanse the earth of tyranny and oppression. For this
reason, a Shia is supposed to mobilize himself for that day which would
occur all of a sudden. Imam Sadiq (a.s.) says:

*“Every one of you must make ready something for the uprising of the
Qaem even though it may be an arrow.”*[^1]
