Preface
=======

Have you not considered how Allah sets forth a parable of a good word
(being) like a good tree, whose root is firm and whose branches are in
heaven?

We present the dear reader this collection of sayings of the Holy Quran,
the Holy Prophet Muhammad (S) and his Household (a.s.) that, if put into
practice, guarantee the happiness of humans in this world and in the
world to come. These unique pearls have been picked up by an eminent
scholar, Ayatullah al-Allamah al-Shaykh Jawaad al-Tehrani (r.a.).

He was born in 1904 in Tehran and grew up in a noble and pious family.
Having studied Islamic sciences in Qum, he traveled to Najaf (Iraq) and
learnt more from its pious scholars. Afterwards he went to Mashad and
dwelt there to become a great example of spiritual perfection to which
the seekers of truth and reality would come and study.

His personality was a combination of a very gentle nature and ardency
against moves that threatened principles, devoting his valuable life to
jihad and struggle, worshipping Allah the Most High and neglecting the
luxury of this world’s life until he accepted the invitation of his Lord
on October 24, 1989.

Mr. Tehrani wrote several precious books in both Arabic and Persian of
which his ***“Ayin-e-Zendegi”*** (Living the Right Way) on Islamic
Ethics, published by this institute, is quite popular. We are now
presenting this honoured book in English and Arabic.

May Allah the Most High purify our endeavour for His Will. He is a
Powerful Guardian and Worthy of granting our supplication.
