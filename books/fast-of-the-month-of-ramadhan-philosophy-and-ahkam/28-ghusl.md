Ghusl
=====

Lailatul-Qadr is one of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadhan.
Al-Majlisi, on p. 10, Vol. 94, of his *Bihar al-Anwar*, quotes Imam Ali
ibn Abu Talib (as) saying the following about it: "Seek it in the last
ten days, for the *mash’ars* are seven, and so are the heavens, and the
(layers of the) earth, and seven kine, and seven ears of grain."

He (as) is also quot­ed saying that during those days, the Messenger of
Allah (S) used to roll his bed, tie his mantle, and keep his family
awake (especially) during the 23rd night, sprinkling water on the faces
of those who were overcome by sleep. Fatima al-Zahra (as) used not to
permit anyone in her house to sleep, giving them very little to eat
(since over-eating causes drowsiness and heaviness), and she used to get
ready for it even during day­time.

She (as) used to say, "One who is deprived of its goodness truly suffers
the greatest deprivation." It is highly recom­mended, therefore, to
perform *ghusul* particularly during the last ten days of the month of
Ramadhan. According to *Al-Iqbal*, Abu Abdullah, peace be upon him, is
quoted saying that the Messenger of Allah (S) used to have his *ghus­ul*
each night during the last ten nights of the month of Ramadhan.
