Twelve Apostolic Imams
======================

The Apostle of Allah said: After me there will be Twelve Imams or
Caliphs: and The first of us is Muhammad; The last of us is Muhammad; In
between us are Muhammad; And all of us are Muhammad; For all of us are
from One Nur (Light).

The Imams
---------

The Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be on him and his progeny) said: "I
shall be succeeded by twelve religious leaders, all of whom will be of
Qurayshite origin." (al-Bukhari, as-Sahih)

The twelve Imams are these sacred personages and spiritual leaders about
whom the Holy Prophet had prophesied. Pointing them out as the source
and means of guidance for mankind, the Holy Prophet remarked: "So long
as my twelve successors will continue to govern, this religion (Islam)
will exist (in this world)." (Abu Dawud, as-Sunan)

On a request from his well-known companion, Jabir ibn Abdillah
al-Ansari, the Holy Prophet explained the names of his twelve successors
thus: "They are my twelve successors, O Jabir, who will come after me.
First of them will be Ali, who will be followed, one after the other, by
Hasan, Husayn, Ali ibn al-Husayn, Muhammad ibn \`Ali, Ja'far ibn
Muhammad, Musa ibn Ja'far, Ali ibn Musa, Muhammad ibn \`Ali, \`Ali ibn
Muhammad, Hasan ibn Ali and lastly by Muhammad al-Mahdi, al-Qa'im (peace
be on them)."
