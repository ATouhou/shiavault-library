[Introduction]
==============

ONE of the differences which are continually arising between occult
knowledge and the oriental science which has of late years been growing
up in the West, is the question of the age of the great religions. When
we come to Buddhism and to Christianity the difference is limited to the
question of a century or two. But with regard both to Hinduism and
Zoroastrianism, there is an entire conflict between orientalism and
occultism - a clash which does not seem likely to cease: for most
certainly the occultists will not change their position, and the
Orientalists, on the other hand, are likely only to be driven backward
stage by stage with the unveiling of ancient cities, with the discovery
of ancient monuments. And this is a slow process. Hinduism and
Zoroastrianism go back into what history would call "the night of time",
Hinduism being the more ancient, and Zoroastrianism the second religion
in the evolution of the Ãƒryan race.

I propose to look at the changes of opinion through which Orientalists
have passed, in order to show you how they are gradually being forced
backwards, disputing, we may say, every inch of the ground, century
after century, as the growing evidence points to an ever greater
antiquity. Then I will take up the occult testimony and see where that
places the religion of the Iranian Prophet.
