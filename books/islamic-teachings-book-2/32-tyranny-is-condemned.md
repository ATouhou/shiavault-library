Tyranny Is Condemned
====================

***“Whoever harms others, will become a loser”.*** (Surah Taha, 20:111).

In the above verse, the Almighty Allah warns the evil-doers and declares
every evil deed to be unlawful. One who harms another person, makes fun
of him, talks ill of him behind his back or accuses him falsely is an
evil-doer.

Those who infringe upon the rights of others, hurt them or usurp their
belongings, are evil people.

If we do not look after our parents, bother them and disobey their
orders, we are guilty of doing evil to them. We commit evil deeds if we
tease our brothers and sisters or misbehave towards our class-mates.

We should not forget that Almighty Allah does not like the evil-doers.
