40. Doctrine of Non-participation in Oppressive Government
==========================================================

Since our Imams have firmly warned us not to help oppressors, even to
the extent of giving them half a date, and not to hope for their lives,
the situation of one who cooperates with them and joins their government
is indeed a bad one. Similarly, for one who is in their employment, or
is one of the founders of their state, or is devoted to preserving their
government. Because:

being loyal to an oppressive government completely undermines the
truth, and rehabilitates and propagates falsehood, iniquity and
corruption.

This is related from Imam Ja'far Sadiq (A.S.).

However, joining the oppressors or their government is permitted by our
Imams if, by so doing, we can increase justice and perform the commands
of Allah. if it is for the good of the believers, encourages what is
right or forbids what is evil. Imam Musa (A.S.) said:

Verily, there are among the company of the oppressors those through
whom Allah has made bright His path. He gives them the power to protect
His friends and to resolve the difficulties of the Muslims. They are
among those who truly believe. They are the guides of Allah and a light
among His slaves.

Many traditions have been passed down concerning these things, which
have clarified the duties of governors and government employees, who
should act in accordance with them. For example, (the letter which) Imam
Sadiq wrote to 'Abdullah al-Najashi, the governor-general of Ahwaz.


**41. The Imams call People to Islamic Unity
**
It is well known that the Household of the Prophet tried hard to
preserve the rites of Islam, to call Muslims to restore its glory, to
unify their beliefs, and that they also strived to maintain the
brotherhood of Islam and to remove malice and enmity from the hearts of
the Muslims.

We cannot ignore Imam 'Ali's dealings with his predecessors to
thekhilafah. He treated them with consideration although he believed
that they had taken what was his right. He agreed with them and kept his
peace with them. and refrained from expressing his opinion about his own
right to thekhilafah in public until after he had attained to it. Then
he called together the remaining followers of the Prophet (those who
were still alive and who had been present on the day of Ghadir when the
Prophet had appointed 'Ali as hiskhalifah), so that they could bear
witness to his appointment to the khilafah.

He never withheld his opinion about what was helpful or in the
interests of Islam and the Muslims, and he often said:

I was afraid lest I should not help Islam and the Muslims, and that
they would fail.

He said and did nothing against the position, power and authority of
thekhulafa', but kept himself to his house and remained silent, despite
the fact that he saw what they were doing.

He acted thus for the sake of Islamic interests, up to the point where
he was famous for his admirable qualities. The secondkhalifah, 'Umar ibn
Khattab, said many times: "I would never encounter a difficulty without
Abu 'l-Hasan being there to contribute to its solution." And "If it were
not for 'Ali, 'Umar (himself) would have perished."

History cannot forget the way Imam Hasan (A.S.) dealt with Mu'awiyah.
He made peace with him, because he realised that if he continued to
fight, the light of the Qur'an and just government would be
extinguished, and moreover the name of Islam would vanish for all time,
the Divineshari'ah would be lost and the Imams that were to come would
be obliterated. So he chose to protect the edifice of Islam and its
name. For this reason, he made peace with Mu'awivah, who was a resolute
hated Imam Hasan and enemy of the religion and of Muslims, and who his
followers. He knew that Mu'awiyah would deal unjustly with him and his
companions, and. although he could have counted on his family and
followers to fight for their rights and defend themselves, he believed
that the highest interests of Islam were above all these things and more
important then them.

It was for the same reason that the third Imam, Husayn, the Holy
Martyr, rose up against the Banu Ummayah; for he realised that if they
continued in their vicious ways without anyone taking arms against them
and proclaiming their wicked intentions, they would eradicate Islam and
its glory. Thus he wished to point out their oppression and iniquity for
posterity, so as to expose their evil plans against the Prophet's
religion. Naturally, events turned out as had been predicted. If it had
not been for his holy campaign, Islam would have been recorded as a
religion of the past, and it would have been thought a false religion.

In completing his holy campaign, following through and pursuing his
sacred aim against iniquity and oppression, the Shi'a revive and
remember the tragedy at Karbala' every year and in various ways, as the
Imams have commanded.

We should obtain a better and clearer understanding of how the
Descendents of the Prophet tried hard to preserve the glory of Islam if
we study the behaviour of Imam Zayn al-' Abidin towards the Umayyid
kings, despite the fact that his family had been killed and that his
reputation had been destroyed by them. He was continually despondent and
heart-broken over the murder of his father and family by the Umayyids at
Karbala', but, in spite of these things, he always prayed that the
armies of the Muslims would be victorious, and secretly asked Allah to
keep the Muslims in safety and to ensure the increase and glory of
Islam. He propagated knowledge of Islam, and by means of prayer alone he
taught his followers how they should ask Allah for victory for the
Muslims. He said in his famousdu'a', for the guardians of the frontiers
of Islam:

O Allah! Send down peace upon Muhammad and his Family,
increase their numbers, sharpen their swords, protect their homes,
preserve their country, cause friendship to spread among them,
improve their conduct,
provide them with sustenance and the means of livelihood,
help them, bestow on them patience, teach them the ways of cleverness .
. .
(and then after calling for the wrath of Allah on the unbelievers)
O Allah! In this way strengthen the people of Islam, protect their
lands, increase their property,
let the soldiers of Islam be free from fighting that they might worship
Thee privately.
Let nothing be worshipped over the whole of the earth but Thee.
Let no-one prostrate himself before anyone but Thee.

Thus he continued hisdu'a' (it is one of his longest), telling of the
duties of the Muslims armies, how they must behave and be of good
character and have good equipment. It contains teachings on the Holy War
(jihad), showing its purpose and its results, warning Muslims to keep
clear of their enemies, instructing them how to deal with their attacks
and defend themselves. It also contains instructions on their
obligations, such as continual remembrance of Allah, avoidance of
unlawful things and keeping the jihad pure for Allah.

Likewise, other Imams have dealt with the kings of their times,
although they were being tortured and cruelly and severely maltreated by
these kings with many kinds of suffering and pain. When they realised
that an' Islamic government was not going to be re-established, they
tried their best to teach the religion to the people, pointing out to
them the excellence of Islamic knowledge. No insurrection which happened
either through some of their family or through others during these times
was ordered by them; on the contrary, these were in opposition to their
explicit orders, because they made the utmost effort to protect the
government of Islam. No-one, not even the 'Abbasidkhulafa' tried harder
than them to protect it.

It is enough just to look at the advice of Imam Musa ibn Ja'far (A.S.)
to his followers:

I charge you to obey your king and not to lose your strength through
disobedience. If he is just, ask Allah to protect his life; if he is an
oppressor, ask Allah to reform him. For your interests are identical
with his interests. Verily, a just king is really like a father - wish
for him what you wish for yourselves, and do not wish for him what you
do not wish for yourselves.

This is one of the best sayings on the subject of the protection of a
king by his people: "wish for him what you wish for yourselves, and do
not wish for him what you do not wish for yourselves."

Compare with this the great offence some writers who are contemporary
with us have committed. They have spoken of the Shi'a as a hidden
destructive group, as a band of revolutionaries and avengers. Now, it is
correct that every Muslim who obeys the teachings of the Household
should, from the moral point of view, despise oppression and oppressors,
keep clear of them and their evil deeds, feel repugnance and contempt
for them and their fellows and helpers and dislike them all. The Shi'a
have had these feelings engrained in their souls from generation to
generation. However, they are not rebels. Nor do they like to stir up
trouble or foment insurrection against a rebellious government which
says that it is an Islamic government, neither secretly nor openly.

The teachings of the Imams do not allow them suddenly to take the life
of someone who is a Muslim, or to betray him, although his beliefs may
differ from theirs. But, according to their teachings, a Muslim who
professestawhid and thenubawwah of Muhammad (S.A.) is to be respected;
his blood, his property and his family is secure. "It is not right to
take the property of a Muslim except by his leave." All Muslims are
brothers to each other, and to each of them belong the rights of
brotherhood, as we shall now explain.
