***In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate the Merciful***

All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. May the peace and
blessings of Allah be upon our Master, Muhammad, and his pure family,
and may the curse of Allah be upon all of their enemies.

A controversial narration ascribed to the Holy Prophet of Islam is the
Hadith of al- Nujum as per which the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and
his family[^1] has been quoted as having said:

*“My Companions are like the stars; whoever among them you follow, you
will be rightly guided.”*

The present study aims to critically asses the above tradition from
three major angles:

Sunni leaders, scholars and memorizers' sayings and comments on the
above hadith

Veracity of the tradition in the light of Sunni scholars of jarh and
ta'dil (critiques of narrators)

Thoughts within the text, significations, denotations and conclusion of
this hadith.

I pray to Allah, the Exalted, to grant me success in examining and
studying this tradition from these three angles. Indeed, success is
granted by Allah and He is the Guardian.

**Ali Husseini Milani**

[^1]: In spite of the fact that in Sunni sources the ‘greeting’
(salawat) after the Holy Prophet’s name is written incompletely, we, as
the Prophet, peace be upon him and his family, himself recommended, have
written it completely.
