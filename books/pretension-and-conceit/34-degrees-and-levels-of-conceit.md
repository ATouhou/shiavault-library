Degrees and Levels of Conceit
=============================

As we have quoted from the imƒÅm, may his blessings endure, about
pretension, that is, it has three levels, and each level has two degrees
the explanation of which has already been indicated, so is the case with
conceit; it, too, has the same levels and degrees.

The first level is conceit about beliefs. The second is conceit about
the faculties. The third level is conceit about deeds. The first level
has two degrees: the first is conceit about belief and true branches of
knowledge. The second degree, in contrast, is conceit about disbelief,
apostasy and inward beliefs. The second level, too, has two degrees: The
first is conceit about good faculties and commendable merits. The
second, in contrast, is conceit about bad manners and ugly faculties.
The third level, too, has two degrees: conceit about the good deeds.
Contrasting the second degree is conceit about ugly deeds and
wrongdoings.
