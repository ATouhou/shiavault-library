Du’a for Virtuous Children
==========================

No efforts can succeed without the help of the Almighty. Recite the
following du’a seven times after every daily prayer for a virtuous
progeny. The du’a is the prayer of Prophet Zakariyyah (a) and is found
in Surah Ale Imran n.3, verse 37 of the Holy Qur’an.

***In the name of Allah, the Beneficent the Merciful***

***O Allah, bless Muhammad and his family***

***My Lord! Grant me, from Yourself, a good (virtuous) offspring.***

***Surely, You are the Hearer of prayer.***

***O Allah, bless Muhammad and his family.***
