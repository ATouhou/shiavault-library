Syntax
======

5. What does syntax teach us?  
 Syntax teaches us the different cases of words when they are found in
different combinations.

6. Is every word alike in the way it changes due to different
combinations?  
 There are two types of words that are put into combinations:  
 • Indeclinable: the end of the word does not change.

• Declinable: the end of the word changes.

7. What must one do to speak correctly, according to the principles of
syntax?  
 One must know the declinable and indeclinable words in order for his
speech to be correct. He must also know the different cases of
declinable words in order to stay away from mistakes.

8. Is there a rule which teaches us what the last syllable of a
indeclinable word should be?  
 There is no rule which teaches us what the last syllable of a
indeclinable word should be, instead we must refer to dictionaries.

9. Is there a rule which teaches us what the last syllable of a
declinable word should be?  
 There are rules that teach us what the last syllable of a declinable
word should be.

10. What different cases can a declinable word have?  
 The different cases of declinable words are as follows:  
 • For verbs: nominative, subjunctive and jussive

• For nouns: nominative, accusative and genitive

11. How can we understand which case should be used?  
 If we want to correct our mistakes in speech we must know when a verb
is nominative, subjunctive or jussive and we must know when a noun is
nominative, accusative or genitive.
