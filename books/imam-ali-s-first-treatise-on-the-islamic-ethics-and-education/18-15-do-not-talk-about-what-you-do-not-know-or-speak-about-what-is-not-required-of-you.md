15) Do not talk about what you do not know or speak about what is not required of you.

In these sentences, Imam ‘Ali (as) emphasizes two ethical principles:

**1.** Do not talk on anything you lack information about. This is
because your statements might turn out to be false. In such cases you
have both told a lie and misled people into ignorance, both of which are
religiously forbidden. Such a case would lower one’s social position.
The Prophet (S) told Abdallah b. ‘Amr b. al-‘As: "What if you are among
low and mean people who are united in not keeping their promises, what
would you do?"
Abdallah said, "You guide me what to do, O Messenger of Allah".
The Prophet (S) replied:[^1] “Act on what you know, leave what you
don’t know and keep to yourself”.

**2.** Do not interfere in anything not related to you and so do not
speak of anything not concerning you. The Prophet (S) has said: "Among a
Muslim’s good deeds is to leave anything that does not concern him."[^2]
