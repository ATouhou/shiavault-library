Lesson Eighty Six: Sins And Apology
===================================

Imam Husayn (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إيّاكَ وَ ما تَعْتَذِرُ مِنْهُ فَانَّ الْمُؤْمِنَ لا يُسِيىءُ وَ
لايَعْتَذِرُ وَ الْمُنافِقُ كُلَّ يَوْم يُسِيىءُ وَ يَعْتَذِرُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Do not sin so that you do not have to apologize for it. A believer does
not sin and does not apologize, whereas a hypocrite sins everyday and
apologizes everyday.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Everyone is apt to make mistakes, but there is a marked difference in
how the believers and the hypocrites deal with this reality. The
believers try to avoid sins in the first place to pre-empt the need for
having to apologize. They know that insincere and routine apologies do
not acquit anyone. But the hypocrites carry on sinning and apologizing
in a never ending cycle. A sign of hypocrites is that outwardly they
show repentance through the apology while inwardly they are unrepentant
since they are not averse to repeating the sin
