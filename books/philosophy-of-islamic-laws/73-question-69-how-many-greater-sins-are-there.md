Question 69: How Many Greater Sins Are There?
=============================================

**Question:** How many greater sins are there?

**Answer:** There are different methods to recognize the greater sin and
we indicate towards two of these methods.

1. Every action the doers of which have been promised by Allah
punishment and chastisement in the Holy Qur’an. (Whether, it is clearly
stated or indicated or it may be emphatic prohibited again and again).
It is a greater sin.

2. Through the correct and authentic traditions that have reached us
from the great leaders of Islam and in which the greater sins are
clearly enumerated. For example the letter Imam Ali Ibn Musa ar-Rida
(a.s.) had written to Mamoon the Abbaside Caliph. In the letter he has
mentioned the number of greater sins. And in the same way is the
tradition narrated by Amash from Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq (a.s.). There is
mention of many greater sins in this tradition. And the same is the
condition of other traditions.

Now we shall describe a greater part of the greater sins which mentioned
in ayats or traditions and pray to the Almighty Allah that He may give
us the *Tawfiq* to shun all these sins.

1. Murder  
 2. Adultery  
 3. Wine
