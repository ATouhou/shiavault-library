Reprehensible (Makruh) Fasts
============================

It is mentioned in al-Fiqh \`ala al-madhahib al-'arba\`ah that it is
makruh to single out Fridays and Saturdays for fasting. So is fasting on
the day of Now Ruz (21st March) in the opinion of all the schools except
the Shafi\`i, and fasting on the day or the two days just before the
month of Ramadan.

It has been stated in Imami books on fiqh that it is makruh for a guest
to fast without the permission of his host, for a child to fast without
the permission of its father, and when there is doubt regarding the new
moon of Dhu al-Hijjah and the consequent possibility of the day being
that of \`Id.
