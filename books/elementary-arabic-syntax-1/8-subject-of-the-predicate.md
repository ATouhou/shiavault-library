Subject of the Predicate
========================

21. What is a subject of the predicate?  
 A subject of the predicate is a noun that takes the place of the actor
in a sentence after the actor is erased. For example: **سُرِقَت**
**ساعةٌ** (A watch was stolen.)

22. What is the difference between an actor and a subject of the
predicate in terms of meaning?  
 An actor is the one who performs the action where the subject of the
predicate is the one that the verb was performed on. When we say that
Joseph stole a watch, Joseph is the actor because he is the one who
stole. But, if it is unknown who stole the watch or we do not want to
mention his name, we say: A watch was stolen. Here we erased the actor
from the sentence and placed the thing that received the action 'watch'
in its place. We also put the verb into the passive tense.

23. What state is the verb in when there is a subject of the
predicate?  
 The verb should be placed into the feminine state if the subject of the
predicate is feminine. The verb should remain in the singular state if
the subject of the predicate is in the dual or plural form.

24. What is a sentence that has a verb and an actor or a subject of the
predicate called?  
 A sentence consisting of a verb and an actor or subject of the
predicate is called a verbal sentence. For example: **نَزَلَ**
**المَطَر** (The rain fell.)
