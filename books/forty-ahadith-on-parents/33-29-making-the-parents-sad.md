29. Making the Parents Sad  
============================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ أَمِيـرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ (ع): مَنْ أَحْزَنَ وَالِدَيْهِ فَقَدْ
عَقَّهُمَا.
  </p>
</blockquote>

The Commander of the Faithful (peace be upon him) has said: “One who
causes his parents to become sad has indeed been disowned by them.”
