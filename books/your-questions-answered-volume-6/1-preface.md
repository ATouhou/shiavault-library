Preface
=======

With humility I offer my thanks to Allah Subhanahu wa Ta 'ala that He
gave me the chance to compile this sixth volume of the series, Your
Questions Answered. This book contains replies to 118 questions received
between October 1990 and December, 1994, from The Philippines, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand; India, Pakistan, Iran, U.A.E.

and Muscat; Sweden, Norway, Germany and U.K.; U.S.A., Canada, Trinidad
and Tobago and Guyana; Ghana, Nigeria, Botswana, Kenya and Tanzania.

As it happens many of the questions are on burning topics of the
current social environment, and I hope this volume will prove more
popular and useful than the previous ones in this series.
