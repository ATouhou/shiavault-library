Chapter 6: Fatawa On Ashura Ceremonies
======================================

**Introduction**

Every year, the holy month of Muharram acts as a reminder to the
Muslims of the sombre memory of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn
alayhis-salam, the grandson of the final Messenger of Allah, the holy
Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and his progeny. Imam Husayn
alayhis-salam along with his brothers and nephews and some seventy of
his loyal companions, were killed by the army of the brutal tyrant Yazid
on the tenth day of Muharram – Ashura – in the field of the land of
Karbala by the River Euphrates, while overwhelmed by severe thirst.

Imam Husayn alayhis-salam stood up to defend the noble teachings of
Islam, which his grandfather had brought, against the relentless efforts
of the Umayyad dynasty to uproot those teachings and replace them with
every evil and decadence they could master. Imam Husayn alayhis-salam
rose to revive Islam anew, for if it was not for the effort and
monumental sacrifice that he and his followers and family members
offered, there would most probably be no sign of Islam as we know it
today. For such reasons, the holy month of Muharram, and the following
month of Safar – both of which are known as the months of sorrows – are
the time to mourn the tragic loss of such an impeccable personality, as
well as the time to reflect on the teachings and movement of Imam Husayn
alayhis-salam, who became known as Sayyid-ul-Shuhada’ meaning “Master of
the Martyrs”, and Abul-Ahrar meaning “Father of the Free”.

Every year, during the first ten days of the month of Muharram, special
programs are held to commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Husayn
alayhis-salam. These Imam Husayn-special commemoration programs – or
Husayni Sha‘a’er in the Islamic literature – serve as a school of
learning for everyone, and at all levels. The Husayni Sha‘a’er mainly
consist of a series of lectures and speeches exploring the personality
of Imam Husayn alayhis-salam, and those of his devout companions,
covering the bravery, mission, and achievements of Imam Husayn
alayhissalam.

These programs revive the fervour of the battlefield of Karbala and the
sacrifice offered by Imam Husayn – the beloved grandson of Prophet
Muhammad – the final Messenger of the Creator to humanity – and the son
of Imam Ali and Lady Fatima al-Zahra’, daughter of the Prophet Muhammad
peace be upon them.

The lectures also cover the movement of Imam Husayn alayhis-salam, the
values he stood for, and the aim for which he paid everything he had –
his own life as well as those of his sons, brothers, nephews, and
companions.

Various aspects of the teachings of Imam Husayn alayhis-salam are
normally addressed in these public lectures and speeches.

As part of the Husayni Sha‘a’er, there are also programs of public show
of grief, known as Ma’tam or Ta‘ziah in Arabic, Azadari in Farsi. The
programs of Ta‘ziah take various forms such as: reciting lamentation
poetry and chest beating. However, on the tenth day of Muharram, Ashura
– the day of the killing of Imam Husayn, in their grief and sorrow, and
in their wish to have been able to join Imam Husayn in his battle with
falsehood, devotees of Imam Husayn take part in public processions of
self-flagellation (Zanjir) and/or hitting themselves on the top of their
head with a sword or any other sharp blade to allow blood to flow –
known as Tatbir in Arabic or Qama-Zani in Farsi, - in sympathy with Imam
Husayn,, and his companions. To create the atmosphere of the battlefield
of Karbala, drums, horns, and cymbals are also used during the ceremony
of Tatbir program. Needless to say that the ceremonies of Tatbir have
been conducted for many generations, stretching over many centuries, and
starting with the era of the Ahl-ul-Bayt alayhum-as-salam. Over the many
centuries the Tatbir program has proven to be very safe and is performed
by experienced individuals.

Tatbir is performed by the devotees throughout the world; from India,
Pakistan, and the Middle East, to Europe, America and Australia. This is
perhaps one of the manifestations of the famous saying; “Every day is
Ashura, and every land is Karbala.”

There are also programs of enactments – known as Shabeeh – depicting
the scenes of the battlefield of Karbala and its aftermath, showing the
severed heads, and the decapitated bodies, the marching of troops of
Yazid taking the women and children captive, etc. After the killing of
the Imam and his companions, the victorious army of Yazid torched their
tents, and the fearful women and children, being chased from one place
to another, ran over the ashes of the blazing tents that had been set
alight by the triumphant troops.

Today, the torching of the tents are also enacted on the day of Ashura,
by setting alight many tents that had been set up for this purpose. In
sympathy with the sufferings of the women and children, many Muslims on
the day of Ashura, also walk barefoot on red-hot charcoal.

Although practices of Tatbir and fire walking on the day of Ashura are
common amongst the Muslims, however, they are not the only people who
engage in such practices. Tatbir for example is not limited to Muslims
alone, but also followers of other religions such as Christianity
perform such acts in certain parts of the world, as a sign of their
devotion to Jesus Christ peace be upon him. Every year on the occasion
of Easter, Christians in the Far East for example perform public acts of
flagellation out of devotion to the prophet Jesus son of Mary peace be
upon them. This issue is one of the topics of an interview conducted
with a Christian scholar that appears at the end of this book.

Furthermore, the practice of walking on fire that devotees of Imam
Husayn do in remembrance and sympathy with the women and children that
were taken prisoners after the killing of Imam Husayn and his
companions, is not limited to Muslims only. Even secular and
non-religious people practice and promote fire walking as part of their
endeavour to enhance their physical, mental and spiritual stamina.

However, due to the widespread Islamophobia, and despite the
nonuniqueness of these programs as referred to above, some Muslims go as
far as calling for such programs to be stopped as, in their opinions,
these programs “give bad image of Islam and Muslims”. However, just as
for any other aspect of life – private or public – that the Muslims seek
clarification on the legality of a particular act from the Islamic
legalistic viewpoint, the Muslim people at various stages and at various
times have sought the opinion of the Maraje‘ of time – the Authorities
on Islamic law – for such programs as the Tatbir and fire walking. In
the following pages the Fatawa (decrees) of the Muslim world’s leading
and most eminent Maraje‘ of recent time are presented, along with
questions and answers on the issues concerned from the legalistic and
historic point of view.

Decrees of 22 of the most Eminent Maraje’ of the Shi'a world regarding
Ta‘ziah or ‘Azadari for Imam Husayn alayhis-salam [The list below is not
exhaustive, but it only enlists some of the eminent Maraje‘.]

**Fatwa of al-Imam al-Sheikh Abdul- Kareem al-Ha’ery Founder of the
current Hawzah50 in the holy city of Qum**

“The hitting of swords on the heads (causing bleeding) is alright
(allowed) provided there is no harm to the person doing this.
Furthermore no one has the right to prohibit this (hitting the head with
sword). In fact all kinds of TA’ZIAH – mourning – for SAYYID AL-SHUHADA’
– Imam Husayn – may our souls be sacrificed for him, are MUSTAHAB –
desirable deeds.”

The above Fatwa by Sheikh Abdul Kareem al-Ha’ery was endorsed and
signed by the following eminent Maraje’:

**Husayn al-Naa’ini**

{’Ustadhul-‘Ulema} or {Teacher of the Maraje’} of the holy city of
Najaf.

“There is no doubt as to the permissibility of the beating of the chest
and the face with the hands to the point of redness or blackness (of the
chest or the face). This is also extended to the lashing of the
shoulders and the back with chains to the extent mentioned (above), and
even if this led to bleeding. As for causing the bleeding of the head by
sword beating, this is also allowed provided it does not lead to
endangering harm, such as unstoppable bleeding or harm to the scull,
etc. as it is known amongst the experts in doing this (hitting on the
head).”

**Fatwa of Ayatollah al-Udhma al-Sayyid al- Kho’i The former leader of
the Hawzah of the holy city of Najaf**

**Question:**

Is there any problem with causing the bleeding of the head – TATBIR –
as it is practiced, to express one’s grief about the martyrdom of our
Imam Husayn peace be upon him, assuming there is going to be no
permanent harm?

**Answer:**

There is no problem with that, given the assumption made in the
question, and Allah knows best.

**Question:**

You stated that there is no problem in causing the bleeding of the head
– known as Tatbir – if it does not lead to harm. It is said that it is
not more than a permissible act, then can Tatbir be Mustahab – desirable
– if the intention was the upholding and honouring the Sha’a’er – signs
of Allah – and sympathy with the Ahl-ul-Bayt, alayhum-as-salam?

**Answer:**

Most probably Allah Almighty would give thawab – reward (the
individual) – for sympathising with the Ahl-ul-Bayt alayhum-as-salam if
the intention is sincere.

**Fatwa of Ayatollah al-Udhma al-Sayyid al-Seestani Current leader of
the Hawzah of the holy city of Najaf**

**Question:**

What is the ruling regarding the lashing with chains, chest beating,
and walking on fire on the occasion of mourning the martyrdom of Imam
Husayn peace be upon him?

**Answer:**

If (these are) not associated with extreme harm or loss of limb, there
is no objection.

**Question:**

What is the ruling regarding wearing black, and chest beating when
commemorating the martyrdom of Imam Husayn peace be upon him, as well as
other infallible Imams peace be upon them?

**Answer:**

This is permissible, and in fact this is regarded as one of the best
means of seeking nearness to Allah, since it is upholding and honouring
the Sha’a’er of Allah Almighty51.

51 This is a reference to the Qur’anic verse 22:32. – translator.

**Fatwa of Ayatollah al-Udhma al-Imam al-Sayyid Muhammad al-Shirazi**

“It is desirable to observe and establish all kinds of mourning
programs for Imam Husayn alayhis-salam, such as weeping, chest beating,
Tatbir or Qama-Zani, Husayni Majlis, etc. There is no objection to
organise such programs in public and to march through the streets in
full view of men and women. Also there is no objection to carry flags,
standards, banners, and such like in front of the mourning processions,
however, instruments of music may not be used.”

**Question:**

What is your opinion regarding hitting the head with sword – Tatbir –
on the day of Ashura whether or not it harms the individual?

**Answer:**

The most common and widely known opinion of the Fuqaha52 is that the
desirability (of Tatbir) is (recognised) if it is not (considered)
extremely harmful.

**Question:**

If one engages in the Ta’ziah (mourning) program of for Imam Husayn
alayhis-salam, and goes on to serve the program, but does not do Tatbir,
is he regarded as a sinner, who deserves to be humiliated?

**Answer:**

Tatbir is a desirable act, and a mukallaf – i.e. one who has reached
the adolescence age and is duty bound – may forsake a desirable act.

However, it is not allowed to humiliate a Mu’min53, and also one who
does not do Tatbir may not humiliate or insult others, or accuse them
(of false things).

**Husayni Ceremonies**

**Question:**

If religious Sha‘a’er (ceremonies) in general, and the Husayni ones in
particular were to be ridiculed by others, should one stop practicing
those Sha‘a’er?

**Answer:**

The Holy Qur’an states, {alas for the servants! there comes not a
messenger to them but they mock him!}54 It is imperative to educate
those who are ignorant of the reason and background of these ceremonies
and remind those who are familiar (with them of the significance of
these Sha‘a’er).

**Question:**

If failure and neglecting to attend in the Husayni Majalis (programs)
would lead to weakening the Islamic spirit for the individual, and his
family, would this be considered as a sin?

**Answer:**

Yes.

**Question:**

Is it obligatory to ensure that Ashura is commemorated?

**Answer:**

Yes, and it (Ashura) is one of the most important of religious
Sha‘a’er.

**Question:**

They say we are the nation of weeping . . . the nation of political
weeping .

. . we are a nation that with its tears floods and destroys the
obstacles that confront Islam. What is your opinion?

**Answer:**

Weeping is a powerful weapon for expressing oppression, and this weapon
has been used by many of the prophets and saints, and there is no doubt
that the case of Imam Husayn alayhis-salam has attracted many to
Islam.

**Imam Husayn and Events of Ashura**

**Question:**

I have heard a hadith that Imam Baqir alayhis-salam has said, “All
Imams are ships of salvation, but Imam Husayn alayhis-salam is the
largest (Ship). Is this hadith true, and where can I find it?

**Answer:**

It is reported that the Imams (of Ahl-ul-Bayt) alayhum-as-salam are the
ships of salvation, and the ship of Imam Husayn alayhis-salam is
bigger,and in the deep seas (it is) faster . . . . You may refer to
“Ikmaal al-Deen wa Itmaam al-Ni‘mah” by sheikh al-Sadouq, “Ma‘ali
al-Sebtayn” by sheikh Muhammad Mahdi al-Mazandarani.

**Question:**

When Imam Husayn alayhis-salam headed for Iraq, did he know that he
would be killed and his family taken prisoners? And if yes, does this
not constitute exposing oneself to a certain death?

**Answer:**

He knew of his fate, and his action is the manifestation of:

if the religion of Muhammad is not to survive except with my death,then
O Swords! Take me.

Question:

On his way to Iraq, was Imam Husayn alayhis-salam seeking martyrdom, or
was he seeking power, and why?

Answer:

He was seeking martyrdom, for Islam depended on that course of
action.

Question:

Is there no contradiction between the peace pact Imam Hasan
alayhissalam made with Mo’awiyah, and the uprising of Imam Husayn
alayhissalam against Yazid?

Answer:

There is no contradiction between the two stances, since each has his
own duties and responsibilities according to the circumstances of the
day. The circumstances of uprising that Imam Husayn alayhis-salam faced
did not arise at the time of Imam Hasan alayhis-salam, nor did they
arise during the first ten years of his (Imam Husayn’s) imamah
(leadership). More details about the lives and the circumstances are
given in details in reference books, which address the lives of the two
Imams alayhum-as-salam. For us it is sufficient the saying of the
Prophet Muhammad sallallahu-alayhi-wa-aalih when he said, “Al-Hasan and
al-Husayn are two Imams whether they rise up or not”.

Question:

What would you put Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah55 not joining Imam Husayn
alayhis-salam down to?

Answer:

He was sick and unable to go.

Chest beating

Question:

What is your opinion with regards to chest beating ceremonies for Imam
Husayn alayhis-salam, and was it practiced at the time of the Ma‘soom
Imams alayhum-as-salam?

Answer:

(Performing) chest beating ceremonies for the Ma’soomeen
alayhum-assalam is permissible, and in fact Mustahab (desirable), and
the ladies descendent from Fatima al-Zahra’ established chest beating in
the presence of Imam Zayn al-‘Abidin alayhis-salam.

Tatbir

Question:

Some individuals say that I do not see shedding my tears as enough to
express my grief for Imam Husayn alayhis-salam, his household and his
companions on the day of Ashura. So is hitting myself with sword and
injuring myself is allowed?

Answer:

The Husayni Sha’a’er, including Tatbir, are some of the raajih56
issues.

Tatbir is a Mustahab or desirable deed, unless it leads to death, loss
of limb, or loss of faculties.

55 Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah is Imam Husayn’s half brother, whose
mother was called al- Hanafiyyah.

56 raajih means acts that are permissible, but could be classified as
desirable, or even obligatory depending on the circumstances of the
time. The determination of those circumstances that render this are made
by the Marje‘. – translator

Question:

Imam Mahdi, alayhis-salam and may Allah hasten his reappearance,
addresses his great grandfather, Imam Husayn alayhis-salam (in
Zeyarahal- Nahiyah): “. . . I shall mourn you every morning and every
evening, and I shall weep blood for you instead of tears . . .” Can we
deduce from this statement that Tatbir (hitting the head with swords to
make blood flow) is an emphatically desirable act?

Answer:

Yes.

Question:

Did the Ahl-ul-Bayt alayhum-as-salam used to hurt themselves for Imam
Husayn alayhis-salam, in commemorating and glorifying the Husayni
Sha‘a’er, such that we should follow suite?

Answer:

Yes, as can be found in various reports and narrations. Some of these
would be discussed in more detail later on in this book.

Question:

What is your opinion regarding the reports that Lady Zaynab
alayhassalam, when she saw the head of her brother Imam Husayn
alayhis-salam, being paraded in public, hit her forehead on the bar of
the carriage she was travelling in, causing bleeding to flow from
beneath her veil, which was visible to those onlookers who witnessed the
event?

Answer:

Yes that is proven.57

Question:

Some would raise questions that, “why do we not give blood on the day
of Ashura instead of performing Tatbir, since that would be more
civilized than Tatbir, which may pollute the environment, and other
sects may ridicule us.” What is your opinion in this respect?

Answer:

57 {Some of the famous references, which confirm the above report, are
as follows:

Bihaar al-Anwaar; v. 45, p. 114, Jalaa’ al-‘Oyun; v. 2, p. 238, Zaynab
al-Kubra; p. 112, Asraar al-Shahadah; p. 474, Al-Muntakhab; v. 2, p.
478, Nusrat-ul-Madhlum; p. 18.

Needless to say that ‘Allamah Majlisi – compiler of Bihaar al-Anwaar –
and Sheikh al- Shari’ah al-Isfahani have confirmed the authenticity of
the report.}

Giving blood in its own right is good, but this does not conflict with
performing the Husayni Sha‘a’er. Furthermore, drawing blood from the
head accompanies many health benefits, and it is a Sunnah of Rasulollah
salla-llahu-alayhi-wa-aalih, and Rasulollah used to call it al-Mughithah
and al-Munqithah (literally meaning “the saviour”) and both the Shi’a
and the non-Shi’a agree on its authenticity, and Bukhari and many others
have reported many narrations in this respect. It is reported from Imam
Sadiq alayhis-salam that, “It is cure from insanity, leprosy and other
skin diseases, diseases that lead to blindness, and toothache”. The
Mu’minin may give blood on another day, such as 3rd of Sha‘baan, which
is the birthday of Imam Husayn alayhis-salam.

Question:

If something such as Tatbir would result in distorting the image of the
true religion, which in turn would weaken other Husayni Sha‘a’er in the
heart of the Mu’minin58, what is the ruling then?

Answer:

Tatbir is generally a desirable act, and it is actually not proven that
it causes distortion and the like. In fact many media experts would
consider it as one of the most important means of education, giving
vitality to the (Shi’a) school of thought59. Furthermore, merely on
grounds that an act would bring about distortion or ridicule, does not
mean that one may abandon a ruling or a practice, otherwise we would
have to abandon many of rulings of Allah Almighty, such as hijab, hajj,
the daily prayers, fasting, etc. Allah Almighty says in the Qur’an:
{alas for the servants! there comes not a messenger to them but they
mock him!}60. Does the mock and ridicule of the prophets means that they
should withdraw from their mission?

Question:

Is the harm attained as a result of Tatbir regarded as permissible or
desirable, for which one would be rewarded? Did the Ahl-ul-Bayt
alayhum-as-salam encourage this?

Answer:

Tatbir is permissible if it does not result in death, loss of a limb,
or loss of use of a limb – such as blindness of an eye. If Tatbir was
performed with 58 The faithful 59 See for example the interview with a
Christian scholar towards the end of this book. 60 The Holy Qur’an, [36:
30]

intention of sympathy with Sayyid-al-Shuhada61 alayhis-salam, and to
express one’s devotion to him and to defend the Truth, to train for and
attain faithful spirituality, sacrifice, and steadfastness, then it
would be amongst the definite desirable acts, and in this respect
scholars in the old and modern times have issued endorsing Fatawa
(rulings). Many reports have been narrated about the biographies of the
Ma’soomeen alayhum-assalam that indicate that the bearing of hardship
and losses in the way of Allah, and training and disciplining the self
on Taqwa (piety) are considered desirable. For example our lady Fatima
al-Zahra alayhassalam used to stand up in worship for prolonged periods
such that her feet would swell. Another example is that Imams Hasan and
Husayn alayhumas- salam used to go to the Hajj pilgrimage in Makkah on
foot while their camels walked behind them.

**Play Acting**

Question:

Every year we organise enactment of the scenes of Karbala, focusing on
the important personalities such that of the Ma’soom, or al-Abbas, and
other members of Ahl-ul-Bayt alayhum-as-salam. The actors concerned may
not fit the reported physical characteristics of the individuals
concerned. Is this permissible.

Answer:

It is of the best means to seek closeness to the Almighty to use
various permissible means to disseminate the teaching and heritage of
the Ahl-ul- Bayt alayhum-as-salam, and those of Imam Husayn
alayhis-salam. This must be done with utmost care, paying meticulous
attention to details and accuracy, so that the presentation is fitting
to the occasion and commendable from every aspect.
