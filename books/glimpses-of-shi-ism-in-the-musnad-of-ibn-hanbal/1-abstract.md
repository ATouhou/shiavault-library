Abstract
========

Abu ‘Abdilla-h Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal Shayba-ni- (166-241
AH/780-855 CE) [^1] is the founder of one of the four schools of Sunni
jurisprudence and his book al-Musnad [^2] is considered among the most
comprehensive and early collections of hadi-th. It contains some 30,000
sayings attributed to the Prophet and the period of its writing makes it
among the foremost of the siha-h al-sittah (six authentic books) of the
Sunni sect. One of the characteristics of this work is the wide space
given to hadi-th concerning the merits of the Prophet’s Ahl al-Bayt,
most of which are confirmed from the viewpoint of Shi‘ite Muslims as
well. Compared to the other hadi-th compendiums of the Sunnis, the
Musnad’s emphasis on this subject is so pronounced that it has attracted
the attention of orientalists and other researchers. The writer of this
article has attempted to focus on this particular point of the Musnad
and its author by selecting some of the hadi-th mentioned in this bulky
compendium with a short explanation wherever necessary.
