Features of the Islamic System
==============================

The Islamic System differs from the man-made system in the following
ways:

1. The Islamic System is promulgated by Allah, the All Wise, Who knows
best what is useful for man and nothing is hidden from Him. Therefore,
it is an efficient and perfect system which suits every time and place.

2. The Islamic System achieves the interests of the people and their
welfare at once. Other systems, i.e., man-made systems, strive only to
achieve the interests of a small group or class. As a result, they cause
the spread of injustice and corruption.

3. The man who believes that the Islamic Systems is proclaimed by Allah,
the Greatest, and that he will be held accountable and punished for
disobeying it or rewarded for following it respects this system and
preserves it.

Thus, we find the truthful believer never steals, nor cheats others, nor
drinks alcohol or wrongs others due to his strong belief in Divine
punishment or reward. Indeed, the welfare of humanity and its happiness
is found in following the Divine System taught by the Prophet of
humanity, Muhammad bin Abdullah (s).
