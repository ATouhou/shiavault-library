Social Justice
==============

There are two means for achieving social justice in Islam:

(a) Islamic Social Insurance
----------------------------

This is partly the duty of all Muslims in the Islamic State. For they
are responsible for their brothers and sisters in Islam. The Prophet
(p.b.u. h.a.h.f.) said: "He who sleeps the night not caring about
Muslims welfare is not one of us". He also said: "He is not one of us,
who sleeps the night while his neighbour is hungry." It is clear then
that if the State's possession is not enough to satisfy the necessary
needs of the poor people, it has the right to pass laws on rich people
in order to help the poor.

The State's duty is not providing the essential requirements of her
citizens only. This is the minimum which should be given, but the State
ought to endeavour for higher standard of living, whose degree is
decided by the economic progress of the Muslim community.

Imam Musa ibn Ja'far (al-Kazim) said: "The Muslim governor should
distribute the national wealth according to the directions made by God.
It should be divided into eight shares, for the poor and the needy. He
should distribute it among them so that they will be satisfied during
the year without hardship or concealing their need.

If something is left it should be returned to the governor, but if it
was not enough so that they are not yet content, the Governor ought to
supply them from the reserves according to their need till they become
satisfied."

(b) Islamic Social Balance
--------------------------

The Islamic State strives to limit and lessen material differences among
Muslims. Although it recognises natural differences among people due to
environment, education, and personal gifts, etc. On the other hand,
Capitalism approves and contributes to widen the gap between two extreme
classes in the society. One class have all the wealth, while the other
is empty handed.

Socialism denies any natural difference among people and forces its
"concept of equality" on the society.

وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَكُمْ خَلَائِفَ الْأَرْضِ وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَكُمْ
فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَاتٍ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ فِي مَا آتَاكُمْ ۗ إِنَّ
رَبَّكَ سَرِيعُ الْعِقَابِ وَإِنَّهُ لَغَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And it is He who made you (His) vicegerent in the earth and raised
some of you above others in grades, that He may try you in what He gave
you; Verily your Lord is quick in the requital (of evil) and He is most
surely the Forgiving, the Merciful". ( Qur'an, 6:165)***

The ways of conceiving social balance are two:

(1) The Islamic State provides equal opportunities for all members of
the society to work, develop and utilise their powers.

(2) The Islamic State endeavours to lift up the standard of the poor, on
one hand, while it closes the revenues and causes of capital inflation,
on the other. This action would limit and gradually converge the gap
between the poor and rich people, which prevent any class-consciousness.
There are many examples by which the Islamic State secures social
balance in the society. It has been already mentioned that a large sum
of the national economy is taken under collective and State ownership.
