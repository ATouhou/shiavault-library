The Prisoner of War
===================

A young man came to Imam Husayn's camp. He was looking for his father
Muhammad bin Basheer al-Hadramy.

The young man said to his father:

*My brother is a prisoner of war at Ray (a town near Teheran).*

His father said:

*I'll support Imam Husayn at any rate!*

Imam Husayn said:

*You're free. Go and release your son.*

Muhammad bin Basheer refused that and said:

*By Allah, I won't leave you!*

Imam Husayn [a] gave him five garments. Each cost one thousand dinars.
Then he said to him:

*Give your son these garments to release his brother.*

Thus Imam Husayn's companions preferred death with him to life with the
unjust.
