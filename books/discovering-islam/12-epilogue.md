Epilogue
========

There are other issues related to Islamic beliefs and rituals that I
intentionally refrained from mentioning throughout this book. The reason
being is that my primary focus was to be brief and comprehensible.
However, the core of Islam, as the reader may have noticed, is
four-dimensional. It includes the attitude and behavior of a Muslim
toward him or herself, God the Almighty, the family and community, and
the environment.

Prophet Muhammad summarized the meaning of religion in a single
wordâ€”*comportment*. Behavior and belief during one's lifetime will
determine his or her fate on the Day of Judgment. With these words of
conclusion, I hope and pray that God the Almighty may guide us all along
the right path. It is only through His path that one is insured success,
prosperity, and peace in this life and in the Hereafter, *insha'Allah*.
