Hygiene in Islam
================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "There are three traits which Allah loves (in
people): briefness in speech, short (length) of sleep, and small
(portion) of food; while there are three traits which He dislikes (in
them): loquaciousness, oversleeping, and overeating."

Al Ithna'Ashariyyah, p. 92

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Try to be clean as much as you are able to.
Verily, Allah has based the foundation of Islam on cleanliness; hence,
never can a person enter Paradise but the clean ones."

Kanz-ul-'Ummal, Tradition 26002

Imam Amir ul Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) said: "Overindulgence of food causes
various kinds of diseases."

Ghurar-ul-Hikam, p. 359

Imam Musa ibn Ja'far, the seventh Imam, (‘a) said:

"There are five sunnah about the head and five others related to the
body. The first five concerning the head, are: washing the mouth,
trimming the moustache, combing the hair, and drawing up water through
the mouth and nostrils.

The second five, concerning the body, are: circumcision, shaving the
pubic hair, depilating the armpits, clipping the nails, and cleansing
the privy parts (with water, tissue, cloth, etc., while water is
preferable)."

Khisal by Saduq, p. 125

Imam Amir ul Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) told Imam Hasan (‘a): "Shall I teach
you four traits by which you will be in no need of any medical
treatment?"

"Yes," Imam Hasan answered. Then, ‘Ali (‘a) said:

Do not sit for food (in order to eat) unless you are hungry;  
 And, do not leave the (table of) food but you still have an appetite
for it;  
 Chew (your food in your mouth) well;  
 And, when you want to go to bed, (primarily) go to the water-closet to
ease nature.  
 If you take these in action, you will be in no need of any medical
treatment."
