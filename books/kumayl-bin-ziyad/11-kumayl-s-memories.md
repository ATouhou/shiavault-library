Kumayl's Memories
=================

Kumayl bravely walked with the police. In the meantime, he recalled the
beautiful days with his teacher and leader, Imam Ali [a].

Kumayl remembered the days when he was a soldier in the Imam's army. He
remembered his fights against the disloyal, the unjust and the
apostates.

Kumayl remembered the day when he led an army of four hundred fighters
to face a raid by Mu'awiyah's army.

Kumayl remembered the day when he chased the invaders of Kirkeesya. He
remembered the Imam's scolding letter because he left the borders of his
country without soldiers.

The Imam's letter read as follows:

*Certainly, you have deeply gone into Kirkeesya. And you have left the
positions without protection. The idea is incorrect. You have become a
bridge for your enemies to protect your friends.*
