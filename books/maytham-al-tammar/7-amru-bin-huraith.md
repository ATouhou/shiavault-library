Amru bin Huraith
================

Amru bin Huraith was a leader from Kufa. Maytham said to him:

*I'll be your neighbour. Treat me kindly.*

Amru said:

*Do you want to buy bin Masoud's house or bin al-Hakim's?*

Maytham kept silent. Amru bin Harith was puzzled. He wondered:

*What does Maytham mean?*

Days and years passed. Unjust rulers succeeded each other over Kufa.
They treated its people rudely.
