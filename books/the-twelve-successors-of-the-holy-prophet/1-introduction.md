***In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful.***

Praise be to Allah the Lord of the worlds. Benedictions be upon Muhammad
(S) and his Purified Progeny.

Peace be upon the righteous Companions.

Some of the controversial issues have divided the Muslims. These issues
have been misused by the enemies of Islam to divide the Muslims and to
weaken them. Therefore, in order to unite the Muslims and to defend the
boundaries of Islam it is necessary to clear the misunderstandings
regarding these differences. In sorting out these issues we have been
ordered to confine ourselves within some limits. As the Almighty Allah
says:

***"And obey Allah and His Apostle and so not quarrel for then you will
be weak in hearts and your power will depart..."*** ***(Sura al-Anfal,
8:46)***

It is a must for us today, and for all times to refer to Qur'an and
Hadith in case of any difference of opinion. As the Almighty Allah says:

***"...then if you quarrel about anything, refer it to Allah and the
Apostle..." (Sura an-Nisaâ€™, 4:59)***

In this series we shall refer to the Qur'an and Hadith to guide us on
the correct path in various controversial topics. We seek the help of
the Almighty in this.
