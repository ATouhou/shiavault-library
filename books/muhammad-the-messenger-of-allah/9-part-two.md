In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful.

"Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those who are with him are
firm of heart against the unbelievers, (but) compassionate among
themselves; you will see them bowing down and prostrating themselves (in
prayer), seeking Grace from Allah and pleasure..."

Holy Qur'an (48:29)

**IN THE STATE OF MADINAH**

The Islamic Message entered a new phase in its blessed movement after
the migration to Madinah. It was a phase of implementing Islamic
principles and reshaping the community in its entirety, including its
prerequisites and institutions. Erecting the holy mosque of the Prophet
was the first step taken towards the achievement of these aims. The Holy
Prophet bought land for its construction from the owners, Sahl and
Suhail the sons of Amru. Around the mosque, rows of houses were later
built in all directions.(55)

The building of the mosque and the surrounding houses were very simple
and cost little money and effort. The mosque had a spacious Yard. Its
walls were made of bricks and clay. Half the roof was covered with
palm-fronds while the other half was left open. Part of the building
became a refuge for the faithful who had no homes.

Except for evening prayer, the mosque was never lit. Hay would be set a
flame to provide necessary lighting.

In no way were the rooms of the Prophet (s.a.w.) distinguished from
other houses with regard to the style of building and the source of
lighting. He lived temporarily, as we have referred before, at the house
of Abu-Ayyub Ansari and it was until after the mosque and the
surrounding houses were built did he move to the quarters specified for
him.(56)

The lesson drawn from the fact that the first achievement of the
Prophet (s.a.w.) at Madinah was the setting up of the mosque is
fundamental to basic Islamic life, in that the first practical step is
to establish a relationship with Allah, the Most High and Exalted. Any
other kind of structure can then be set on this firm foundation and is
derived from it.

In addition to the mosque, the Prophet (s.a.w.) did not need to build
an administration center. The mosque was to serve that purpose. As well
as a place of worship it was furthermore a meeting-place where Muslims
consulted among themselves, the place where differences were resolved,
where military plans were laid, military commanders appointed, where
Muslims learnt reading and writing...and any other activity related to
the state and the community.

The fact that the Prophet (s.a.w.) made the mosque the place from which
he presided, settled people's problems and managed the Islamic state's
affairs, is regarded the most convincing and practical proof that
rulership and the management of social, economic, political...affairs of
the Muslim nation is intricate with the submissiveness to Allah, the
Exalted.

In Islam, state affairs are managed by adhering to divine orders and
instructions which were revealed to the Messenger of Allah. That is why
the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) was himself a ruler, judge, guide and a
military commander.

Accordingly then Islamic society is composed of factors derived from
the basis of obedience and total submission to Allah, the Blessed, the
Mast High.

In view of this, the different facets of life are never disconnected
the Islamic life. For life, in all its dimensions and aspects, emerges
from the same source, moves along the same path and ends at the same
point.
