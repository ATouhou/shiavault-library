Lesson 16: The Branches of Religion (III)
=========================================

VI. Jihad (The Holy War)
------------------------

Defense is unquestionably the most important phase of a community’s
life. Islam provides for the defense of the Muslim community by
imposition of what is called Jihad. It means fighting in the path of
Allah in response to the call from the Prophet or the Imam of the age.

***“And fight in the cause of Allah against those who fight against you:
but do not transgress because Allah does not love transgressors”.
(2:190)***

VII. Amr bi’l Ma’ruf
--------------------

It means enjoining the good. If a person does not fulfill the
obligations laid down by Allah, it is obligatory on us to guide him to
the right path provided we have a hope that he will follow our guidance.

VIII. Nahy ‘an al-Munkar
------------------------

It means forbidding the prohibited things or works. We should ask any
man who is found to be doing things prohibited by Allah, to refrain from
such deeds, provided we have a hope that he will act on our advice.

IX. Tawalla
-----------

It means to love the Fourteen Ma’sumeen and keep friends with their
followers.

X. Tabarra
----------

It means that we should remain aloof from the enemies of the Fourteen
Ma’sumeens.

Ijtihad and Taqlid
------------------

In every sphere of life we have to heed to the advice of the experts in
that field. Likewise, in the matter of Islamic Laws, we must obey the
rulings of the experts of that Law. Those experts are called Mujtahids;
and the act of obeying their rulings is called *taqlid*.

Here are some of the conditions which govern our choice of the Mujtahid:

(a) He must be *baligh* (i.e. adult), (b) *Aaqil* (i.e. sane), (c) Man,
(d) Alive at the time of beginning the Taqlid, (e) Ithna ‘Ashari, (f)
*Aadil*, (g) Mujtahid, (h) *A’lam*, (i) Of legitimate birth. (j) Having
good memory, (k) Not involved in worldly affairs so as to hinder his
scholarly pursuits.

*Aadil* means a person who does not commit major sins even
unintentionally; and if he commits minor sins (not intentionally) he
repents at once. Only an *aadil* person can lead the prayers, can be
accepted as a reliable witness and be appointed as *qadhi* (judge).  
*A’lam* means one who is the most learned of all.
