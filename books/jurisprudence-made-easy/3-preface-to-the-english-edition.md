Preface to the English edition
==============================

**In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful**  
 I have pleasure in making available to the English reader my Book,
al-Fatawa al-Muyyessarah - Jurisprudence Made Easy, which has also been
translated to few other languages. I am glad to say that the Arabic
Edition has now been published few times. This is indicative of the need
for books of jurisprudence, which is a quite technical subject, in a
form of language that is down to earth. This being so as to make the
subject matter more accessible to the readers, irrespective of their
backgrounds.  
 I am confident that this novel approach to dealing with the subject
will bear fruit, not least in contributing to the spread of religious
knowledge among vast sections of the society, especially the
up-and-coming generation, who has been starved of gaining any meaningful
knowledge of the precepts of religion, because of the way the education
system has been geared.  
 I would like to thank Imam Ali Foundation, London for financing the
translation and publishing of the book. I should also thank Mr. Najim
al-Khafaji for the efforts he put in translating the book.  
 Since presenting to the reader a simplified version of jurisprudence
and issues of religious connotations is the first attempt of its kind, I
should be very grateful for any feedback from you.  
 In the end, I pray to the Almighty to bestow success upon us for that
which pleases Him. For all the mercies vouchsafe us, we are truly
grateful to Allah.
