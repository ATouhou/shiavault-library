Being Independent Of Others
===========================

**Being independent of others-الاِسْتِغناء عَن الخَلقِ**

1. Dispense with your dependency on anyone and you will be like him.

> 1ـ اِسْتَغْنِ عَمَّنْ شِئْتَ وكُنْ (تَكُنْ) نَظِيرَهُ.

2. One who is independent from people, Allah, the Glorified, enriches
him.

> 2ـ مَنِ اسْتَغْنى عَنِ النّاسِ أغْناهُ اللّهُ سُبْحانَهُ.

3. One who becomes independent becomes an honour for his people and one
who is needy becomes contemptible to them.

> 3ـ مَنِ اسْتَغْنى كَرُمَ عَلى أهْلِهِ ومَنِ افْتَقَرَ هانَ عَلَيْهِمْ.

4. That which you have no need for is better than that through which you
gain independence.

> 4ـ مَا اسْتَغْنَيْتَ عَنْهُ خَيْرٌ مِمَّا اسْتَغْنَيْتَ بِهِ.
