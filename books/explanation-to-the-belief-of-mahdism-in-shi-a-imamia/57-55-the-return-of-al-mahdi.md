55. The Return of Al-Mahdi
==========================

What was predicted did not produce a result, what was foretold was not
applicable; circumstances did not come under the fang of prediction;
hence, the appearance of the 12th Imam remained uncertain. The writer
says this. The time of appearance of the Imam was and still is unknown.
Therefore, there was no prediction in this respect. The Shia knew this.
There was no uncertainty about it nor is there today. If the writer says
the uncertainty lies in the belief he is wrong.

The matter is clear. Knowledge of time is known to no one except God.
That the Shias in hopes of the future, abstain from taking part in
politics is wrong. The political activity of Shias is undeniable.
Sometimes Shias have remained aloof and at a distance from politics
which again in itself is a policy. Religious prudency dictates at
interludes for policies to vary.

Many only look at the periphery of the events. The political stand that
a Shia take is on the fundamental of a campaign. He opposes a tyrant
government and supports anything having to do with belief. His position
has always been strong solid in the political field.
