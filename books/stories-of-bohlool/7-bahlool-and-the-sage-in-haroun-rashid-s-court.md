Bahlool and the Sage in Haroun Rashid's Court
=============================================

Haroun sent for a certain sage of Greece. When he came, Haroun greeted
him with majesty, splendor, and respect. For a few days court rulers and
the great men of Baghdad came to see this philosopher. On the third day
Bahlool also went with some people. In the middle of the formal and
petty talk, Bahlool suddenly asked him, “ What kind of work do you do?”

The sage was aware of Bahlool's insanity, so he wanted to make him look
like a fool. He answered, “I am a philosopher and I awaken the dead
(people's minds).”

Bahlool replied, “Don't kill those (minds) that are alive (by giving
wrong ideas). Reawakening the dead (people's minds) is your compensation
for that.”

Haroun and his courtiers laughed a lot at Bahlool's answer, and the sage
shamefully left Baghdad.
