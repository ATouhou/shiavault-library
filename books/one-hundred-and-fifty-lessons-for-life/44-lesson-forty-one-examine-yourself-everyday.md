Lesson Forty One: Examine Yourself Everyday
===========================================

Imam Al-Kadhim (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَيْسَ مِنّا مَنْ لَمْ يُحاسِبْ نَفْسَهُ كُلَّ يَوْم
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

One who does not perform self-examination everyday is not among us.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Preventing loss and increasing profit in any worldly activity, however
big or small, requires continuous monitoring and assessment through
inspection, measurement and accounting. One can see how careful people
are in calculation of their material wealth. And how sensitive are the
weight-watchers about small changes in their weight. Yet, surprisingly,
some of them do not look into their human, moral and spiritual accounts
even once during their life. What a terrible negligence!

A responsible and vigilant Muslim is one who, as the Imam says, examines
his account everyday without exception. If he has done a good deed, he
tries to continue it, and if he has done evil, he repents for it.
