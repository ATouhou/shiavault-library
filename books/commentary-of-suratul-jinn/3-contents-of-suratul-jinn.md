Contents of Suratul Jinn
========================

   
**S**uratul Jinn was revealed in the blessed city of *Makkah*
*al-Mukarramah* and contains twenty eight *Ayat* (verses).  Just as its
name indicates, this Surah contains a discussion concerning the unseen
creation of Allah (Glorified and Exalted is He) known as the *Jinn*. 

The discourse, amongst other topics, covers the Jinns' belief in the
Prophet of Islam (blessings of Allah be upon him and his progeny) and
their humility and humbleness in relation to the Holy Qur'an.

Their belief and firm conviction on the Day of Resurrection, and that
among them there can be found both believers and disbelievers, is also
covered in this Surah.  These discussions are covered in nineteen of the
twenty eight verses of the Surah and not only refute and negate much of
the uncertainty and hearsay that has been disseminated about the Jinn,
but also amends and rectifies them.  
    
 The second section of this Surah contains a subtle allusion regarding
the belief in the Oneness of Allah (Glorified and Exalted is He) and the
Resurrection Day.  
    
 In the final section of this Surah, there is a discussion concerning
the Knowledge of the Unseen *(\`Ilmul Ghaib)* of which not a single soul
has knowledge about - except Allah (Glorified and Exalted is He) and
those individuals whom He decides to inform about these matters.
