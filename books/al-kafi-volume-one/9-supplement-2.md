Supplement 2
============

rendered their magic powerless. Thus, the divine power gifted to Moses
clearly demonstrated the divine truth to those magic-mad people.

،¥Jesus (p.b.u.h.) was sent at the time when the people were under the
grip of chronic diseases. Hence Jesus brought from God such medical
powers as the people of that time did not possess. Jesus (p.b.u.h.)
brought the dead back to life and healed the people born blind and
leperous by the will of Allah. Thus the divine reason and justification
was demonstrated to the people.

،¥Almighty Allah sent Prophet Muhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.p.) at the time
when oratory and speech had a tremendous sway over the people.'

"I (the narrator) think that the Imam used the word "poetry" (i.e. he
added "poetry" to the "oratory and speech"). (Then the Imam
continued):

،¥In view of this trend of the time, Prophet Muhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.p.)
was gifted by God with such sublime sermons, admonitions, and such
eloquent discourses of wisdom which clearly demonstrated the divine
truth to them (by defeating them on their own ground, the field of
oratory and poetry).' "Hearing this highly learned and scholarly
statement, Ibn as-Sikk.t (the great scholar) exclaimed, ،¥By God, I have
never seen any scholar like you.،¦ Then Ibn as-Sikk.t inquired of the
Imam, ،¥Who is the man personifying this divine proof and demonstration
for the people of this time?،¦ The Imam replied, ،¥It is through
intellect and reason one can recognise and corroborate the truthful
divine demonstrator.

And it is through reasoning one can falsify the pretender who claims
divine representation as a divine demonstrator.،¦ Hearing this, Ibn
as-Sikk.t exclaimed, 'By Allah this is the one and the only reply.' 21.

(،X) Muthanna al-Hƒmannatƒz (،X) Qutaybah al-A،¥sha (،X) Ibn Abi Ya،¥f.r
(،X) the slave of Bani Shayban (،X) Abu Ja،¥far (p.b.u.h.) as saying:

"At the time when Imam al-Mahdi (the twelfth Imam in the line-age of
Prophet Muhammad's progeny) will make an appearance in the world,
Almighty Allah will put His blessed Hand over the heads of the people of
that time through which the Reason of the people will be completely
restored and their comprehension will be brought to perfection."

22. ،¥Ali ibn Muhammad (،X) Sahl ibn Ziyad (،X) Muhammad ibn Sulayman
(،X) Ali ibn Ibrah.m (،X) ،¥Abdullah ibn Sinan (،X) Abu ،¥Abdillah
(p.b.u.h.) as saying :

"Each prophet personifies the proof and divine. demonstration for
mankind (taken collectively). While Reason is the proof and
demonstration between God and mankind (taken individually)."

23. A group of our associates (،X) Ahmad ibn Muhammad (Mursalan ،X
without describing the chain of narrators) quoted Abu ،¥Abdillah
(p.b.u.h.), as saying :

"The reasoning capacity is the chief pillar of human existence. It is
the fountain spring of sagacity, comprehension, memory and knowledge.
Man is perfected through Reason and it is this which is a guide, a
discriminator and a key to every success. When Reason secures the
approval of Divine Light, it earns (perfection in) know-ledge, memory,
sagacity, level headness and God mindedness.

It is through Reason one understands how, why and where. It is through
Reason one knows who guides him and who misguides him. Having known all
this he comes to realise what source of life he should adopt, whom he
should meet and whom he should not. He becomes pure and sincere in his
concept of Unity of God and also in his acceptance, and belief, and
ultimately in His obedience and submission to Him.

When he has reached this stage, he has redressed every loss. He has
acquired every gain he can secure. He quickly comprehends where he
stands, and what is what, which is which, and why he has been sent here
in this worldly life, where he is brought from and where he has to go.
All this can be secured with the assistance of Reason."

24. ،¥Ali ibn Muhammad (،X) Sahl ibn Ziyad (،X) Isma.l ibn

Mihran (،X) some of his associated narrators (،X) Abu ،¥Abdillah
(p.b.u.h.) as saying:

"Reason is a guide to every believer."
25. al-Hƒmusayn ibn Muhammad (،X) Mu،¦alla ibn Muhammad (،X)
al-Washsha،¦ (،X) Hammad ibn ،¥Uthman (،X) as-Sari ibn Khalid (،X) Abu
،¥Abdillah (p.b.u.h.) as saying:

"The messenger of Allah (Muhammad, the prophet - p.b.u.h.a. h.p.), said
(to ،¥Ali):

،¥O ،¥Ali, no poverty is as great as ignorance and no wealth is as
profitable as the reasoning capacity.،¦ "

26. Muhammad ibn al-Hƒmasan (،X) Sahl ibn Ziyad (،X) Ibn Abi Najran
(،X) al-،¦Ala ibn Raz.n (،X) Muhammad ibn Muslim (،X) Abu Ja،¥far
(p.b.u.h.), as saying:

"When Almighty Allah created Reason, He ordered it to come forward and
it came forward. Then He ordered it to go back and it went back. On this
Almighty Allah said : ،¥I swear by My power and Majesty that no creation
of Mine is dearer than you are. Lo! to you are My orders and
prohibitions addressed and for you are My rewards and retributions
reserved.،¦ "

27. A group of our associates (،X) Ahmad ibn Muhammad (،X)

(،X) al-Haytham ibn Abi Masr.q an-Nahdi (،X) al-Hƒmusayn ibn Khalid
(،X) Is'hƒuaq ibn ،¥Ammar who reports:

"I inquired of Imam Abu ،¥Abdillah, ،¥How is it that certain people
understand much although I speak to them only a little? How and why is
it that certain people understand, memorise and repeat to me the whole
(subject) after I speak a lot. How and why is it that certain other
people request me to repeat although I have spoken a lot.،¦ The Imam
replied, ،¥The man who understands the whole (subject) after hearing a
little is one whose intellect and reason is kneaded along with his
gene.

The man who understands, memorises and repeats to you the whole
(subject) after your speaking fully over it, is one whose intellect and
reason develops in the embryo of his mother. And the man who requests
you to repeat the subject for him after hearing you in full, is one
whose Reason develops after he is grown up."

28. A group of our associates (،X) Ahmad ibn Muhammad (،X) some
(narrators) (rafa،¥ahu) Abu ،¥Abdillah (p.b.u.h.) as saying: "The
Messenger of Allah (Muhammad, the prophet - p.b.u.h.a.

h.p.) stated: ،¥Don't pride on a person performing too many prayers and
observing too many fasts until and unless you determine what degree of
Reason he possesses.،¦"

29. Some of our associates (rafa،¥ahu) (related the following tradition
without mentioning the sources quoted from) (،X) Mufadƒudƒual ibn ،¥Umar
(،X) Abu ،¥Abdillah (p.b.u.h.) as saying:

"O،¦ Mufadƒudƒual! one who has no Reason, secures no success. He who
has no knowledge has no Reason. And he who has understanding is closer
to excellence. He who has a quality of forbearance is bound to secure
success. Knowledge is a shield (against all evil); truthfulness is an
honour; ignorance is a disgrace; understanding is glory; generosity is
salvation; good bearing is a magnet of love.

One who is a sage of his time cannot be assailed by doubts and
confusions. Wisdom and caution demand misapprehensions about others.
(Presuming all persons to be angels runs counter to wisdom and maturity
of judgment.) Men of learning ،X the scholars are the divine bounties
and are the bridge between people and wisdom.

And men of ignorance ،X the rustics are the bridge between the people
and miseries. Almighty God is a friend to him who takes pains to know
Him and He is unfriendly to him who does not take pains to know Him. A
man of wisdom is always forgiving and a man of ignorance is always
treacherous. If you want to be honoured, be gentle to others and if you
want to be disgraced be harsh to others. One who is noble by birth is
gentle at heart, and one who is ignoble by birth is crude at heart.

One who transgresses (the divine limits) is caught up in a sad plight.
One who is afraid of consequences never takes any wrong step. One who
rushes in doing what he does not know disgraces himself. (There is an
English proverb to this effect : ،¥Fools rush in where angels fear to
tread.،¦) One who has no knowledge cannot understand and he who does not
understand cannot be in peace.

He who is not in peace cannot have any honour. And he who has no honour
is abashed. And he who is abashed is a target of general condemnation.
And he who is like this has ultimately to meet repentance and
disgrace."

30. Muhammad ibn Yahƒuya (rafa،¥ahu) Am.r al-mu،¦min.n (،¥Ali, ،X the
Chief of the believers) as saying :

"One who is fortified at least in one virtue from amongst the rest to
my satisfaction, will be acceptable to me just on the score of that
virtue alone. I can overlook and forgive his lack of other virtues, but
the lack of Reason and faith in no case can be overlooked and forgiven.
Being without faith and religion is equal to being without peace and
security. Verily, life in fear is totally unpleasant and lack of Reason
is tantamount to lack of life.

A person devoid of reason cannot be conceived except as a corpse."

31. ،¥Ali ibn Ibrah.m ibn Hashim (،X) M.sa ibn Ibrah.m al-Muhƒuaribi
(،X) al-Hƒmasan ibn M.sa (،X) M.sa ibn ،¥Abdillah (،X) Maym.n ibn ،¥Ali
(،X) Abu ،¥Abdillah (p.b.u.h.) as saying:

"Am.r al-mu،¦min.n (،¥Ali ،X the Chief of the believers) has stated,
،¥Self Conceit is a proof of feeble Reason.،¦ "

32. Ab. ،¥Abdillah al-،¥Asƒwimi (،X) ،¥Ali ibn al-Hƒmasan (،X) ،¥Ali
ibn Asbatƒz (،X) al-Hƒmasan ibn al-Jahm (،X) Abi'l-Hƒmasan ar-Ridƒua
(p.b.u.h.), when a discussion about Reason took place before him, (the
Imam) observed :

"A believer in religion who has no Reason is of no consideration at
all." The narrator asked, "May my life be sacrificed for you, there are
certain people in our community who, in our eyes are without any fault,
but they don't possess (sufficient) Reason and understanding (of
religion)." The Imam remarked, "Such people are not among those God has
considered eligible to be addressed. When Almighty God created Reason,
He ordered it to come forward.

The Reason came forward. Then He ordered it to go back. It went back.
On this, God the Almighty observed : ،¥I swear by My power and Majesty
that I have not created anything more handsome and dearer than you. It
is only on your account that I shall take people to task and it is only
on your account that I grant My rewards.،¦ "

33. ،¥Ali ibn Muhammad (،X) Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid (،X) his
father (،X) some of our associates (،X) Abu ،¥Abdillah (p.b.u.h.), as
saying : "There is no distinguishing feature between faith and
infidelity apart from the lack of reasoning." Hearing this someone asked
the Imam, "O،¦ son of the Prophet, how is this?" The Imam replied,
"In-stead of turning to God, man turns to other men for the fulfilment
of his needs. If he had turned to God exclusively, in all sincerity, God
would have fulfilled his need much speedily than any man could have
done."

34. A group of our associates (،X) Sahl ibn Ziyad (،X) ،¥Ubaydillah
al-Dihqan (،X) Ahmad ibn ،¥Umar al-Hƒmalabi (،X) Yahƒuya ibn ،¥Imran
(،X) Abu ،¥Abdillah (p.b.u.h.) as saying that Am.r al-rnu'min.n.
(،¥Ali - the Chief of the believers) used to say :

"It is through Reason that wisdom can be fathomed in all its depth.
And, it is through wisdom that the depth of Reason can be fathomed. Good
supervision gives birth to good bearing and social decorum." Also
Hƒmadƒurat ،¥Ali used to say, "Meditation grants real life to the heart
and soul of an observant person. As a pedestrian goes along in darkness
with the help of a lamp, we should go (along on the path of life
continuously) with the help of the lamp of our reason, guarding
ourselves against the evils, without unnecessary delay."

35. A group of our associates (،X) ،¥Abdullah al-Bazzaz (،X) Muhammad
ibn ،¥Abd ar-Rahƒuman ibn Hƒmammad (،X) al-Hƒmasan ibn ،¥Ammar (،X) Abu
،¥Abdillah (p.b.u.h.) as saying :

"The initiation, the development and the power of any task productive
of any advantage cannot be undertaken without reason which has been
designed by God as light and ornament for His creation. It is through
reason that man recognises his Creator. It is through reason that they
recognise themselves to be not self created but God is their Disposer
and that they are at His disposal.

It is through reason that they comprehend the object behind the
creation of the heavens, the earth, the sun, the moon, the night and the
day. It is through reason they realise that there is a Creator and
Disposer for them, and for all the universe that has always been and
will always be. It is through reason that they discriminate between good
and bad. It is through reason that they understand that darkness (the
evils) lies in ignorance and the light (every good) lies in knowledge.
All these facts are known to men through reason."

It was asked of the Imam, "Is it possible for the people to be
contented with their reason leaving every other thing behind?" The Imam
replied, "Lo! the reason which has been designed by the God to be the
foundation, the ornament and guidance is a light house for the wise, who
recognise that God is the Truth and He is man's sustainer. They realise
that their Creator has His likes and dislikes and He could be obeyed and
disobeyed.

"They also recognise that- they cannot understand the manner in which
His likes and dislikes operate with the help of mere reason. Hence, in
this respect it is essential for them to take the help of knowledge. It
means that they have derived no benefit from their intellectual
capabilities. It is therefore imperative for men of reason to acquire
knowledge and decorum without which their life has no support."

36. ،¥Ali ibn Muhammad (،X) some of his associates (،X) Ibn Abi ،¥Umayr
(،X) an-Nadƒur ibn Suwayd (،X) Hƒmumran and Sƒlafwan ibn Mihran
al-Jammal, as saying: "We both have heard Abu ،¥Abdillah (p.b.u.h.), as
often saying :

،¥No wealth is so prolific as that of Reason. No destitution is worse
than stupidity. In nothing does success surpass so much as in obtaining
councils, from the people of Reason and Knowledge.،¦ " (This is the end
of the First Part of the Book of REASON and IGNORANCE).

All praise to Allah alone and bit sings of Allah be upon Muhammad and
upon his Progeny, with the best of regards.
