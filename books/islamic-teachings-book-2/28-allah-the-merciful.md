Allah, the Merciful
===================

***“Your God is Allah, the One. There is no god but He! The Beneficent
the Merciful. “***

(Surah al-Baqarah, 2:163).

Allah, the Creator of the universe, is One and Unique. He has no partner
in the creation and administration of the universe.

We see that the mechanism of creation is in motion and in perfect order,
and no chaos or disorder is present in it anywhere. Keeping this order
and arrangement in view, we can very well realize that there is only One
Omnipotent and Omniscient Being who controls this entire mechanism. It
is He whom we call God or Allah.

All the Prophets who were sent by Him into this world, taught us that He
is One and One only.

We Muslims believe that all human beings are Allah's servants and
everything has been created by Him. We worship only that One and Unique
Allah.
