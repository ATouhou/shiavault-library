Acknowledgement
===============

My deep appreciation is extended first of all to the owner of the idea
of compiling a book introducing the personality of al- ‘Abbas ibn ‘Ali
(a), Mr. Muhammad Taqi Ansariyan who assigned me for this holy task. It
is surely a holy task since it deals with the great leader who
represented all the meanings of heroism, loyalty, perseverance and
truthfulness.

Appreciation is also shown to Dr. Muhsin Jaffar who offered his
considerable notes about the text of this book.

I would like to refer to the assistance that I received from Sheikh
Abu-Alaa as-Saffar and Mr. Muhammad Gannan too, who supplied me with
precious reference books upon which I relied throughout this work.

And finally, thanks to everybody who encouraged and helped me proceed
with this work.
