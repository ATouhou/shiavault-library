Dedication
==========

*To the lady of whom were born heroes and who could carry all the
qualifications of giving birth to a hero,*

*the lady who preferred the children of the Prophet to her children,*

*the lady who sacrificed her four sons for God,*

*the lady whom God has made the door to the settlement of needs,*

*the mother who fed her son with heroism, magnanimity, and altruism,*

*the mother of al-â€™Abbas, the righteous servant of God,*

*I dedicate this modest work to her, hoping for acceptance.*
