42. The 4th ambassador and the end of the period of his embassy
===============================================================

The long absence (Ghaybat Kubra) was an anticipated one during the short
one (Ghaybat Sughra). In that period books too were written about this
subject. No ambassador was appointed after Ali Bin Mohammed Saruri. The
reason is not known. It could be that the Imam did not find a
trustworthy one. It could be this that the Nawabs of the period of short
Ghaybat were to acquaint the people with the coming Ghaybat that was
going to be indefinitely long.
