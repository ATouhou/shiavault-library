1- Night of Divine Decrees = Night of ghadr (\*) a night told of in a
koranic chapter in which I have found the word ghadr translated in two
dif-ferent ways in two koranic translations; M. M. Pickthail refers to
it as the “Night of Power” and M. H. Shakir calls it the “Night of
Majesty” My opinion however is that according to the contents of the
verse, “Night of Divine Decrees” better describes this night. (the
translator)

2- is from the root word originally meaning “weaning from milk” and in
the appropriate choice of this name for the lady Islam, reasons have
been mentioned, including the above meaning.

3-According to the reports of the religions great ones, it is bidden
among three nights (the 19th and 23rd of Ramazan).

4-Because her satisfaction and pleasure causes god’s pleasure; and gods
pleasure is greater than the world and everything in it.

5-Mojam-AI-Boldan: The word Fadak.

6- Quran; chapter 54, Vs 6 & [^7]:

7-Refer to the book “Fadak” by Alameh Seyyid Mohammed Hassan Ghazvini
Haery.

8-Because it was a possession of the Prophet (p.b.u.h.).
