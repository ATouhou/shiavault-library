A Word From The Publisher

##### In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful

##### A Word from the Publisher:

This booklet was originally printed in Persian by the *Organization for
the Establishment* of Salatof the Khuzistan Province in the Islamic
Republic of Iran in 1998.

We present the English translation of this small booklet to the dear,
esteemed readers in hopes that the younger generation of Muslims will be
able to benefit from it and learn the correct method of the Salat - the
best way for the Muslim to get closer to his Creator. We ask Allah
(Glorified and High is He) that He place us amongst His true worshippers
and servants, InshaAllah.
