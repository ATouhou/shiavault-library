Translation From Urdu
---------------------

*Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir-Raheem*

My dear Maulana Muhammad Raza Dawoodani is among those young scholars
who try to present laws of *Shariah* in the easiest possible manner and
consider it their responsibility to do so. This sense of responsibility
is such an act of piety which needs to be encouraged and is praise
worthy. May Allah increase his *taufeeq*.

This booklet consists of those issues which believers come across during
the month of Ramadhan and Eid. They are presented beautifully in an
extreme easy way. I hope people with academic taste will benefit from
this work. Benefit would have been enhanced if interpretation of few
more jurists is included.

I pray to Allah, the Almighty for the continuous *taufeeq* of Maulana
Dawoodani to serve this science and religion for the sake of infallible
imams (A.S.).
