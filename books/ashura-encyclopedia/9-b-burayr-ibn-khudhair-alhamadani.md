B - Burayr Ibn Khudhair Alhamadani
==================================

Amongst the martyrs of Karbala, he was known for reading the Qura'an and
teaching it to others. Burayr was known for his bravery in Kufa.
Originally from the tribe of "Hamadan", he was called 'Sayyid
Al-Qurra'a', Master of the Reciters. In Karbala, he tried to guide ‘Umar
Ibn Sa'ad to the right path and leave Yazeed Ibn Mu’awiyyah, but to no
avail. He was killed early in Karbala right after the martyrdom of Al
Hurr Ibn Yazeed Al-Riyahi.
