The Superiority of Islam in the Doctrine of Divine Unity
========================================================

The above are the three stages which the lovers of the Truth in the
various religions of the world pass through. When they begin their
travel on the way of spiritual perfection they take these stages to be
their final goal. Islam, however, does not limit itself to these stages
but delineates a goal for its followers which is even higher and which
surpasses the goal formulated in the text of any other religion.

For, it does not stop at negating all limitations from God and
considering Him as infinite and transcendent over all qualification, but
it goes so far as to negate from Him this very quality of Infinity
(since every quality [even that of Infinity] cannot help but "qualify"
and so limit that to which it is attributed.)

Hence the Divine Essence is considered as transcending all names and
designations and even as transcending this very description. The sixth
Shi'ite Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq, according to a tradition which is quoted
by al-Kulayni in the book Usul-al-kafi, has deduced this stage from the
following verse of the Holy Qur’an:

***"Say (unto mankind): Cry unto Allah, or cry unto the Beneficient,
unto whichsoever ye cry (it is the same) . His are the most beautiful
names." (Qur’an 17: 110) .***

However, since further elucidation of this doctrine would mean that we
must enter a philosophical discussion which is not in keeping with the
nature of the present article, for the present we must leave this aside.
