2. Comparison between English and Arabic prepositions (fii..in), (ala..on)
==========================================================================

English language researchers are well aware that English prepositional
usage is one of the Arab learners are also expected to find similar
difficulties in the use of English prepositions because although Arabic
and English prepositions have some characteristics in common, they
differ in both number and usage. There are only twenty Arabic
prepositions the most important and commonly used are six prepositions,
(min, ila, ala, ba, la, fi), (Abbas hasan, 1961:pp320) while in English
there are one hundred fifty prepositions (Josef essberger, 2000).

A preposition by definition expresses a relationship between two
entities: it indicates a relationship in space (between one object and
another), andor a relationship in time (between events), andor a more
abstract relationship (government). So, the first characteristic is that
neither Arabic nor English prepositions can stand by themselves: they
get their meanings through their usage in contexts.

The other characteristics is that the number of prepositions in English
is more than Arabic in Arabic is limited, as mentioned above; but, at
the same time, each preposition may have to serve variety of purposes.
The same preposition may express time or space and be followed be anoun,
a verb, an adverb or an adjective; also it may be used idiomatically.

The main problem for these learners lies firstly in the fact that not
every Arabic preposition has definite equivalent in English and vice
versa, and secondly, in that not every English or Arabic preposition has
a definite usage and meaning, indicating only time or space or following
preceding a certain word. The most problematic of all prepositions for
both space and time**“fii** and**on”.**

The first example the Arabic preposition ”**fii”** is used as an
equivalent instead of**“in, into, at, on, during’, within, inside and
also zero equivalent”.** This particular preposition has therefore great
semantic power in both standard and colloquial Arabic: it’s the filter
through which all these English equivalents must pass. It is used to
denote time and place and occurs with many different Arabic words in
abstract and metaphorical usages. Therefore “**fii’** as well as other
Arabic prepositions interferes the selection and usage of English once.

Fii

I sleptin bed. (Correct response) (In)

Spring beginsin the first of March. (On)

In the end of the journey we brought fruit. (At)

In my last holiday I did many different thinks. (During)

I went homein happily. (?)

The plane is flyinginto the sky. (In)

The first English preposition that is likely to be produced as the
equivalent of the Arabic preposition fii is “in” as shown in the first
sentence where it is correctly used. However it is incorrectly selected
instead of “on, at, during, “?”, and into”. In the sentences 2,3,4 and5.
On the other hand students may also they maybe use this preposition and
all its other equivalents interchangeably, as illustrated by sentence 6.

Another problem is that Arab use or omit certain English prepositions
according to Arabic usage .so, by literal translation when the Arabic
context requires a preposion (or requires none), learners make wrong
responses accordingly as illustrated in the following examples:

The boy enjoyed the film.

The literal translation of this sentence is

Either              the boy enjoyedwith the film.

Or                   the boy enjoyed from the film.

In Arabic it is necessary to insert a preposition to make a relationship
between the enjoyment and the film, which was the cause of the
enjoyment. With out such a preposition the Arabic sentence will have no
sense.

Therefore Arab learners are likely to insert unnecessary prepositions
when they express themselves in English. On the other hand, they may
omit necessary prepositions as illustrated by the following examples:

When we arrivedin Jericho we bought fruit.

I must stayat the university for eight years.

I saw the domeof the rock.

These are correct responses in English. The prepositions “in, for, and
of” must be inserted to form a relationship between the arriving and the
place, which was arrived at, and the stay at the university and the time
to be spent there; also between the rock and the dome which is built
over it. With out these prepositions the above sentences will make no
sense in English. But the literal translations of these sentences don’t
need such prepositions because the relationship exists in Arabic without
them as shown in flowchart (1).

Flowchart (1) Arabic preposition**“Fii”** comparison with English
preposition**“In”**

The second example: Ala

The Arabic preposition “Ala’ is used as an equivalent instead of “on,
over, above, at and onto”. According to Arab learners these prepositions
in English language have the same equivalent and usage. They couldn’t
differentiate in the use of these prepositions, they only use “on”, as
shown in the examples below.

I saw a football matchon TV.  (On)

The bird is flyingon my head. (Above)

He jumpedon the wall. (Over)

We saton the table. (At)

I will comeon seven o’clock. (At)

The crab was washed upon the shore. (Onto)

As shown in the first sentence above, the first English preposition that
is likely to be produced as the equivalent of the Arabic
preposition**“ala”** is**“on”** . However, its incorrectly selected
of**“over, above, at and onto”** in sentences 2,3,4,5 and 6.

The key to this problem is the fact Arab always resort to literal
translation before they form English pattern. In the other words, they
translate the English into Arabic and then the Arabic back in to
English, word for word .so these mistakes due to the Arabic interference
when they speak or translate into English once.  Also the differences
between English and Arabic patterns make it difficult to choose the
correct preposition, as shown in flowchart (2).
