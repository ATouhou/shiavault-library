-----------

Lit. "two margins or limits"; technically the term denotes the doctrine
of the philosophers, particularly that of Mulla Sadra, according to
which all existents have "two limits", one towards the Necessary Being
(al-wajib al-wujud, q.v.) and the other towards the prime matter
(hayula, q.v.). See also al-Shaikh al-Yunani (Plotinus) in whom we
already meet a similar view about existents.

of the greatest and most original thinkers, not only in the history of
Muslim philosophy but in the history of human thought. This title befits

celebrated work: Tahafut al-Falasifah (The Incoherence of the
Philosophers). Links: Ghazali's Site.

received through the five external senses (al-hawas al-khamsah, q.v.).
It may be said

that it is a faculty in which all the sense-perceptions are so coalesced
that they assume a single form. This is how when we see the yellow
colour of honey, we can internally tell that it is sweet, good-smelling
and fluid; true, we have our past experiences of the taste, smell and
touch of honey without sensing them again has become possible only
through the functioning of the faculty of common sense.

hissah

Case (see Asfar, 1: 43) (AnAc)

al-hikmat al-ishraqiyah
-----------------------

"Illuminationist theosophy": a school of thought in Muslim
religio-philosophical thought which identifies philosophy with wisdom
and gnosis rather than with abstract speculation and rational
systematisation. Accordingly, unlike the Peripatetic philosophers of
whom it is mostly critical, it lays greater emphasis on intuition
(attained through invocation, meditation and purification of the soul)
than on discursive intellect to reach the light of wisdom which, it
maintains, was first revealed to the prophets and only partly understood
and even misinterpreted by the Greek philosophers. As enunciated in the
Hikmat al-Ishraq (528/1186) by Shihab al-Din al-Suharwardi
(549-587/1153-1191), the founder of the school, it integrates Platonic
and Aristotelian philosophy with the Zoroastrian principles of light and
darkness along with its peculiar angelogy and Hermetic ideas and places
the whole system within the context of Sufism. the outstanding among
those who kept up the tradition of Ishraqi school were Mir Damad (d.
1041/1631), Mulla Sadra (d. 1050/1640) and Haji Hadi Sabziwari (d.
1295/1878). See also al-hikmat al-dhauqiyah.

al-hikmat al-bahthiyah
----------------------

Philosophy based on discursive intellect and its abstract speculations,
a name given by the philosophers of Illuminationism to the philosophy of
Aristotle and his representatives in Muslim philosophy (masha’iyun). See
also al-hikmat al-dhauqiyah.

al-hikmat al-dhauqiyah
----------------------

Philosophy based on Illuminative disclosures of inner experiences and
mystical intuitions as opposed to al-hikmat al-bahthiyah (q.v.), the

philosophy based on discursive intellect and theoretical speculations. A
distinction made by the philosophers of Illuminationism (, q.v.). While
the former opens up new frontiers of experience and suggestion and inner
illumination, the latter merely enters into subtle dialectical
discussions through definitions, explanations and abstract speculations.
See also al-hikmat al-ishraqiyah.

al-hikmat al-riyadiyah
----------------------

The science of mathematics which consists of four disciplines:
arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and theory of music.

al-hikmat al-majhuulah
----------------------

"The unknown wisdom", i.e. those acts of God the wisdom of which remain
unknown to human beings, for example the infliction of pain upon the
innocent and virtuous. The term is used equally with reference to such
religious beliefs as are beyond our finite understanding.

al-hikmat al-muwwahamah

q.v.); (5) the relation between a body and its place.

al-hulul al-jawari

The relation of something being contained in a container like water in a
water-pot, a term used synonymous with (al-hulul al-tarayani, q.v.).

of the latter like the fragrance of a rose into the rose flower.

al-hulul al-tarayani
--------------------

The relation of something being contained in a container like water in a
water-pot; also sometimes called al-hulul al-jawari opposed to al-hulul

haml al-ishtiqaq
----------------

Incomplete or partial prediction of a subject in a subject-predicate
proposition, e.g. when we say that man is a biped.

haml al-muwatah

that the two become congruent and convertible with each other, e.g. when
we say that man is a rational animal; opposed to haml al-ishtiqaq

philosophers, from a series in a graded order in which the distinctive
nature of the sensation receiving the form without the mother of its
object is increasingly manifested.

al-hawas al-zahirah
-------------------

The external senses; include touch (lams), taste (dhauq), smell (shamm),
sight (basr) and hearing (sam‘); these are five senses (al-hawas
al-khamsah) if touch is considered a single sense, but eight (al-hawas
al-thamaniyah) if it is supposed to comprise the four pairs of
contraries: hot (hararah) and cold (burudah); dry (yubusah) and moist
(rutubah); hard (salabah) and soft (rakhamah); and smooth (mulasah) and
rough (khushunah).
