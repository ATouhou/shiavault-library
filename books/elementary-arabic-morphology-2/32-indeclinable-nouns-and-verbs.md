246. Indeclinable words are words that do not change due to the
different places of a sentence it is put in. for example: **أینَ**
**الکتابُ** (where is the book?), **أینَ** **ذَهبتَ** (Where did you
go?), and **من** **أینَ** **جئتَ** (Where did you come from?)

247. Indeclinable nouns are: pronouns, demonstrative pronouns,
conjuncts, conditional nouns, interrogative words, adverbial nouns of
time or place.

248. Indeclinable nouns are indeclinable on:

• *Sakūn*, for example: **مَن** (who)

• *Dummah*, for example: **حَیثُ** (how)

• *Fathah*, for example: **أینَ** (where)

• *Kasrah*, for example: **أمسِ** (yesterday)

249. The preterite tense, imperative tense, and aorist tense verbs that
are connected to the feminine *nūn* and the *nūn* of emphasis are
indeclinable.

250. The preterite tense verb is indeclinable on:

• *Fathah*, for example: **شَرِبَ** (he drank)

• *Dummah*, if it is connected to the plural *wāw*, for example:
**شَرِبُوا** (they drank)

• *Sakūn*, if it is connected to a nominative voweled pronoun, for
example: **شربتُم** (we drank)

251. The imperative verbs are indeclinable on:

• *Sakūn*, for example: **اِشرِب** (drink)

• Erasing the *nūn*, if it is connected to the plural *wāw*, dual
*alif*, or the feminine second person pronoun, for example: **اِشربا**
(drink, addressed to three or more people).

• Erasing the weak letter, if it is a defective verb, for example:
**اِرمِ** (throw).

252. The aorist tense verbs are indeclinable on:

• *Sakūn*, if it is connected to the feminine *nūn*, for example:
**یَضرِبنَ** (she is hitting)

• *Fathah*, if it is connected to the *nūn* of emphasis, for example:
**یَضرِبَنَّ** (he is hitting!)

253. Yes, there is another *nūn* called the *nūn* of protection. This
*nūn* separates the verb from the first person *yā'*. For example:
**ضَرَبَني** (he hit me).

254. No, the *nūn* of protection is attached to some prepositions as
well. For example: **مِنِّي** (from me).
