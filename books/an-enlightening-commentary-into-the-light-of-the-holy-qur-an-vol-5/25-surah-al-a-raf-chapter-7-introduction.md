The Virtue of Studying This Surah
---------------------------------

'Ubayy-ibn-Ka'b, a leading commentator, has narrated from the Holy
Prophet of Islam (S) who said:

*"Whoever recites Surah Al-A'raf,* Allah *will set a curtain between him
and the Satan and, on the Day of Judgment Adam (as) will be his
intercessor."*

Ayyashi, another commentator, by the way of his teacher Abu Basir, has
narrated from Imam Sadiq (as) who said:

*"Whoever recites Surah Al-'A'raf every month, will be among those that
no fear shall be upon them, nor shall they grieve."*
