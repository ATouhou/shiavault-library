Trade and Industry
==================

Treat businessmen and artisans well, and advise others to do likewise.
Some of them live in towns, while some move from place to place with
their wares and tools earning their living by manual labour. Trade and
industry are the real sources of profit to the state and the suppliers
of consumer goods.

While the general public is not inclined to bear the strain, those
engaged in these professions take the trouble to collect commodities
from far and near, from land and across the sea, from mountains and
forests and naturally derive benefits.

It is this class of peace loving people from whom no disturbance need be
feared. They love peace and order, indeed they are incapable of creating
disorder. Visit every part of the country and establish personal contact
with this class, and inquire into their condition.

But bear in mind that a good many of them are intensely greedy and are
inured to bad dealings. They hoard grain and try to sell it at a high
price and this is most harmful to the public. It is a blot on the name
of the ruler not to fight this evil. Prevent them from hoarding, for the
prophet of God had prohibited it.

See to it, that trade is carried on with the utmost ease, that the
scales are evenly held and that prices are so fixed that neither the
seller nor the buyer is put to a loss. If in spite of your warning,
anyone should go against your commands and commit the crime of hoarding,
then deal him appropriately with a severe punishment.
