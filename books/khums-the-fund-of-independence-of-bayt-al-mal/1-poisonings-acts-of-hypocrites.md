Poisonings Acts of Hypocrites
=============================

There are only few jobs easier than “poisoning” the minds of people who
have not extended knowledge of a matter, because this is like destroying
a building. Sometimes it takes several years to build a building, while
it is possible to destroy it in only few seconds.

Therefore, if we see that evil temptations of frails around us have
effects on some simple thoughts, it is neither because of power and
logic of tempters nor weak principles of Islam, but this is the
attribute of poisoning among people who have not enough knowledge of a
matter; and the best of fighting this poisoning is to increase the level
of knowledge of people in Islamic matters, because if the sun of science
and knowledge rise in hearts then witch moths will hide themselves
rapidly.

Accordingly, it is decided, by almighty god’s will, to prepare and
publish brief and precise but calculated and logical booklets in
different Islamic issues and those which are related to Shiite and Ahlul
Bayt (a.s.) that hypocrites poisoning on them for informing the public
in order not to remain a place for cavillers.

Here it is necessary to acknowledge respectful scholars Ahmadi,
Ashtiani, Imami, Imani and Asadi who helped in collecting the contents
of this booklet.
