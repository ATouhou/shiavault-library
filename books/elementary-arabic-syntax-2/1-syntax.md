Syntax
======

1. What does syntax teach us?  
 Syntax teaches us the states of words when they are combined with other
words.

2. Do all words combine with other words in the same way?  
 There are two types of words that are combined with other words:  
 • Indeclinable: the end of the word does not change.

• Declinable: the end of the word changes due to the different functions
that it serves.

3. How does one know what the end of an indeclinable word is?  
 There is no rule in determining the end of an indeclinable word.

4. How does one know what the end of a declinable word is?  
 The end of declinable words is determined by the rules that one learns
from syntax. One will learn when a verb is put into the nominative,
subjective or jussive cases and when a noun is put into the nominative,
accusative, or genitive cases.
