Al- Rabab, the Wife of the Imam (Q) with his Holy Head
======================================================

Bin Ziad had asked for them one more time, and when the ladies entered,
they saw the Head of Imam Hussain (Q) between his hands, while divine
lights were shedding from it towards the sky. The Rabab, the wife of
Imam Hussain (Q), could not control herself, so she threw herself on him
and started kissing him.
