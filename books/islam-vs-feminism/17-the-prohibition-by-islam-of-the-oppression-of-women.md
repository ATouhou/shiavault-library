The Prohibition by Islam of the Oppression of Women
===================================================

No prohibition is given greater emphasis in Islam than that against
injustice. In the Qur'an, particular attention is drawn to various areas
in which there is a potential for injustice against women, but in
general it is social acceptability and moral conscience to which appeal
is made in order to discern what is just from what is oppression. The
laws of Islam set outer limits, but that does not mean that whatever
falls within the perimeters is condoned. With respect to worship, for
example, the law specifies the outward conditions for correct prayer,
fasting and ritual purity, but one may offer formally correct prayer in
ways considered repugnant (makruh) even with respect to external form.
It is rather trite to mention, additionally, that validity of external
form is no guarantee of interior soundness (ihsan).

According to a hadith related by both Shi'i and Sunni sources, on his
last pilgrimage, the Prophet (S) said, "O people! Fear Allah regarding
women, for you have taken them in trust from Allah." Since what is taken
in trust must be properly cared for, some scholars have allowed that the
legal religious authorities may intervene even when there has been no
explicit violation of Islamic precepts in case of mistreatment of a wife
by her husband.31
