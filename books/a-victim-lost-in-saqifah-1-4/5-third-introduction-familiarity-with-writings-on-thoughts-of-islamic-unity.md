Third Introduction: Familiarity With Writings On Thoughts of Islamic Unity
==========================================================================

When we read the writings and opinions of supporters of Islamic unity,
we easily understand the bulk done in this respect. However, very little
is done towards classifying and differentiating them scientifically.

Perhaps it is one reason for difficulty one has to face in analyzing
their outlook. Further, it gives room to mistake the stand of critic to
the effect that he is intentional and deliberate in his motive. Absence
of classification between viewpoints stands as a cause in this regard.

To arrive at a correct analysis about Islamic unity depends upon these
two packages of information:

A) Acquaintance with standards of evaluation of output of revivalism.
Locating the position in this regard.

B) Accurate knowledge of various writings about Islamic unity.

We revert to history of contemporary thought while trying to lay hands
on the theory of Islamic unity and its application in our social life.
We become aware that in the first step we could follow two ways to reach
‘unity’ and to have a discourse thereon.

In other words, there remain two routes to tally towards attaining the
aspired Islamic unity. They are:

***One: Political and social movement***

***Two: Movement of belief and thought***

As mentioned before, both these lines depend on theoretical foundations
– unique in their kind. We shall try to comment on the basis of these
packages regarding particulars about Islamic unity from the angle of
thought and belief.
