55: the Mercy-giving (rahman)
=============================

This apocalyptic chapter containing 78 verses was completed after
Thunder 13 and before [Every]man (or This [Day and] Age) 76. It may
possibly be an early Meccan revelation. God in His role as Ar-Rahman or
The Mercy-giving is also expounded in Chapter 19 on Mary.

Another unifying refrain similar to that in Psalm 136 and its refrain on
how the Lord's mercy endureth for ever " runs through this chapter: So
which of your Lord's blessings will both of you deny? ". This is
repeated 31 times, carried along on rhyme or assonance (in -an) in a
strophic form. The measured prose is very effective: the chapter is in
fact a long poem dealing with proofs of Cod's favors. Duals or pairs
give it another special figure which is difficult to bring out through
English verbs or nouns.

Its inspiring message also describes the future life which is offered
the faithful, while there is a passage on Creation at the end of section
(I). Hell (II) and Heaven (III) are likewise pictured.
