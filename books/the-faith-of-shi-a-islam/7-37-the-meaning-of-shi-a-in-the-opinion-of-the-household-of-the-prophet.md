37. the Meaning of "shi'a" in the Opinion of the Household of the Prophet
=========================================================================

The Imams of the Household (A.S.) did not receive the leadership of
Islam, although, however, they never had any designs towards it. So they
devoted themselves to educating the Muslims, and to instructing them as
Allah had ordered. They remained with those who were faithful to them,
and confided in them their secrets, took great pains to teach them all
the religious commandments and instill in them religious knowledge, and
showed them what is of advantage to man and what is harmful. They
recognised no-one as Shi'i or as one of their followers unless he obeyed
the commands of Allah, kept himself apart from his desires and carried
out what they taught and guided him towards. Only to love them will not
suffice to save someone, it. that person also follows his desires.
making excuses for his disobedience to Allah, because they have clearly
said that love of them will save no-one unless it is accompanied by pure
actions, truth, honesty, piety and virtue.

Imam Baqir (A.S.) said:

O Khuthayma! Say to our friends that we can be of no help to them
before Allah unless their actions are pure, and that they cannot attain
our friendship and love except through their virtue.
For surely, one who reveres justice, but does not act in accordance
with it, will be stricken with grief and remorse more than anyone
else.

The Imams desired and expected their followers to guide others and show
them the correct path of goodness, and they instructed them to call the
people to the truth by good actions, saying that this was more important
than calling by word.

Call the people unto the truth by your behaviour, so that they can see
your obedience, and know that you are truthful and obedient.

We shall give some extracts here from conversations between the Imams
and their followers, so that the reader may see how they were anxious to
educate the people.

1. From Imam Baqir's conversation with Jabir al-Ju'afi:

O Jabir! How can someone who claims to follow us be content with only
loving us? I swear that our follower is one who carries out his duty to
Allah and fears Him. Our followers are known by their humility. modesty,
exceeding remembrance of Allah, fasting, prayer, being sympathetic and
helpful towards the poor, their reading of the Qur'an, saying nothing
about a person except concerning his good actions, and they are most
trustworthy among those close to them. (O ye who follow!) Observe your
duty to Allah, and perform good actions for His reward, for there is no
preference by Allah towards anyone. The most beloved of His servants in
the presence of Allah is the best in conduct and obedience to Him.[^8] O
Jabir! Nobody can come close to Allah except through obedience. Without
this nobody will be saved from Hell, nor can anybody excuse himself
before Allah without it. Whosoever obeys Him, he is our friend, but
whosoever disobeys Him, he is our enemy. You cannot attain to our
friendship except through good actions and virtuousness.

2. From Imam Baqir's conversation with Sa'id ibn al-Hasan:

al-Imam: 'Does it happen to you that one of you approaches his brother
and puts his hand into his brother's pocket to take some money of which
he is in need, without his brother preventing him?'
Sa'id: 'I do not know of such a thing.'
'Then truly, there are no real Shi'i among you.'
'Shall we all perish, in that case?'.
'Yes, indeed, for such people do not put into action what they say.'

3. From Imam Ja'far's conversation with Abi as-Sabah al-Kanani:

al-Kanani: 'How much harassment we receive from people for your
sake!'
al-Imam: 'What harassment do you receive from them?'
'When there is a dispute between one of us and one of them, they
immediately condemn us for following you.'
'Do they condemn you for my sake?'
'Yes, indeed!'
'But there are only a few of my followers among you. Only those who
possess great and real virtue, whose acts are only for the sake of the
Creator and to obtain his reward, only these are my followers.'

4. There are many traditions from Imam Ja'far concerning these matters.
Here we have chosen some of them and written them down.

- If a man lives in a town with a hundred thousand inhabitants or more,
and there is someone in that town whose virtue is greater then his, then
that man is not one of my followers.
- We do not count among the believers anyone unless he obeys all our
commandments. Indeed, righteousness is the only sign of one who follows
us. Adorn yourselves with it, and may Allah have Mercy on you.
- One whose chasteness and abstinence from unlawful sexuality is not
the subject of talk among women is not one of our followers. And one who
lives in a town with ten thousand inhabitants, and one of them is
greater in righteousness than he, then that man is not one of our
followers.
-Truly, a follower of Ja'far is one who does not listen to his stomach
or to his carnal desires, who endeavours in the path of Islam, who acts
for the sake of Allah, hoping only for His reward and fearing His
chastisement. Yes, indeed, such are the followers of Ja'far.


**38. The Avoidance of Oppression
**
In the opinion of the Imams, one of the worst sins among men is enmity
and iniquity between themselves. Just as it is said in the Qur'an:

Deem not that Allah is heedless of what the iniquitous do; He is only
deferring them to a day when eves shall stare.(14:42)

Likewise, 'Ali, Amir al-Mu'minin (A.S.) had a strong aversion to
iniquity, and he told the truth when he said:

I swear by Allah that if all the continents of the earth and all that
is under the sun were offered to me in exchange for sinning towards
Allah even by stealing a grain of barley from an ant, truly 1 should
never do such a thing.

And this shows how much a person can be aware of the evil of iniquity
and hold himself back from doing it. 'Ali would not do wrong even to an
ant by stealing a grain of barley from it, even though all the lands of
the earth were offered to him. How then does one stand who sheds the
blood of Muslims, plunders their property, and pours scorn on their
reputation and honour? How should he be compared with 'Ali? Where does
he stand compared to the wisdom of 'Ali? Truly, 'Ali's behaviour is a
shining example of the excellent religious education which Islam seeks
to instill in humanity.

Iniquity is, then, one of the greatest of the sins Allah has
prohibited, and this is why the Household of the Prophet have cautioned
their followers against it above all else, through their words and
prayers. Thus was their policy and behaviour, and they acted justly not
only towards their friends, but also towards those who showed disrespect
for them and treated them with rudeness.

The story of the forebearance of Imam Hasan (A.S.) with the man of Sham
(Damascus) who insulted him[^9] is well known. On that occasion, the Imam
spoke gently with him and treated him kindly, letting him understand
that he had done wrong. Even as the fourth Imam, Sayyid as-Sajadin asked
for forgiveness for iniquitous persons in hisad'iyah.
This is the utmost generosity and nobility of mind that a perfect man
can reach. Although it is correct from an Islamic point of view to
avenge an oppressor in one's own manner, and to curse him before Allah,
it is better to forgive than to avenge, for forgiveness is a sign of
virtue; indeed, in the opinion of the Imams, to curse him is to be
iniquitous oneself.

Imam Sadiq (A.S.) said:

Verily, a slave is oppressed so long as he refrains from cursing his
oppressive master excessively, but if he should do so, then he becomes
an oppressor too.

How sublime this is! But if to curse an oppressor is oppression itself,
what is the condition of those who instigate oppression and iniquity,
who commit aggression against people, or caste aspersions on their
reputations, who plunder their property, denounce them before
oppressors, or deceive them so that they fall into danger or are hurt,
or who spy on them? How do they stand in the wisdom of the Imams? Truly,
such persons are the farthest from the generosity of Allah, their sins
and their punishment are the most horrible, just as are their actions
and morality.


**39. Doctrine of Non-Cooperation with Oppressors
**
Because oppression is very dangerous and has evil consequences, Allah
has forbidden men to cooperate with the iniquitous or to associate with
them. He has said:

And do not incline towards those who are injust, lest the fire touch
you, and you have no guardians besides Allah, then you shall not be
helped. (11;113)

This is exactly what the Descendents of the Prophet have taught us, and
their teachings are the same as the Qur'an's. It is narrated that they
had the greatest aversion to those who form ties with, help or cooperate
with oppressors at any price, even to the extent of half a date. Without
doubt, the greatest misfortune that has beset Islam and the Muslims is
their lack of firmness in dealing with the evils of oppressors, and
their connivance with them, not to mention their cooperating with them
and protecting them in their oppression. There is no greater reason for
the weakness and backwardness of the Muslims than their deviation from
the straight path of Islam, and, as a result, the religion loses its
power and disintegrates day by day, becoming foreign to the people. The
Muslims, or rather those who call themselves Muslims, become powerless
and far from the protection of Allah, so that they are unable to defend
themselves against the most feeble and lowest enemies like the abject
Jews let alone their powerful Christian opponents.

As far as they were able, the Imams always endeavoured to prevent their
companions and relatives from cooperating with oppressors or helping
them, and concerning this innumerable traditions have been related by
the narrators. One of these traditions is from Imam Zayn al'Abidin
(A.S.), who had written to Muhammad ibn Muslim az-Zuhari after warning
him not to engage in oppression himself.

The reason they ask for you is only to use you as a grinding stone, a
bridge whereby they can progress to their evil aims, a ladder to their
deviations, so that you may be an agent and a propagandist for their
crimes. Through you, they can hide their affairs from wise men, and
attract the ignorant to themselves. Neither their own ministers nor
their followers can disguise their faults as you can; what little will
they give to you compared with what they take away. Take care of
yourself, examine yourself and reckon with your actions as a responsible
person.

The last sentence is full of meaning. Because, as long as man is
conquered by his desires he considers himself worthless, and feels no
responsibility for what he does; he cannot feel the evil of his bad
deeds and he supposes that what he does is as nothing and will not be
taken account of. Truly this is one of the secrets of man's unruly
soul.

Then the Imam wanted to make az-Zuhari aware of this spiritual secret
which mysteriously is part of his nature, so that he would not be
deluded by his imagination and exceed his responsibility.

One conversation that is more forceful than the above, but which is on
the same subject, comes from Imam Musa Kazim. He was speaking to Safwan
al-Jammal who was a Shi'i and a faithful narrator of his traditions,
according to al-Kishshi, who has given a biography of al-Jammal.

It is narrated that al-Jammal went to see Imam Musa.
'O Safwan! All of your actions are good, except one.'
'And what is that!'
'Your hiring of camels to that man Harun.'
'I swear by Allah that I did not do this so that he might live in
pleasure, nor that he might hunt, or amuse himself, hut only that he
might make the pilgrimage to Mecca. I have not taken charge of the
camels myself, but have entrusted them to a servant.'
'Does he have to pay for them?'
'Yes.'
'Do you wish him to live until he pays.'
'Yes.'
'Whosoever wishes them (i.e. the oppressors) to stay alive is in fact
one of them, and he shall enter Hell.'
Safwan relates that he immediately went and sold all his camels.

If such is the future for one who only wishes the iniquitous to live,
then how bad it must be for one who helps them or joins with them, or
does their work or who obeys them.
