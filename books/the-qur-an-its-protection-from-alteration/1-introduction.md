Introduction
============

The Qur'an is the eternal miracle and the living proof of the truth of
Islam. It challenged the adversaries to bring its like, even a single
chapter like its, if they thought that it was not from Allah. [^1] The
enemies failed to do so; and tried to extinguish the light of Islam by
waging war after war, which incidentally still continues on many fronts
and in several disguises.

The most important target of the enemies of Islam was and is the
Qur'an, which they have been trying to disparage in one way or the
other. For example: They said that the Prophet (peace be upon him & his
progeny) had learnt these profound truths from some Jews or Christians!
They claimed that there were contradictory statements in the Qur'an!
They pontificated that the Qur'anic ethics fell far short of the
"sublime ethical teachings" of the Christianity!

None of these claims could be sustained in the eyes of independent
thinkers; the Muslims rebutted all such accusations. We have only to
read the talk of Amirul-mu'minin 'Ali (a.s.) with an atheist on the
subject of the Qur'an, to see how the Imams of Ahlu 'l-bayt (who were
the guardians of the Qur'anic truths according to the hadith of
thaqalayn) defended the Qur'an and proved its pristine reality beyond
any doubt. [^2]

The purpose of this talk is to show that there was no tahrif in the
Qur'an. The word tahrif may denote several meanings; however, what we
are concerned with here is alteration or omission. It is our belief that
there is no alteration in, addition to or omission from the Qur'an.
Allah has clearly and emphatically declared that He Himself was the
Protector of the Book:

Surely We have revealed the Reminder and We most surely are its
Guardian. (15:9) [^3]

In fulfillment of this promise, the Qur'an was collected in book form
in the days of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny)
himself.

Both external evidence (from the sunnah) and internal evidence (from
the Qur'an itself) have clearly established that the Prophet had left a
Book in the hands of the Muslims. As for the internal evidence, there
are at least fifty-two verses in which the Qur'an has been called a
"Book".

As for the external evidence, the famous mutawatir hadith of Thaqalayn
proves the existence of the Book during the last days of the Prophet
(peace be upon him & his progeny). The hadith is narrated in scores of
Shi'a and Sunni books with some minor variations in wordings, but the
main parts are the same everywhere. I am quoting it from Sahih Muslim,
where Zayd ibn Arqam mentions the Prophet's sermon in Ghadir Khumm:

"...And I am leaving among you two weighty things. First of them is the
Book of Allah; in it is the guidance and the light; therefore take hold
of it and adhere to it ... And (the second are) my Ahlu'l-bayt; I remind
you of Allah concerning my Ahlu 'l-bayt, I remind you of Allah
concerning my Ahlu'l-bayt, I remind you of Allah concerning my Ahlu
'l-bayt..." [^4] [Ed: Also see Hadith al-Thaqalayn: A study of its
tawatur]

There are some other traditions (apart from the Ghadir sermon) in which
the words "the Book of Allah and my traditions" have come. But the word,
"Book of Allah" is present in both versions.

This sermon of Ghadir Khumm was delivered about two and a half months
before the death of the Prophet and at that time there was a Book of
Allah which the Prophet was leaving among his ummah and exhorting them
to hold fast to it.

Then just a few days before his death, the Prophet (peace be upon him &
his progeny) said:"...Come on, I will write for you a writing (because
of which) you shall not go astray after me." But 'Umar said: 'Surely,
the Messenger of Allah is overcome by pain, and you have got the Qur'an;
the Book of Allah is sufficient for us..." [^5]

It clearly shows that the Book of Allah was in the hands of Muslims
before the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him & his progeny).

It is far-fetched to think that the word "Book" in the Qur'an, in the
sermon of the Prophet, and in the statement of 'Umar was used for
scattered pieces of paper, etc. The grand teacher of contemporary
mujtahids, Sayyid al-Khu'i has rightly said after quoting the Qur'anic
references and the hadith of Thaqalayn: "...There is a clear proof that
the Qur'an was then written and compiled, because the word 'book' is not
used for that which is retained in the memory, nor for scattered
writings on the parchments, pieces of papers and bones, except
metaphorically. But it is not right to construe any word metaphorically
unless there is an evidence in its context. The word 'book' denotes
existence of a collection and not of scattered scribbles, nor of things
which are in the memory but not written. [^6]

The enemies of Islam from very early days had hit upon a plan which
they thought would be very effective in weakening the belief in the
authenticity and originality of the Qur'an. They looked at the
prevailing condition of the Muslim world and found a ready and
flourishing market for forged ahadith. They exploited it to their utmost
advantage and began wholesale fabrication of traditions casting
aspersion on the validity of the Qur'an by imputing that there were
additions, deletions, alterations and even some mistakes in this Qur'an
which is in our hands.

This idea was and is diametrically opposed to what the Muslims, the
Shi'a and the Sunni alike, believe about the Qur'an. Shaykh Abu Ja far
as-Saduq (d. 381) writes in his Kitabu 'l-I'tiqadat:

"It is our belief that the Qur'an which Allah revealed to His Prophet
Muhammad is (the same as) the one between the two boards (daffatayn).
And it is that which is in the hands of the people, and is not greater
in extent than that."

Then he says:

"And he who asserts that we say that it is greater in extent than this
(the present text) is a liar." [^7]

Similar declarations have been made by almost all great Shi'a
mujtahids; for example, Shaykh al-Mufid (338-413), Awa'ilu l-Maqalat, p.
95; Sharif al-Murtada (355-436), Bahru 'l-Fawa'id (Tehran, 1314) p. 69;
Shaykh at-Tusi (385-408), Tafsir at-Tibyan, vol. 1 (Najaf, 1376) p. 3;
Shaykh at-Tabrasi (d. 548), Majma'u 'l-Bayan, vol. 1 (Lebanon) p. 15.

This belief has continued un-interrupted upto the present days. One may
just mention the names of Sayyid Muhsin al-Amin al-'Amili (1284-1371);
Sayyid Sharafu'd-Din al-Musawi (1290-1377); Shaykh Muhammad Husayn
Kashifu 'l-Ghita' (1295-1373); Sayyid Muhsin al-Hakim (1306- 1390);
'Allamah at-Tabataba'i (1321- 1402) Sayyid Muhammad Hadi al-Milani
(1313-1390); Sayyid Ruhullah al-Khumayni (1321 - 1409); Sayyid Abu
'l-Qasim al-Khu'i (1317-1413) and Sayyid Muhammad Rida al-Gulpaygani
(1316-1414).

I would like to give short hints on the following six aspects of this
topic, to show how the enemies of islam got the chance to create the
fitnah of tahrif and to what extent they succeeded in their
endeavours.

1. The appearance of forged ahadith in the Muslim world.
2. Confessions of some of those who indulged in this practice.
3. Examples of forged ahadith showing that hundreds, if not thousands,
of verses were deleted from the Qur'an.
4. Sunni attitude and their belief. The theory of abrogation of
recitation and its implication.
5. Shi'a attitude towards such traditions.
6. American Islam resurrected this buried topic, ostensibly to ridicule
Shi'ism and hinder Iranian efforts for establishing Islamic unity
world-wide. But what was its real motive?

Obviously the time does not allow to go into details. Therefore, I
propose only to mention briefly these topics in this talk.
