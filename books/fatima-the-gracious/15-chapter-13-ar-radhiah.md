Chapter 13: Ar-Radhiah
======================

Accepting what Allah ordains for one's self, is considered an excellent
degree of belief in Allah-Glory be to Him. Throughout her difficult
life, Lady Fatima az-Zahra (sa) was delighted with whatever Allah
Almighty ordained for her. In fact, this book specializes in discussing
the inflictions and disasters, which befell Fatima az-Zahra (sa) from
the day she was born until she was martyred at a young age. During the
difficult stages of her life, Fatima az-Zahra (sa) was content with the
fear, oppression, deprivation, poverty, sorrows and pains, which Allah
had ordained for her.

Therefore, Fatima is worthy of being included with those mentioned in
the verse:

***"To the righteous soul will be said: O (thou) soul, In (complete)
rest and satisfaction! Come back to thy Lord.--well pleased (thyself)
and well pleasing unto Him!"*** (79: 27-28)

Because she [Fatima az-Zahra (sa)] is satisfied with Allah's rewards,
and grants to her, and is satisfied with Allah's will in this world, He
has become well pleased with her.
