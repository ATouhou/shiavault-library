Lesson Forty: Mourning
======================

Imam Al-Baqir (a.s.) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلنَّياحَةُ مِنْ عَمَلِ الْجاهِلِيَّةِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Mourning is one of the deeds of the age of ignorance (one shall not
complain about the difficulties, rather he shall try to solve them).[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

This short and meaningful tradition has an outward and an inward sense.

Its outward refers to the irrelevant actions being popular at the age of
ignorance. When somebody died, mourner women were invited to lament on
his death by reciting their special songs and deceitful and false poems.
And the other meaning, which Imam Al-Baqir (a.s.) may refer to, is that
mourning and complaining for hard and difficult events and problems of
personal and social life is useless and causes waste of energy and
facilities. Instead one should spend that energy to solve the problems,
seeking a remedy by the strength of intellect and thinking as well as
continuous effort and tolerance.
