The Ninth Imam
==============

Imam Muhammad (ibn Ali) Taq (sometimes called Jaway and Ibn al-Rida)
was the son of the eighth Imam. He was born in 195/809 in Medina and
according to Shi'ite traditions was martyred in 220/835, poisoned by his
wife, the daughter of Ma'mun, at the instigation of the Abbasid caliph
Mu'tasim.

He was buried next to his grandfather, the seventh Imam, in Kazimayn.
He became Imam after the death of his father through Divine Command and
by the decree of his forefathers. At the time of the death of his father
he was in Medina. Ma'mun called him to Baghdad which was then the
capital of the caliphate and outwardly showed him much kindness.

He even gave the Imam his daughter in marriage and kept him in Baghdad.
In reality he wanted in this way to keep a close watch upon the Imam
from both outside and within his own household. The Imam spent some time
in Baghdad and then with the consent of Ma'mun set out for Medina where
he remained until Ma'mun's death. When Mu'tasim became caliph he called
the Imam back to Baghdad and, as we have seen, through the Imam's wife
had him poisoned and killed.
