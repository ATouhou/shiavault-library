Decrease in the Respect Of Ahlul Bayt From The Aspect Of The Rule Of Consensus
==============================================================================

Here are present other example that prove decrease in the respectability
of Ahlul Bayt (a.s.). It is the stand of Ahlul Sunnat scholars that two
people of other than Ahlul Bayt (S) are sufficient for quorum of
consensus. But the consensus of Ahlul Bayt (a.s.) is not acceptable
whether of two people or two hundred

Fourthly, this jurisprudence removed the belief of the infallibility of
Ahlul Bayt (a.s.) from the common people and this indirectly benefited
the non-Ahlul Bayt people. Without any doubt, this type of jurisprudence
showered untold honors on the non-Ahlul Bayt people and went to great
lengths to decrease the respectability of Ahlul Bayt (a.s.). Thus, there
is no doubt that Karbalaâ€™ was the culmination of the intrigue against
Ahlul Bayt (a.s.) that was initiated just after the demise of the Holy
Prophet (S). This continued till Imam Hasan Askari (a.s.). Rather, it
exists even after that and will remain till there remains enmity to
Ahlul Bayt (a.s.).
