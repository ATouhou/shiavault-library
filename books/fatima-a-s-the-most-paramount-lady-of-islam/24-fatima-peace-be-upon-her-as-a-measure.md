Fatima (peace be upon her) as a measure:
========================================

Scales is an instrument for measuring and the facts are assessed by it.
In materialism, for measuring goods, volume, weight, and a period of
time, the special measuring instruments are utilized. In spirituality,
measuring is possible through samples and symbols. For instance, the
level of somebody’s understanding is measured through comparison with an
intelligent person; the level of somebody’s piety is measured through
comparison with a pious person; the level of sOmmebody’s intelligence
and talent is measured through comparison with a talented and bright
person; and the level of sOmmebody’s generosity and humanity is measured
through comparison with a generous person.

Fatima (peace be upon her) is a complete measure for evaluating the
ladies’ deeds, and according to the infallible, “she is measure”.
Fatima’s spirit power, unique courage, elevated thoughts, and excellent
dispositions are all and all measures and samples. Her chastity, piety,
faith, nobility, honor, housekeeping, rearing the children, abstinence
from sublunary luxury, material and spiritual aspects and even her death
are all measures for us.

In the history of the wOmmen world, we do not know a woman like her to
be the measure and sample. All Fatima’s attributes make her more adorned
than others and give a distinguished face to her.
