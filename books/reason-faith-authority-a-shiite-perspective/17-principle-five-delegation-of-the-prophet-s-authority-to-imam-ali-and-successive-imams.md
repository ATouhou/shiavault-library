Principle Five: Delegation of the Prophet’s Authority to Imam Ali and successive Imams
======================================================================================

In the same event, the Prophet was asked by God to transfer this same
authority to Imam Ali. He was commanded to tell the people that which,
if he did not tell, was as though he had not delivered the entire
message.

“All those men and women who acknowledge me as their Master, I want them
to acknowledge (at this point he held Imam Ali's hand and lifted it high
over his head) Ali also as their Master. Ali is the Master of all those
men and women whose Master I am.”

This indicates the point of delegation of the Holy Prophet's authority
to Imam Ali by divine command.30 As soon as this announcement was made,
the following verse was revealed:

***“This day I have perfected for you, your religion and have completed
My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam to be your religion.”
(5:3)***

We also read in the Qur'an:

***“Only God is your Guardian and His Apostle and those who believe. Who
perform prayer and pay alms while they bow”. (5:55)*** 31

The Shi'a believe that the Imams who succeeded the Prophet continued the
same roles in presenting Islam (teaching and preaching), judging and
leading the society. The difference was that there was no further
revelation after the demise of the Prophet; all knowledge of Imams was
received from the Holy Prophet.
