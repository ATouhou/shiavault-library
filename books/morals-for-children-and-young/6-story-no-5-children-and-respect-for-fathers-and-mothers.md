Story no. 5: Children and respect for fathers and mothers
=========================================================

Sakina, Suhail and Hussain were seated at the side of their parents.  
 Suddenly, six year old Sakina left the place unhappily and went to the
other room.  
 Hussain who was attentive to Sakina’s gestures went after her and said
“Sakina why did you leave so suddenly?

She replied “Don’t you see that Suhail has stretched his legs in front
of father and mother?!!”  
 Hussain called Suhail and said “Didn’t you know that our father and
mother possess respect?”  
 We should sit with respect in front of them.

Yes, respect of father and mother has been mentioned with the respect of
God himself, so we should respect them very much. Yes, respect of father
