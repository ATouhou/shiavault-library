Part Two : Foroo‘ Al-deen
=========================

The Essential Principles and Practices of Islam Before beginning with
the presentation of the second part of Islam’s outstanding teachings, it
is worth mentioning that the first part of Islam’s splendid teachings;
namely Os}ool al-Deen; the fundamental principles or beliefs of Islam,
which were covered earlier – must be the belief of the individual out of
reason and conviction by investigation, for they are issues related to
thought and belief, and it is not sufficient for one to rely on and
follow others on these matters.

However, in the case of Foroo‘ al-Deen or the essential rulings and
practices of Islam that we are to discuss here, involve all aspects of
life, covering one’s every acts, deeds, and movements from before one’s
birth to after his death. Since one is generally not able to readily
attain expert knowledge in every aspect of all these acts, deeds, and
movements, and acquire their rulings from their detailed sources that
are mentioned in the four sources; namely the Noble Qur’an, the
honourable sunnah – i.e. the hadith of the prophet and the narrations of
his Ahl al-Bayt peace be upon them all – consensus, and reason,
therefore Islam has allowed one to follow a mujtahid (learned expert)
who is fully qualified for taqleed on these matters, and to refer to him
in order to make things easy for the individual concerned.

Of course Foroo‘ al-Deen are many, and so we shall mention the most
important of them which are the famous ten, and then we will elucidate
some of those that require clarification by the will of Allah. The ten
famous Foroo‘ al-Deen are as follows:

1. S{ala\> or the daily obligatory prayers,
2. S{awm or fasting,
3. Khums or the one-fifth religious duty,
4. Zaka\>h or the duty applicable to certain commodity,
5. H{ajj or pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca,
6. Jihad or striving,
7. Amr bil-Ma’roof – promoting virtue or enjoining good,
8. Nahy anil-Munkar – prohibiting evil,
9. Tawalli – aligning with Allah’s disciples,
10. Tabarri – dissociating from the enemies of Allah.

Needless to say, these ten principles, as well as other principles such
as buying, selling, marriage, divorce, punishment, compensation are
discussed in detail in our book The Manual of Islamic Law. However, some
of the important principles, which are of particular significance in the
modern times, such as human community, social order, politics, economy,
the army, the armed forces, the justice system, culture, mass media,
health, medical issues, individual and social freedoms, and suchlike are
the ones we shall discuss in this section by the will of Almighty
Allah.

**Society and the System of Islam**

There is no doubt that Islam has its own particular system for
governance and for managing the affair of society, just as there is also
no doubt that this particular Islamic system was working, whether when
fully or partially implemented, for thirteen centuries until Islamic
government fell more than half a century ago. One also hears that the
Islamic civilization was an exemplary one to the greatest extent, and
that through its just divine laws Islam guarantees to solve the world’s
problems, and if it is brought back to governance the world will become
Paradise and the people will live therein in utopia, comfort, happy, and
bliss.
So what is that system?

Is it possible for the Islamic system to come back to life during the
space and nuclear age, and during the internet and communication
revolution?

And how would Islam solve the problems if it took charge? These are
pressing questions that are worth answering. The answers that we will
give to such questions here may astonish the reader and he might think
we are talking of some utopian city.

We are of course ready to eliminate his astonishment by presenting the
Islamic the proofs and evidences for the answers given, and presenting
clear examples of the history of the pure Islamic governance, which
proves the ability of the Islamic system to come back to life, and take
charge – with total competence and excellence – for it is the only
system from amongst the systems of the world – whether in the old times,
currently, or in the future – that is able, through its divine laws, to
manage developed and progressive world with a management that will
realise its hopes and wishes, solve its problems, eliminate its crises,
eradicate what hardship it has, as well as diseases and ignorance,
delivering it to the shore of safety and security, peace and
tranquillity. This system contains all the bases for development and
progress, and all that mankind needs in this respect; politics,
economics, freedom and suchlike, outlining some of them as follows:187

**Islam and Politics**

Question: Is there politics in Islam?

187 For more details in this particular field, see from amongst the
al-Fiqh Series, the books of “The Islamic Government”, (volumes
101-102), “Politics” (volumes 105-106), “Economics” (volumes 107-108),
“Society” (vol. 109-110), “Management” (vol. 103-104), “Governance in
Islam” (vol. 99), “Freedoms” (vol. 139), and also “The New Order for the
World of Faith, Freedom, Welfare, and Peace”, “If Islam Were To Be
Established”, “Islamic System of Government”, “The Means to Awaken the
Muslims”, “The Dynamics of Change for the Salvation of the Muslims”, and
suchlike by the late Ayatollah al-Udma Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi.

Answer: Yes, Islam has the best kind of politics, and the finest kind
of management for the country and the people. Q. Is the Islamic system
of government a republic or a monarchist system?

A. It is neither a republic nor a monarchist in the conventional sense,
as found in the political dictionary of the western world today. It is a
form of consultative system, and given the consensus nature of the
system it would be correct to call it a republican, for the system of
governance in Islam is neither monarchy nor hereditary.

Q. What are the qualities of the head of the Islamic government?

A. He is a Muslim believer who has thorough understanding and expertise
in Islam. He is proficient about the worldly affairs and is empowered
with the ability not to deviate from the standards of justice in all
matters. So, whoever possesses these qualities and the majority of
people accept him, he can be the head of the government. Whenever he
looses any of these qualities he is removed from his position
immediately. However, if the people would not agree with his leadership
they have the right to change him and choose another individual who
meets the criteria.

Q. Who chooses the Islamic head of government?

A. The majority of the people do, this is of course if he is not a
ma‘s}oom who has been appointed by Almighty Allah such as the prophet or
one of the ma‘s}oom Imams peace be upon them all.

**Governance**

Q. Are there elections, referendum, voting, parliament, and
municipalities, and suchlike in the Islamic system? A. Yes, it has all
of these – and that is with respect to our time, the time of occultation
of Imam Mahdi, may Allah hasten his reappearance – but in the Islamic
format. So for example, the national assembly or parliament is to apply
and implement the general laws to whatever they are applicable but it is
not for legislation and law-making [outside the framework of Islamic
laws], since legislation and law-making is the right of Almighty Allah,
firstly, and secondly because there is no deficiency in the laws of
Islam nor is there any shortage that we need to legislate.

Islam has elucidated for us the law of everything, “even the
compensation of a scratch”, as the hadith goes188, and in another
hadith, “the h}ala\>l of Muhammad is h}ala\>l until the day of
judgement, and his h}ara\>m is h}ara\>m until the day of judgement”189.
Therefore, it is not permissible for anyone to prescribe anything as
h}ala\>l or h}ara\>m, and the only right there is the freedom in
implementation, for example Islam has decreed that trading is the right
of the people to engage in, thus it is not permissible for the
parliament to change or modify this right by making it exclusive or the
right of the government only.

On the other hand, as Islam has not prescribed the flow of traffic to
be on the right or left, therefore it is for the parliament to decide on
which side it should be, for Islam has in general enjoined to order and
prevention of disorder and anarchy, and thus to decide for the traffic
to be on the right, say, is in accordance with the order which Islam has
promoted and legislated, and the same goes with the rest of the
issues.

Q: Why do we then see shortfalls and deficiencies, problems, and
man-made legislation in Islamic countries?
A: These countries are Islamic by name and slogan only and nothing more
than that. Almighty Allah has said,

188 al-Ka\>fi, vol. 1, p238.
189 al-Ka\>fi, vol. 2, p17.

.And whoever turns away from My Message, verily for him is a life
narrowed down and wretched and on the Day of Judgment We shall raise him
blind..190

So he who begins to legislate and makes laws himself, and turns away
from the laws of Allah, he shall narrow down and straiten his life and
his sustenance – just as life is narrowed down and straitened for the
Islamic countries today – and he shall have humiliation and hell fire in
the hereafter.

**Duties of the Islamic Government**

Q. What are the duties and tasks of Islamic Government towards the
nation?

A. Its duty is to uphold justice amongst the people, inside and outside
the country, and to push life forward towards progress, the provision of
sustenance and wealth, to educate and bring about awareness, and to
protect their security and stability.

Q. What laws does the Islamic government adhere to?
A. The laws that are derived from the Qur’an, the sunnah191, consensus,
and reason.

Q. Who gives these laws the final shape for practical purposes?

A. The just fuqaha’ – i.e. the learned scholars of Islamic law and
jurisprudence who do not deviate from the standards of justice – from
amongst the maraje’ who are expert in both religious and current
affairs, to whom the people refer in taqleed.

Q. Are political parties recognised in Islam?
A. There is no objection to [political] parties that [operate] under
the supervision of the scholar maraje’ if this is in aid of forming a
190 The Holy Qur’an, T{aha (20): 124.

191 Needless to say the sunnah is the hadith of the prophet and the
narrations of his Ahl al-Bayt peace be upon them all, as mentioned at
the outset of Part Two.

parliament that implements and enforces the laws. However, as for
parties that aim to form a legislative parliament [passing manmade laws
contrary to the Islamic law], then there is no room for them in Islam,
for legislation is specific only to Almighty Allah.192

**The Islamic Economy**

Q. Is there a system of economy in Islam?
A. Yes and it is the best system the world has ever known.

Q. Is the system of economy of Islam capitalist, socialist, communist
or distributive?

A. It is none of the above in the conventional sense.

Q. What is then the Islamic economy?
A. The Islamic economy respects private ownership and sanctions it
provided that earnings are not obtained through unlawful means and that
all income liabilities are paid.

Q. What are the government’s sources of income?
A. They are the obligatory duties that Islam has sanctioned. Q. What
are the obligatory duties?

A. There are four: Khums, Zakah, Khiraj, and Jizyah.

**Sources of income in Islam**

Q. Can you explain these duties that are the sources of income in Islam
as you have mentioned?

A.

Khums The Khums is the 20% rate the just ruler levies on all 192 In
Islam a parliament may address new issues and developments and devise
rules and regulations that are based on Islamic principles, and provided
that they do not breach the framework of Islamic law. There are texts
and principles in Islam that form the basis of those new rules. There is
also no objection to the political parties that strive for the
reconstruction and development of the country, if there is no deviation
from the shari’ah.

permissible profits, minerals, found treasures, pearls and other
artefacts from the sea, the earnings that are mixed with doubtful ones,
the spoils of the battlefield and some categories of land.

Zakah Zakah is the sum the just ruler takes with rates ranging from 1%
to 2.5% levied on sheep, cows, camels, gold, silver, raisins, date,
barley, and wheat when each one of these items are over certain
threshold, as detailed in fiqh texts.

Khiraj Khiraj is the sum the just ruler acquires from farmers [working
on] conquered land.

Jizyah Jizyah is the sum the just ruler obtains from non- Muslims [the
Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians and other non-believers] living in the
Islamic State for their dhimmi193 status and the protection they attain.
Q. Is there a banking system in Islam?

A. Yes but without usury – for usury in Islam constitutes a declaration
of war against Allah and His Messenger – and provided that all the
banking laws comply with the laws of Islam. The expenses of its
employees are met from various incomes of the bank and if they were
insufficient then Bayt-ul-Ma\>l (the Treasury) would pay.194

Q. Would the Islamic government take other monies from the people, like
the various categories of taxes there are today?

A. No. The Islamic government has – absolutely – no right to collect
any taxes other than the four mentioned. In the hadith we have, “he who
takes money from another without his consent, on the day of Judgement
the Almighty Allah will take, for every dirham, seven hundred prayers
from amongst his accepted s}ala\>h and gives them to the owner of the
money”.

193 dhimmi means ‘being the responsibility of’ the Islamic State.
194 This is of course after careful study of the bank’s management is
conducted.

**Bayt-ul-Mal of the Muslims**

Q. What would the Islamic government do with the money it receives from
the public?

A. In the structure of the Islamic government there is the department
called the Bayt-ul-Mal (which is the equivalent of the Treasury
Department) where all the collected funds are managed, and it is formed
to meet the needs of the Muslims. The government uses the Bayt-ul-Mal to
pay for the expenses of all the construction, development, reforms,
projects, etc. in the country. It also uses the Bayt-ul-Mal to help the
needy run their affairs so that there no destitute left in the society,
like helping people to get married, start a business, buy a house, treat
an illness, travelling for necessity or if one is left without money
while on a journey, or for education that needs money, and suchlike, if
he could prove - in a simple way, like providing evidence or witness, or
even swearing on oath - his needs, then the treasury would provide him
assistance according to his need and status. In this way there will be
absolutely no destitute left without help under the Islamic system of
government.

Q. Will those four categories of taxes be enough for all such
expenses?

A. Yes, they will be enough in addition to the government’s other
income from its tenements and possessions known as al-Anfa \> l195

195 al-Anfal, literally meaning “the extras”, refers to any gains
obtained by the prophet without any contribution from the Muslims, or
given to him [as gift], as well as ‘estates’ or natural lands and
resources such as the mountain peaks and valley beds. They belong to
Allah and the prophet, and the 12 appointed imams after him. The Prophet
– and the imams – deal with these as appropriate, for the benefits of
the Muslims. Al-Tahdheeb, by Sheikh al-T{ousi, vol. 4, p 132. The holy
Qur’an, al-Anfa\>l (8): 1.

or ‘Estates’, and the hadith states, “if they [the Anfa\>l] were not
enough then Almighty Allah would increase their amount”.196 Minimisation
in departments and civil servants Q. How will the said sources of income
be enough, given their relatively small amount, when we see the massive
taxes today are still not enough to meet the needs?

A. They will be enough given the government’s low overheads and
trustworthiness of those in charge, and relegating the tasks and affairs
to the people. For example the number of government employees in the
Islamic government is very small, as there is no need for many of the
government departments [and their associated army of civil servants] in
the Islamic government.

Under an Islamic system of government, the public will undertake many
of the tasks executed by today’s governments, and what remains in
responsibility of the government will be minimal and this will be
discharge of in the shortest time and in the simplest way. Needless to
say, when the number of civil servants is reduced to a minimum,
bureaucracy is eradicated, the affairs of the people are left to the
people, and those in charge are trustworthy, then expenses will be
reduced and more money will available.197

Q. Is there any pension scheme in Islam?

196 Provided of course there is no injustice to the right of others, as
well as the future generations.

197 It was reported in the mass media that one of the prominent western
countries suffered from huge budget deficit of millions of dollars, but
it managed to reverse the tide through reducing the number of its civil
servants in a few of years. In the process it managed to have a budget
surplus of millions of dollars; using it for the interest of its people
and its economy. Needless to say, minimal number of civil servants is
what Islam has instructed to and Allah has enjoined upon the Islamic
government, but it is rather unfortunate that the Muslims abandon the
teachings of their Islam while the non-Muslims uphold them, thus
benefiting from them and achieving progress, prosperity, and leadership,
and instead we go backwards and attain humiliation.

A. If one is needy and not able to earn he receives help for what he
needs, not a fixed amount, as it is the norm in governments today.

**Social Security in Islam**

Q: Is there social security in Islam?

A: Yes, the best kind of social security and its most supreme.

Q: Can you outline some aspects of the social security in Islam?

A: Social security in Islam is in the best form there is, and since
Islam’s stance is humanitarian, this security is in harmony with the
human nature in its most graceful sense. Indeed history does not record
prior to Islam, nor do the civilisations that came after Islam until
today a social security system as thorough as the social security in
Islam.

**Examples of the Islamic Social Security**

The social security in Islam declares the following:

1. Whoever dies and leaves debts behind, or if he leave a family behind
with no one taking care of them, it is the responsibility of the leader
of the Muslims to pay his debt, just as it is his responsibility to take
care of his family,199

2. Whoever dies and leaves wealth behind, all of the wealth goes to his
heirs,200

198 This section of “Social Security in Islam” is taken from the book
“Politics from Islamic Standpoint” by Ayatollah Udma\> Sayyid S{a\>diq
Shirazi, which was first published in 1970.

199 This is on the basis of the Prophet Muhammad’s teaching who said,
“Whoever dies and leaves debts behind, or if he leaves a family behind
[who cannot fend for themselves, then they should come to me and this is
my responsibility”. 200 This is based on a prophetic hadith that states
the above.

3. This is in addition to the monetary services that are provided –
from Bayt al-Ma\>l – to all members of the community to meet their basic
needs and facilitate a happy life for them.

Now, with all that, is there a social security like the one in Islam in
the most civilised states? Certainly not. Rather, the ja\>hili systems
before Islam, and also the modern civilised systems today impose heavy
taxes on inheritance, just as they do not pay the debt of anyone, nor
take care of his family. As an example the following are mentioned.

**Example One**

In Islamic texts there are great amount that emphasises on the
aforementioned system of Islamic social security, and if this points to
anything it points to the extent of Islam’s care and concern on
emphasising on this great social and humanitarian issue. This matter is
repeatedly narrated from the prophet of Islam and imams of the purified
progeny, peace be upon them.

It is reported from Imam Ja’far ibn Muhammad al-S{a\>diq – the sixth
imam of the Ahl al-Bayt, the purified progeny – that Allah’s messenger
said, “I have more authority over every believer than he has over
himself201, and Ali has more authority over him after me.” It was said
to him, “What does that mean?” the imam said, “in relation to the speech
of the prophet who said, “he who [dies and] leaves behind a debt, or a
family, then it is my responsibility, and he who leaves behind
inheritance then it is his heirs””.202

**Example Two**

Ali ibn Ibrahim in his tafseer, or commentary on the Qur’an, reports,
through his chain of narrators, from Allah’s messenger 201 This is in
reference to declaration by the Almighty who states .The Prophet has
more authority over the believers than they have over themselves.. The
holy Qur’an (33): 6.

202 Al-Ka\>fi, vol.1, p406, Wasa\>’el al-Shi‘ah, vol.18, p337,
Mostadrak al-Wasa\>’el, vol.13, p400, etc.

who used to say, “A debtor would not go with his debt to one of the
Muslim governors, explaining to the governor his difficulty [in repaying
his debt], except that the debtor will be released from the burden of
his debt, and his debt will be that of the governor of the Muslims in
whose hands are the funds of the Muslims”203.

After narrating this hadith from Allah’s messenger, Imam Sadiq said,
“And the reason for the majority of the Jews converting to Islam was
none other than this speech of Allah’s messenger, for they felt secure
about their selves and their families”.204

**Example Three**

Shaykh al-Mofid narrated in his lectures from Imam S{a\>diq peace be
upon him who used to say, “The Prophet ascended the pulpit, and the
colour of his cheeks changed, then he turned to the people and said, “O
gathering of the Muslims! Indeed [the time] I was sent and [that of] the
Hour are like these two205 . . . until he said, O people! Whoever leaves
wealth behind, it is for his family and for his heirs, and he who leaves
a progeny or a family [who cannot fend for themselves], then it is my
responsibility, and [they should come] to me””.206

He also narrated from Imam S{a\>diq peace be upon him who said, “he who
demanded money from a man who had borrowed it [from him], who had not
used it in extravagance, or in sinning, and it has become difficult for
him to pay it back, the claimant of the money should give him the chance
until Allah provides him with the money so that he could repay it, and
if there were a just governing imam (i.e. leader), then it is imperative
for him to pay the debt of the debtor, on the basis of the speech of
Allah’s messenger; “he 203 Mostadrak al-Wasa\>’el, vol.13, p400, and
Tafseer al-Qummi, vol.1, p94 204 Al-Ka\>fi, vol.1, p406.

205 . . . pointing his middle and forefinger, i.e. just as the lengths
of the two fingers are close, the times of the mission of the prophet
and the day of resurrection are relatively close. 206 Mostadrak
al-Wasa’el, vol.13, p399

who leaves a wealth behind it is for his heirs, and he who leaves debt
or a progeny behind, then it is my responsibility and [they should come]
to me”, and it is the responsibility of the imam (i.e. the leader)
whatever the Prophet, peace be upon him and his purified progeny, had
guaranteed”.207

**Example Four**

By virtue of its system in the Bayt al-Ma\>l of the Muslims, and the
Islamic social security, Islam made out of the Islamic State, which was
of distant horizons, and expansive lands - covering over threequarters
of the planet – and of great populous, a rich nation where poverty was
made history.

Shaykh H{urr al-‘Ameli reports in his famous book Wasa’el al- Shi‘ah
the following incident:

Amir al-Mo’mineen Imam Ali peace be upon him was walking in the streets
of Kufah – his capital city – when he noticed a man begging the people.
He was greatly shocked to see that and he turned to those around him and
said “What is this?!” They replied, “He is an old Christian man, he is
unable to work, he does not have the money to make ends meet, and so he
is begging”.

Imam Ali angrily said, “You used him in his youth until he grew old,
and now that he is old you have abandoned him?!” So Imam Ali ordered
that a wage be assigned from the Bayt al- Ma\>l of the Muslims for that
Christian man to live on so long as he alive.208

This case indicates that poverty has no place in the Islamic State,
such that if Amir al-Mo’mineen Imam Ali see one destitute is shocked,
and he considers this phenomenon as unnatural, which 207 Mostadrak
al-Wasa\>’el, vol.13, p400 208 Wasa’el al-Shi‘ah, vol.15, p66

has no harmony with the Muslim society and the Islamic system, and then
he orders for a salary to be assigned for him to live in comfort, even
though he is Christian and does not practice Islam, so that in the
Islamic State there is not even one case of poverty and destitution, and
so that the world, including the Muslims, realise that the Islamic
government eradicates poverty, and improves the state of the poor – not
for the Muslims only, but it eliminates poverty even for the non-Muslims
so long as they are under the care of the Islamic government.

**Example Five**

Shaykh al-Kulayni narrates that “When Imam Ali defeated T{alh}ah and
Zubair – in the battle of Camel and his battle with the Na\>ketheen (The
Renegades) – the defeated soldiers fled the scene in various directions
and they passed by a pregnant woman, who was terrified by their
presence, such she miscarried, and the foetus suffered distress and died
shortly afterwards, and after a while the woman also died. Imam Ali and
his companions passed by the road where the woman and her child laid
dead, and he enquired about the matter. They said that she was pregnant
and she was terrified and distressed when she saw the fleeing [of the
soldiers]. He asked who died first. He was told that the child died
before the mother.

So Imam Ali called for her husband, the father of the dead child. He
gave him as the heir of his son one-third of the blood money, and he
also gave his mother as the heir one-third of the blood money. Then he
gave the husband as the heir of his wife half of the blood money that
she gained from her son, and gave the rest to the relatives of the dead
woman. Then he gave the husband from his dead wife’s blood money
one-half, which is 2,500 dirham, and he gave the other half to the
relatives of the dead woman, for she had no other offspring other than
the one she miscarried when she was distressed. Imam Ali gave all that
from the Treasury (Bayt al- Ma\>l) of the city of Bas}rah.209

This is how Islam made the Bayt al-Mal of the Muslims for the benefit
of the Muslims and to meet their needs, and give their rights, for – as
given in the honourable hadith – “the right of a Muslim person is not
wasted” and “the blood of a Muslim person does not go in vain”210, and
in this way it facilitates welfare and happiness for the nation under
its just social security.
