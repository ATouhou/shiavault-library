Expressing Your Needs
=====================

**Expressing Your Needs الإحتياجات**

1. Express your needs to whomever you wish and (you will) become his
captive.

> 1ـ إحْتَجْ إلى مَنْ شِئْتَ وَكُنْ (تَـكُنْ) أسِيْـرَهُ.

2. When you express your needs to someone, you abase yourself before
him.

> 2ـ مَنِ احْتَجْتَ إلَيْهِ هُنْتَ عَلَيْهِ.

3. One who seeks his needs from you, his obedience to you will be to the
extent of his need from you.

> 3ـ مَنِ احْتاجَ إلَيْكَ كانَتْ طاعَتُهُ لَكَ بِقَدْرِ حاجَتِهِ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إلَيْكَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

4. When someone turns to you with his needs, it becomes obligatory upon
you to help him.

> 4ـ مَنِ احْتاجَ إلَيْكَ وَجَبَ إسْعافُهُ عَلَيْكَ.
