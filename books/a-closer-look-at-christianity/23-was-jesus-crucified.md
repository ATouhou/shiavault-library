Was Jesus crucified?
====================

No. Jesus (P.B.U.H.) was raised to God.

On the night that Jesus was supposed to be taken up by God he called the
12 apostles for a meeting. He advised them, and told them of what he
wanted from them. Then he asked if one of them would volunteer to take
his place (form) after he left. God would then make that person look
like Jesus. That apostle would have to endure killing, and crucifixion
by the Jews, and in return he would be in the same level in paradise as
Jesus.

One of the apostles agreed to sacrifice himself, and Jesus was taken up
from one of the corners of the house while the apostles were watching.
When the Jews came looking for Jesus, God made the volunteer look like
him, the Jews took him, and crucified him.
