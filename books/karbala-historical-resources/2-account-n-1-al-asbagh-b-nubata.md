Account N. 1 : Al-asbagh B. Nubata
==================================

Al-Asbagh b. Nubata is accredited with the first known account of the
martyrdom of the Imam al-Husayn.

He was a prominent member of the Shi’i community who came from Kufa. It
is claimed that he was in charge of the shurta in Kufa for the Imam
\`Ali. He seems to have lived well into the second half of the 1st
century. All and was contemporary with the events of the
martyrdom[^10].

It seems that little or nothing of his work survives. However, Ibn
al-Kalbi (in al-Tabaris version of his account) and al-Mada'ini (as
reported by Abu al-Faraj) give reports emanating from his son al-Qasim.
These may, in fact, belong to his father's book.

The account from Ibn al-Kalbi tells how when the Imam's camp was
overrun, he attempted to reach the water and was stopped by a tribesman
leading a group of his tribe. The Imam al-Husayn calls on God to make
him thirsty, and the tribesman's retort is to shoot an arrow into his
throat. The Imam catches the blood with his hands after pulling the
arrow out. The account then goes on to describe how that man suffered
from an illness so that water would not quench his thirst, and
eventually the amount he drank of it killed him[^11].

The second report tells of the sufferings of the killer of al-‘Abbas b.
Ali. This killer dreamed of being flung into hell, so that every night
he woke up screaming[^12].
