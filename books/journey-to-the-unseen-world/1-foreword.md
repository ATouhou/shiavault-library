Foreword
========

This picture book contains an abridged text of the original book by
Hujjatul Islam Najafi Quchani. This was prepared as an easy reader for
all age groups. However, it is strongly suggested that the youth and the
older readers also study the original book which makes very interesting
reading and explains in detail various issues, discussions and
circumstances of Barzakh in detail (in the light of Qur'an and Ahadith)
which was beyond the scope of this picture book.

Please note, the figures drawn in this book are from the artist's
imagination and do not bear any resemblance to the supernatural beings.

Your ideas and suggestions for improvement of this book are most welcome
and will definitely be considered for inclusion in the next edition.
