Excellence of the Month of Ramadan
----------------------------------

The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said: O' People!
Surely, the month of God has approached you. This month that, in the
eyes of Allah, is the most virtuous of the months. Its days are the best
of the days and its nights, the best of the nights and its moments, the
best of the moments.*Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 96, pg. 356*
