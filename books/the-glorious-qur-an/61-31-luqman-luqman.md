31: Luqman (luqman)
===================

This chapter was revealed after (Drawn up in) Ranks 37 and before Sheba
34.

it consists of four sections which embrace 34 Meccan verses (except that
the poem on "God's Words " in section iii dates from a later period in
Madina).

Among the Arabs Luqman was a spiritual associate and possible
grandnephew of the Old Testament prophet Job, and similar to the
fable-teller and wise man of Greece called Aesop. He is in fact the
traditional Arab sage who fills much the same place in Arab folklore as
Aesop (OR the Ethiopian \`) did among the Greeks.

From now on the chapters become shorter. This one is full of fine
thoughts, including a Polonius-style speech to the wiseman's son.
Towards the end, it also has two hymns, one on God's Words " (III) and
the other on God the All-Knowing " (IV).
