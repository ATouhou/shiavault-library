The Peaceful Journey To the Secure Land
=======================================

"And when Ibrahim said: My Lord! Make this city secure, wad sai'e me
wad my sons from worshipping idols." Holy Qur'an (14:35)

Allah made a secure land for the people, and a place for peace. Its
remembrance fills people with security and calm. Its rites widely spread
on earth peace and deep respect for life. Within man the incentives for
vice and aggression diminish, and also those impulses which call him to
unjustly shed blood and transgress the limits set by Allah. It was so
heinous a behaviour that the angels wondered before the creation of man:
How can man be qualified to be the viceroy of Allah on earth when he
makes mischief on earth and sheds blood.

"Will You place on it one who will corrupt therein and shed blood,
while we extol Your glory wad sanctify You?" Holy Qur'an (2:30)

Is it not sufficient for him to be doomed to death and nonexistence
that he holds such criminal tendencies? Is it not fair that he who
celebrates the praise of Allah and extols His holiness is qualified to
inhabit the earth, respect life, and Allah's will and wisdom?

For the purpose of completely wiping this crime off the face of the
earth and obliviating it, Islam plants in the Muslim who performs Hajj
an inclination to call for security and peace. Its growth inculcates in
him the percept of the holiness of life, so that he perceives that
nobody deserves

[ 8 ]

to live except he who respects life. Those who humbly celebrate the
praise of Allah, who know Him are qualified to inhabit the earth..

The pilgrim finds the rites of Hajj an enlightenment urging him to
respect life, practiced and deeply felt in the secure land of Mecca; the
land of security and peace. So, Allah has made the Sacred House and the
sacred city (Mecca) a pilgrimage for people, and a secure place towards
which the fearing souls resort. Near it, the hearts that have lost the
delectation of life find refuge.

Not only worldly fears dissipate in the Sacred House, but sins are also
shed. It is the place where one repents returning to his Creator,
winning His remission. In the Qur'an, many verses emphasize the security
and sanctity of the Sacred House. Words like "security and "haram are
repeatedly mentioned, to show man the value of his life Thus man is
disillusioned from fear, his greatest complex, and the misadventure that
follows him everywhere:

"So let them serve the Lord of this House, Who feeds them against
hunger and gives them security against fear". Holy Qur'an (106:3-4)

"And when Ibrahim said: My Lord, make this city secure, and save me and
my sons from worshipping idols." Holy Qur'an (14:35)

"Therein are clear signs - the station of Ibrahim, and whoever enters
it is secure." Holy Qur'an (3:97)

"And We made the House (the Ka'ba in Mecca) a resort and a sanctuary
for the people.." Holy Qur'an (2:125)

"I swear by the fig and olive, And mount Sinai. And this city made
secure." Holy Qur'an (95:1-3)

"I am commanded only that I should serve the Lord of this city: Who has
made it sacred, and His are all things, and I am commanded that I should
be the first of those who submit." Holy Qur'an (27:91)

[ 9 ]

"Allah has made the Ka'ba, the Sacred House, as livelihood for people,
and the sacred month." Holy Qur'an (5:97)

"And forbidden to you is the game of the land, so long as you are on
pilgrimage." Holy Qur'an (5:96)

"0 you who believe, violate not Allah's rites, nor the sacred month."
Holy Qur'an (5:2)

The above cited texts are by no means the only ones referring to the
security, peace, holiness and respect of life, rather, these are only a
few of the Qur'anic verse mentioning the holiness of the Sacred House
(Ka'ba), the sacred land (Mecca), and the sacred month (the pilgrimage
month). They emphasize forbiddance of such aspects of Hajj as the
killing of animals or hunting them,

cutting trees or shrubs growing in the sanctum sanctorum, killing any
living thing, including pests like insects and reptiles, as long as they
are on pilgrimage. By so doing, Islam aims at implanting within man
respect of security, love of peace, and save him from mischief, crime
and the shedding of blood.

Hajj is genuinely a peaceful trip to the city of security and peace. It
is a journey through which the pilgrim feels the value of security in
himself and the community. Thus, he becomes aware of the Omnipresence of
his Creator Who made this sacred place a secure one. In it, his self
feels calm. He could seek refuge Allah's wrath by hoping for His
remission, feeling His ever-close mercy, and entering under His
protection. The pilgrim returns ready to repent, and plans a new phase
of his life.

How beautiful is the discernment of this truth by Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq
(a.s.) when he addresses the pilgrims by saying:

"And move into Allah's security, His shade and protection, His help to
you to attain your goal of entering the sanctuary, and entering the
House while deeply knowing the greatness of its owner; His Highness and
Omnipotence."4


**Hajj As Worship**

Hajj is a bodily and spiritual journey. It is man's migration towards
Allah's grace and pleasure.

[ 10 ]

It is the abandonment of one's relatives, wealth, and wordily comforts,
and enduring a host of difficulties, troubles and hardships for the
Creator's sake.
"And proclaim among people the pilgrimage; they will come to you on
foot and on every lean camel, coming from every remote path." Holy
Qur'an (22:27)

Hajj is a form of a worship, to which several factors intertwine.

Physical and material, spiritual and emotional. Hajj, therefore, is a
physical and material form of worship in which the worshipper gives of
himself both physically and materially and endures hardships and
troubles in the way of Allah, demonstrating his pure pristine servitude
to Allah and his independence from any power other than Him. This pure
goal of Hajj is the goal of any worship in Islam that is to be for the
sake of Allah alone, regardless of any existing power other than Him. It
is the utmost goal of man's worship. Man's conscience completely awakens
and man is rendered, purified and cleansed of all evil and vice,
provided sincerity of intention is involved.

For this aim, Hajj is ordained and the Holy Our'an regards it as
Allah's right over His servants:

"â€¦it is the duly of mankind towards Allah to make the pilgrimage to the
House, whoever can afford the way there;..." Holy Qur'an (3:97)

Hajj is a main pillar of religion, and a mainstay of faith. Traditions
and texts reported from the Prophet (s.a.w.) and his pure progeny
(a.s.), refer to the significance of Hajj. It is reported that Prophet
Muhammad (s.a.w.) said: "Prayer was not ordained, Hajj and Tawaf were
not made incumbent on the faithful, and rites were not conveyed to man,
but to remember Allah."

And he (s.a.w.) also said:

"The people who perform the Hajj and Ummrah are the guests of Allah.
Allah grants them whatever they ask Him, accepts their prayers, and
compensates them for their expenditures."
Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (a.s.) is reported to have said:

"So long as the Ka' ba is secure, so is the religion" 5 And he (a.s.)
also said:

"If one should leave off Hajj, when he is capable of performing it,
with no legitimate excuse, then he has neglected an Islamic rite." 6

[ 11 ]

Islam gives Hajj primary attention. It goes to the point of granting
the Islamic state the authority of sending a number of Muslims to Mecca,
even if it is done by force, should all of them decline to perform it.
It is a bid to keep Islam's religious rites fresh and dynamic. In case
the pilgrims are unable to attend the journey, the Islamic state is
responsible to pay for traveling expenses to Mecca for performing this
congregational worship.

Imam Ja'far bin Muhammad al-Sadiq (a.s.) is reported to have said:

"Should all the people abandon Hajj, the governor is authorized to
oblige them to perform it. Should they give up performing pilgrimage to
the tomb of the Prophet (s.a.w.), the governor is authorized to order
them to do so, if they are penniless, he should pay them from the
treasury."7

It was reported from Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (a.s.):

"If anyone of you had amounts of gold as huge as Abu-Qubais (a mountain
in Arabia) and spent it in the way of Allah, its reward would never be
equal to the reward of Hajj (from Allah), A dirham (an Arabic currency
denomination) disbursed by the pilgrim is worth 2000 dirhams in the way
of Allah."

He (a.s.) is also reported to have said:

"Hajj is the jihad (holy struggle for the sake of Allah) of the weak."
He (a.s.) further said:

"He who is not prevented from the Hajj by an obvious necessity, a
tyrannical ruler or a disease which confines him (or her) at home and
dies without having performed the Hajj, might as well die a Jew or a
Christian."


**Values and Meaning in Hajj's Rites**

Hajj is a collection of rites and observances. It is a number of
actions and recitations. They are all combined to be performed within a
certain time and place, the result is worship, and an enlightening
action conducive to the building up of the Muslim character. It
effectively rebuilds the personality, corrects its course in life, and
focuses its direction toward Allah.

Hajj, in its general formula of certain devotions and prayers recited
by the pilgrim, inspires the soul with spiritually sublime feelings. The
pilgrim then realizes the grandeur of his undertaking and the greatness
of humbleness and servitude to Allah. It inculcates into the soul the
highest of morals, and leads it to righteousness, and benign
behaviour.

Every action, word, and prayer during Hajj is a symbol that inspires
the soul with a vivid feeling and encompasses a secret and an
objective.

[ 12 ]

Ihram (donning the pilgrim's garb). Talbiyah (the saying of labbaika
Alahumma labbaik), Tawaf (circumambulation), Sa'y (walking to and fro
between the hills of Safa and Marwah), Wuquf (staying at Arafat)...etc,
all of these are meaningful actions and feelings with deep meanings that
the pilgrim experiences spiritually.

Hence, the genuine value of Hajj, and its reforming effects on the soul
and behaviour does not lie in mechanically routine practice, devoid of
any meaning or value beyond what is seen, but in the awareness of the
pilgrim and his spiritual and ideological awareness of every action he
practices, every call he makes and in every prayer he reiterates.
Otherwise, the pilgrim is not but a tourist, idly wandering around a
historic place. He achieves none of the goals of Hajj and his soul
remains untouched.

How deep was the awareness of the pious to the implications and goals
of Hajj! How excellent was their depiction of Hajj, because they lived
it a deeply effective truth within themselves, and a symbolic language
expressing their deep feelings.

Let us take an exemplary picture for this deep understanding of the
implications of Hajj. Herein Imam Ali bin al-Husain (al-Sajjad) (a.s.)
describes Hajj, discloses its symbolic implications, and the
inspirational meaning of each devotional rite (deed) during Hajj. The
reader will understand from the explanation of the Imam that such rites
are designed to accommodate the aims of Islam and demonstrate its goals
in symbolic and exact way. The pilgrim practices these rites within the
greatest gathering of people assembled for worshipping and standing
under the shadow of the greatness of Allah, the Almighty.

It is reported that when Imam Zain al-Abideen (a.s.) returned from
Hajj, he was welcomed back by al-Shibli. The Imam asked Shibli, 0,
Shibli, have you performed the Hajj?"

And Shibli replied."Yes, 0 Holy Imam."

The Imam asked, When you were about to remove your clothes and wear the
Ihram, what was your intention during those exciting moments? Did you
avoid absolutely all the things that must be avoided and that which is
inferior to Almighty Allah?" Shibli replied: "No."

He then asked, Did you say Labbaik' with full knowledge and great
respect? Did you hear the command of Allah and obey as Ibrahim did?"

He replied, "No."

Imam: While you were in Arafat, standing so close to Almighty Allah,
did you have a chance to know Him? Were you not eager to grasp a bit of
knowledge?'

Shibli: "No."

[ 13 ]

Imam: When you entered the Ka'ba, as the people of the cave' had done,
did you deny your self-centeredness? Did you fear the punishment of the
Hereafter?'

Shibli: "No."

Imam then asked him, When you shot the idols, did you think of them as
evil? Did you then avoid all wrong deeds?" Shibli: "No."

"When you offered the sacrifice, did you feed a hungry person or an
orphan? Did you first think of Allah? Did you then kill your
selfishness?"

Shibli: "No."

"When you stood in Ibrahim' s position, did you rely absolutely on
Allah sincerely and with strong faith?" Shibli: "No."

"While you circumambulated and made the Tawaf of the Ka' ba, were you
reminded of all the angels who constantly circumambulate this world?"

Shibli: "No."

"During your Sa'y, while you were running between Safa and Marwah, were
you sanctified and purified?" Shibli: "No."

"Now that you have returned from Mecca, are you homesick for the Ka' ba
? Did you bury yourself' there? Are you impatient to return?"

Shibli replied, "No. Of whatever you have asked me so far, I have
understood nothing!" Then the Imam said, "0 friend, you have not
performed the Hajj! And you have not obeyed Allah! You went to Mecca and
visited the Ku' ba, but when you decide to return to Hajj again, by to
do as I have instructed you"8
