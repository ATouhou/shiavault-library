Story no. 69: Hami at the table.
================================

Whenever the family was called down to meals and the children sat at the
table, Hami only ate from the centre of the bread and did not eat the
corners.  
 As a result, much bread was wasted.  
 One day, one of Hami’s brothers said to him “Hami, do you know that
wastage is an action that is against the morals of Islam?”  
 And if we want we can be content with little and avoid wasting money.  
 This is also a law of our countries.
