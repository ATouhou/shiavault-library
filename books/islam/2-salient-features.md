Salient Features
================

**In the Name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful**

Now let us begin with the salient features of this faith. My sect, like
other sects of Islam, consists of some beliefs and some religious
obligations. Its social life is based upon some well-defined ethical
patterns. It has fully developed civil as well as criminal laws. All
these aspects of religion are based upon the Holy Qur'an (The Book of
Almighty Allah) and the Traditions of the Holy Prophet and Imams.

Every religion has a history; its present cannot be separated from its
past; and its past influences its present trend of thinking. You will
agree with me that it is not possible to deal with all these aspects of
Shi'ah Ithna \`Ashari sect in one lecture. So, with your permission, I
will limit this discussion to the beliefs in particular.

In our terminology the faith is called the \`Root' (usul) of the
religion, and the religious performances are named the \`Branches'
(furu') of religion. These terms are very significant because they show
the relation between \`Faith' and \`Deeds,' from our point of view. As
no tree can survive without its root, so no prayer can be said to be
alive without faith. And, as no tree can bear fruits without branches,
so no faith can be of much help without good deeds.

The Roots of our Religion are Five:

1. Tawhid (Unity of God)  
 2. \`Adl (Justice of God)  
 3. Nubuwwah (Prophethood)  
 4. Imamah or Imamate (Successorship of  
 the Prophet)  
 5. Qiyamah (Day of Judgment)
