Preface
=======

It is a recognized fact that relating of stories is one of the best
venues of making think and reform their ideas. And those true stories of
important events in the past afford opportunities to readers not only to
reform their ways of thinking but also uplift their moral standards.

The Holy Qur'an tells us about the prophets who were asked to relate to
their people stories of past events (ref: 7:176) so that they may think.
Parables are also mentioned in the Holy Book so as to warn people
against pitfalls in their ways of life as weel as to provide examples of
virtue and vice. The aim has been to bid people to do good and forbid
them from doing bad.

I have endeavoured in this booklet to relate stories extracted from the
past history, adding explanatory notes and relevant quatations form the
Holy Qur'an and ahadith.

It is hoped that this will serve to acquaint readers to the true
Islamic values as well as in uplifting moral standards where needed. It
is also aimed at helping lecturers in schools and in public
gatherings.

Readers are requested to accord due respect to this booklet in view of
the Holy quatations contained in therein. Also to help us in circulating
it as as to spread the benefit as widely as possible.
