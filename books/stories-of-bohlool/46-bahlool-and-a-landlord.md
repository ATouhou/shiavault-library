Bahlool and a Landlord
======================

They say that one time Bahlool went to Basra. Since he had no
acquaintances in this city, he rented a room for a few days. That room
was so old and damaged that it started creaking at the slightest breeze.

Bahlool went to the landlord and said, “The room you gave me is very
dangerous because its ceiling and walls start creaking at the slightest
breeze.”

The landlord liked joking. He said, “There's nothing wrong. You know
that all creations timely praise Allah and recite Tasbeeh. This is the
room's praise and Tasbeeh.”

Bahlool replied, “That is true, but after praising and glorifying Allah,
the creations lastly do Sajdah. That is why, from fear of this room's
prostration, I want to leave as soon as I can.”
