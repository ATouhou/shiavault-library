Lesson One Hundred Thirty Three: Greater Jihad
==============================================

Imam Hasan Al-’Askari (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَشَدُّ النّاسِ اِجْتِهاداً مَنْ تَرَكَ الذُّنُوبَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The strongest warrior for the faith among people is one who gives up the
sins.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

We know that struggle against one’s rebellious and sensual desires that
lead to sins is called the ‘greater jihad’ in Islam, being more
important and valuable than struggle with enemies. This warfare is the
means of purification of the soul and requires a strong will to achieve
victory .

In societies stained with sin, the value of this warfare is more obvious
and its importance in achievement of social objectives cannot be denied.

Victories of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) in Medina
were actually the direct result of purification of souls and spiritual
struggles of his companions.
