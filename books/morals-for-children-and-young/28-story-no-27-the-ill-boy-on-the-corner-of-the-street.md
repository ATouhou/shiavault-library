Story no. 27: The ill boy on the corner of the street
=====================================================

Ahmad was waiting for his friend Muhammad so that they would go to a
place. He glanced at his watch and realized that Muhammad was late.  
 When he did come, Ahmad asked him “Why were you late?”  
 Muhammad replied “When I was coming, I saw an ill boy on the corner of
the street.  
 I asked the address of his house to which he replied in a weak voice
that he lived near my house.  
 I went running to his house, and informed the people.  
 Ahmad said “Bravo! What a good job that was which you did”.
