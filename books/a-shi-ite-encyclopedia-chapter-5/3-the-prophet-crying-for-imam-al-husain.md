The Prophet Crying For Imam Al-husain
=====================================

Narrated Salma:

"I went to visit Umm Salamah and found her weeping. I asked her what
was making her weep and she replied that she had seen Allah's Messenger
(PBUH&HF) (meaning in a dream) with dust on his head and beard. She
asked him what was the matter and he replied, \`I have just been present
at the slaying of al-Husayn.'"

- Sahih Tirmidhi, per:

- Mishkat al-Masabih, by al-Nawawi, English Version, Tdadition \#6157

Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas: One day at midday he saw in a dream the
Prophet (PBUH&HF) dishevelled and dusty with a bottle containing blood
in his hand and said, "You for whom I would give my father and mother as
ransom, what is this?" He replied, "This is the blood of al-Husayn and
his companions which I have been collecting today." He told that he was
reckoning that time and found that he had been killed at that time.

- Musnad Ahmad Hanbal;
- Dala'il an-Nubuwwah, by al-Bayhaqi; per:
- Mishkat al-Masabih, by al-Nawawi, English Version, Tdadition \#6172

Aisha narrated:

The Prophet (PBUH&HF) said: "Gabriel informed me that my grandson al-
Husain (AS) will be killed after me in the land of al-Taff and brought
me this Turbah (mudd/soil) and informed me that this is the soil of the
place he will be martyred."

p292

Not only human beings, but also the Jinns mourn for Imam al-Husain. It
has been narrated that after his (AS) martyrdom:

Um Salama (the wife of Prophet (S)) said: I heard the Jinns (the unseen
creatures) mourning for al-Husain."

As for the Shi'ite references, there is a traditions from the Prophet
(PBUH&HF) that: "When al-Khidr (AS) met Moses (AS), he explained and
forecast the catastrophe of Karbala (the place where this tragedy took
place) in the day of Ashura for Moses, and the calamities that will
happen on that day, and then both al-Khidr and Moses cried and screamed
severely."

Also Ibn Abbas (RA) narrated that he met Imam Ali (AS) in Ziqar, and
Imam Ali pulled out a book that was written of the words of Prophet
(PBUH&HF) in which the Prophet had explained the tragedy of Ashura and
the slaughtering of his grandson al-Husain and how he will be killed and
who kills him and who assist them and who will be martyred with him.
Then Imam Ali (AS) screamed severely and caused Ibn Abbas (RA) to cry.


**Umayad Sanctifying Ashura**

Bani Umayyah (Umayad) forced people to celebrate the day of Ashura
(10th of Muharram) as a blessed day, and encouraged people to buy and
store their annual food on that day and to fast that day as Sunnah, by
fabricating traditions in this regard which were solely designed to
overshadow and to cover up the great catastrophe of the slaughtering the
household of Prophet (PBUH&HF).

To make people believe that Ashura is a blessed day, day fabricated
that it was in that day when Allah saved Bani Israel from Pharaoh. this
is while Moses (AS) and his companions were saved and passed the Nile
river in the month of Rabiul-Awwal.

They also invented that the repentance of Adam was accepted on that
day, while it was accepted in the month of Zil-Hajjah. They say that it
was the day that Jonah (Yunos) was saved from the body of fish and the
ark of Noah was settled on earth while it was on the 18th of Zil-Hajjah.
All those traditions were fabricated By Bani Umayyah to cover their
crimes.

Imran ibn Husayn narrated that:

The Prophet (PBUH&HF) at the time of his death disliked three tribes:
Thaqif, the Banu Hanifah and the Banu Umayyah.

- Sahih Tirmidhi, per:

- Mishkat al-Masabih, by al-Nawawi, English Version, Tdadition \#5983

"The Children of Umayad shall ascend to my pulpit. I have seen them in
my dreams jumping on my pulpit like monkeys."

Then the Prophet said that the following verse was revealed about the
Umayad :

And We made that dream, which We have shown you, only as a test to the
people and the cursed tree in the Quran. And We warn them but it only
increases their extreme transgression! (17:60)

Ashura is the day of mourning and lamentation. In a tradition from
Ahlul- Bayt, it is said that "whoever celebrates this day as a blessed
day, he will be resurrected in the day of judgment with Yazid."

The reason is clear, and it is because there are traditions from
Prophet (PBUH&HF), every body who is pleased with an action, he will be
resurrected in the day of judgment with the one who did that action.
Performing a non-obligatory Fasting is a sign of being pleased and a
sign of happiness.

I know you say such traditions are narrated in Sahih xxxx. But remember
that there are many contradictory reports are within these xxxx which
disprove your hypothesis as being Sahih books.

Bismillah-hirehman-nirraheem


Muhammad came in the kingdom of God,
as a messenger of peace as the master of creed.
He influenced the world with Ali's help,
and all the sons from his daughter's breed.
Fatima the lady of God's paradise,
Ali the warrior, the leader, the wise.
Hassan, the heir of eternal lore,
Hussain, the martyr, the heaven's door.
Call Ali in the trouble, Almighty says,
because in his presence the evil decays.
He's the lion of God, he's the sword of God,
and all his believers are one righteous squad.
Islam's prosperity is the gift of Hussain,
in the way of God, he sacrificed his clan.
He gave his head but not his grace,
His martyrdom is a slap on the devils face.
The grandson of prophet decided to fight,
to unveil the Satan, and bring him in light.
The food was banned, the water was stopped,
but on his mind the triumph had topped.
Zainab was with her brother all the time,
and participated as much to demolish the crime.
Her surety was Abbas, the holder of the flag,
whose hand on the emblem is the victory's tag.
The thirst was a menace, the hunger a threat,
an example for all the mankind was set.
But the righteuos fought, and died on the faith,
and the right won, against the evils wraith.


**More Sayings from the Holy Prophet about Imam Husain:**

1. Whosoever wishes to such a person who lives on earth but whose
dignity is honoured by the Heaven-Dwellers, should see my grandson
Husain.

2. O my son! Thy flesh is my flesh and thy blood is my blood; thou art
a leader, the son of a leader and the brother of a leader; thou art a
spiritual guide, the son of a spiritual guide and the brother of a
spiritual guide; thou art an Imam the son of an Imam and the brother of
an Imam; thou art the father of nine Imams, the ninth of whom would be
the Qaim (the last infallible spiritual guide)

3. The punishment inflicted on the murderer of Husain in hell would be
equal to half of the total punishment to be imposed on the entire
sinners of the world.

4. When the Holy Prophet informed Lady Fatima of the Martyrdom in store
for his grandson, she burst into tears as asked "O my father! when would
my son be martyred?" "In such a critical moment," replied the Holy
Prophet, "when neither I nor you, nor Ali would be alive."

This accentuated her grief and she inquired again, "Who then, O my
father, would commemorate Husain's Martyrdom?" The Holy Prophet said,
"The men and the women of a particular group of my followers, who will
befriend my Ahlul Bayt, will mourn for Husain and commemorate his
martyrdom each year in every century."
