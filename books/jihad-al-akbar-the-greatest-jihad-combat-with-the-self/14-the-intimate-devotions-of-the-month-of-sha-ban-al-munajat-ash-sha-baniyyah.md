The Intimate Devotions of the Month of Sha‘ban (Al-Munajat Ash-Sha‘baniyyah)
============================================================================

*In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful*

*My Lord, bestow Your blessings on Muhammad and the progeny of
Muhammad.*

*Hear my prayer when I pray to You,*

*And hear my call when I call to You.*

*Turn to me when I whisper to You my devotions.*

*For I have fled to You*

*And am standing before You,*

*Imploring You in humility*

*In hope of that which You have as my reward.*

*You know what is in my soul*

*And You are aware of my need.*

*You are acquainted with my mind,*

*And nothing of my returning and my destination is hidden from You:*

*Not that with which I intend to begin speaking,*

*Nor the request I would utter,*

*And of the hopes I have for the hereafter.*

*O my Lord! Whatever You have destined for me until the end of my life*

*Concerning the secret and open aspects of my life,*

*It is in Your Hand and in the hand of none else,*

*My abundance and my deficiency,*

*My benefit and my harm.*

*My God! If You deprive me*

*Who will provide for me?*

*And if You forsake me*

*Who will help me?*

*My God! I seek refuge in You from Your wrath*

*And from the arrival of Your displeasure.*

*My God! I am unworthy of Your Mercy,*

*You are certainly worthy of generosity to me by the virtue of Your
Graciousness.*

*My God! It is as though I myself were standing before You*

*And were in the shade of my trust in You,*

*Then You said that of which You are worthy*

*And You covered me with Your forgiveness.*

*My God! If you forgive me, then who is more suited for that than You?*

*And if the moment of death has come near*

*But my deeds have not yet brought me near to You,*

*Then I make this confession of my sins to You my vehicle.*

*My God! I have recklessly failed to look after my soul,*

*So it is doomed if You do not forgive it.*

*My God! Your favor has been constant throughout the days of my life,*

*So do not cut off Your favor from me at the time of my death!*

*My God! How can I despair of Your watching well over me after my
death,*

*When You have wrought nothing but beauty in my life?*

*My God! Do that of which You are worthy in my case*

*And bestow Your grace upon a sinner engulfed in his ignorance.*

*My God! You have concealed my sins in this world,*

*While I am in greater need of their concealment in the hereafter.*

*As You have not exposed my sins to any of Your righteous servants,*

*Do not disgrace me on the Day of Resurrection before everyone.*

*My God! Your generosity has inflated my hopes*

*And Your righteousness is better than my deeds.*

*My God! Delight me with Your encounter on the day You judge among Your
servants.*

*My God! My apology to You is the apology of one who cannot afford*

*That his apology not be accepted.*

*So, accept my apology, O most Generous of those to whom the evil doers
offer their apologies!*

*My God! Do not reject my need,*

*Do not disappoint me in what I covet,*

*And do not cut off my hopes and aspirations from You.*

*My God! If You had wanted to degrade me,*

*You would not have guided me;*

*If You had wanted to disgrace me,*

*You would not have kept me safe and sound.*

*My God! I do not think You will refuse me in this need*

*In whose solicitation from You I have spent my life.*

*My God! To you is due all praise,*

*Always and forever, eternally,*

*Increasing, not diminishing,*

*As You like and please.*

*My God! If You hold me for my crimes,*

*I will hold on to You for Your forgiveness,*

*And if You hold me for my sins,*

*I will hold on to You for Your pardon.*

*If You cast me into the Fire,*

*I will announce to its inmates that I love You.*

*My God! If my works are too little regarding obedience to You,*

*There is indeed much regarding my hopes in You and my aspirations.*

*My God! How can I turn away from nigh unto You bereft, in failure,*

*When I had such a good opinion of Your generosity that You would turn
me away from being bereft of salvation.*

*My God! I have wasted my life on the evil of inattentiveness toward
You*

*And I have worn out my youth in the drunkenness of estranging myself
from You.*

*My God! I did not awaken when I was under a delusion about You*

*And was inclined toward the way of Your wrath.*

*My God! I am Your servant, the son of Your servant, standing before
You,*

*Trying to use Your own magnanimity as a means to You.*

*My God! I am a servant who would*

*Excuse himself before You of that which I did in front*

*Of You because I lacked shame of being*

*Watched by You; and I seek Your forgiveness,*

*For Forgiveness is a characteristic of Your generosity.*

*My God! I was not strong enough to remove myself from disobedience to
You*

*Until You awakened me to Your love.*

*I was as You wanted me to be*

*So I thank You for bringing me to*

*Your generosity and for purifying my heart*

*Of the filth of negligence of You.*

*My God! Look upon me as one*

*Whom You called and who answered You,*

*Whom You helped by employing him*

*And who obeyed You.*

*O Near One who is not far from one who is estranged!*

*O Generous One who does not withhold*

*His reward from one who hopes for it!*

*My God! Provide me with a heart, the passion of which may bring it near
to You;*

*With a tongue, the truth of which may be offered up to You;*

*And with a vision whose character may bring it nigh to You;*

*My God! Whoever becomes acquainted with You is not an unknown;*

*Whoever takes shelter with You is not abandoned;*

*One to whom You turn cannot be owned.*

*My God! Whoever takes the path to You is enlightened,*

*And whoever resorts to You is saved.*

*And I have cleaved to You, O my God!*

*So, do not disappoint me of Your Mercy,*

*And do not block me from Your kindness.*

*My God! Place me among your Friends*

*In the position of one who hopes for an increase in Your love.*

*My God! Inspire me with fervor for the remembrance of You until I have
become inspired with remembrance of You*

*And spiritual zeal for the success of*

*Your Name and the station of Your Sanctity.*

*My God! By You I invoke You*

*To join me to the place of those who are obedient to You*

*And the abode of the righteous of those with whom You are pleased.*

*I can neither defend myself*

*Nor control that which is in my interests.*

*My God! I am Your weak and sinful servant*

*And Your repentant slave*

*So, do not make me one of those from whom You avert Your Face*

*And whose inattentiveness blocks him from your forgiveness.*

*My God! Make me completely cut off from all else but You*

*And enlighten the vision of our hearts*

*With the radiance of looking at You*

*Until the vision of our hearts penetrates the veils of light*

*And reaches the Source of Grandeur*

*And set our spirits to be suspended by the glory of your sanctity.*

*My God! Make me of those who answer you when you call them,*

*Who are thunderstruck by Your Majesty when you look at them,*

*And who work for you openly when you whisper to them secretly.*

*My God! I have not allowed my good*

*Opinion of You to be overcome by despair,*

*Nor have I lost hope in the favor of your generosity.*

*My God! If my mistakes have*

*Degraded me with you, ignore them*

*In virtue of my reliance on you.*

*My God! If my sins have lowered me to unworthiness of your kindness,*

*My certainty has roused me to the nobility of your affection.*

*My God! If I have been put to sleep*

*By neglecting to prepare to encounter you,*

*I have been roused by knowledge of the nobility of your blessings.*

*My God! If Your great punishment invites me to the Fire,*

*Your abundant reward invites me to heaven.*

*My God! I ask and beseech you,*

*I implore and entrust You*

*To bestow your blessings on Muhammad and the progeny of Muhammad,*

*And to make me of those who are constant in their remembrance of you,*

*And who never violate their covenant with you,*

*Who neglect giving thanks to You*

*And who do not depreciate your commands.*

*My God! Join me to the Light of Your resplendent Might,*

*So I may have gnosis of You*

*And may be diverted from all else but you,*

*And be fearfully watchful of you.*

*O Sublime and Noble!*

*May the blessings of Allah be with Muhammad, His Apostle, and his
immaculate progeny, abundant salutations prayed for their peace!*
