Ahlul Sunnat And Lady Shaharbano
================================

Ahlul Sunnat say that Shaharbano was brought to Medina as a prisoner,
which did not have religious sanction according to Shia faith; so how
can her relationship with Husayn (a.s.) be justified and how can her
giving birth to Imam Zainul Aabideen (a.s.) be legitimized? The writer
has already proved in detail these things in the foregone pages. Here it
suffices to say that according to a traditional report of Biharul
Anwar[^1] the proper marriage (Nikah) of Imam Husayn (a.s.) was
performed with Shaharbano and she was not dealt with like other women
prisoners of war. The reason for this was only so because she had come
as prisoner of war conducted by the Caliphs and these wars were
themselves not legitimate.
