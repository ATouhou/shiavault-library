39. Acts without Benefits 
==========================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ رَسُولُ اللٌّهُ(ص): يُقَالُ لِلْعَاقِّ إِعْمَلْ مَا شِئْتَ
فَإِنِّي لاَ أَغْفِرُ لَكَ وَ يُقَالُ لِلْبَارِّ إِعْمَلْ مَا شِئْتَ
فَإِنِّي سَأَغْفِرُ لَكَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his family) has said: “One
who has been disowned by his parents is told: ‘Act as you please, for I
shall not forgive you.’  Whereas one who is good towards his parents is
told, ‘Act as you please.  I will be forgiving towards you.’”
