Talbiyah - the Soul's Response To Allah's Call
==============================================

Since the Qur'an calls on Muslims to perform Hajj, worshippers respond
to this eternal call. They begin by humbly repeating the call of love,
loyalty, and faithfulness to Allah:

"Labbaika Allahumma labbaik. Labbaika La sharika laka labbaik. Innal
hamda wan ni mata laka wal mulk. La sharika lak"

(Here I am, my Lord. Here I am.
Here I am, You have no partner.

[ 14 ]

Here I am. Praise, grace, and the kingdom is for You. You have no
partner.)

Thus was the call of Muhammad (s.a.w.), which he taught his ummah. It
is a call recited by the hearts that faithfully respond to Allah's call.
By so doing, they display their loyalty, and good intentions, bravely
challenging all the troubles and hardships.

They sincerely express their love and longing to Allah, the Exalted,
for visiting the holy lands. The pilgrim calls, along with the others
Here I am, my Lord, here I am.' I have responded to Your call and
command, and Tam under the cloak of Your mercy, because of my love and
loyalty to You. You are the One Who has possessed my soul, feelings and
life. Nothing except You can prevent me from coming to You. You have
granted me the honor of being Your servant. You love me, that is why You
have embraced me with your mercifulness. How can I decline your
invitation?

Are not the creatures and the worlds Yours?

Are not You the source of all graces, deserving of our deep thanks and
praise...? Am I not indebted to you? I, the servant, who always praises
and glorifies you?

Here I am before You, I have left all of what You have bestowed on me:
My family, wealth, social status and pleasures, in seeking of Your
pleasure, out of my great desire to come to You. O my Lord, accept me as
You have accepted Your servant. Accept my prayer, and grant me Your
blessings and mercy. Accept me, for I have forsaken all disobedience to
You.


**Objectives and Benefits**

"And proclaim among people the Pilgrimage; they will come to you on
foot and on every lean camel coming from every remote path. That they
may witness advantages for them and mention the name of Allah during the
stated days over what He has given them of the cattle quadrupeds, then
eat of them and feed the distressed one, the needy". Holy Qur'an
(22:27-28)

Hajj is a great Islamic conference. It is and ideal demonstration of
faith in which diverse groups of every race, class, and nationality join
together at a given time and in a specific place. They repeatedly recite
a single call, and proclaim the same slogan. They gather for one
purpose.

[ 15 ]

To declare their servitude and loyalty to Allah alone, freeing
themselves from any trace of polytheism and ignorance, in a deeply
effective, collective way, which fills the soul with feelings of faith,
and uniterism.

As the Holy Qur'an proclaims, and the Prophetic traditions bespeak, it
is not only worship and a way of getting closer to Allah, but is a way
of granting the pilgrim social, educational, economic and political
benefits. Combined together these bounties are conducive to improvement
within an Islamic society, increase its awareness, recti1~' problems,
and activate its movement.

During Hajj, Muslims witness the most excellent example of equality,
submissiveness, and human brotherhood. This is accomplished by removing
the outer difference and donning the dress of unity Ihram. The result is
that all feel a oneness among the human race, brotherhood and
equality.

While performing Hajj, Muslims feel a oneness with the earth and the
people. The invalidate all the artificial boundaries established by
human, regional, national and racial superiority complexes and egoism.
Traveling across thousands of miles, they penetrate all barriers, and
rise above all-man-made hurdles, in order to respond to Islam's call of
faith.

During Hajj, Muslims meet each other in a magnificent communion. They
relate to each other's domestic and regional affairs. They consult each
other concerning their life and religion. They exchange experiences,
opinions, and good habits. They become acquainted with each other's
problems.

They learn of each other's viewpoints. This interchanging of ideas
increases their awareness, knowledge grows, and the impetus to reform is
invigorated. As a result, plans are proposed, projects designed,
educational, political, social and economic centers are established. The
Muslims support each other, as if they are one body and one soul.

Since Hajj is a large and impressive human gathering, it attracts
millions of Muslims from different countries. It also stimulates an
economic movement, which is beneficial to the world of Islam.

During Hajj, the pilgrim imbibes ethical and educational lessons which
reduce his faults. He enquires patience through hardship. He becomes
humble, generous, and tender. He renounces lying, backbiting, animosity,
and pride. He learns from his journey through mixing with other. Within
him, positive social tendencies grow and morals are refined.

[ 16 ]

Imam Ja'far bin Muhammad al-Sadiq (a.s.) has talked about Hajj and its
benefits, eloquently answering the question of one of his followers,
(Hisham bin al-Hakam). Once he asked Imam Ja'far (a.s.), Why does Allah
order His servants to perform Hajj, and circumambulate around the
Ka'ba?

The Imam (a.s.) replied:

"Allah has created His servants and instructed them how to obey Him
through the performance of religious duties. He has made (Hajj) a
gathering in which people from the East and the West participate and
become acquainted with one another. Every' single one of them benefits
from the experiences of others who come from different places. Memories
of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.), and his life will never be
forgotten...etc." 9

This explanation is completely congruous with that of his nephew, Imam
Au bin Musa al-Ridha (a.s.) on the benefits of Hajj and its social
effects. Imam al-Ridha (a.s.) says:

"People are ordered to perform Hajj so that they remain the guests of
Allah, the Most High, gain divine rewards and win the remission of
whatever wrong they have committed through repentance, and preparing for
the future. During Hajj people spend of their wealth and selves, leave
their families and children, refrain from pleasures travel inhospitable
weather and are filled with determination to complete Hajj, while being
continuously humble, calm and submissive.

During Hajj benefits abound for all people every where, from the East
and the West, on land and sea, for those who perform Hajj and for those
who have not.

All people profit from Hajj, whether merchant, seller, buyer, the poor,
and the destitute. Whenever the pilgrims get together the inhabitants of
that place prosper. They in crease in knowledge, while spreading the
statements of the Imams to every corner of the earth. As Allah, the Most
High says:

"... Why should not then a group of every party from among them go
forth in order to master religion so that they may warn their people
when they return to master religion so that they may warn their people
when they return to them that they may beware?"10, and that they may
witness advantages for them"11

Allah, thus willed that Hajj be a place of prayer and devotion, a
season for worship and enlightenment, and a bounteous field for the
fulfillment of man's social interests.
