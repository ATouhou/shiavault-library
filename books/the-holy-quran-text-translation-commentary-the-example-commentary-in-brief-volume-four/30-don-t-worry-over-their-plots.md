Don't Worry Over Their Plots
============================

VERSE NO.69ِ75

Now the prophet is addressed, and is ordered to tell the obstinate
disbelievers who always look for new excuses:ِ \`\`Travel in the earth
and see how was the end of the sinners.'' They said; we and our fathers
have been promised of this, which is nothing but the fables of the
ancients. They say so, but they do not mind to take lessons from the
incidents of past and present, and from the fates of other people. If
they would tour in the lands, they would see that evil has always come
to an evil end, and the truth has always been the winner.

Qura"n repeatedly has asked people to travel on the earth and observe
the monuments, and the surviving traces of the great ancient towns,
palaces, and houses of those who were smitten by God's wrath, and then
study their customs, states, and deeds, and that, what was the
consequences of their rejecting the truth.

Our prophet suffered from the denial of the polytheists and refusal of
the Jews, but was always full of pity for them, because of seeing them
digging their graves with their own hands, and providing for their own
destruction.

[ 533 ] Their plots and plans against the prophet was also not rare.
Here Allah consoles His Messenger and Muslims to assure them that the
plots of the unbelievers will never frustrate Allah in His purpose and
plan.

Those obstinate refusers of truth, took no care of the warnings of our
prophet and by a way of scoff and irony said:ِ \`\`When is the promise
to come if you are truthfuls.'' To answer their mockery, Qura"n in a
serious and dignified manner says:ِ

\`\`....Some of what you seek to hasten might be well behind you. How
do we know that this very hour is not the last hour of our life, and the
first hour of our Dooms Day. For man every hour should be that of
repentance and return.'' The conclusion of the above passage is a
mention of the infinite knowledge of God that encompasses everything
large or small, visible or invisible:ِ

\`\`And there is nothing hidden in the sky and earth except that it is
recorded in a Perspicuous Book.'' Everything that happens or does not
happen has been written in a perspicuous Book by the pen of cause and on
the paper of effect. It is so with the exception that God may want it to
be otherwise. His Grace may sometimes want to modify or amend something.
This is because God's Mercy is always willing to call back actions from
disorderly to a regular and tamed state.

إِنَّ هَذَا الْقُرْآنَ يَقُصُّ عَلَى بَنِى إِسْرَائِيلَ أَكْثَرَ
الَّذِى هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ(( 76 ))

76- VERILY THIS QURA"N DECLARES TO THE ISRAELITES MOST OF THAT IN WHICH
THEY DIFFER. (ARE IN VARIANCE)

[ 534 ]

وَإِنَّهُ لَهُدىً وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ(( 77 ))

77- AND THAT IT IS A GUIDANCE AND A MERCY FOR THE BELIEVERS.

إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَقْضِى بَيْنَهُمْ بِحُكْمِهِ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ
الْعَلِيمُ(( 78 ))

78- VERILY YOUR LORD WILL JUDGE BETWEEN THEM BY HIS DECREE, AND HE IS
EXALTED IN MIGHT, ALL-KNOWING.

فَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللهِ إِنَّكَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ الْمُبِينِ(( 79 ))

79- SO PUT YOUR TRUST IN ALLAH, THAT YOU ARE IN CLEAR TRUTH.

إِنَّكَ لاَ تُسْمِعُ الْمَوْتَى وَلاَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ الدُّعَاءَ
إِذَا وَلَّوْا مُدْبِرِينَ(( 80 ))

80- THAT YOU DO NOT MAKE THE DEAD TO HEAR, NOR DO YOU MAKE THE DEAF TO
HEAR THE CALL, WHEN THEY TURN THEIR BACKS RETREATING.

وَمَا أَنْتَ بِهَادِى الْعُمْىِ عَنْ ضَلاَلَتِهِمْ إِنْ تُسْمِعُ إِلاَّ
مَنْ يُؤْمِنُ بِآيَاتِنَا فَهُمْ مُّسْلِمُونَ(( 81 ))

81- AND YOU ARE NOT TO GUIDE THE BLIND OUT OF THEIR STRAYING. YOU MAKE
NOT TO HEAR EXCEPT HE WHO BELIEVES IN OUR SIGNS, AND THOSE WHO SURRENDER
THEMSELVES TO US. (THE MUSLIMS)

[ 535 ]

**THE COMMENTARY
DEAFS AND BLINDS WILL NOT CATCH YOUR WORD**

VERSE NO.76ِ81

The Israelites were at variance in many important matters, such as Mary
the Virgin, Jesus Christ, the Messiah to come, and many a commandment of
the Law.

Qura"n revealed, and declares most of such differences which is a real
guidance and true Mercy for those who do believe in Qura"n:ِ \`\`Verily
this Qura"n makes clear to the Israelites most of that in which they are
at variance.''

The Jews and Christians have numerous sects with different ideas even
in their orthodox body. They have various scriptures with important
conflicts in their texts, some of which have canonically been approved
and accepted as true, and some have been rejected like the Gospel of
Barnabas which proves to be more truthful. Both of the main groups of
the Mosaic Law (JEWS AND CHRISTIANS) have a large volume of traditions
with which they have overlaid the Law of Moses. This is where Jesus has
said:ِ \`\`Do not think that I have come to do away with the Law of
Moses, and the teachings of the prophets. I have rather come to make
their teachings to come true. Remember that as long as heavens and earth
last, not the least point, nor the smallest detail of the Law will be
done away withِnot until the end of all things. So, whoever disobeys the
least important of the commandments, and teaches the others to do so,
will be the least in the kingdom of heaven. MATTHEWSِ5:17''

Therefore many of their disputes can be settled up by Qura"n, such as
the nature of God-the true personality of Jesus-the revelation and
inspiration, and the Hereafter and Resurrection Day.

Qura"n makes everything known explicitly, but when someone is blind,
how can you show him the colour of a rose, or when someone is [ 536 ]

deaf, how can he enjoy a song. Those can be addressed by the Messenger
of God, who are aliveِwho are willing to see and hear, and not the deads
who have turned their backs retreating:ِ

\`\`And you are not to guide the blinds out of their straying. You make
not to hear except he who believes in our signs, and those who surrender
themselves to us.''

The duty of the Messenger of God was to convey God's Message to His
servants, and he did that very well. Then he is not responsible for what
the people do or do not, or he is not authorized to make people to
convert through force majeure:ِ \`\`There is no compulsion in religion.
Verily the truth has been made distinct from error. Whoever rejects evil
and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold that
will never break, and Allah hears and knows all things....S 2:256''

وَإِذَا وَقَعَ الْقَوْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ أَخْرَجْنَا لَهُمْ دَابَّةً مِّنَ
الاَْرْضِ تُكَلِّمُهُمْ أَنَّ النَّاسَ كَانُوا بِآيَاتِنَا لاَ
يُوقِنُونَ(( 82 ))

82- WHEN THE WORD (OF PUNISHMENT) OCCURED AGAINST THEM, WE WILL BRING
OUT OF THE EARTH A CREATURE FOR THEM, SPEAKING TO THEM THAT PEOPLE WERE
NOT SURE OF OUR SIGNS.

وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُ مِنْ كُلِّ أُمَّة فَوْجاً مِّمَّنْ يُكَذِّبُ
بِآيَاتِنَا فَهُمْ يُوزَعُونَ(( 83 ))

83- AND THE DAY IN WHICH WE WILL RESURRECT A TROOP FROM EACH NATION, OF
THOSE WHO BELIED OUR SIGNS, AND THEM WE WILL HALT, FOR OTHERS TO JOIN
THEM.

[ 537 ]

حَتَّى إِذَا جَاءُوا قَالَ أَكَذَّبْتُمْ بِآيَاتِى وَلَمْ تُحِيطُوا
بِهَا عِلْماً أَمَّاذَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ(( 84 ))

84- UNTIL THEY HAVE COME (BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE) HE SAID:ِ
\`\`DID YOU BELIE MY SIGNS WHICH YOU ENCOMPASSED THEM NOT WITH
KNOWLEDGE? WHAT WERE YOU DOING?''

وَوَقَعَ الْقَوْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِمَا ظَلَمُوا فَهُمْ لاَ يَنطِقُونَ(( 85
))

85- AND THE WORD (OF PUNISHMENT) WILL FALL AGAINST THEM FOR WHAT THEY
HAVE OPPRESSED, THEN THEY DO NOT SPEAK. (THEY WILL HAVE NOTHING TO
SAY)

**THE COMMENTARY**

VERSE NO.82ِ85

The advent of the creature is before this world is ended, and the new
world is brought into being:ِ \`\`And when the word of punishment came
to pass against them, We will bring out of the earth a creature for
them, who speaks to them, telling that the people had not faith in our
signs. Qura"n does not give enough detail, as to who or how the creature
is. From the verse we can understand that he is a moving creature, which
may mean he is very hardy and active. He is also intelligent and well
aware of the social conditions, that he makes speech, and informs the
people that their difficulties are due to their lack of faith in the
signs of God.

Of course, the creature, through some Islamic, traditions, has been
illustrated well enough. It is narrated that the creature is one of [
538 ]

the signs and evidences that the Resurrection Day would occur soon
after. Some of the expounders of Qura"n, have understood the moving
creature to be some sort of a superman who is very active, and through
his earnest movements will separate the line of the believers from the
non-believers and in particular, that of the hypocrites. There are some
traditions that he is Hazrat Imam Ali (AS) and some other commentators
like, \`\`ABULFOTUH RAZI'' have understood the creature to be Hazrat
Al-Mahdi (AS), who is the 12th and the last Imam of the Shiite sect of
Islam.

Whoever, or whatever, the moving creature of the earth might be, he
will admonish people that they arrogantly and without having knowledge
have rejected the signs of God, and provided for their ruin, with their
own hands. Then God's decree against the non-believers will be executed,
while they have nothing to say for being sure that they are guilty.

**REJAT = RETURN**

Some scholars have taken moving creature of the earth, to be one of the
signs of \`\`REJ-AT''.

The Arabic, \`\`Rej-at'' which means, \`\`THE RETURN'' is a sure
incident which will happen, according to the Shiite Doctrine. This will
happen after the advent of Al-Mahdi, and before the Resurrection Day.
Thereby a group of believers and a troop of non-believers will return
back to life. The believers will then develop to higher ranks in their
way of evolution, and the non-believers will be punished severely for
their oppressions. This Return is not general, and for all. It rather is
applicable to certain people, specified from both parties. Jurisprudents
say that, the Return is not one of the necessary [ 539 ] principles of
Shiite; and those who have denied it, have not been excommunicated from
the sect.

أَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا الَّيْلَ لِيَسْكُنُوا فِيهِ
وَالنَّهَارَ مُبْصِراً إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لاَيَات لِّقَوْم يُؤْمِنُونَ((
86 ))

86- DO THEY NOT SEE THAT WE HAVE MADE THE NIGHT, SO AS TO REST IN IT;
AND THE DAY, LIGHT GIVING? VERILY IN THAT THERE ARE SIGNS FOR A PEOPLE
WHO BELIEVE.

وَيَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِى الصُّورِ فَفَزِعَ مَنْ فِى السَّموَاتِ وَمَنْ فِى
الاَْرْضِ إِلاَّ مَنْ شَاءَ اللهُ وَكُلٌّ أَتَوْهُ دَاخِرِينَ(( 87 ))

87- AND THE DAY (IN WHICH) IT IS BLOWN IN THE TRUMPET, THEN TERRIFIED
IS WHOEVER IS IN THE HEAVENS, AND WHOEVER IS ON THE EARTH, EXCEPT HE
WHO, ALLAH WILLS, AND ALL WILL COME TO HIM IN HUMILITY.

وَتَرَى الْجِبَالَ تَحْسَبُهَا جَامِدَةً وَهِىَ تَمُرُّ مَرَّ
السَّحَابِ صُنْعَ اللهِ الَّذِى أَتْقَنَ كُلَّ شَىْء إِنَّهُ خَبِيرٌ
بِمَا تَفْعَلُونَ(( 88 ))

88- AND YOU SEE THE MOUNTAINS CONSIDERING IT TO BE SOLID (STATIONARY),
AND YET IT MOVES AS THE CLOUDS MOVE! IT IS THE WORKMANSHIP OF ALLAH, WHO
HAS MADE EVERYTHING FIRM. VERILY HE IS AWARE OF WHATEVER YOU DO.

[ 540 ]

**THE COMMENTARY
EARTH'S MOVEMENTِA SCIENTIFIC MIRACLE OF QURA"N**
VERSE NO.86ِ88

Here the immediate reference is to some natural phenomena, and physical
Law that may serve to enlighten our heart with the light of truth:ِ
\`\`Do they not see that We have made the night so as to rest in it, and
the day light-giving.'' The comfort which is provided by darkness in the
night is vital to life of all creatures. It forces all of them to cease
their tiresome endeavours and tedious attempts, in order to have a rest
and repose. Night is for rest and day for work, and we must harmonize
ourselves with it. The importance of the dark of night for rest is no
less than that of the light of day for work. Both of them are God's
blessings, and misusing both of them, is a bad sort of ingratitude. A
patient who cannot fall asleep for pain, during the night long, can
understand the value of night and rest.

The next verse applies to the Resurrection Day:ِ \`\`And the day in
which it is blown in the trumpet, and every one in the heavens and earth
will be terrified, except he whom Allah wills.'' The angels who are in
the heavens, and the pious believers who live in the earth, and all the
good people are exceptions, and are not afraid of the dread of that
awful day. As a matter of fact, an honest man has nothing to fear. When
something dreadful happens, such as the earthquake, or an attack with
artillery, of throwing shells, bombs, or missiles, causing the roofs to
fall upon the heads, and man sees through it the awful face of death and
destruction, his arrogance will flee. Then he may see his true place
which is that of humility and lowliness.

[ 541 ]

The next verse points to one of the physical phenomena in the nature,
which is the moving mountains that seem to be stationary, as it is the
case with the globe. Some of the commentators have understood that the
verse (NO.88) refers to an incident which will happen at the down of
Resurrection Day, wherein the mountains will be smashed.

But the verse, whatever it may mean, is also true with the present
physical condition of the mountainsِthey have indeed various movement
while they seem to be stationary in our eyes. Nowadays, it is a proved
scientific matter that even those things that we consider them as solid
and without any movement, they consist of molecules and atoms that do
have many kinds of movements and in different directionsِthey spin round
themselves, they encircle about other bodies in their orbits, and they
travel longitudinally, and in such laws of gravitation, and among all, a
mountain is not exceptional.

On the other hand, when Qura"n says that the mountain moves as the
cloud moves, and in several other places of Qura"n it is cited that the
mountains are nailed and fixed into the earth, it clearly means that the
earth is moving and this is one of the scientific miracles of the
Glorious Qura"n.

مَنْ جَاءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهَا وَهُمْ مِّنْ فَزَع
يَوْمَئِذ آمِنُونَ(( 89 ))

89- AND HE WHO CAME WITH A GOOD DEED, FOR HIM IS A BETTER THAN IT, AND
THEY SHALL BE SECURE FROM THE TERROR OF THAT DAY.

وَمَنْ جَاءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَكُبَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فِى النَّارِ هَلْ
تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ(( 90 ))

90- AND HE WHO CAME WITH AN EVIL DEED, THEY SHALL BE

[ 542 ]

HURLED INTO FIRE WITH FACES DOWNWARD. (HEADLONG) ARE YOU REWARDED
EXCEPT FOR WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING.

إِنَّمَا أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ رَبَّ هَذِهِ الْبَلْدَةِ الَّذِى
حَرَّمَهَا وَلَهُ كُلُّ شَىْء وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنْ
الْمُسْلِمِينَ(( 91 ))

91- VERILY I AM ORDERED TO WORSHIP THE LORD OF THIS CITY (MECCA). HE
WHO HAS SANCTIFIED IT, AND EVERYTHING BELONGS TO HIM, AND I AM COMMANDED
TO BE OF THE MUSLIMS. (THOSE WHO HAVE SURRENDERED TO GOD'S WILL)

وَأَنْ أَتْلُوَ الْقُرْآنَ فَمَنِ اهْتَدَى فَإِنَّمَا يَهْتَدِى
لِنَفْسِهِ وَمَنْ ضَلَّ فَقُلْ إِنَّمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُنذِرِينَ(( 92
))

92- AND TO REHEARSE THE QURA"N. THEN HE WHO IS GUIDED, HE IS GUIDED FOR
(THE BENEFIT OF) HIMSELF, AND HE WHO WENT ASTRAY, THEN YOU SAY, I AM
ONLY OF THE WARNERS.

وَقُلِ الْحَمْدُ للهِِ سَيُرِيكُمْ آيَاتِهِ فَتَعْرِفُونَهَا وَمَا
رَبُّكَ بِغَافِل عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ(( 93 ))

93- AND SAY:ِ \`\`PRAISE BELONGS TO ALLAH. SOON SHALL HE SHOW YOU HIS
SIGNS SO THAT YOU WILL RECOGNIZE THEM, AND YOUR LORD IS NOT NEGLIGENT OF
WHATEVER YOU DO.

[ 543 ]

**THE COMMENTARY
THE PROPHET'S LAST COMMISSION**

VERSE NO.89ِ93

Again the argument is about the wonders of Resurrection, and the
profoundly impressive terror of that Day, of which only the believers
with good deeds are secure. The evil doers who are also non-believers
will be hurled into the blazing fire of Hell, headlong, which is the
worst kind of punishment. Some have said that the punishment is
relatively very severe, and far from justice. Here the answer of Qura"n
is:ِ \`\`You are not rewarded except for what you have been doing.''

In other word, the punishment, whatever it is; it is only the
consequence of our deeds. When we saw a seed say, a wheat; and then we
harvest a bunch of 70 grains, no one will object, because we all know it
to be the natural result of our work.

Then comes the next verse by which the prophet is ordered to worship
the Lord of this city, which is Mecca. The Lord God Who has sanctified
the town by the presence of KAABEH, the first mosque which was rebuilt
by Abraham for the worship of Allah, the only one and true God. The city
has always been respected by God, and has been sanctified and kept safe
and secure. Then in the following verses, mention is made of some of the
duties of the prophet:ِ \`\`I am ordered to worship the Lord of this
city (MECCA). The Lord Who has sanctified it. I am also commanded to be
of the Muslims, and to rehears Qura"n.''

The ending of this chapter (Sِ27) consists of a promise:ِ \`\`And say:ِ
\`\`Praise belongs to Allah. Soon shall He show you His signs so that
you will recognize them and your Lord is not negligent of what you
do.''

[ 544 ]

Some years later, with the prophet and after him, up to now which is
our time in the 14th centure, so many wonderful incidents has happened
about Islam and Qura"n, proving that what the prophet brought to us as
the Message of God, is controlled and supported by the mysterious and
meanwhile intelligent and powerful hand of God. So far all the doubts
should have been removed from the minds of those who do not mean to
reject the truth deliberately.

**THE COMMENTARY
GOD'S WILL WAS TO SUPPORT THE WEAKEND**

VERSE 1ِ6

In the above verse (NO.2) by the perspicuous book, the Holy Qura"n is
wanted. The Arabic, \`\`MOBIN'' translated to, \`\`PERSPICUOUS'' is a
transitive, as well as an intransitive word which means it is clear and
also it makes things clear. Pharaoh who was intoxicated with pride of
race, and vanity of power, issued a decree that all the male born to his
Israelite subjects had to be killed, and the females kept alive for the
pleasure of Egyptians! Further in these verses, it is related how Moses
was saved from that wonderful general slaughter of babies. As to the
weakened party in Egypt; Pharaoh's plan was to crush them but God's will
was otherwise. He wanted to protect them and to make them custodians of
His religion.

Therefore so it happened that Pharaoh and his chiefs and hosts were
destroyed, and the Israelites inherited their capital and moving [ 547
]

assets. Such were the calamities of which Pharaoh and his hosts were
afraid, and against all their precautionary actions it afflicted them.

As to the cause of Pharaoh's hostility against the children of Israel,
commentators and historians have narrated that Pharaoh dreamt that a
great burning brand of fire came out of Jerusalem and took over all the
Egyptian houses, burning them all, but the fire did not touch any
Israelite house! The interpreters told him that a man will rise from
among the children of Israel who will perish Egyptian king and conquer
Egypt. This dream of his, made him to issue a decree through which the
Israelites new born baby sons had to be killed and the female separed.

Then the immediate reference is to a part of the story of Moses which
is related in truth and far from superstitions and fables. The part of
the story of Moses which is rehearsed here is how his mother trusted
Allah in her most critical situation and put her trust in her Lord, and
threw here beloved child into the sea with the hope that God would
protect him. Then it is narrated how Moses himself escaped the deathful
judgement of their tyrant of ages, and away from home, he found love and
support due to his good deeds.

Pharaoh himself was a weak servant of God, who had lost or forgotten
his very self; and by psychological disease he was thinking too much of
himself. He, by the wings of ignorance and vanity flew as high as
calling himself a god.

Pharaoh's policy was to divide and rule by which a small minority of
people would rule a great majority. He had divided the people of Egypt
in two main groups. A party was called, \`\`GHEBTIES'' which included
all the Egyptains, and those who were known as, \`\`Sebties'' were
generally the children of Israel who had emigrated to Egypt.

The unjust king had made envious distinction between his subjects. He
declared a caste of the Israelites, depressing their men, killing their
newly born male, and enslaving their females for the pleasure of
Egyptians.

[ 548 ]

وَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَى أُمِّ مُوسَى أَنْ أَرْضِعِيهِ فَإِذَا خِفْتِ

7- AND WE INSPIRED THE MOTHER OF MOSES, TO SUCKLE HIM, AND WHEN YOU

8- (WHEN THE MOTHER WAS VERY AFRAID, SHE PUT HER CHILD IN A WOODEN BOX,
AND GAVE IT TO THE FLOW OF NILE, AS PER ORDER OF GOD) THEN PHARAOH'S
FOLK PICKED HIM UP, SO AS TO BE AN ENEMY FOR THEM, AND (A CAUSE OF)
GRIEF; THAT PHARAOH, HA"MA"N, AND THEIR HOSTS, WERE WRONG DOERS.

وَقَالَتِ امْرَأَةُ فِرْعَوْنَ قُرَّتُ عَيْن لِّى وَلَكَ لاَ

يَشْعُرُونَ(( 9 ))

9- AND PHARAOH'S WIFE SAID:ِ \`\`A JOY OF EYE FOR ME AND YOU. DO NOT
KILL HIM. PERHAPS HE MAY PROFIT US; OR WE MAY TAKE HIM FOR A SON, AND
THEY WERE NOT AWARE.'' (THAT GOD'S PLAN WAS OTHERWISE)
