Account N. 13 : Al-dinawari
===========================

Al-Dinawari gives us a fairly full account[^56].

In the main, it seems to follow the traditional account, but it was
probably based on a later recension of Abu Mikhnaf's work. On two points
in the account he introduces material that differs from what has been
reported earlier. He presents an account of Ibn al-Zubayr trying to
persuade the Imam al-Husayn not to go to Kufa but to carry out his
resistance to Yazid from the Hijaz[^57].

This may be a survival of a Zubayrid Medinan tradition which supported
Ibn al-Zubayr, but did not want to denigrate the Imam al-Husayn. The
other point is that al-Dinawari does not mention the three options often
alleged to have been offered by the Imam to \`Umar b. Sa\`d. As far as
he is concerned, the Imam only said that he was willing to go back, but
Ibn Ziyad insisted that he pledge allegiance to Yazid[^58].

In effect, al-Dinawari's version is basically presenting the standard
version with a high degree of sympathy and support for the Imam
al-Husayn.
