Unawareness of the Servants’ Detriments
=======================================

Among the perils of conceit is that instead of one seeing his faults and
shortcomings, he becomes too blind to see these, so he does not examine
his deeds, nor does he ascertain his acts of worship. If the *nafs* and
Satan find their ways to him through other venues such as pretension and
others, one may treat himself before it is too late. But due to this
disease [of conceit], one may not correct the conditions required for
the soundness of his rituals and acts of adoration, so his good deeds
and worship become void even according to obvious religious laws and
according to the verdicts of scholars of the Sharī\`a.

But since he admires his good deeds, he does not look for such verdicts
so he may apply them to the sacred rites. The poor man finds himself in
a situation in which the adoration of as long as fifty years of his
lifespan is void and was not correct even in a way where he can repeat
them and make up for them. What a fault is greater than one being
unaware of seeing his faults?! The Prophet (ص) says, "Suffices one for a
fault is that he sees people's faults while being too blind to see his
own." Imām Ali bin Muhammad al-Hadi (ع) has said, "One who is pleased
with himself will find many who are displeased with him."

Lord! Enable us to see our faults so such vision may be one of the marks
of Your love for us. He, peace be with him, has said, "If Allāh loves a
servant, He enables him to see his own faults."
