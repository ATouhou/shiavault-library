29: the Spider (ankaboot)
=========================

This chapter of seven sections consists of 69 middle Meccan verses
except for the first eleven and the very last one, which date from
Madina. It was revealed after The [East] Romans (OR The Byzantines) 30,
the chapter which follows this one, but before The Cheats 83.

The title comes from the fable on the Spider contained at the end of
section IV which demonstrates how flimsy it is to associate anything
else in our worship of God. It begins with an admonition on the
treatment of parents (I), then mentions Noah, Abraham and offers a
philosophy of history (II). Lot (III) and other prophets follow IV). It
ends with a passage on the duty of Jihad or striving for God's sake
(VII).
