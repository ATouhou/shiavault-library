Evidences on the Authenticity of the Qur’an
===========================================

As the opponents want us to believe, the Holy Qur’an is not the product
of the holy Prophet’s speculation and thinking, rather it is a revealed
book in which every word is the word of the Almighty that was
communicated to the Prophet through the process of revelation. While
historical testimony in this regard is unquestionable, the Qur’an
emphasizes it further with a view of showing the opponents of Islam that
what came out from the sacred lips of the Prophet was a divine
revelation:  
    
***“(This is) the revelation of the book in which there is no doubt,
from the Lord of the worlds. Will they say: ‘He has forged it!’ Nay, it
is the Truth from the Lord ...”. (32:2-3)***  
*** ***  
***“But Allah bears witness that what He has revealed to you (O
Muhammad), He has revealed from His own knowledge, and the angels bear
witness (to it), but sufficient is Allah for witness”. (4:166).***  
*** ***  
***“And you (O Muhammad) did not recite any book before this, nor you
were able to transcribe one with your right hand. In that case, indeed
those who talk vanity could have doubted.” (29:48).***

 Following are some evidences and arguments in brief, to prove the
authenticity of the Holy Qur’an as the word of Allah (swt).
