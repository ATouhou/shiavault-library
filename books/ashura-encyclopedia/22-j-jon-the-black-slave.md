J - Jon, the black slave
========================

He was a servant to Abu Dharr Alghifary, a close companion of Imam Ali.
His full name was John Ibn Jowey. He returned to Madinah after Abu Thar
was banished by the third caliph and became loyal to the Ahlul Bayt.

He was in the service of Imam Ali, Imam Hasan, Imam Husayn, and Imam Ali
Ibn Al-Husayn. He came to Karbala with Imam Husayn and was responsible
for fixing and preparing the swords and various other weapons. He fought
with the Imam until he was killed. The Imam then sat on his dead body
and prayed to Allah for him.
