To the Gentle Reader
====================

You may find, as I have found, that these pages are not enough to
encompass this unique, noble character. No wonder! The ascent is not
easy. So, my excuse is the inability that I have recorded against
myself. However I cannot drive away the inability. Please, after you
have read these pages, bestow your notices upon me to avoid that in
another edition. Indeed, the dearest one of my brothers is he who gives
me my defects as a present.
