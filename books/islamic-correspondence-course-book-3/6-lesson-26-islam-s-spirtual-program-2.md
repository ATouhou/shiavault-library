Lesson 26 : Islam’s Spirtual Program (2)
========================================

**(B) THE DAILY SPIRITUAL TRAINING**

Islam has also provided its followers with a program for spiritual
training on a daily basis. This program is known as salat. Salat is not
a “prayer” in the sense of talking to God whenever, wherever and however
you like.

Salat is an act of worship which must be done in a prescribed manner.
Whenever we use the words “ritual prayer” it refers to salat and not to
“prayer” in the sense explained above.

In appearance, salat is just an act of worship; but with further
insight into the philosophy of salat, you will realize that it is also a
program which trains the Muslims to spiritually strengthen themselves
and to become the masters of their own lives rather than be slaves of
their desires.

It is this aspect of salat which has made it the pillar of Islam. The
Prophet says: “The salat is the pillar of religion.”

While describing the effect which salat should have on the lives of
Muslims, Allah says: “Establish the salat; surely the salat prevents
[the doer] from the indecencies and the forbidden facts].

And surely the remembrance of Allah is great.” (29:45) This verse
clearly says that a true salat would help the doer in staying away from
sins. It is in the light of this verse that the Prophet of Islam
(s.a.w.) said, “The first deed to be checked [on the Day of Judgment]
will be the salat: if it is accepted, then other deeds will also be
accepted; but if it is rejected, then other deeds will also be
rejected.”

What the Prophet meant was that the salat plays a pivotal role in the
life of a Muslim: if his salat was a true salat and had affected his
behaviour,

then there is a great chance that his other deeds will also be good;
but if his salat was just a ritual without any impact on his life, then
there is a lesser chance that his other deeds would be good.

The five daily prayers, provided done with understanding, will not just
be rituals but a program for spiritual upliftment of the Muslim. The
salat will constantly remind him to keep the purpose of life in focus
and work towards it.

That is why the Prophet once asked his companions, “If there is a
stream outside your house and you wash yourself in it five time every
day, then would any dirt remain on your body?” When the answer was
negative, the Prophet said, “Indeed the example of salat is like that
flowing stream — whenever one performs a salat, the sins between the two
prayers are washed away.”6

In this lesson, we will look at just three aspects of salat which can
help us in spiritual training.

**(i) Wuzu: Reminder of Spiritual Purity**

Every Muslim is required to do ritual ablution (wuzu) before salat.
Even this simple ablution is a way of reminding us about spiritual
purification. When we study the two verses of the Qur’an about
ablutions, we see that there are two planes of purification: physical
and spiritual.

Although wuzu and ghusl (the major ablution) are related to physical
purification, there is a more sublime reason underlying these two
ablutions — they serve as a reminder to and gateway of spiritual
purification.

In the chapter al-Baqarah, after talking about one of the major
ablutions, the Qur’an says:

“Surely Allah loves those who oftenly turn to Him, and He also loves
those who cleanse themselves.” (2:222) In another verse, after talking
about wuzu, the Qur’an says:

“Allah does not desire to make any impediment for you; but He desires
to cleanse you, & that He may complete His blessings upon you;

haply you may be grateful” (5:6)

We find two different themes in these verses: First: Allah loves those
who cleanse themselves, and that He desires to cleanse us. Second: He
wants to complete His blessings upon us, and that He loves those who
oftenly turn towards Him. The first theme is 6 Wasa’ilu ‘sh-Shi’a, vol.
3, p. 7.

related to the physical cleanliness, while the second theme is related
to the spiritual purity.

The words of the first theme are very clear; they refer to cleanliness.
But what do the words of the second theme mean? What is the meaning of
“oftenly turning to Allah?” Turning to Allah implies that the person had
turned away from Allah. What does this mean? These are the questions
which I will discuss below.

In the Islamic value system, the human soul is like a light bulb. If
the bulb is protected from dust and dirt, it will enlighten the area
around it; but if dust and dirt is allowed to accumulate on the bulb,
then it will not be able to illuminate the area as much as before.

Similarly, the human soul has to be protected from spiritual ‘dirt’ and
uncleanliness, otherwise it will not be able to guide the person as
rightly as before.

After swearing by the most majestic signs of His creation, Allah says
in chapter 91, verses 1-10 that the pure human soul has the ability to
understand what is right and what is wrong provided it is purified and
uncorrupted.

He makes it clear that the soul, just like the body, is capable of
becoming spiritually impure and unclean. Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) has said, “The
human soul is a precious jewel; whoever protects it, enhances its
(effectiveness), and whosoever degrades it, decreases its
(effectiveness).”

The impurities that can corrupt a human soul are collectively known as
“sins”. Accumulation of sins can indeed render the human soul
spiritually ineffective and, in Qur’anic expression, ‘seize the
heart’.

Allah says, “Whatever (sins) they have committed has seized their
heart.” (83:14) By committing sins, not only is the soul of a Muslim
seized but he also spiritually turns away from Allah. Sins create a
distance between God and man.

Can a person rescue his soul from the seizing of the sins? Can a sinner
spiritually get closer to God? Yes, indeed, a sinful person can
spiritually return to Allah. Returning to Allah means repenting and
asking forgiveness for your sins. Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (a.s.) has
explained this phenomenon as follows: “Each believer has a bright
soul.

When he commits a sin, a dark dot appears on his bright soul. If he
repents, the dark dot will disappear. But if he persists in his sins,
the darkness will increase until it covers the entire soul—then the
person would never return towards goodness.”7

Just as our bodies can become impure by the physical things, our souls
can become impure by sins. To rid our bodies of the physical dirt, we
use water; similarly, to rid our souls of the spiritual impurities, we
use tawbah (repentance). In short, the human soul is corruptible; it is
corrupted by sins; the corrupted soul can be purified by tawbah.

After talking about ritual ablutions which are done by water, Allah
says that “He loves those who do tawbah”. By this He is drawing our
attention to the spiritual purification. So with this insight into the
Qur’anic verses, whenever a Muslim does the ritual ablution, he also
remembers the spiritual purification which is even more important than
the physical purification.

**(ii) Salat Helps in Spiritual Training**

The five daily prayers have different” numbers of cycles known as
rak’ah. Each rak’ah consists of the act of standing while reciting two
short chapters from the Qur’an, the act of bowing and two
prostrations.

The fajr (dawn) prayer consists of 2 cycles.

The zu.hr (noon) prayer consists of 4 cycles.

The ‘asr (afternoon) prayer consists of 4 cycles.

The maghrib (evening) prayer consists of 3 cycles.

The ‘isha (night) prayer consists of 4 cycles. -

One wonders why Islam prescribed a different number of cycles for these
prayers? Why could not they be the same for all ritual prayers?

7 Al-Usul al-Kafi, vol. 2, p. 273.

Many people have attempted to explain it in different ways, but I have
also looked at this question and came to the conclusion that there is no
particular reason for this variety in the number of cycles. It seems
that this difference in the number of cycles was introduced by Islam in
order to create a sense of discipline among the Muslims and to create
the spirit of absolute obedience to the Divine laws.

A Muslim is someone who voluntarily submits himself to Allah. This is
not always easy keeping in mind the trials and tribulations which we are
going through. Praying on a daily basis and following the number of
cycles prescribed by the shari’a without questioning its merit is a way
of instilling in us the spirit of obedience to the laws of Islam.

You must pray in the prescribed manner even if you do not understand
the merit of some of its rules; you should pray with the thought in your
mind that this is how Allah, subhanahu wa ta^ala, wants you to pray.

This will indeed help you in harnessing the power of desires and
emotions within yourself, and help you in getting closer to the purpose
of life — to totally submit ourselves to the will of Allah.

**(iii) Sajdah: Daily Reminder of the Purpose of Life**

Sajdah is the last part in each cycle of salat; it is the part where
you prostrate in such a way that your forehead, both palms, both knees
and the big toes of both feet are touching the ground. Sajdah is to be
done twice in each cycle: one should go into the first sajdah, then sit
upright for a moment, and then go into the second sajdah.

Imam ‘Ali bin Abi Talib (a.s.) was once asked why we have two sajdahs
in each cycle of salat. The reply that the Imam gave shows that sajdah
(like many other parts of the ritual prayer) has a symbolic meaning
also.

He said, “While you are in the first sajdah, you are saying [to God]
‘From it [the earth] You have created me.’

While getting up from the first sajdah, you are saying ‘From it You
have taken me out.’

When you go into the second sajdah, you are saying To it You will
return me.’

While getting up from the second sajdah, you are saying, ‘From it You
will take me out again.”’

In this hadith, the holy Imam has actually applied the following verse
to the sajdah: “From it We have created you, and to it We shall return
you, and from it We shall take you out again.” (20:55) If you study this
hadith carefully, you will realize that:

1. You have been created from the earth. Remembering your origin will
not allow you to be arrogant and proud on the basis of race or wealth.

2. Getting up from the first sajdah is like our birth, going down into
the second sajdah is like death and getting up from the second sajdah is
like resurrection. This symbolic meaning will never let us forget the
day of judgment and the life hereafter.

3. It also shows that this worldly life is symbolically nothing more
than a few moments that you sit between the two sajdahs. This insight
into the philosophy of sajdah will surely transform your salat from a
mere ritual to a practical reminder about your origin, the transient
nature of this world and your ultimate destination in the hereafter.

What you have read above are just three examples from the rules related
to salat which help the Muslims in focusing on the purpose of life and
strengthening themselves spiritually. We thank Allah, subhanahu wa
ta’ala, for providing such means of spiritual training in the daily
rituals of an Islamic life.
