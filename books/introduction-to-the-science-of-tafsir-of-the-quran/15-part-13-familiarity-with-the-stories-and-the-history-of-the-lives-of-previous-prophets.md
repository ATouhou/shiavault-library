Part 13:  Familiarity with the Stories and the History of the Lives of Previous Prophets
========================================================================================

A great portion of the verses of the Qur\`an are in relation to the
history of the previous prophets and we are given a brief insight into
the lives of some of these great men and the ways of their struggles
with the oppressors and tyrants of their time.

Having knowledge of the history of the life of previous nations such as
’Ad and Thamud, or having knowledge of the satanic powers of the
oppressors such as those in Babil [present day Iraq] and the Pharaohs of
Egypt, make the verses which speak of the struggles of the various
prophets such as Hud (‘a), Salih (‘a), Ibrahim (‘a) and Musa (‘a) clear
to us.

Information on the lives of the prophets of the Children of Israel (Bani
Isra’il), especially of prophets Dawud (‘a) and Sulayman (‘a) help us
understand many of the verses of the Qur\`an. In referring to the verses
of the Qur\`an in regards to these two individuals, the truthfulness in
our words (in regards to these two prophets) would be made clear to
everyone.

Of course in this section, we must not give up our prudence and caution
(in conducting research) and must recognize the correct and authentic
reports from the incorrect and unauthentic ones, especially when it
comes to the prophets sent to the Children of Israel and the forged
traditions known as “Isra’ili” narrations, which are large in number and
can never be relied upon.
