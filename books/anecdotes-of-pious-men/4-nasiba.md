Nasiba
======

The deep scar on the shoulder of Nasiba, daughter of Kaab, spoke of a
major wound in the past. Whenever the women, specially of the younger
generation who had not seen the time of the Prophet or were too small at
that time, noticed the cavity in her shoulder, they enquired with
extreme curiosity about the frightening incident which had resulted in
the injury to her shoulder. They loved to hear her adventures in the
battle of Uhud from her own mouth.

She had never imagined that she would fight shoulder to shoulder with
her husband and two sons defending the Prophet in the battle of Uhud.
She had only taken the water-skin on her back so that she could provide
water to the injured and also had taken some home-made bandages to dress
their wounds. She had not thought of herself as worthy of any other work
on that day.

Although the Muslims were small in number and had only a limited supply
of equipments, they gave a grand defeat to the enemy who took to their
heels vacating the battle field. But soon after, due to the negligence
of some men guarding the "Ainain Hills;" the enemy made a surprise
attack from the rear, turning the victory of the Muslims into defeat.
The Muslims surrounding the Prophet fled away, leaving him almost alone
in the battlefield.

When Nasiba saw this precarious situation, she put the water-skin on the
ground, and took a sword in her hand. She fought with the sword and also
made good use of bows and arrows; and took a shield left over by a
fleeing soldier. Once she noticed a man shouting: "Where is Mohammad
himself?" She approached him immediately and inflicted a few blows on
him; but he was double-armored and her attacks had not much effect on
him. He then inflicted such a heavy blow on the shoulder of the
armourless woman that it required treatment for one year.

Noticing a stream of blood gushing from her shoulder, the Prophet called
to one of her sons to immediately dress her wound. He put a bandage over
her shoulder and she again got busy in the battle.

Meanwhile one of her sons got injured. She took out a bandage and
dressed his wound. The Prophet watching the scene smiled at the heroism
of this woman. After dressing her son's wound she instructed him to get
going for the battle. These words were still in her mouth when the
Prophet pointed out a man to her and told her that he was the same man
who had injured her son. She attacked the man like a lioness and
inflicted her sword on his leg. He fell on the ground. The Prophet said,
"Well, thou hast taken thy revenge. Thanks for God who gave the victory
on him and made thy eyes cool."

Many Muslims were martyred and wounded. She herself was severely wounded
and there was no hope of her life.

After the battle of Uhud, the Prophet ordered the wounded Muslims to
pursue the enemy upto Hamra-ul-Asad, to be sure of their intention and
condition. Nasiba also wanted to accompany them but the deep injuries
did not allow her to do so. On returning from Hamra-ul-Asad, the Prophet
before reaching his house, sent someone to enquire about her health and
was pleased to learn that she was alive.
