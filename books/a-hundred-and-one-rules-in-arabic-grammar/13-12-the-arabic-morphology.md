12. The Arabic Morphology.
==========================

At a very early date, the Arab grammarians invented a notation for the
morphological patterns **التصريف** , which represented the three root
radicals**فعل** For those grammarians, the task of morphology was the
breakdown of words into radical and auxiliary consonants**الزوائد** .
The grammarians set up methods to identify the radicals, of which the
most important was**الاشتقاق** , the comparison of the form under
scrutiny with morphologically-related words with the same semantic
content. In line with the idea of the purity of the language, the
semantic extension of an existing word was regarded as the most
appropriate device for expansion of the lexicon. The model for this
procedure was believed to have been given by the language of the Qur'an
itself. Semantic extension became an accepted method of creating new
terminology.
