The Commander of the Faithful, Imam Ali, peace be on him, is the most
distinguished personality of Islam after Prophet Muhammad, peace and
blessings be on him. His entire life is the life of struggle for the
advancement of Islam. He was a great combatant, a great judge, a great
philanthropist and the most pious person of his time. Much has been
written and continues to be written about the life, character and
attributes of Imam Ali.

The present book is an English translation of *Sautu'l \`Adalati'l
Insaniyah,* the biography of the Imam, written in Arabic by George
Jordac, a renowned Christian author of Lebanon. It has gained much
popularity in the Arab and the Muslim world. Many Muslim and non-Muslim
scholars have paid it glowing tributes.

The author is an enlightened man of letters and has written the book
with perfect sincerity. However, at times, he has said things which do
not accord with the facts of history. In such cases necessary
clarification has been made in the foot-notes and at places some
paragraphs have been deleted altogether. Keeping in view the usefulness
and popularity of the Arabic version of this book, the Islamic Seminary
is presenting the English version for the English knowing readers. It is
hoped that this book will enlighten the mind of our conscientious young
generation and will inspire it to form an Islamic social order.
