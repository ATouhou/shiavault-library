5. Jihad System
===============

Allah made *jihad* an obligatory duty on all Muslims to defend
themselves against the enemies of Allah, and to protect their homeland,
religion and interests from the aggression of the infidels and
oppressors.

Allah, the Eternal, says:

***“And fight them until there is no more sedition and the religion be
wholly for Allah...” Holy Qur'an (8:39)***

Allah has made *jihad* obligatory for every able Muslim man when it is
necessary to defend Islam and Islamic homelands against danger. Islam
has also made it obligatory for every human being to carry out jihad
against his own self to defend his soul from envy, jealousy, deceit,
cheating, lying, stealing, and all other evils that attack man's spirit.

*Jihad* achieves victory, power and dignity for the Muslim nation and
rids us of the colonialists and oppressors.
