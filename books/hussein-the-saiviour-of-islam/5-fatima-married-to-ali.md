Fatima Married To Ali
=====================

A DIVINE LADY like F aterna Could not have bceii the wife of any
ordinary man, and more particu1arIy when she was destined to provide the
Divine Plan with the godly characters suitable to be the Universal
Guides to mankind as a whole. Providence had already arranged for the
alliance of this holy One with another one of the same lineage.

"If Ali was not horn, Fatema had none of her set (to maryr with)" said
the Holy Prophet.The Holy Prophet Muhammad was ordained by God to effect
the alliance between his dauW-iter Fatemna and his Vicegercnt Au, so
that through this Holy alliance, may Continue to flow the .Divine Light
in their issues who had been destined to be the Eleven of the Twelve
Princes promised in the seed of Jsbmael (Cien. 17:20). While the Holy
Prophet muham- mad was 'The Prophet' prophesied by Moses, the
'Confurter', the 'Holy Ghost' and the 'Spirit of Truth', prophesied by
Jesus, Ali alona with his Eleven issues was to fulfil the advent of the
Twelve Princes promised in the seed of Ishmae]. Thus Fatema was married
to Ali and through the Holy Alliance of these two divines, came into the
World, Flasan the secoiid holy Imam and Husain the third holy Imam to be
the King of Martyrs to offer the 'Zibhe Azeem' or tne Great Sacrtfice
willed by God, instead of the sacrifice of Ishmael by Abraham
(37:105-108).

" And we called out to him saying 'o' Abraham! 'Thou hust indeed proved
true the dream ; Verily, thus do we reward the righteous. Verily, this
is an open trial; And We have substituted ii with 'Zibhe Azeem' a Great
Sacrifice'!" 37:104-108

Husain's advent dreamt by Lady Ommul Fadhl

A FEW DAYS before the birth of Husain, Lady Ommul Fadhl, the wife of
Abbas Ibne Abdul Muttalib dreamt that a bit of flesh flew from the body
of the Holy Prophet and fell in her lap. When referred to, the Holy
Prophet interpreted the dream telling the Lady Ommul Fadhi that: " A scm
will be born to my daughter Faterna and the Baby will be given to thee
for nursing." According to ibne Shar Aashooh, immediately after the
birth of Husain, Faterna got indisposed and the Baby was given in the
charge of Lady Ommul Fadhl for nursing.

**Husain arrives on Earth**

WITH THE LACK of the correct knowledge about the absolute inde-
pendence of the All-Supreme authority and the dominance of the All-
Pervading will of the Omnipotent Creator Lord of the Universe, and His
being the Author, the Sole Controller and the Independent Regulator of
the laws of nature, man had begun to believe as God also being subject
to the laws instead of the laws being subservient to their Omnipotent
Author.

Many evcnts of guidance to man, about the independent working of the
Omnipotent Will of God, were demonstrated in the birth of many holy
ones,particularly in the advent of some of the prophets of God and the
holy members of the House of the Holy Prophet the (Ahlul-Bait).

1.Yahya - (John son of Zakariah was given a birth in six months in the
inconceivable advanced age of his parents. 2.Jesus - was sent into the
world in six months without the agency of a male partner to his mother
and talked while still a baby in the cradle.

3.Mtthamrnad - (the Last Apostle of God) was born with signs
supernatural, announcing his advent duly circum- cised, with a body not
castina its shadow on earth.

4.Ali - the Vicegerent of Muhammad the Last Apostle of God - born duly
circumcised : A miraculous entrance was divinely caused into the Holy Ka
ba for the confine- ment of his holy mother. He could be present at more
than one place at one and the same time. His godly strength amazed tile
world as his exclusive miracles and many other super - natural powers
with mystic signs and miraculous events, which facts are unbelievable
today by the materialists, but they are authentic.

5. Fatema- The Lady of Light- was heard glorifying God, in her
pregenetal state.

6. Hasan- son of Ali and Fatema- was born duly circumci- sed with
extraordinary cleanliness of birth without the natural signs which
ordinarily accompany the conception and the delivery of a human child.

7. Husain- was given a clean birth duly circumcised as that of his
brother Hasan, and was born like Yahya (John) and Jesus, in six
months.

The miraculous birth of Jesus without a male partner to his mother the
Virgin Mary, was nothing but to prove to the people of the age and to
inform mankind as a whole that the laws of nature as understood by man
with his conceptual limitations, do not bind the Omnipotent Lord who is
Himself the Originator of nature and the Independent Reulator of its
laws 36:82, 2:113, 16:40, 19:35, 40:68. His command when He intends
anything to say it to BE and there it IS.

Much has been made of Jesus birth without a father, by the christian
church, inspite of its very Holy Book the Bible saying that Jesus
said:-

"I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise children unto
Abraham." Luke 3:8

When God can raise human children from stones, where is the reason to
call any child as the son of God; if it was brought forth from a human
being (Mary) a woman who by nature was a child - bearer. Our christian
brethren hail Jesus as the Son of God, while Jesus himself calls himself
a son of man. (Luke.7 :34)

And if Jesus had ever called himself as son of God, he had called Adam
also the son of God (Luke 3:38). The term son will mean the chosen
servant of God, and not an issue of God.

About the independent execution of the Omnipotent Creative Will of God,
the Holy Qur'an says:-

"He (God) Createth whatsoever He willeth". 42:49 Qur'an further asserts
that God Creates whatever He Wills, which mankind does not know. "He
(God), Createth what ye know not." 16:8

There are many such assertions in the Holy Qur'an referring to the
various aspects of the independent execution of the divine will.

On Thursday the 3rd of Shaban in the fourth year of Hijrat i.e., the
Migration of the Holy Prophet from Mecca to Madina, Husain arrived on
earth, with super natural signs which have usually accompanied the birth
of some chosen ones of God. Jesus, as a Jew, through his mother Mary, in
the lineage of Isaac son of Abraham, according to the covenant of God
(Gen. 17:23, 21:40) was circum- cised on the 8th day of his birth (Luke
2:21) whereas every male member of the Holy Ahlul-Bait (The Holy Prophet
and the Twelve Imams) in the lineage of Ishmael the first son of
Abraham, was born duly circumcised, i.e., with the Abrahamie covenant
already fulfilled even in the very native formation of their holy
bodies.

When Hasan the first son of Ali and Faterna, was born, the Holy Prophet
was out of Madina, on a defensive expedition, and had left word that if
a child is born to his daughter in his absence, the baby be not fed with
anvth ing until his return, but since his return the Holy Prophet said
it is oniy the will of the Lord that is done. Just before the birth of
Husain also the Holy Prophet was to leave Madina but this time he
desired that whatever time it takes for his return, until then the baby
should not be fed. When Husain was born the Holy Prophet came to Fatema
and takina the baby (Husain) In his lap, mysteriously placed his tongue
in the mouth of the Baby, and theflahv began sucking it and thus the
Holy Child was first fed by the Saliva of the Apostle of God, as the
first sustenance of his holy body in this world.

After giving the Holy Baby the first feeding by his Saliva, the Holy
Prophet said :-

" Husainun minni wa and minal Husain."

Husain is of me and I am of Husain."

Husain's Martyrdom Prophesied

WHEN HUSAIN WAS born Gabriel the Messenger Anacl appeared before the
Holy Prophet and after paying his respects to the Apostle of God,
said:-

"0" the Most beloved one of God; The Alnighty Lord presents his
blessings and felicitations to thee, and wills that thou shouldst
felicitate Ali and Fatema On the birth of the baby, and the baby be
named Husain, for he is known in heavens with this name."

Sating this the Angel stopped with some symptoms of concern. The Holy
Prophet said :-

"Brother Gabriel, if this he a felicitation to us what is the other
matter of any serious concern ?" The Angel continued saying:-

"0" Prophet of God, it is for the newly born son of Lady Fatema, for
lie will suffer innumerable difficulties, miseries, tortures, wounds and
pains of bitterest nature. He will at last he martyred with all his
faithful supporters in a desert called Karbala on the banks of the
Euphrates in lraq, it will be a time when Islam will be in a crisis and
the existence of this revealed religion for Mankind will rest upon the
sacrifices of Husain, your grandson.

Hearing this the Holy Prophet naturally felt sorrowful. It can easily
be imagined by the reader how Lady Fatema, the mother of Husain, would
have felt when she heard of the calamities to befall the dear one just
arrived in her lap.

Immediately after the birth of Husain, Fatema was indisposed and the
Holy Baby was given to Lady Ommul Fadhl for nursing and for forty days
consecutively the Apostle of God used to place his holy finger in the
mouth of the innocent and thus the Holy Baby was sustained for forty
days without any thing else, even the mother's milk. It is inferred by
great divines that it was the pre- determined Divine Process to
condition the Holy Child with the divinity endowed in the apostolic
physic of its Holy Grandfather the Chief and the Last of the apostles of
God for Husain had to play an apostolic role on behalf of his
Grandfather to save the Truth, Islam.

**Husain a Duplicate Muhammad**

HIST0RlANS REPORT THAT besides the native endowments identical with
those of the Holy Prophet, the outward appearancb (i.e., the physical
features) of Husain was a moving picture of his Grandfather the Holy
Prophet.

Ibne Katheer says " I never saw a more beau qful man than Husain" and
according to Anas " there was none other resembling the holy Prophet
more than Husain."

The function of heredity had its full play in Husain. He had inherited
all the divine native endo~vments from his Grandfather the Holy Prophet,
and his godly parents Au and Fatema.

" Warna flu aaba to nt 1bul anbiya "

"i.e., Whatever is in their parentage, inherit the apostles. "

**Heaven's Regard for Hasan and Husain**

ONCE WHEN HASAN and Husain were young children, on the eve of a
festival, came both the innocents to their holy mother Lady Faterna and
said "Mother dear! Tomorrow is 1,efestival, where are our new dresses
for the festival day?" What was there in the holy house of the godly
family the inmates of which often starved, for Fatema to provide her
dear ones with any ne~v garments when her own covering mantle was full
of patches with the date leaves. With Fidak confiscated by the Kalifate,
the daily life of the Ahlul Bait was rendered further more miscrable.
The hoW lady who always depended upon the Al- merciful Lord, said:-

" My darlings,if the tailor brings them, ye will hat e them
tomorrow."

At night when the two innocents had gone to bed, Fatema was on her
prayer-mat, supplicating to the Lord saying:-

" Lord! Fatema Thy subscn ient one depending upon Thy usual grace and
mercy on her, has promised new clothes to her innocents who are Thine
OWn!. My Lord! If they get the new clothes they will he happy and Thou
wilt Thyself be pleased on their rejoicing Lord ! let not The word ofThy
Fatemafail and let not Thy Hasan and Husaita he sorrowful on the
festitval tomorrow."

Imad Zadeh in his famous work says:-

" Early at dawn, the Holy Innocents awoke and the first thing they
asked their mother was about the dresses promised to them. Fatcma could
have given only some excuse but a voice at the door was heard saving:-"
0' AhIul Bait of the Holy Prophet- here are the dresses offlasan and
Husain." Fatema received the dresses and offered her thanksgiving prayer
to the Lord for the ready response to her supplication. Allama Majlisi
relates from Omme Salema the righteous wife of the Holy Prophet that she
said:-

"I saw Hasan and Husain with the Holy Prophet in such new clothes which
I had never seen before and asked wherfrom the woonderfully beautifull
clothes of his grandsons had come; in reply the Holy Prophet said- '
They are the heavenly garments received for them'?" (ZH) Imad Zadeh.

Once Fatema was asleep and the Holy Baby (Husain) in the cradle awoke
and cried, the cradle automatically began swinging, when Fatema awoke
she saw the cradle moving and some one talking to the Baby and flOflC
seen nearby. She referred the matter to the Holy Prophet who said that
it was the Arch Angel Gabriel who was serving the holy child.

(Muntahal Aamaal, Shaikh Abbas-e-Khummi)
The above references are only two of the many instances of the shower
of heavenly favours on this Holy Family.

**The Holy Prophet's Personal Regard for Husain**

HISTORIANS SAY THAT once on the morning of a festival day, while going
to the Id Prayer (Festival congregational Prayer) in Madina, the whole
public of the town saw the Holy Prophet carrying Hasan and Husain on his
shoulders, bare-headed with the tassels of his head, divided into two
parts, each held by each of the innocents, as the reins of a camel in
their tiny hands, and the Holy Prophet running towards the 'Idgah' ,
imitating a camel. The public was amazed at this mysterious behaviour on
the part of the Apostle of God and a man seeing this, addressed the holy
children saying: ' How excellent a ride ye have.' The Holy Prophet
turning to the man said: " Why doth thou not say, how excellent 11w
Riders are?" On many other instances, Hasan and Husatn were found on the
shoulders of the Holy Prophet. (F.M., ST., YM.)

It is reported that once when the Holy Prophet was on the pulpit in the
Mosque in Madina, giving a sermon when Husain who was yet a baby,
entered the Mosque and proceeded towards his grandfather, and his
garment got twisted in his feet, the Holy Prophet stopped the sermon and
rushed from the pulpit to the holy baby lest it might fall.

It is also one of the universally acknowledged events of the life
history of the Holy Prophet that once when he was prostrating in prayer
in the Mosque, Baby Husain came and getting over the back of his
Grandfather the Holy Prophet, sat on it. The Holy Prophet repeated the
prayer-phrase "Subhaana - Rabbiyal- a'la wa behamdeh' seventy times in
the state of prostration instead of the only three prescribed
repetitions, until Husain himself, of his own accord, got down from his
back and then he raised his head from the prostration.

Shaibani reports from Abdullah ibne Shaddad that his father related
that he was in prayer in the ranks behind the Holy Prophet and when he
found that the duration of the prostration was unusually long, he raised
his head several times and secing the Hoiy Prophet still in prostration,
resumed the prostration, and after the conclusion of the prayer, he
asked the cause of the unusual in - terval between the two prostrations.
The Holy Prophet replied that he had to do it until Husain got down from
his back of his own accord, the Apostle of God acteth not but at the
Revealed wi1l of the Lord.

(Tafseerul Osool-ila Jama-e-Osool e-Shaibani)

Historians have reported numerous other similar intances of mysterious
behaviour on the part of the Holy Prophet, with regard to Husain in
particular:

Once, the Holy Prophet was with his baby grandson, Husain and his baby
son Ibrahim. The Messenger Angel appeared and said: "0' Apostle of God!
It is the Will of the Lord thou shalt have any one of them, either
Husain or Ibrahim and not both, whichever thou desirest, will be taken
away from thee-"

The Holy Prophet said : " Let Ibrahim be taken away and Husain be
spared. I need him for the preservation of Islam." Thus Ibrahim was
taken away (died).

(Almustaqsi- from Habibus Siyar)

The Declaration of the Holy Prophet about Husain SALMAN-E FARSI SAYS '
I saw, one day, Husain seated beside his Grandfather the Holy Prophet,
who was addressing Husain saying:- " Thou art a Syed (Chief), son of a
Syed, and the fathter of the Syeds. Thou art an Imam, (Heavenly guide),
son of an Imam, the father of Imams. Thou art a Hujjat and the father of
nine Hujjats in thy seed and the ninth will be the 'Oayam' of them (the
standing, i.e., the ever current authority).

Said the Eighth Holy Imam Ali ibne Musa Ar-Riza, that the Holy Prophet
said :-

" Let him who wants to see the most loved one of the people of the
earth, and in heaven, see Husain."

Shaikh-e-Sadooq reports from Huzaif-e-Yamani who said:- " I saw the
Holy Prophet holding the hand of Husain and saying '0' people! Know ye,
this Husain son of Ali and Fatema, know him, ye all, that by the One
(God) in Whose hands is my soul, that he (Husain) is of heaven, his
friends will be the inmates of heaven."

The following is the famous sayings of the Holy Prophet:- Hasan and
Husain are the Two youths of Paradise; Hasan and Husain are Imams,
(divinely commissioned guides) standing or sitting (i.e., in any
circumstances, being accepted by the people or not). These are only one
or two of the innumerable other sayings of the Holy Prophet,
particularly about the unique heavenly position and the status of
Husain.

While judging the words and the action of the Holy Prophet, one must
remember the following verse of the Holy Qu'ran " And he (the Holy
Prophet) speaketh nothing of his desire save, it is the re- velation
revealed (to him)." 55:3, 4 It is quite obvious that all this was the
Divine Plan to demons- trate to mankind, the actual unique position of
the issues of All and Fatema, particularly the holy status of Husain,
lest thereafter, none who misbehaves with these holy ones, gets the
excuse to say that he did not know as to who actually they were.

The instances of the open acts of the heavenly regard for the
'Ahlul-Bait' , demonstrating their unique divine position, are so many
that volumes will be needed to enumerate them all. These few brief
references will do, to bring home to any sincere one, the idea about the
unique excellence and the greatness of the holy souls and the degree of
the divinity endowed in them.
