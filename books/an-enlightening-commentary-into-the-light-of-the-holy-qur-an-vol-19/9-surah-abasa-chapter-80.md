***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

Surah Abasa is short, but contains various important subjects, which
especially emphasize on the Resurrection and can be summarized under
five topics:

1. Allah’s serious admonishment to the one who did not show suitable
behavior to a truth‑seeking blind man.

2. The importance of the Holy Qur'an.

3. Man's ungratefulness toward the blessings of Allah.

4. A partial description about His blessings in the field of nutrition
for Men and animals in order to stimulate a sense of thankfulness.

5. Some hints about the terrible incidents of the Day of Judgment' and
the fate of the believers and unbelievers on that Day.

The name of the Surah is derived from its first verse.

The Virtue in Studying this Surah
---------------------------------

A tradition from Prophet Muhammad (S) says:

*“One who studies Surah 'Abasa will arrive at the Gathering Place
smiling and rejoicing will arrive at the Gathering Place smiling and
rejoicing on The Day of Judgment.”*

### The Occasion of Revelation

These words show that Allah has blamed someone for an action which gave
superiority to a man or men of wealth rather than to a blind man who was
seeking the truth. But who was the admonished one? There are a variety
of ideas on this subject, but the most famous commentary among the
scholars is the following:

Once the Prophet (S) was deeply engaged in trying to explain the Holy
Qur'an to some pagan Quraish leaders such as 'Atabat‑ibn‑i‑Rabi 'ah,
Abu‑Jahl, 'Abbas‑ibn‑'Abdul‑Mutallib and some others. He was hopeful
that it would attract them to Islam, and in so doing, surely a lot of
others would come to Islam, too. And therefore, put an end to their
sabotage. But, suddenly, he was interrupted by a blind man;

‘Abdullah‑ibn‑Ummi‑Maktum, who was apparently poor, so that no one took
notice of him. He wanted to learn the Qur'an and asked the Prophet (S)
to teach him. He repeated his statement again and again, because he did
not know exactly whom he was talking to.

The Holy Prophet (S) naturally did not like the frequent interruptions
and this was seen on his face.

*“These Arab leaders”,*

he said to himself

*“may think of Muhammad as a Prophet of the poor and the blind."*

Then he turned away from 'Abdullah and continued the work at preaching
Allah’s Message to them.

At that moment he received the new verses stated above, which admonished
the Prophet (S) for this action. Afterwards, he always held 'Abdullah in
high honor, and whenever he saw him he used to tell him

*“Hail to the one for whom Allah admonished me.”*

And, then, he questioned the man:

*“Is there anything that I can do for you?”*

The blind man became a true and sincere Muslim and as a direct
appointment by the Prophet, himself, become a governor of Medina on two
occasions when the Prophet (S) went to battle.

A second opinion about this revelation is given for these verses, which
is that a man from the Umayyads was sitting with the Prophet Muhammad
(S) when 'Abdullah‑ibn Ummi‑Maktum arrived. When this man saw 'Abdullah,
he frowned and turned his back to him, as if he might become infected by
him.

The aforementioned verses were about the man sitting with the Prophet
(S) and the admonishment was for him. It has been narrated that Imam
Sadiq (as) agreed with this opinion when he was asked about this
occasion of revelation. The late Sayyed Murtaza, the great scholar of
Islam, approved with this occasion of revelation, as well.

There is nothing, of course, in the verse, itself, to show clearly that
the one who is addressed is Muhammad (S).

The only sign may be found in verses 8 to 10 where they say:

***“But as to him who comes to you striving hard,”***

***“And he fears (Allah in his heart).”***

***“Of him wast thou unmindful.”***

This is the matter that can be true about the Prophet (S) more than
anyone else. But, according to what 'Sayyed Murtaza' has said, there are
some signs in the verses showing that 'the one' is not the Prophet (S).
Some of them are as follows:

'To be frowning' was not one of the Prophet’s character traits,
especially for the Prophet of Islam. He spoke gently and with a kind
face even to his own enemies and was even more kind to the truth‑seeking
believers.

Moreover, paying attention to the wealthy people and neglecting, the
poor is not agreeable, at all, with what is said about him in Surah
Qalam, No. 68, verse 4 which says:

***“And thou (standst) on an exalted standard of character",***

(with the particular note that Surah Qalam had been revealed before the
revelation of Surah Abasa).

But, supposing the first occasion of revelation is true, this act is not
more than 'leaving to the better' /tark‑i‑'ula/ and there is nothing in
it that contrasts with the state of sinlessness.

Since, first, the purpose of the Prophet (S) was definitely to absorb
the Quraish leaders in order to spread Islam and to stop their sabotage.

Secondly, it does not matter so much to frown at a blind man because he
cannot see. Moreover, 'Abdullah‑ibn‑Ummi‑Maktum did not keep the rules
of etiquette, since, he should not have interrupted the Prophet (S) when
he was busy talking to the people who were gathered there.

On the one hand, since Allah’s emphasis is on love and affection for the
poor and the afflicted, among the believers, it does not approve of the
little amount of heedlessness from His prophet to that believing
servant, so He admonishes him.

On the other hand, if we consider the Prophet (S) as a true, great
prophet, from these verses we see that they are almost a miracle,
because the great leader of Islam mentions such important
responsibilities in the heavenly Holy Book, about himself, that he finds
the slightest 'leaving to the better' an option: i.e. the little amount
heedlessness to a blind truth‑seeking believer, which Allah admonish him
for.

This is an evidence for the fact that this Book is from Allah and he is
a true prophet, because if the Book were not from Allah, surely it would
not have such content.

A more astonishing matter is that according to the above mentioned
narration, whenever the Prophet (S) saw 'Abdullah‑ibn‑Ummi‑Maktum, he
remembered the occasion a honored him very much.

The other aspect, which the verses contain, is that of the Islamic
culture in relation to the behavior shown to the oppressed and to the
arrogant: as to how it considers the blind, poor believer in comparison
to those rich, powerful pagan Arab leaders. This clearly shows that
Islam is a support for the oppressed and is against the arrogant.

In conclusion, we repeat that though the first thought about the
occasion of this revelation is well‑known among the commentators, it
should be confessed that there is nothing vivid, in the verse, to prove
the idea that the Prophet (S) is the clear target of the admonition.

### Harsh Admonition For Heedlessness Shown to a Truth‑Seeking Blind man

Keeping in mind what was said about the first idea regarding the
occasion of revelation of the verses, we will now discuss the given
commentary.

***“He Frowned and turned away”.***

***“Because there came to him the blind man”.***

***“And what would make you know that he might (spiritually) purify
himself”.***

***“Or become reminded so that the reminder might profit him?”***

The reminder can be, at least, an advice to him. If it does not affect
him to be really virtuous, it may make him aware and this awareness
would change him a little.

***“As to one who regards himself as self‑sufficient”***

***“To him do you address yourself!”***

And 'you' insist on guiding him, but he is entangled with pride due to
his wealth and selfishness.

It is the pride from which rebellion and disobedience originate, as
Surah Alaq, No. 96, verses 6‑7 say:

***"Nay, most surely man does transgress (all bounds),”***

***“For he thinks himself self‑sufficient”.***

***“Though it is no blame on you if he would not (spiritually) purify
himself”.***

It is for 'you' only to deliver His message; they may take its advice or
merely become annoyed. Therefore, you should not neglect the
truth‑seeking blind man or annoy him for the sake of the rich leaders,
although you mean to guide them.

***“But as to him who comes to you striving hard,”***

***“And he fears (Allah in his heart)”***

The very motive, fear of Allah, has forced him to come to you in order
to hear some truth and, thereafter, employ them in order to purify
himself and grow in understanding.

***"Of him wast thou unmindful."***

Indeed, the term /anta/ 'you, thee' is used to say that a person, such
as the Prophet, should not divert himself, even for a moment, from such
a truth‑seeking man and should not pay attention to others although he
definitely wanted to guide them, because the priority is given to that
of the pure‑hearted oppressed.

In any case, this reproachful speech, whether to the Prophet (S) or to
anyone else, clearly states the fact that Islam and the Qur'an give a
special high regard to the servants of Allah, particularly to those of
the oppressed.

Also, Islam takes a severe position against those who are intoxicated
and become proud from the abundance of Allah’s blessings, so much so
that Allah is not content if the least annoyance is caused to the
truth‑seeking oppressed, because of giving attention to the affluent.

The reason is clear: such a message works first amongst the simple and
lowly, the poor and despised folk, and the mighty ones, of the earth
only come around when the masses stream in like an irresistible force.
The oppressed always support Islam, sincerely, helping the great leaders
of the religion in their affairs, and are the candidates of the battle
fields “or martyrdom.

As Imam Ali (as) said in his famous order to Malik‑i‑Ashtar:

*"...While the common men, the poor and apparently the less important
section of your subjects are the Islam; of Islam; they are the real
assemblage of Muslims and the power and defensive force against the
enemies of Islam. Keep an open mind for them, be more friendly with them
and secure their confidence and sympathy.”*

### Only the Purified Ones Can Touch the Qur'an

In connection with the aforementioned verses, which spoke about
admonishing the one who was unmindful of a truth‑seeking blind man,
these verses are about the importance of the Qur'an, its pure origin,
and the efficient effect it has on individuals.

Advising the one who was unmindful not to repeat this action again, it
says:

***"Nay, surely it is an admonishment.”***

‘You’ do not need to pay attention to those who are, apparently, gifted
and self‑sufficient and are, subsequently, proud, while neglecting the
purified oppressed.

It, is, also probable that the verse:

***“Nay, surely it is an admonishment”***

could be an answer to all accusations the pagans and the enemies of
Islam uttered about the Qur'an. They called it 'a poetry', 'a magic',
and sometimes 'a kind of soothsaying'. The Qur'an demands that none of
them are right, but that these verses of Qur'an are reminders for
acknowledgment, awareness and faith. It contains the proofs and
documents in itself. The people who approach it can get the facts,
themselves, except its enemies.

***“So let him who pleases, mind it”.***

This points to both the lack of obligation, and an evidence to exercise
of free‑will for everyone ‑ that is, no one can obtain its merits unless
one wishes to and makes the decision to follow its guidance.

***“(It is) in Books held (greatly) in honor,”***

The term /suhuf/ is the plural form of /sahifah /which means 'tablet' or
'sheet' or 'anything on which something can be written'. This shows that
the verses of Qur'an had been written on some tablets before they were
revealed to the Prophet (S), and the angels of revelation possessed
them, therefore, it means that the tablets were in a very high position.

Some views have held that /suhuf/ means 'the Books of earlier prophets
(as),' which does not seem agreeable with its pre and post verses. Some
have also said that it means 'the Preserved Tablet', but this idea does
not seem suitable, either, because /suhuf/ is in a plural form and has
not been used in the form of 'the Preserved Tablet'.

***“Exalted (in dignify) kept pure and holy”.***

It is beyond the reach of the aberrant ones; they cannot distort it; it
is pure and kept far from tainted hands. Finally, it is pure from any
contradiction, discrepancy and doubt.

Moreover, they are:

***“In the hand of scribes,”***

who are:

***“Honorable and pious and just.”***

The term /safarah/ is the plural form of /safir/ based on /safar/, which
originally means 'to unveil a matter or a thing', so, one who comes unto
people with a special mission; to remove their difficulties and uncover
the ambiguous matters for them is called /safir/ 'an ambassador'. A
writer is also called /safir/ since he or she uncovers the meaning of a
matter.

Therefore, /safarah/ means 'the Divine angels who reveal Messages or
write them down'.

A narration from Imam Sadiq (as) says:

*“One who learns the whole Qur'an by heart and acts accordingly is with
the scribes, honorable and pious and just”.*

This clearly shows that those who know the Qur'an by heart,
commentators, and those who act according to its instructions are in the
same rank as the scribes. And it is a fact that when scholars and those
who learn the Qur'an by heart, or preserve it, do something similar to
what the angels and bringers of revelation do, then, they should be
counted among them.

It is understood that, on the whole, any Muslim who tries to protect and
keep the Holy Qur'an alive deserves a position as high as that of the
'honorable and pious angels'.

The term /kiram/ is the plural form of /karim/ which means 'honorable,
or beneficent' and refers to the greatness of the angels of revelation.

It is sometimes said that it refers to their pureness of any sin, as
Surah Anbiya, No. 21, verses 26‑27 say about the angels:

***"...Nay, they are honored servants, ''***

***“They do not precede Him in speech and (only) according to His
commandment do they act”.***

The term /bararah/ is the plural form of /bar/ based on /bar/ which
originally means 'vastness', then, 'a vast land' is called /barr/, and
since good people's generosity is vast and benefits many others, they
are called /bar/.

The term

***'pious'***

used in this verse, of course, means 'obedient to His Command' and
'sinlessness'. Thus Allah characterizes the angels in three ways: first,
they are His agents for His revelations, second, they are naturally
pious and honorable; and third, they are pure, obedient and sinless.

Though there are so many signs of guidance from Allah in His

***'Books held (greatly) in honor'***

containing all kinds of reminders revealed by the angels, the ungrateful
man does not resign himself to Him, hence, it says:

***“Cursed be man! how ungrateful is he!”***

The term /kufr/, may mean 'disbelief’ or 'ingratitude' or 'any covering
and denial of Allah', which can be suitable, here, because, in the last
verses it refers to the signs of guidance and faithfulness, and in the
next verses it mentions the different kinds of blessings from Allah.

In any case, the objective point of

***"Cursed be man!"***

is to express an intensive hatred toward the ungrateful ones.

Since the origin of disobedience and ungratefulness is generally pride,
then to break it, the next verse says:

***"Of what thing did He create him?"***

***"Of a sperm‑drop He created him, then molded him in due
proportions".***

Why does man not think about the origin of his creation? Why does he
forget his main source? Moreover, why does he not take note of Allah’s
ability in the creation of this strange creature from a sperm‑drop? If
he contemplated on his creation from a sperm‑drop and, then, about the
formation of his body and its limbs, and his faculties and abilities and
even his necessities of life being in a suitable proportion, it could be
the best guidance for his theological and divine knowledge.

The term

***/qaddarahu/, 'He molded him in due proportions'***

is based on /taqdir/ which means 'the act of measuring and
well‑balancing'.

We know that there are more than twenty metals and metalloids in the
human body, each of which is at a determined level from the point of
quantity and quality. If these levels change to a lower or a higher
degree, the regularity of the body's chemistry will be disturbed.

Besides this, the condition of the body's structure and the relations
between its organs, have exact limits. The intellect and instincts
hidden in an individual, alone, and in human beings, all together, must
be in a special arrangement to provide for man's happiness.

Allah is He Who fulfilled all the above proportions for the worthless
life‑germ in the form of a sperm‑drop. The life‑germ is so small that if
we gathered, together, as many of them as the number of human beings,
which exists today, they would not amount to a thimbleful. Yes, He
designed so many colorful characteristics and embellishments on and in
such a slight, tiny particle, and from this created a creature such as
man.

The term /taqdir/ has been defined as: 'to make ready' by some
commentators. It is also probable that the meaning of /taqdir/ is 'to
make the unworthy life‑germ powerful'. How great is the Creator Who
makes this feeble substance so powerful; Who puts the sky, the earth and
the seas at his disposal, and enables him to conquer all the forces of
his surroundings.

Of course, all three of the above comments can be considered, together,
also.

***"Then He made the way easy for him”.***

Allah made the way for the fetus to develop in its mother's womb, and
then made the way for moving to this world, easy for man.

One of the wonders of man's birth is that a few moments before the time
of nativity the child is so located in the mother's womb that usually
its head is right side up, its face is to the mother's back and its feet
are toward the down side of the womb; but when the time of birth comes,
the child turns upside down so that its head is downwards, and this very
position makes the birth easier for both the child and its mother.

There are, of course, exceptions where some children are born under
various complications and, therefore, their mothers encounter many
difficulties.

Allah has made everything easy for him: after his birth he grows during
his childhood, then his human instincts grow, and after that he grows
along the path of faith and spiritual perfection by way of guidance from
the prophets (as) and by his own reasoning.

***“Then He made the way easy for him”.***

What a completely meaningful and interesting sentence this is! It is
very short, but it alludes to so many facts!

Another point which is noteworthy is that it says:

***"Then He made the way easy for him”.***

It does not say: 'Then He forced him to go the way'. This is an
emphasis, again, on man's free‑will.

Further, it declares the end of man's life and says:

***"Then He caused him to die, then assigned to him a grave”.***

Surely, the act of 'putting to death' belongs to Allah, but the act of
covering the corpse, in a grave, apparently belongs to man, however, the
required intelligence, for this action and, also, the other necessary
means for it have been supplied by Allah, and that is why the assigning
of a grave has been attributed to Allah too.

Some commentators have also said that the objective point of attributing
the action to Allah is that He has created a grave for man which is
under the ground, while some others have thought of it as a religious
instruction, from Allah, about the burial of corpses.

One of the graces of Allah to human beings is the very burial of
corpses. If they did not know what to do with their corpses or if there
were not any instructions issued about the burial of corpses, the
corpses would humiliatingly remain putrid on the ground, and the beasts
and birds would feast on them, which would be a horrible debasement.
Therefore, Allah’s graces are bestowed on man; not only during his
lifetime, but even after his death.

Moreover, the instruction for burying the corpses of people (after the
ceremonial bath, shroud, and prayer) is an inspirational one, because it
is to say that the dead bodies of human beings must be purified and
respected, even more than their live ones, because live people have the
responsibility of keeping themselves pure.

Another noteworthy point is that the situation of death, in this verse,
is counted among the blessings of Allah. This is really true if we care
to understand, because, first, death is a release from the troubles and
imperfections of this world and a close to the probationary period.

After which will dawn the full Reality in a world so much broader than
this world. Secondly, the death of the present generations makes room
for the later generations, and causes mankind to continue to live and to
improve, or else the human population would reach such extremes that
would be impossible for them to live on Earth.

It is interesting that this very idea is delicately mentioned in Surah
Rahman, No. 55, verse 26‑28 thus:

***“Everything on earth will pass away;”***

***“And there will endure the Face of your Lord, the Lord of Glory and
Honor.”***

***"Then which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?”.***

There, again, according to these verses, death is one of the great gifts
from Allah.

Yes, the world, with all its blessings, is a prison for a believer.

Moving from this world to the next world is a release from this prison.
Besides, the abundance of blessings, in this world, sometimes causes
people to neglect their position, then, the remembrance of death may
awaken them, therefore, from this point of view, too, it is a blessing.
If all of the past events of life were always alive, it would certainly
be tiresome to continue it, but the immortal life, on the contrary, will
be thoroughly full of joy and happiness.

Then, our attention is turned to the Resurrection of the human race,
and, it says:

***"Then when it is His will, He will raise him to life again."***

The term /inŝaraha/ is based on /inŝar/ which means 'to spread abroad
after gathering'. It is an interesting point which shows that the life
of man is totally gathered up by death, but it will be spread out,
again, through Resurrection in a higher and greater environment.

It is worthy to note that for 'death' and for 'burial' it says:

***“Then He caused him to die, then assigned to him a grave",***

but for Resurrection it says:

***"When it is His will, He will raise him to life again"***

and this makes it clear that no one knows the time of the Great Event
(The Resurrection), but, it is only Allah, Who knows it, and death is an
inevitable event where everyone, after living a willy‑nilly natural
life, will die.

The last verse of this group says that although these blessings and
stages have been provided by Allah’s grace, for the good of man, (from
the time he was a lowly sperm‑drop to the time he arrived in this world
and went on the path of growth and, finally, passed away and was covered
with dust in the grave), unregenerate man fails in carrying out the
purpose of his creation and life:

***"Nay, but (man) has not done what He commanded him".***

The term /lamma/ is usually used with a negative meaning when something
is still expected. It touches on this sense that man, having these
divine gifts and the means of guidance, is expected to be earnest m
obeying Allah and acting on His commands, but surprisingly he has not
done it yet.

The following are two different ideas about the meaning of the term
'man' used in this verse:

The first idea says that it alludes to the persons who go the path of
ungratefulness, denial, and injustice and corresponds with Surah
Ibrahim, No. 14, verse 34 which says:

***“...most surely man is very unjust, very ungrateful.”***

The second idea says that it refers to all of mankind, because no one
(irrespective of believers and unbelievers) has accurately carried out
what Allah has commanded him to do, to the extent that it deserves the
greatness of His glory and dignity; as a Persian poem says:

Servants of Allah should ask Him to excuse them for their short comings.

Else, no one is able to do according to his Lordship.

### Man Should Look At His food!

Since the aforementioned verses allude to the Resurrection and the next
verses also refer more vividly to this very matter, it seems that these
verses are a proof for the Resurrection. By explaining Allah’s authority
over all things and, also, reviving the dead lands by sending down rain,
which is a resurrection in itself for plants, proves the possibility of
Resurrection.

By the way, since these verses mention the different kinds of
nourishment that Allah has given to man and his cattle, they call him to
thank Allah and pay heed to the knowledge of Him.

First, it says:

***“Then let man look to his food;”***

and considers how Allah has produced it.

The closest exterior substance, to man, is his food which, after some
changes, is easily absorbed and becomes part of his body, therefore, if
he cannot obtain it he will perish. That is why the Qur'an, among all
things, puts emphasis on the nourishment; especially those produced from
trees and plants.

It is clear that the aim of saying 'look to' is not a simple look, but
it means with deep care and contemplating on the vital elements and
wonderful structure of the nourishment, and the surprising effects they
have on him, so, consequently, he should think about the Creator, Who
has created them.[^1]

There is the idea which says that it may mean 'a superficial look, a
look which stimulates the salivary glands and, as a result, helps the
digestion'. This seems improbable because, in comparison with its pre
and post verses, the verse does not carry such a meaning at all; but
some food scientists look at the contents of the Qur'an with their own
narrow view points, then, it is natural for them to have an idea like
that about the verse.

Some others believe it to mean that when one sits at the table to eat,
one must look carefully at the foods to see how they are prepared,
whether they are permitted or forbidden, lawful or unlawful and, thus,
one may consider the moral and religious aspects in eating.

In some narration’s from the sinless Imams, the term

***/ta'am/ ‘food',***

here, means 'knowledge', the sustenance of man's soul, then, one should
be careful and 'look' at Whom he has taken it from.

Among these is a narration from Imam Muhammad Baqir (as) for the
commentary of the above verse, which says:

*“Be careful from where and from whom you get your information.”*

Another narration, similar to this, has been quoted from Imam Sadiq
(as).

Undoubtedly, the apparent meaning of the verse is about the bodily foods
which are described in later verses, but the soul's sustenance can
analogically be understood from it, since man is a combination of soul
and body; as his body needs bodily food so his soul requires spiritual
sustenance, as well.

When man should be careful about his bodily nourishment, and knows of
its origin which, according to the next verses, is life‑giving rain, he
should also be careful about his spiritual nourishment, the Message
revealed from above (like rain) to the Prophet's heart (S). The very
place where the hearts of the sinless Imams got it from and store it
like fountains of youth for others to make their own hearts fruitful
with faith, virtue and morals.

Yes, one must completely be aware of the main origin of one's knowledge
or one may call it 'spiritual nourishment', lest it may come from a
corrupted source and, as a result, cause one's soul and body to become
sick or die.

And the matter of things being lawful /halal/ or unlawful, /haram/, and
permitted or forbidden can analogically be understood through the
potential guidance, too.

This is also probable that the terms 'food' and 'look' both have vast
meanings in this verse, hence all the three above commentaries can be
gathered in it.

It is evident that the term

***'man',***

used in the verse, includes all members of the human race whether they
are believers or unbelievers. They must care about what they eat and,
also, the wonder of its creation in order for the unbelievers, to find
the right way, and for the believers to increase in their faith.

Verily, each article of food: fruits, nutritious seeds, and vegetables
have some interesting properties which can be studied, separately, in
our lifetime and many things can be learned from them to enlighten us
and give us insight into the wonders that they contain.

Then, to explain the nourishment’s and their origins, it says:

***"That We pour down the water, pouring it in abundance”.***

The term /sab/ means 'to pour water over from above', and here it means
'sending down rain'. The term /sabba/, at the end of the verse, is used
for emphasis and to note the abundance of water.

Water, which is very necessary for every living creature, often comes
down sufficiently, because of Allah’s grace. And we know that the
essential source of water existing in rivers, streams, springs,
subterranean canals and wells is rain, so that if it does not rain one
year, all of them will dry up.

Thus, while studying articles of food, first and foremost, man should
refer to the importance of the regularity of rainfall. The sun shines
over the seas where vapor, in the form of clouds, rises from and moves
above the earth where winds scatter the clouds high in the sky.

At cold points in the atmosphere, the clouds change into pure, harmless
water again and fall gently on the ground in the form of droplets of
rain or little pieces of snow that soak into the ground. Trees, plants
and living things draw up water from the ground.

After mentioning water, which is an important factor in human life, it
refers to another great factor; the earth, and says:

***“And We split the earth in fragments”.***

many commentators have said that this splitting is the splitting of; the
land by plant seeding. It is really wonderful that a little smooth
seedling can break the hard, solid land and sometimes it shoots up
through stone. What a surprising power the Creator has given to this
tiny smooth seedling which enables it to do so!

Some others have said that the split may be the splitting of the land
when man ploughs it or even when some worms burrow through it; a kind of
plowing for the purpose of some other life activities.

Plowing is one of man's activities, of course, but Allah has given him
all its necessary means, therefore it relates to Allah.

The third commentary, which has been cited for the verse, and seems
preferable for certain considerations, says that the meaning of

***'splitting the earth'***

is 'the act of breaking the stone into pieces on the surface of the
earth.’

### Explanation

At first the surface of the earth was covered with a mass of stone.
Heavy rains fell, continuously, and cleft the stone asunder and spread
its little parts onto the low lands and, thus, a mass of agricultural
soil was formed, some of which is now carried to the seas by floods. But
the new soil, produced by the succeeding rain and snow was replaced by
it, otherwise man would be faced with the lack of agricultural soil.

Then, the verse points to one of the miracles of the Qur'an, in science,
when it says it rains, first, then the earth cleaves asunder and becomes
fit for farming. This not only happened in the very early days, but also
keeps occurring today.

This commentary seems more suitable, because the growth of plants and
the production of grains are mentioned in the next verses.

Here, again, all three commentaries, together, can be probable.

After mentioning the two basic factors; i.e. water and soil, it refers
to the eight items of plants, which contain the main nutrients for man
and cattle.

***“And We produce therein corn”.***

***Corn /habba/***

is 'grain, the seeds of cereal grass; wheat, oats, rye or barely, or the
plants producing them'. They are the essential sources of man's and
cattle's nourishment’s during the year, the lack of which, because of
drought, causes famine and starvation, a great plague for the world.

The term

***/habban/ 'corn',***

in a general sense, shows the importance and the variety of the seeds.
Some others have only meant it as 'wheat' or 'rye' which is not
reasonable, because the term 'corn' can include all seeds, which was
mentioned before.

***“And grapes and grasses”***

The term /'inab/, which means both 'grapes and vine', in the verses of
Qur'an, is mentioned, here, because it contains many nutrients, as a
complete food and more than other fruits. It means only grapes in this
verse.

The term /qathb/ originally means 'the vegetables which are cut several
times', and, here, it means the different kinds of vegetables. Its
occurrence after the term 'grapes' is for its importance as a food
material.

Today, vegetables enjoy a high position in food science and are
especially recommended.

The term /qathb/ is sometimes used with the meaning of 'to cut, or to
pick'.

It is probable that /qathb/, used, here, in this verse, has a broader
meaning which includes both vegetables and fruits.

***“And the olive and the palm”.***

It is clear that these two items are both from the most important
articles of food which are useful, sound, and nutritious. This is why
they are mentioned and emphasized on, here.

***“And gardens, dense with trees”.***

The term /hada'iq/ is the plural form of /hadiqah /which is 'a garden
surrounded by a wall', but originally it means 'a piece of land
containing water for irrigation'. The word is derived from /hadaqah/
'eye‑socket' where water exists, constantly.

Since these kinds of gardens are usually fruit gardens, the word may
hint to the kinds of fruits in Heaven.

The term /qulb/ is the plural form of /aqlab/ and /qulba '/ which means
'thick‑necked' and is originally derived from /qalabah/. Here, it means
'tall, thick trees'.

***“And fruits and fodder”.***

The term /abb/ means 'herbage not sown by men' or 'herbage prepared for
pasture and for cutting'. Basically it means 'preparation' and, since
these pastures are prepared for the usage, so, they are called /abb/.

Some others have also said that /abb/ is used for the fruits that are
suitable for drying and storing to be used in winter, because they are
always ready for use.

The late Mufid in his book, Irshad, has narrated from Amir‑al‑Mo'mineen
Ali (as) that the word meant 'herbage as a pasture', and he added:

*“What God said in the verse 'And fruits and fodder' is a divine gift
for His servants that He created as a part of their food and for their
cattle, from which their lives receive merit and their bodies are
strengthened”.* [^2]

In the former verses some special fruits were named, while here fruits,
in general, are discussed. Moreover, the last verse spoke about
'gardens', which seemed to mean 'the fruits of gardens', then, how are
the fruits dealt with, here, again?

The answer to this question is this: There, some definite fruits such as
grapes, olives, and dates, which are of great importance among all
fruits, were named; but, here, fruits are mentioned separate from
'gardens', perhaps because, besides fruits, gardens have some more
advantages, such as, fresh air, nice views, etc.

Moreover, the leaves of some trees and the twigs, the roots, and the
barks of some others (for example: tea, cinnamon, ginger and the like)
are among the edibles; in addition to the leaves of many trees, which
are suitable food for cattle. And it is a fact that the items stated in
the aforementioned verses are edible for both human beings as well as
their cattle.

For this reason, in the next verse, it says:

***“Provision for you and for your cattle.”***

The term /mata'/ means 'anything that man uses or enjoys'.

### Explanation:Wholesome Nutriments

There are eight nutriments named, in these verses, for man and cattle.
It is interesting that all of them are from herb ages and that is
because of the importance of vegetables, grains and fruits in man's
diet, so, in other words, they are the true original nutriments, while
meat, obtained from animals, is in the second position and in a lesser
amount.

Also noteworthy is that food science, which is one of the wide spread
and important sciences and has a broad field with a large scope of
investigation, is an explanation for what is mentioned in these verses
and shows the magnificence of the Holy Qur'an, especially when this
science emphasizes on the value and the efficiency of these food
materials.

In any case, taking note of these materials and thinking about the
creator of them may cause man's awareness of Allah’s grace and mercy to
mankind.

Yes, paying attention to ones bodily food and, then, the sustenance of
the soul from the points of both its structural content and how one
obtained it, can push one forward along the path of knowledge of Allah,
righteousness, and self‑perfection.

Verily,

***“Then let man look to his food”,***

and what a meaningful sentence this short, single statement is!

### The Resurrection Cry!

After describing a notable number of divine gifts and worldly blessings,
the theme changes to talk about the resurrection and some of its
happenings as well as the end of the believers and unbelievers. The
purpose in this is to say that, firstly, these gifts, whatever they are,
will have an end sometime; and secondly, they are some signs to prove
the existence of Allah’s authority which is over everything and, of
course, over the Resurrection.

***“And when the deafening cry comes,”***

The term /saxah/ is based on /sax/ which originally means 'a very loud
noise', so loud that it almost deafens the ears, or actually deafens
them. It points, here, to the second sound of the blast of the trumpet,
the very great cry which brings the dead to life again and makes them go
forth to the gathering place for the final Judgment.

Verily, the cry is so loud and shocking that everyone forgets all but
one's end resulting from one's own actions.

***“The Day on which a man shall flee from his brother”.***

The same brother who was loved sincerely, was helped in everything
favorably, now he flees from that brother, abruptly.

***“And his mother and his father,”***

***“And from his wife and his children”.***

Thus, individuals not only leave the nearest and the dearest members of
their family such as their brother, father, mother, wife, and children,
but also flee from them.

This statement shows that the horror and the fear of the Day is so much
so that it makes individuals cease all their wishes and affections. In
the probationary life, mother was loved by her child very much; father
was highly respected by his son; wife was eagerly beloved by her
husband; children were the best for their father, as the apples of his
eyes; but now, in the eternal life, one flees from all of them!

The reason why he flees from them is stated in the next verse.

***“Each one of them, That Day, will have concern enough to occupy
him”.***

The term

***/yuqnih/ 'makes him self‑sufficient'***

shows that on That Day, man is so busy with his affairs that he does not
pay attention to anyone; and the events are so terrible and overwhelming
as to occupy him and his mind, totally.

It has been narrated that some of the households of the Prophet (S)
asked him if one would remember one's close friend on That Day, and he
answered:

*“There are three halting‑places where no one remembers anyone.*

*The first place is where the acts are weighed to see whether they are
heavy (worthy) or light (unworthy); then, it is on the path where he
wonders whether he can pass it (successfully) or not; and then it is the
time when he is given his Record to see whether it is given to his right
hand or to his left hand.*

*In these three halting‑places no one cares for any one else: his
supporter, his comrade, his companion, his very true friend, his child,
his parents, and this is the same thing that Allah says:*

***'Each one of them, That Day, will have concern enough to occupy
him'”.***[^3]

Then the situation of the believers and unbelievers is described when it
says:

***“Some faces That Day will be bright”***

***“Laughing, rejoicing”,***

***“And some faces That Day will be dust‑stained,”***

***"Blackness will cover them”.***

The term /musfirah/ is based on /asfar/ which means 'to appear, or to
glitter' like the light of the early morning at the end of the darkness
of night; the term /qabarah/ is based on /qabar/ which means 'dust'; the
term /qatarah/ originally is based on /qatar/ which means 'smoke'; the
term /kafarah/ and the term /fajarah/ are the plural forms of /kafir/ 'a
unbeliever from the point of view of belief and /fajir/ 'a sinner from
the point of view of action'.

The look on the face shows the inner self (mood), both physically and
spiritually, good or bad.

It is understood from the verse that on That Day the faces show the
righteousness or wickedness of persons during their lives in this world.

The dust on the faces of the sinners will be in contrast to the beaming
light on the faces of the righteous; and the blackness (smoke) of the
faces of sinners, who are sad and regretful, in contrast to the
'laughing, rejoicing' faces of the righteous.

On the whole, on That Day, the faces show the facts and it is enough to
look at the faces to know who is a sinner and who is righteous; as it is
said in Surah Rahman, No. 55, verse 41:

***“(For) the sinners will be known by their faces”.***

### Explanation: Self-Perfection

The ideas set forth in the short and meaningful verses, of this Surah,
are a good collection for individuals to use as a guidance to
self‑perfection.

1. On the one hand, it leads man to refer to the origin of his creation
to understand how he was created from a lowly sperm‑drop in order that
he should not be proud, because one of the greatest hindrances on the
path of self‑perfection is pride.

2. On the other hand, it introduces the divine leadership to man as the
best provision of his way including both the Prophet's guidance,
originating from revelation, and the guidance led by rational thinking
and the observation in the regularity of the created world.

3. Then, it orders man to look to his food to see how it is created and
prepared for him by the Beneficent and the Merciful Creator, and then,
to obey Him in humility. Man should be careful to obtain his food,
lawfully, because pure and lawful food is an important basis for
self‑perfection.

4. When he must be careful about his bodily food, then, he should
certainly be careful about his soul's sustenance to see that it is not
from a corrupted source; that which threatens his spiritual life.

It is surprising that some people are seriously careful about their
bodily food, but they do not take care about their soul's sustenance;
they read any book and they learn the tutorship of any misleading
education and observe no limits or conditions for the sustenance of
their soul.

There is a narration from Amir‑al‑Mo'mineen Ali (as) that says:

*"Why, I see that people light a lamp at nigh, to watch what kind of
food they eat, but they do not mind what is the sustenance of their
soul. They do not enlighten their mind by (the) rational knowledge, if
they do they will be safe from the bad results of ignorance and
sinfulness in their beliefs and deeds.”* [^4]

His son Imam Hassan‑Mujtaba (as) also said something along these lines:

*“I wonder at some people who think about their bodily food, but do not
care for their soul's sustenance. They avoid eating harmful food, but
fill their hearts with fatal materials.”* [^5]

5. One should remember that the Deafening Cry will raise up all from
their graves, and everyone will be faced with one's Record. Then, the
circumstances, there, will be so awful that one will forget all of one's
dearest beloved. One should think about one's acts whether they be so
good that one will deserve to have a 'laughing, rejoicing' and bright
face That Day, or whether one will have an ugly, black and frowning
face, then, and thus, will cause oneself to prepare for that Day.

### Supplication

*O Lord! Make each of us successful in self‑perfection.*

*O Lord! Do not deprive us from a good sustenance for our spirits.*

*O Lord! Make us conscious of our duties to fulfill them before the
occurrence of the deafening Cry!*

of his Creator and the Resurrection, then let him look to his food’.
