اِفتَعَلَ یَفتَعِلُ ، اِنفَعَلَ یَنفَعِلُ ، اِفعَلَّ یَفعَلُّ.** Third,

یَتَفَعلَلُ.** Second, quadriliteral verbs with two increase letters:
**اِفعَنلَلَ یَفعَنلِلُ ، اِفعَلَلَّ یَفعَلِلُ.**

20. Increase letters are not added to a verb unless to change the
meaning of the verb. For example: **أفعَلَ** and **فَعَّلَ** are to
convert the verb into the transitive form as in **أکرَمَ. فاعَل** and
**تفاعل** denote a form of dual participation as in **شارکتُهُ. تفعّل**
is to make the **فعّل** reflexive as in **عَلَّمتُهُ فَتَعَلَّمَ.
انفعل** and **افتعل** are to make the **فَعَلَ** reflexive as in
**نَثرتُهُ فانتَثَرَ. افعلّ** is used with an adjective as in **احمَرَّ.
استفعل** denotes asking for something as in **استَغفَرَ. تفعلل** is to
make the **فعلل** reflexive as in **دَحرَجتُهُ فَتَدَحرَجَ.** All of the
other forms are used for emphasis.
