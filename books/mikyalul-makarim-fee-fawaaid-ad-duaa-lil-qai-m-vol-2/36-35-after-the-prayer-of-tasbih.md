35. After The Prayer Of Tasbih
==============================

That is, the prayers of Ja’far Ibne Abi Talib (r.a.), particularly when
you pray it on Friday. There is an invocation narrated by Imam Kazim
(as) for this occasion in Jamaal al-Usboo’[^1] and other books of
supplications. May Allah the Almighty give us and other believers the
grace for its recitation. We shall mention this invocation in the
supplications of Friday, Inshallah.
