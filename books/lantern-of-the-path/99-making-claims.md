Making Claims
=============

Â   
 In reality the claim belongs to the prophets, the Imams and the
truthful, and a man who makes a claim improperly is like the accursed
Iblis. He lays claim to devoutness while in reality he contends with his
Lord and opposes His command. Whoever makes such claims reveals his lie,
and the liar is not trustworthy; whoever claims what is not lawful for
him has the gates of affliction opened for him. Anyone who makes a claim
will doubtless be asked for clear proof, upon which he is shown to be
bankrupt and disgraced. The truthful person is not asked the reason for
his actions; as 'Ali said, 'No one sees a truthful person without being
in awe of him.'
