Hujat Ull Islam (proof of Islam)
================================

And what is required to prove something? Some people try to prove it
with academic arguments, some have even tried it by military force, and
the Prophets (a.s.) even used miracles for their proofs.

So, when a person call himself a proof of Islam, then it follows that
he is referring to his character, his whole personality, so that when a
person looks at him, then Islam is proven. By looking at him, at his
blessed face, listening to his speech, his actions, and his character,
the truth of Islam would dawn upon the people. There would be no need to
provide any intellectual arguments or proofs.

If you were to now use your common sense a little bit you will realise
the gravity of the situation when someone uses this title for himself,
as the whole of the building of religion would be based on this
foundation and would eventually collapse if the claim turns out to be
false.

According to Shiite beliefs, Allah (s.w.t.) gave a complete religion
with no deficiencies, through a trustworthy angel to an Infallible
Prophet and Infallible Imams. The proof of an infallible religion can
only be through an infallible. If a normal person were to be regarded as
proof of Islam then all his deficiencies will have to be regarded as the
deficiencies of Islam, and in this way the whole religion would become
unreliable. The person who is accepted as the proof of Islam would
therefore be one who is above any mistakes or disagreements.

QUESTIONS

Do any of these Hujjat Ul Islams claim to be infallible? If not, then
how can their incomplete persons be the proof of our complete religion?
**Ayatollah (Sign Of Allah (S.W.T.))**

These have sprung up only recently, in the last hundred years or so.
Beforehand, most of them used to be referred to as Sheykhs.

And so I referred to the Book of Allah (s.w.t.) and saw fifty six
Divine Verses referring to the Ayatullahs. Well, obviously I cannot use
all of them here, for the sake of brevity, but I cannot use only a
couple either as that would not do justice to the argument. Therefore I
have decided to use as few of them as I could.

Wherever the term Ayatullah has been used, it has been immediately
followed by a Fatwa (Verdict) from Allah (s.w.t.) that whoever rejects
them, falsifies them, does not place his faith in them, neglects them,
denies them, mocks them, turns his face away from them, or fights
against them has been referred to as either an unbeliever, person of
Hell,

one on whom is Divine Wrath, one whose deeds have been confiscated, the
most unjust one, blind, deaf, dumb, one without posterity, an accursed,
a loss maker, a transgressor and ungrateful. Phew!

Here they are!

[Shakir 2:39] And (as to) those who disbelieve in and reject My
communications, they are the inmates of the fire, in it they shall
abide.

[Shakir 2:61] And abasement and humiliation were brought down upon
them, and they became deserving of Allah's wrath; this was so because
they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and killed the prophets
unjustly; this was so because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits.

[Shakir 3:4] Surely they who disbelieve in the communications of Allah
they shall have a severe chastisement; and Allah is Mighty, the Lord of
retribution.

ٍَ [Shakir 3:21] Surely (as for) those who disbelieve in the
communications of Allah and slay the prophets unjustly and slay those
among men who enjoin justice, announce to them a painful chastisement.

[Shakir 3:22] Those are they whose works shall become null in this
world as well as the hereafter, and they shall have no helpers

[Shakir 6:39] And they who reject Our communications are deaf and dumb,
in utter darkness; whom Allah pleases He causes to err and whom He
pleases He puts on the right way.

[Shakir 6:49] And (as for) those who reject Our communications,
chastisement shall afflict them because they transgressed.

[Shakir 6:157] Or lest you should say: If the Book had been revealed to
us, we would certainly have been better guided than they, so indeed
there has come to you clear proof from your Lord, and guidance and
mercy. Who then is more unjust than he who rejects Allah's
communications and turns away from them? We will reward those who turn
away from Our communications with an evil chastisement because they
turned away.

[Shakir 7:40] Surely (as for) those who reject Our communications and
turn away from them haughtily, the doors of heaven shall not be opened
for them, nor shall they enter the garden until the camel pass through
the eye of the needle; and thus do We reward the guilty.

َُْ [Shakir 7:64] But they called him a liar, so We delivered him and
those with him in the ark, and We drowned those who rejected Our
communications; surely they were a blind people.

[Shakir 7:72] So We delivered him and those with him by mercy from Us,
and We cut off the last of those who rejected Our communications and
were not believers.

[Shakir 7:203] And when you bring them not a revelation they say: Why
do you not forge it? Say: I only follow what is revealed to me from my
Lord; these are clear proofs from your Lord and a guidance and a mercy
for a people who believe.

[Shakir 10:17] Who is then more unjust than who forges a lie against
Allah or (who) gives the lie to His communications? Surely the guilty
shall not be successful.

[Shakir 11:59] And this was Ad; they denied the communications of their
Lord, and disobeyed His messengers and followed the bidding of every
insolent opposer (of truth).

[Shakir 11:60] And they were overtaken by curse in this world and on
the resurrection day; now surely Ad disbelieved in their Lord; now
surely, away with Ad, the people of Hud.

[Shakir 20:125] He shall say: My Lord! why hast Thou raised me blind
and I was a seeing one indeed?

[Shakir 20:126] He will say: Even so, Our communications came to you
but you neglected them; even thus shall you be forsaken this day.

[Shakir 20:127] And thus do We recompense him who is extravagant and
does not believe in the communications of his Lord, and certainly the
chastisement of the hereafter is severer and more lasting.

[Shakir 31:32] And when a wave like mountains covers them they call
upon Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience, but when He brings them
safe to the land, some of them follow the middle course; and none denies
Our signs but every perfidious, ungrateful one.

[Shakir 39:63] His are the treasures of the heavens and the earth; and
(as for) those who disbelieve in the communications of Allah, these it
is that are the losers.

You have now seen the Verses about the Ayatullahs and the Fatwas
(Verdicts) of Allah (s.w.t.) that have been Issued to those that reject
them.

Let us look at this from another angle. Say there are two Mujtahids who
call themselves Ayatullahs. One of them has declared something
permissible whilst the other one has made it forbidden (e.g. Chess). Can
you now tell me whether they are verifying each other or falsifying and
opposing each other? You will have to admit that they are actually
falsifying and opposing each other.

And yet they both claim to be Ayatullahs. You have seen above the
result of the one who falsifies or opposes an Ayatullah. Don't both of
these two people come under these Divine Verdicts?

The Holy Infallibles (a.s.) have actually referred to themselves as the
Ayatullahs. AL KAFI - H 528, Ch. 18, h1

Al-Husayn ibn Muhammad has narrated from Mu'alla ibn Muhammad from
Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah from Ahmad ibn Hilal from 'Umayya ibn
Ali from Dawud al-Riqqi who has said the following: "Once, I asked abu
'Abd Allah, recipient of divine supreme covenant, about the meaning of
the words of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, 'The signs and
warnings are of no avail to the disbelieving people.' (10:101) The Imam
said, 'Signs are 'A'immah, and warnings are the prophets, recipient of
divine supreme covenant. '" AL KAFI - H 529, Ch. 18, h2

Ahmad ibn Mahran has narrated from 'Abd al-'Azim ibn 'Abd Allah
al-Hassani from Musa ibn Muhammad al-'Ijli from Yunus ibn Ya'qub in a
marfu' manner from abu Ja'far, recipient of divine supreme covenant, who
has said the following: "In the words of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most
High, 'However, they rejected all Our signs. . . .' (54:42) 'The signs'
are all the successors (of the prophets, recipient of divine supreme
covenant).'" HADEETH U TARIQ

The Commander of the Faithul (a.s.) said: O Tariq, The Imam is the
Kalama-t-All?h [Word of God] and Waj'ha-t-Allah [Face of God] and
Hijaba-t-Allah [Veil of God] and N?ru-Allah [Light of God] and
?ya-t-Allah [Sign of God]. - Bihar Ul Anwaar Vol. 25 H 4 After all this,
do you reckon that anyone other than the Holy Infallibles (a.s.) has any
right to this title? It looks to me as if some people are taking this
title very lightly.

[Shakir 45:34] And it shall be said: Today We forsake you as you
neglected the meeting of this day of yours and your abode is the fire,
and there are not for you any helpers:

[Shakir 45:35] That is because you took the communications of Allah for
a jest and the life of this world deceived you. So on that day they
shall not be brought forth from it, nor shall they be granted
goodwill.

In Tafseer Safi and Tafseer Qummi, this has been explained in this
manner: 'The 'Ayaat of Allah' in this Verse is a reference to the Holy
Infallibles (a.s.) and those that mocked them will be told that these
are the ones they used to falsify and mock'. The reality is that these
claims of theirs to the titles of the Holy Infallibles (a.s.) is to try
and equate to them. No one from the olden times up until recently has
ever used these titles or even plucked up the courage for it. Sheykh
Mufeed and Sheykh Tusi that they revere so much, remained as just
Sheykhs, whilst they themselves have gone much further.

QUESTIONS

Why are these Ayatullahs differing from each other in their Fatwas if
they are both signs of Allah (s.w.t.), and He (s.w.t.) is only One? If
one Ayatullah opposes another Ayatullah, will they both end up in Hell
as per the Divine Verses?
