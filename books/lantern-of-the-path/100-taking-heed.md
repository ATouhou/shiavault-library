Taking Heed
===========

   
 The Messenger of Allah said, 'He who learns his lessons in this world
lives in it like a man asleep: he sees it but does not touch it.
Abhorrence is increased in his heart and in his self by the behaviour of
those who are deceived by this world, which can only bring the reckoning
and punishment. He exchanges that world for what will bring him near to
Allah's pleasure and pardon. He washes himself free of those things to
which the world invites him, and of its worldly adornments, with the
water of the world's extinction.  
    
 Taking heed brings three things to the person who does so: knowledge of
what he does, acting by what he knows, and knowledge of what he does not
know. The root of taking heed lies in one's fear of its outcome, when he
sees that he has fully realized abstinence at the beginning. Taking heed
is only successful for those who have purity and insight.  
    
 Allah said,  
  

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَاعْتَبِرُوا يَا أُولِي الْأَبْصَارِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Take a lesson, O you who have eyes!*** (59:2)  
    
 and again,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَإِنَّهَا لَا تَعْمَى الْأَبْصَارُ وَلَكِن تَعْمَى الْقُلُوبُ الَّتِي
فِي الصُّدُورِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***For surely it is not the eyes that are blind, but blind are the
hearts which are in the breasts.*** (22:46)  
    
 When Allah opens the eye of someone's heart and insight by means of
consideration, then He has given him a high station and an immense
fortune.
