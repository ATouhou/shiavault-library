Al-Husayn Responds
==================

   
    
 When letters filled two saddlebags, al-Husayn (‘a) wrote them one
letter which he gave to Hani Ibn Hani al-Subay’i and Sa’id Ibn ‘Abdullah
al-Hanafi. These were the last of his messengers. Its text was:  
  

*In the Name of Allah, the Most Benevolent, the Most Merciful*

“*Hani and Sa’id brought me your letters, and they are the last to
deliver them to me. I understand what you narrate, and the gist of most
of your letters is: “We have no Imam; so, come to us, perhaps Allah will
gather us with you on the path of guidance and righteousness.”*

*I have sent you my brother and cousin and the confidant of my Ahl
al-Bayt and ordered him to write me with regard to your conditions,
views and intentions.*

*So, if he writes me saying that your view is united with that of those
of distinction and wisdom from among you and in agreement with what your
messengers and letters state, I shall, by the Will of Allah, come to you
very soon. By my life, an Imam is one who acts upon the Book [of Allah]
and implements justice and follows the path of righteousness; he
dedicates himself to follow Allah's Commandments, and peace be with
you”*.[^1]  
    
 He handed his letter to Muslim Ibn ‘Aqil saying, “I *am dispatching you
to the people of Kufa, and Allah shall deal with you as He pleases. I
wish that both of us should be in the status of the martyrs; so, proceed
with Allah's blessing and help. Once you get there, stay with the most
trustworthy of its people*.”[^2]
