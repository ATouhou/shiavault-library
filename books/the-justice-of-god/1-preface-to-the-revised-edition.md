Preface to the Revised Edition
==============================

**In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful**

The first edition of this book was published in 1970 as the third unit
of the Islamic Correspondence Course (ICC), initiated and run by the
Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania. The aim was to provide in simple
language the answers to many questions which are frequently asked not
only by the youths but also by the grown‑ups.

Since then it has been reprinted several times in Tanzania and Kenya.
Also its Swahili translation, *Udilify Wa Mungu,* by Sayyid Muhammad
Ridha Shustary, was published in 1985 at Dar es salaam.

As the original work was meant to serve as a text book, it was not
necessary to give references for the topics described therein. But the
book did not remain confined to the students of the ICC; and requests
for its copies have been coming from far and wide.

Therefore, with a view to enhance its usefulness, my son, Hujjatul Islam
Sayyid Muham­mad Rizvi (Vancouver, Canada) had, in 1985, writ­ten
foot‑notes giving most of the necessary references.

Some more references have been added by me. Also some revisions and
additions have been made by me here and there. Unfortunately, it has
taken a much longer time to get this revised and annotated version
printed.

We are thankful to the Vancouver Islamic Educa­tional Foundation
(Canada) for typesetting of the book. May Allah give them its reward in
both worlds.
