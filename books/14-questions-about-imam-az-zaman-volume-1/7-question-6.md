Question 6
==========

Discuss the false claimants and pretenders of Mahdawiyyah who have been
recorded in history.

**Reply:**

The preceding discussions indisputably establish the fact concerning the
Islamic belief in Mahdawiyyah and the reappearance from occultation of a
divine reformer. History records that while some people have falsely
represented themselves as the promised Mahdi, some others have been
erroneously attributed as Mahdi by either ignorant and harassed people
or the selfish motives of others have foisted Mahdawiyyah on them.

Some of the pseudo-Mahdis in history are as follows:

Abu Ishaq Abu Abidah Saqafi, Abu Muhammad Abdullah al-Mahdi, Abu
Abdullah al-Magrebi, Mahdi al- Sudani, Sayed Muhammad Jaunpuri Hindi,
Musa Kurdi, Mahdi al-Bengali, Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani, Sayed Bab and
Bahaaullah.
