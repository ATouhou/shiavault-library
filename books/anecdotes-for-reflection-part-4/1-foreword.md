In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w) has said,

بُعِثْتُ لِأُتَمِّمَ مَكَارِمَ الأَخْلاَقِ
  </p>

***“I have been sent to perfect the good morals.”***

The Islamic Education department of The World Federation has a proud
tradition of producing literature in the field of Islamic Ethics, in its
long history of service to the community. In continuation of this
service, we are pleased to present part four of the Farsi work ‘Yaksad
Mawzu, wa Pansad Dastan’ by Sayyid Ali Akbar Sadaqat. The translation
from Farsi to English was carried out by Shaykh Shahnawaz Mahdavi.

I would like to personally thank both Sayyid Ali Akbar Sadaqat and
Shaykh Shahnawaz Mahdavi for their efforts in bringing this collection
of very practical, inspirational and motivational stories into the hands
of lay-people. The ‘Anecdotes for Reflection’ series has proven to be
very popular amongst all sectors of the community.

Indeed some of my own *Zakir* colleagues make use of them for lectures,
as do *Madrasah* teachers for their lessons to the younger generation.
The far-reaching effects of what Shaykh Sadaqat and Shaykh Mahdavi have
produced will inshallah be appreciated for years and generations to
come, *ameen.*

I pray to Allah (SWT) to reward them amply and to grant them increased
success in their lives in this world and the hereafter.
