99. How is an epithet formed?

98. An epithet is a form derived from an intransitive verb to denote
thabut, for example: **حَسَنٌ.** What is meant by thabut is that it is
mutlaqan in the characterized without any qayd of time. Whatever is
derived from a triliteral verb with the meaning of an active participle
noun but not in that form and indicates thabut is an epithet.

99. An epithet is formed from non triliteral verbs upon their active
participle form, for example: **مُعتدِل.** It is formed from triliteral
verbs that denote color, defect, or trickery in the form **أفعَل,** for
example: **أسوَد.** It is formed from triliteral verbs that do not
denote such things in various forms that do not have a ruling, for
example: **کَریم.**
