Conspiracy Against Imam Ali (as)
================================

A Sunni brother mentioned that:

It is quite difficult for us to digest the so-called "conspiracy
theory." Despite many years of companionship, how could only few people
out of all his companions hold on to Muhammad's instructions on the
issue of Caliphate and the rest disobey him?

I would certainly accept the argument of this brother if he can
convince me why almost all the companions of Moses became worshipers of
a golden calf after so many years of training?! According to Sahih
al-Bukhari, the Messeenger of Allah has told Ali that the story of Moses
and Aaron (Haroon) is similar to that of the story of him and Ali. The
tradition is as follows:

"Your position to me is like the position of Aaron to Moses, except
that there shall be no Prophet after me"

**Sunni References:**

(1) Sahih al-Bukhari, Arabic-English version, Traditions 5.56 and
5.700
(2) Sahih Muslim, Arabic, section of virtues of Ali, v4, pp 1870-71

(6) Mushkil al-Athar, by al-Tahawi, v2, p309

Now, the position of Aaron (Haroon) to Moses is given by the verses of
Quran, among which are the following three:

(Moses said: "O' Allah) assign me a vizier from my family, (that is) my
brother Aaron (Haroon) ...," (Allah) said: "We granted your requests, O'
Moses." (Quran 20:29-36).

Allah, Exalted, also said:

"Surely We gave the book to Moses and assigned his brother Aaron as his
vizier." (Quran 25:35).

He, Exalted He is, also said:

"... And Moses said unto his brother Aaron: Take my place in my
comunity." (Quran 7:142).

Notice that "Ukhlufni" and "Khalifa" (Caliph) are exactly from the same
root. Now, to realized what was narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari, we need to
replace the word "Moses" with "Muhammad" and "Aaron" with "Ali", and we
are all set!!

The sentence becomes "And Muhammad (PBUH&HF) said to his 'brother' Ali,
take my place among my community." Of course, the tradition in Sahih
al-Bukhari excluded the Prophethood for Imam Ali, and what remains for
him is the leadership of the community.

Putting the above 3 verses of Quran beside what has been narrated by
al- Bukhari and Muslim, Ibn Majah and many others, we solves the
mystery! Ali is the "brother" and his deputy/successor. By the above
authentic tradition, the Prophet (PBUH&HF) meant that as Moses had left
behind Aaron to look after his people when he went to Miqaat (meeting
Allah), in the same way he was leaving Ali behind to look after the
affairs of Islam after he met Allah (i.e., his death).

Confirming what the above tradition implies, we find in the many
reports that Imam Ali (AS) received the title of the "brother" of
Prophet when Prophet established the "brothering" among his followers
(see Sahih al- Tirmidhi, v5, p363; Sirah Ibn Hisham, p504; Tahdhib
al-Tahdhib, v4, p251).

Interestingly enough, the Prophet in that occasion made Abu Bakr and
Umar brother of each other (al-Tabaqat, by Ibn Sa'd, v3, part 1, p123).
If Abu Bakr was really the closest to the Prophet, he would have chose
him for himself instead of Imam Ali.

In fact, if we look deeper to the situation of after death of Prophet
Mohammad (PBUH), and the leaving of Moses to MIQAAT (appointment with
Allah), we will see more analogy to what Prophet (PBUH) said to Ali
(AS).

Quran states that: Moses (AS) with the order of Allah, assigned Haroon
(AS) as his successor (Caliph) and left his people to him, and left for
MIQAAT (appointment with Allah) for a total of forty days. After leaving
of Moses, most of his companions turned against Haroon, and were
deceived by Sameri, and became worshipers of a golden calf. (See Quran
7:142, 20:90-97, 20:83- 88).

The analogy that Prophet (PBUH) mentioned in the above tradition, seems
to be a reality after his demise. Most of companions (except Abu Dhar,
Miqdad, Salman al-Farsi, Ammar, and ...) became disloyal to Ali (AS)
after the death of Prophet (PBUH), turned against him, and preferred
some other people to him.

The majority of people disobeyed Ali (AS), as their forefathers
disobeyed Haroon (AS). They did not take lessons from Quran and the
history, and thus the history repeated over and over again. The
repetition of the history of the Children of Israel for Muslims is
confirmed by Prophet (PBUH&HF):

Sahih al-Bukhari Hadith: 9.422

Narrated Abu Sa'id al-Khudri:

The Prophet said, "You will follow the ways of those nations who were
before you, span by span and cubit by cubit (i.e., inch by inch) so much
so that even if they entered a hole of a mastigure (lizard), you would
follow them." We said, "O Allah's Apostle! (Do you mean) the Jews and
the Christians?" He said, "Whom else?"

This tradition is also narrated by Muslim in his Sahih , v8, p57. It is
also narrated in Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, v3, pp 84, 94.

Think for a while... Why would the Prophet (PBUH&HF) compare his
companions to the Jews and the Christians, knowing full well that the
Jews and the Christians have mutilated and perverted the religion of
Allah (SWT)? Because Allah (SWT) had told him (PBUH&HF) that your
companions will turn back, except the select few.

Imam Ali (AS) was still a divinely-appointed Imam during the time of
the first three rulers, and what these rulers could take from him was
the rulership (which is one of the rights of Imam) and not the position
of Imamat. As for Imam Ali pledging Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman, he was
compelled to that since he had no choice and he was compled to do so.

We, however, never accuse the Imams of being cowards. What Imam Ali did
was his duty which is similar to what Haroon did as his duty.

Quran states that when Moses (PBUH) came back from MIQAAT he was very
angry since Allah had informed him that his community went astray during
his absence. Moses came and started questioning his brother Haroon, that
why he did not take action to prevent this corruption. Quran states that
Haroon (Aaron) replied:

"(O' Moses) people did oppress me and they were about to kill me."
(Quran 7:150).

The above verse gives another striking similarity between Ali and
Haroon. Since Muslims all believe that Haroon was a true prophet of God,
they do not allow themselves to call him coward.

In fact Taqiyya (dissimulation) is mentioned in Quran in several
verses. This requires another article by its own, to explain the
importance of Taqiyya according to Quran and the numerous traditions of
Prophet (PBUH&HF) reported in the authentic Sunni collections.

Nevertheless Ali did his duty after the death of the Messenger of
Allah, as Haroon (Aaron) did:

"Before this, Aaron had already said to them: 'O my people! you are
being tested in this, for verily your Lord is (Allah) Most Gracious; so
follow me and obey my order.'" (Quran 20:90).

Sahih al-Bukhari confirms that Imam Ali refused to give his allegiance
to Abu Bakr for six months. He gave his allegiance to Abu Bakr only
after the martyrdom of his wife Fatimah al-Zahra, Daughter of the Holy
Prophet, six month after the departure of Prophet. (see Sahih
al-Bukhari, Arabic-English version, Tradition 5.546).

After the death of Prophet (PBUH&HF), for forty days, Ali (AS) was
contacting the well-known people at night, reminding them the
instructions of prophet about his right to Caliphate, asking them to
join him to get the power. But non responded except Abu Dhar, Miqdad,
and Salman al-Farsi and some more.

The Prophet had already instructed Ali that if the number of his
followers at that upheaval exceeds 40 men, he should take the action
otherwise he should keep silent since the only remaining pious people
would be killed without being able to help Islam. Ali (AS) was not
afraid of being killed, and he kept silent only to keep the faded lawn
of Islam alive.

After he was sure that there would no success in his revolting, he kept
silent. During his silence, he indeed started cooperating with the first
2 Caliphs as consultant and did his best to decrease the damage as much
as possible.

If he had not done so, Islam would have been destroyed completely. Imam
Ali said: "I tolerated those periods as if there was a thorn in my eye
and a sharp bone stuck in my throat." (Nahjul Balagha, the sayings of
Imam Ali).

Islam was very young at that time (only 23 years old!) and division
among Muslims could have totally removed Islam from the surface of the
earth. So he kept silent, as Haroon (Aaron) kept silent to prevent
division:

(Moses) said: "O' Aaron! what kept you back when you saw them going
wrong?"... (Aaron said:) "...Truly I feared you would say 'You caused a
division among the Children of Israel and you did not respect my word!'"
(Quran 20:92-94).

Abu Sufyan was one of those who wanted to destroy the young Islam by
encouraging Ali to revolt when he was sure that Ali will have no success
due to small number of his followers. But the revolt of Ali would at
least cause the civil war and the destruction of Islam. al-Tabari
reported:

When people gathered to give their oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr, Abu
Sufyan came while saying, "By God, I see a cloud of smoke which nothing
but blood will clear. O family of Abd Manaf! Who is Abu Bakr that he
should be the master of your affairs?

Where are Ali and al- Abbas, the two oppressed ones?" He then said (to
Ali): "O Abul Hasan! stretch your hand so that I give you the oath of
allegiance."... Ali rebuked him, saying: "By God, you do not intend
anything but (to stir up) Fitnah (dissension). For long you have desired
evil for Islam. We do not need your advice."

Sunni reference: History of al-Tabari, English version, v9, p199 As we
quoted the tradition of al-Bukhari earlier, the Prophet confirmed that
the history of the Children of Israel will be repeated for Muslims. In
fact Quran has mentioned the stories of the Children of Israel to give
us a way to understand the true history of Islam itself.

There are many other striking similarities in this regard written in
Quran. Please see the artcle of "The Twelve Imams (Part II)" for the
Quranic verses in this regard.

**Side Comments**

A Sunni brother mentioned that Aaron (Haroon) died during the liftime
of Moses, and as such, this is not a correct analogy to confirm the
caliphate of Ali using the tradition of Sahih al-Bukhari in which the
Prophet said: "Your position to me is like the position of Aaron
(Haroon) to Moses but there is no prophet AFTER me."

The claim that Aaron died during the life-time of Prophet Moses (if
true) does not hurt this argument at all, if you very carefully read the
following paragraphs:

As Moses (AS) had left behind Aaron to look after his people when he
went to Miqaat (meeting Allah), in the same way the Prophet (PBUH&HF)
was leaving Ali behind as his deputy to look after the affairs of Islam
after he met Allah (i.e., his death).

This assertion becomes more evdient when we look at the last phrase of
the tradition of al-Bukhari where the Messenger of Allah mentioned: "but
there is no prophet AFTER me". Think about the word "AFTER" in the
statement of the Prophet. Don't you think that the Prophet Muhammad is
talking about AFTER his death? That position (leadership) which the
Prophet entrusted to Ali was with Ali till his death. No body except the
Prophet Muhammad can take this position back from him.

Prophet Moses (AS) was away from his people for 40 days and he came
back and met them along with Haroon (AS). Likewise, Prophet Muhammad is
away from us (living in the heaven), but he will soon meet us and his
companions as well as Imam Ali on the Day of Judgment.

He will then question them the same way as Moses questioned his people,
specially those who left his religion and worshipped the golden calf.
Look at the following tradition from Sahih al-Bukhari to have some idea
about the would-be conversation between Prophet Muhammad and some of his
companions:

Sahih al-Bukhari Hadith: 8.585

Narrated Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa'd:

The Prophet said, "I am your predecessor (forerunner) at the Lake-
Fount, and whoever will pass by there, he will drink from it and whoever
will drink from it, he will never be thirsty. There will come to me some
people whom I will recognize, and they will recognize me, but a barrier
will be placed between me and them." Abu Hazim added: Nu'man bin Abi
'Aiyash, on hearing me, said.

"Did you hear this from Sahl?" I said, "Yes." He said, " I bear witness
that I heard Abu Said Al-Khudri saying the same, adding that the Prophet
said: 'I will say: They are my companions. Then it will be said to me,
'You do not know what they innovated (new things) in the religion after
you left'.

I will say, 'Far removed, far removed (from mercy), those who changed
after me." Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said, "On the Day of
Resurrection a group of companions will come to me, but will be driven
away from the Lake-Fount, and I will say, 'O Lord (those are) my
companions!' It will be said, 'You have no knowledge as to what they
innovated after you left; they turned apostate as renegades (reverted
from the true Islam).

Another person claimed: Not all of the people of Moses worshipped the
calf and those who did not killed the ones who did by the order of
God.

Perhaps, this brother has been told another story. But Quran tells us
that all the followers of Moses (except a few) were deceived by Sameri.
The companions of Moses did not kill Sameri either. The were rather
about to kill Aaron (AS) who tried to advise them on that affliction.

If the number of those who preserved their faith was a lot, Aaron
wouldn't have been in trouble. Here are some verses of Quran concerning
the event:

7:148 And the community of Moses, after (he had left them), chose a
calf (for worship), (made) out of their ornaments, of saffron hue, which
gave a lowing sound. Saw they not that it spake not unto them nor guided
them to any way? They chose it, and became wrong doers.

7:150 And when Moses returned unto his people, angry and grieved, he
said: Evil is that (course) which ye took after I had left you. Would ye
hasten on the judgment of your Lord? And he cast down the tablets, and
he seized his brother by the head, dragging him toward him.

(Aaron) said: "Son of my mother! Lo! People did oppress me and they
were about to kill me. Make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune
nor count thou me amongst the sinful people."

20:90 Before this, Aaron had already said to them: "O my people! you
are being tested in this, for verily your Lord is (Allah) Most Gracious;
so follow me and obey my order."

20:91 They had said: "We will not abandon this cult but we will devote
ourselves to it until Moses returns to us."

So the last verse disproves the claim that the true followers killed
the wrong doers before Moses (AS) come back. Yes, after Prophet Moses
came back, he punished the influential individuals among those who led
people astray. But he did not kill them:

20:97 (Moses) said (to Sameri): "Go! Your (punishment) in this life
will be that you will say 'Touch me not'; and moreover (for a future
penalty) thou hast a promise that will not fail: now look at thy god of
whom thou hast become a devoted worshipper: we will certainly (melt) it
in a blazing fire and scatter it broadcast in the sea!"

Another brother mentioned that if Ali wished could very well incite
forcful rebelion since he is from a very strong tribe Bani Hashm, and
both Abu Bakr and Umar from a week tribe Adiyy, and Taym. Then why did
he keep silent and did not use force to restore his right after the
election held in Saqifah?

If Bani Hashim were strong with respect to other tribes, as the above
brother claims, then Muslims wouldn't have had to migrate from Mecca to
Medina. Also they wouldn't have been subject to economical sanctions in
She'b Abi Talib.

The exceptional brevity of Imam Ali (AS) in various wars and his
killing of the most important warriors of Arabs, is well-known for even
Sunnis. Imam Ali mentioned that he himself has killed 40,000 infidels by
his sword (this figure includes those who were killed by him in the
civil wars).

Killing the lions of Arabs developed a very intensive and long-lasting
hatred in the heart of the Arabs from different tribes. For this very
reason, most Arabs due to their tribal ties, even after embracing Islam,
were not friendly toward Imam Ali and other members of Ahlul-Bayt.

This hatred gave its fruit on the issue of Caliphate, and later in the
civil wars at the time of Imam Ali (AS) as well as the prosecution of
Ahlul-Bayt and their partisans after his martyrdom which continued with
utmost brutality for a number of centuries.

The hatred of the house of Umayyah against Bani Hashim (the clan of
Prophet and Ali) is well-known. The wars of Abu Sufyan and his son
Muawiyah against Prophet and Ali respectively, also the horrible
massacre of the grandson of prophet at Karbala by the grandson of Abu
Sufyan, are only some of top items among the long list of such crimes.

You might also want to refresh the memory that when Muawiyah took over
the power, he instituted the Sunnah of cursing Imam Ali. Sunni history
books and Sunni collections of traditions clearly state that Muawiyah
commanded all the Imams of the mosques throughout the Muslim world to
CURSE Imam Ali in every Friday prayer. (Sunni references are available
upon request).

Now, we turn to the events of Saqifah and the "election" of Abu Bakr:
During the lifetime of the Prophet (PBUH&HF), the Mosque of Prophet was
the center of all Islamic activities. It was there that the decision of
war and peace were made, delegations were received, sermons were
delivered and cases were decided. It is not surprising that when the
news of the demise of the Prophet (PBUH&HF) spread, the Muslims
assembled in that very Mosque.

On the other hand, Saqifah of Bani Sa'idah was located three miles
OUTSIDE Medina and was a secret location for the evil activities of some
Arab tribes. (see Ghiyath al-Lughah, p228).

Why then Sa'd Ibn Ubadah and his fans as well as Abu Bakr and Umar,
left the Mosque secretly and without informing other prominent
companions and went three miles outside Medina to discuss the issue of
Caliphate?

Why didn't they discuss the issue as important as this among the
Muslims inside the mosque? Wasn't that they wanted to usurp the
Caliphate without the knowledge of people? Why did Abu Bakr and Umar
with Abu Ubaydah slip out the mosque secretly? Was it because Ali and
Bani Hashim were present in the mosque and in the house of Prophet, and
they did not want them to know the plot?

Also, we should keep in mind that it was the custom of the Arabs that
once a person was declared, even by a small group, to be the chief of
the tribe, others hesitated to oppose him, and willy nilly followed
suit. Due to their dislike of Imam Ali (AS) (which I discussed earlier),
they did not respect his right, nor did they even informed him of this
meeting.

They SIMPLY neglected the last sermon of Prophet in Ghadir Khum where
the Messenger of God declared him as his successor just two and a half
months months before the incedent of Saqifah.

A Sunni brother mentioned that: If Imam Ali disaproved Uthman, then why
did he risk the lives of his beloved sons, al-Hassan and al-Hussain,
trying to protect the life of his adversary from the blood-thirsty
rioters in Medina?

According to the Shia sources such news are dubious. We do not have any
strong evidence that Imam Ali sent his sons to support Uthman's House.
In fact, al-Tabari who is one of the important Sunni Historians said
that Imam Ali deserted Uthman since Uthman did insisted in keeping
Marwan in his administration. Here is the related part from the History
of al-Tabari, when the siege over Uthman was very severe:

People informed Ali of the news. Then Ali came to Uthman and said:
"Surely you have satisfied Marwan (again), but he is satisfied with you
only if you deviate from your religion and reason, like a camel carrying
a litter that is led around at will.

By God, Marwan is devoid of sense in regard to his religion and his
soul. I swear by God, I think he will bring you in and then not send you
out again. After this visit, I will not come again to chide you. You
have destroyed your own honor and you have been robbed of your
authority."

When Ali departed, Uthman's wife told him: "I have heard that Ali said
to you that he will never return to you, and that you have obeyed Marwan
(again), who leads you wherever he wishes." Uthman said: "What shall I
do?" She responded: "You should fear God alone, who has no partner, and
you should adhere to the practice of your two predecessors (Abu Bakr and
Umar).

For if you obey Marwan, he will kill you. Marwan enjoys no prestige
among the people, and inspires neither awe nor love. People have only
abandoned you due to Marwan's position (in your councils). Send to Ali,
then, and trust in his honesty and uprightness. He is related to you and
he is not a man whom people disobey." So Uthman sent to Ali, but he
refused to come, saying: "I told him I would not return."

Sunni reference: History of al-Tabari, English version, v15, pp 176-179
Even we suppose that Imam Ali protected Uthman in his last days, the
protection was not because he loved Uthman to be on power.

He did so (if true) since he knew that this is a conspiracy, and he
knew that those companions who plotted to kill Uthman, would become the
avenger of his blood tomorrow, as it happened (e.g., the companions like
Talha, Zubair, Muawiyah, and ...) and it became a custom of
assassination of Caliphs with self-judgments including the assassination
of Ali (AS) himself.

Another reader mentioned that, if some companions conspired against
Imam Ali and usureped his right of Caliphate, is it not a possibility
that they conspired to alter the Quranic text? The compilers and
transmitters of the Quran were fallible and sinners.

As for protection of Quran, it is the will of Allah! Even if all the
people of the world gather to change it they will fail. Muslims could
recall the history that Allah willed to raise and preserve Moses in the
house of His Enemy, Pharaoh.

Also there was no reason for Umar or Abu Bakr to delete something from
Quran, because the name of Imam Ali did not appear in Quran. (eventhough
his name was in the divine commentary which was revealed with Quran but
was not a part of text of Quran. It is no surprise that this divine
commentary was suppressed). Nonetheless, Sunni documents agree that at
least 300 verses of Quran directly revealed on the honor of Imam Ali.
(reported by Ibn Asakir, al-Suyuti, Ibn Hajar, etc.) Beside that that,
Ibn Abbas said:

"There is no verse in Quran in which the term 'Believers', unless Ali
is at the top of them and the chief of them and the more virtuous one
among them. Surely Allah has admonished the companions of Muhammad
(PBUH) in Quran, but He did not refer to Ali except with honor."

Also, not all were sinners. The Sunni traditionists and historians Imam
Ali (AS) was the FIRST who compiled Quran. It took Imam Ali one week
after the death of Prophet to Finnish his compilation. Imam Ali
presented this Quran to the rulers of that time and they had a chance to
review it and learn about the missing verses of their own collections
and they did correct what they missed.

(Please see the article of "The Quran Compiled by Imam Ali" for the
references in this regard) As you see the one who corrected them was an
infallible one, and thus we have all reasons to believe that the Quran
that we have today is the very same as what was revealed to Prophet
except that it is not in the correct sequence. But nothing is missing
from it.

A brother mentioned that according to the verse:

If two parties among the Believers fall into fighting make peace
between them. If then one of them transgresses against the other, fight
that which transgresses until it complies with the command of Allah; but
if it complies then make peace between them with justice and be fair,
for Allah loves those who are just. (Quran 49:9)

Quran did not remove the characeristic of belief from either of the two
warring factions. That two Muslims fight is not an indication that one
of them is unbeliever.

The above comment is correct. But the verse does not imply that any
warring faction is necessarily Muslim even though they say so by their
tong. There is no doubt that a believer can be killer of an innocent and
also there is no doubt that such killer will go to Hell for ever as the
foolowing verse testifies:

"And Whoever kills a believer deliberately, his reward is Hell forever,
and the Wrath of Allah is upon him, He cursed him and prepared a great
punishment for him." (Quran 4:93)

The above verse (4:93) does not exclude believers from that punishment.
Whoever does so, is entitled to the same punishment be it believer or
unbeliever.

I also think you forgot to think about the latter portion of the verse
you quoted which was: "If then one of them transgresses against the
other, fight that which transgresses until it complies with the command
of Allah." Talha and Zubair are entitled to this last portion. Because
Imam Ali frequently asked them for reconciliation, but they killed his
messenger when he was carrying Quran to them for a sign of asking for
reconciliation.

The story is written in the History of Tabari, v4, P312. So those
companions are "Baaggee" -- transgressor according to the verse you
quoted, and should have been fought as Imam Ali did, and they will be
the companions of Hell forever.

A brother mentioned that according to Quran, Moses who was a Prophet of
god was confused with the strange actions of al-Khidhr. But when at the
end , Moses (AS) was told about the reasons behind those actions, he
completely admired them. Moses (AS) was a Prophet, but still He could
not see the complete picture related to these events; none of us are in
the position of Moses (AS). None of us has a clear picture of what we
are criticizing from the actions of the companions.

I would like to remind that brother that he is discrediting you the
most important investment which Allah gifted to everyone that is logic
(Aql). If I came to know God, it was due the using this investment. If I
found that Islam is the best religion, it is because I used my brain and
concluded that the instructions given in Quran are sound instructions
and the regulations of Islam are the best among all other
alternatives.

If one discredit this precious thing, he will lose every thing
including his religion, and he will accept any irrational 'fatwa' as a
religious command, he will accept some killers of innocents go to
paradise without giving it a thought.

Moses (AS) did not discredit this precious thing, and he asked Prophet
Khidr for clarification, and he finally got the answers and was
convinced shortly after the incidents. Now, can provide any rational
justification for what some companions did after the demise of
prophet?

It it about 14 centuries passed and we could not come up any
justification for their deads. So why should we still blindly follow
their narrations and their sayings which are in clear contradiction with
tha sayings of Ahlul-Bayt?

Asking question is not sin. Remaining ignorant is a big loss though.
Also comparing a sinless prophet with a sinfull companion is like
comparing heavens with the earth.

A Wahhabi contributor claimed that the Shia do not follow the Sunnah of
the prophet since it was transmitted by his companions.

This Wahhabi fellow did not even give it a second thought that the Shia
follow Imam Ali (AS) who was the BEST of the companions of the Prophet
and their most knowledgeable one, the Strong Rope of Allah (3:103), and
His Right Path (1:6). Neither his proximity of relationship with Prophet
was preceded (42:23), nor his preceding in accepting the religion
(56:10-11).

We stick to the instructions of Ahlul-Bayt who are pure and infallible
according to Quran and Hadith. Hence, we do not need to follow those of
companions who opposed/fought Ahlul-Bayt.

Thus the Shia, indeed, follow the Sunnah transmitted by a Prophet's
companion, the best of them. However, Wahhabis follow the worst of them,
that is Muawiyah, and take his Sunnah which has no similarity with the
Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH&HF).

A Wahhabi mentioned: It is part of our Sunni dogma to respect and love
the all the companions of the Prophet. Our scholars remind us that
vilification of the companions is Kufr.

Interestingly enough that those companions who remained loyal to Ali
received severe punishment from the government of the time, and were not
respected at all. One example is Abu Dhar who was exiled to the worst
climate location in the reign of Uthman because they could not stop him
from telling the truth. They kept him there till he died (martyred).

Abu Dhar was the one that prophet said in his virtue that "The Earth
does not carry nor the Heavens cover a man more frank and truthful than
Abu Dhar".

Wasn't Abu Dhar a great companion of prophet? So why shouldn't they
have respected him according to your judgment? It seems that even Uthman
did not accept your type of judgment! nor Talha and Zubair when they
were fighting against their legitimate Caliph Ali (AS). Are all of them
Kafir by your judgment?

When the Shia reflect on the mistakes of the companions, they do so in
retrospect of history. It would be very interesting to look at some of
the comments of both the Wahabi and the Sunni scholars in this
retrospect.

Ibn Taymiyyah, the Shaykhul Islam of the Wahabis, writes And merely
abusing some one other than the Prophets does not necessarily make the
abuser Kafir; because some of those who were in the time of the Prophet
(i.e companions) used to abuse one another and none of them was declared
kafir because of this (practice); and (also) because it is not Wajib to
have faith particularly in any of the companions; therefore abusing any
of them does not detract from the faith in Allah and His books and His
messengers and the Last day.

Wahabi reference: As Sarimu l masul, Ibn Taymiyyah, page 579 Published
in 1402/1982 by Alam al-Kutub

The name of Mulla Ali Qari requires no introduction to the Sunnis, and
he writes in his work of Sharah Fiqh al Akbar that To abuse Abu Bakr and
Umar is NOT Kufr, as Abush Shakur as Salimi has correctly proved in his
book, at Tamhid. And it is becuase the basis of this claim (claim that
reviling the Shaykhan is kufr) is not proven, nor its meaning is
confirmed.

It is so because certainly abusing a Muslim is fisq (sin) as is proved
by a confirmed hadith, and therefore the Shaykhan (Abu Bakr and Umar)
will be equal to the other (Muslims) in this rule; and also if we
suppose that some one murdered the Shaykhan, and even the two sons in
law (Ali and Usman), all of them together, even then according to
Ahlussunnah wa al- Jamah, he will not go out of Islam (i.e will not
become kafir) ...

Interesting note:

The above quote was taken from three (3) editions, printed in India and
Turkey. Now a new edition has been printed by Darul Lutubil Ilmiyah,
Beirut in 1404/1984, which claims to be the first edition, and from
which four pages (including the above text) have been OMMITED. The
deleted portion contains the declaration that ... those who believe that
Allah has a body are definitely kafir according to the Ijma without any
difference of opinions.


**Do I need to comment on Wahabi scholarship?**

Another prson mentioned: Why is it that you want Sunnis accept a
selected number of traditions from the Sunni sources which refutes the
integrity of people like Abu Bakr, Umar Ibn al-Khattab? This point
really irks me.

I am sorry it irks you! It is not completely correct, however. We have
nothing against the persons of Abu-Bakr, Umar and Ashia. We are looking
at history in retrospect and evaluating their actions - which should not
be considered a sin. Afterall, they were human beings who were capable
of making mistakes. Why not learn from their mistakes - particularly if
done in a sensetive way.

We just mentioned some traditions from Sunni books, actions and sayings
of the companions. If it sounds insulting it is not because the Shia put
them in there. I tried to give supportive evidence to my argument,
objectively, with no disrespect for the companions (khulafaa
particularly).

We feel that they made ijtihad in certain cases, that we don't agree
with - we choose to follow the ijtihad and teachings of others such as
Imam Ali and th Imams of his decendent - what is wrong with that? We
also feel that there has been a lot that has been attributed to them in
the form of Hadiths, that they have not necessarily said or agree
with.


This is due, in part, to the Umayads who hated Ahlul Bayt and wanted to
make them look as less than who they were, either by elevating the
status of the people you named and others, or by fabricating hadeeths in
conflict.
