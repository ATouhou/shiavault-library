Lesson One Hundred Twenty Five: Salam, Islamic Salutation
=========================================================

Imam Husayn (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لِلسَّلامِ سَبْعُونَ حَسَنةٌ تِسْعٌ وَ سِتُّونَ لِلْمُبْتَدى وَ
واحِدَةٌ لِلْرّادِّ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Salam (salutation) has 70 rewards, 69 parts of which are for one who
salutes and one part of which is for one who returns the salutation.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Among the salutations of various nations, ‘Salam’, the Islamic
salutation and greeting, has a special luminosity, because it indicates
both welcoming and peace, pleasure and friendship, and also a wish for
peace from God for the other party. For this reason, salutation of the
people of paradise is Salam, and angels of mercy receive the virtuous
and good-doers with Salam. Unfortunately, some egoistic Muslims think
that not saluting ( or not being the first to salute) reflects their
high status and saluting reduces their rank. Thus they deprive
themselves of the great reward mentioned in the above tradition
especially for those who show humility by taking the initiative to
salute first.
