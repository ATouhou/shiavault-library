12. the Exact Date of the Martyr
================================

\*       \*       \*

The true date of  Fâtemeh’s martyr, is a subject for discussion among
Muslims. Some say that it was forty days after the death of our Prophet,
some say it was sixty days after, some believe it was seventy five days
after, and some say it was ninety days, and some do believe that it was
ninety five days after the death of her beloved father. There are some
who also believe that Fâtemeh died six months, or even eight months
after her illustrious father.

But among the great Islamic scholars, there is an agreement that Fâtemeh
died ninety days after her father…

Some say that her grave is in “ Baghi “ cemetery, and some believe that
her grave is situated in her own little house.

We pray that Hazraté Fâtemeheye Zahra takes care of all of us, poor
sinners, and that she would be willing to intercede in our favour…! May
God hear her intercession for us, and forgive our sins and faults, and
let us enter the Paradise!
