Mutual Cooperation
==================

***“Cooperate with one another in good deeds and abstain from
evil”.***  
 (Surah al-Maida, 5:2).

Every human being needs the cooperation of others to lead a pleasant and
comfortable life. Man can never acquire happiness by remaining aloof
from others. As a matter of fact, cooperation with one another in good
deeds guarantees the progress of human society.

Islam also wishes that people should cooperate with one another in
accomplishing good tasks, like helping the needy, building schools and
hospitals etc.

Islam has insisted upon the Muslims, in very strong terms, to cooperate
with one another. It also wishes that, if a person is in difficulty,
others should help him. All of us should, therefore, endeavour to get
acquainted with the needs and difficulties of one another, and remove
them as far as possible.
