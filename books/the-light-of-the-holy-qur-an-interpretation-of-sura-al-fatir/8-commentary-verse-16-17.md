Commentary : Verse 16.17
========================

(16) إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ

(17) وَمَا ذَلِكَ عَلَي اللَّهِ بِعَزِيزٍ

16.“If He pleases, He will take you off and bring a new generation,”

17. “And this is not hard to Allah.”

**Commentary:**

The statement of the power of Allah is a way for inviting people and
threatening the disobedient ones. Allah is powerful in creation and His
Power has no limit.

For laying an emphasis on this very need and indigence of men, this
verse says:

“If He pleases, He will take you off and bring a new generation,”

Therefore, He is not in need of you and your worship, but it is you who
are in need of Him.

He neither needs your worshipping nor is he afraid of your sins, and in
the meantime, His vast mercy has encompassed all of you. Neither the
destruction of the entire world decreases anything from His greatness,
nor has the creation of this world added anything to the rank of His
sovereignty.

In the second verse, the Qur’a-n, as a repeated emphasis, says:

“And this is not hard to Allah.”

Yes, whatever He intends He commands it to be, and immediately it also
comes into being. Not only for the creation of Man, but also this
statement is true about the whole world of existence.

However, if Allah (s.w.t.) commands you concerning Faith, obedience,
and worship, all are for your own benefit, and the advantages and
blessings of them all return to you.


**Commentary : Verse 18**

(18) وَلاَ تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَي وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ
اِلَي حِمْلِهَا لاَ يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَيْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَي
اِنَّمَا تُنذِرُ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْن َرَبَّهُم بِالْغَيْبِ وَأَقَامُوا
الصَّلاَةَ وَمَن تَزَكَّي فَاِنَّمَا يَتَزَكَّي لِنَفْسِهِ وَاِلَي
اللَّهِ الْمَصِيرُ

18. “And no one laden bears the burden of another; and if one
heavy-burdened calls for its load to be carried, not a thing of it will
be carried, even if he be a near kinsman. You warn only those who fear
their Lord in secret and keep up prayer. And whoever purifies (himself),
he only purifies for his own self. And Unto Allah (alone) is the
destination (of all).”

**Commentary:**

Based on justice, everyone must carry his own burden. The verse says:

“And no one laden bears the burden of another; …”

In the Hereafter, the Record and Reckoning of everybody is separate
from those of others.

In the Qur’a-n we recite that, in order to deceive others, a group of
disbelievers say: “… follow our path and we will certainly bear (the
burdens of) your sins’. …” [^1] This verse is an answer to them.

Question: Taking this verse which says in Hereafter the burden of
everybody is on one’s own shoulder and it does not harm others, can we
say we should leave alone the sinners,

[^1] Sura Al-'Ankabu-t, No. 29, verse 12

because they themselves will carry the burden of their own sins and it
does not relate to us?

Answer: This verse does not justify the silence before unlawful things,
because undue silence itself is a sin upon those who commit this action.
Our duty is to bid the right and forbid the wrong, but if they did not
follow it, their sin would not be upon us.

The Qur’a-nic term /wizr/ means the heaviness and a load. The Arabic
word /mu?qalah/ means the weight of a load. The word /himl/ refers to
the load on the back while /haml/ refers to the load in the womb.
(Mufrada-t by Ra-gib)

This Qur’a-nic sentence: “And no one laden bears the burden of another.
…” is one of the basic fundamentals in Islamic convictions. In fact, on
one side, it relates to the justice of Allah that He counts everybody
pledged in his own action, rewards his righteous efforts and endeavours,
and gives retribution for his sins.

On the other side, it points to the severity of the divine punishment
on the Day of Hereafter when nobody agrees to carry the burden of the
sin of another person, even though he had been fond of him
extraordinarily.

Being attentive to this meaning has a great effect in man’s
self-improvement, because whoever is careful of himself he never tends
to corruption with the pretext that his entourage or his environment is
polluted. He does not count the pollution of the environment as a
justification for his own pollution, because everybody carries his own
burden.

On the other side, it gives man such a conception and understanding
that the reckoning of Allah with societies is not a total and a lamp
reckoning, but everybody will be reckoned separately and independently.
That is, if he has done his duty both in relation to his purification
and struggle against corruption, there will be no fear and horror on
him, although all humankind totally, except him, are polluted with
infidelity, polytheism, injustice, and sins.

Principally, no training program will be effective without attracting
the attentions to this basic principle.

This very subject is referred to in the second sentence in another
form. It says:

“… and if one heavy-burdened calls for its load to be carried, not a
thing of it will be carried, even if he be a near kinsman. …”

An Islamic tradition indicates that on the Day of Hereafter there will
be brought a mother and a son both of whom have a heavy burden of sins.
The mother asks her son to carry a part of her burden of sin and
responsibility instead of those labours she tolerated in the world for
him. The son will say to the mother to get distance from him, because he
is involved in difficulty more than her. (The Commentary of Abul-Futu-h,
Qurtubi-, and Rauh-ul-Baya-n)

Finally, in the third sentence this fact is revealed that the warnings
of the Prophet (p.b.u.h.) affect only in the receptive hearts, where it
says:

“… You warn only those who fear their Lord in secret and keep up
prayer. …”

The warnings of Divine prophets and Allah’s friends will not have any
effect unless there is the fear of Allah in the heart, and the one does
not feel the observance of a spiritual power over him inwardly and
outwardly, and by establishing the daily prayers which survives his
heart and causes him to remember Allah, he does not help this inner
feeling.

At the beginning of an action, when a person has chosen no faith and
has not believed, if he has not a truth-seeking character and does not
feel responsibility before the cognition of the facts, he will not
hearken to the invitation of prophets, and consequently he will not
contemplate over the Divine signs in the world of existence.

In the fourth sentence, the verse returns again to this fact that Allah
is self-sufficient from all. It adds:

“… And whoever purifies (himself), he only purifies for his own self.
…”

And, at last, in the fifth and the last sentence, it warns that if the
good doers and the evil doers do not reach the result of their deeds in
this world, it does not matter because the return of all is to Him. It
says:

“… And Unto Allah (alone) is the destination (of all).”
