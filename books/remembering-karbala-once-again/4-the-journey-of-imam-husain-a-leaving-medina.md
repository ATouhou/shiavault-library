The Journey of Imam Husain (‘a) Leaving Medina
==============================================

("Ghar Sejab Behre Safar Sayyid‑a Aalam Nikle")
When the Noble Prince left His home

His eyes were teary and His heart did mourn

As friends and sons followed behind

He cried out "Destiny, here I come."
"I've heard the cries of Zahra all night

The forsaken wilderness is in my sight"
Then towards the Prophet's tomb He glanced

He bowed His head in a respectful stance

Then approaching the tomb, He knelt and bowed

"Do I have Your permission to leave?" He asked
"Today I depart from this home and this land

Your grandson leaves this country's sands"
"Though mankind sleeps with peace in its homes

This peace is denied to me alone

The cry of my family breaks my heart

Where must we go with babes in our arms?"

"Neither jungle nor city can shelter me now

To send me to my grave, they've taken a vow'

"The enemy swords await my neck

On my friends and family havoc will wreck

You had warned my Mother of these days my Lord

She had cried and Her heart had filled with dread"

"But pray do not forget this forlorn Grandson

Who'll be beheaded under the blazing sun"
"In this heat, even birds stay close to their nests

it's the month of fasting, but leave I must

For danger lurks wherever I stop

My children or family can find no rest"
"My Lord, I've tired of living thus

Come, take me, hide me in Your grave's dust"

Inconsolable He wept at His Grandfather's tomb

The tomb did tremble and darkness loomed

Then the voice of the Prophet filled the air

"My noble son, your foes are doomed"

"Forgetting how much I hold you close

They seek to kill you, your wretched foes"
"My patient, my noble, my pious Grandson

My virtuous, my truthful, my brave Grandson

Woe to the people who forsake You now

My honor, my pride, my dearest Grandson"
"I'll be Your company, forever and now

Abandoning my tomb with You I will go"
Heartened, the Grandson rose and bowed

And His noble sister cried out loud

"Let us go my Brother to our Mother's grave

To bid farewell and kiss the shroud"

"Why must I weep here in the palanquin?

With strangers around and in this din?"

So He led His family to Zahra's grave

And Zainab alighted at a somber pace

And they bowed and kissed their mother's tomb

And around Him He felt His Mother's embrace
And He heard His Mother weep at His plight

"O Mother," He cried, "Bid me farewell tonight"

"Not yet," She cried,,, I must see Abbas,,

"Then I will bid you farewell soon alas!

He's born of another, but my son no less"

Hearing this Husain called "Hither Abbas"

"Do not proceed we leave not yet

My mother summons you to her grave instead"

Hearing this Abbas slowed his horse's pace

And came and knelt at the foot of the grave

And Zahra cried "My beloved son"

"I leave Husain's safety up to you beware!"

"You are a friend to Husain in these lonely times

Farewell, protect him from his enemies' designs"
