Explaining the Question
=======================

What we mean by discussing the economic doctrine is finding a method to
regulate the economic life according to the principle of equity. When we
inquire about the economic doctrine in Islam, we express our desire to
know whether or not Islam has brought a way to regulate the economic
life as capitalism, for example, has brought forth the principle of
“economic freedom,” using it as its own general outline in regulating
the economic life.
