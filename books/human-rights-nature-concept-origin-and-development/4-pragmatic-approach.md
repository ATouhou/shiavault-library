Pragmatic Approach:
===================

Besides, philosophical and theoretical approach, another way to looking
at the meaning and nature of Human Rights is pragmatism. Every right
whether it has been perceived an inalienable or other wise can have
validity and effectiveness only through some process or institution.
Thus it cannot be defined without reference to some institutional
structure. As a room can not be defined without reference to the walls.
So Human Rights can not be defined without reference to institutional
settings, therefore, it is important that their exists an internally
agreed upon catalogue of Human Rights, which should be minimal
definitional guide to understand the essence of human rights and
fundamental freedoms[^13] .
