Bahlool's Gift to the Khalifa
=============================

One day Haroun Rashid gave Bahlool some money and told him to distribute
it amongst the poor and needy.

Bahlool took the money, but a moment later gave it back to the Khalifa,
who asked the reason why he did this.

Bahlool said, “I thought a lot, but found no one more dependent and poor
than the Khalifa. This is the reason why I returned the money. I see
that your guards and officers stand in the shops and whip people,
collect tax and revenue, and then pour them all into your treasures. So
I thought that you are the most needy person, and gave the money back to
you.”
