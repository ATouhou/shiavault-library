Dedication
==========

My master Abfl Abd Allah: I raise these brief pages with both my hands
to dedicate them to your exalted holiness. I am sure that I am not among
those who match these high ascents, or whose goods are sold in such an
expensive market, but 1 am cleaving to the handle of this pure progeny,
holding fast to this Blessed Tree, and hoping very much to be among
those lucky ones who serve them. This book, which is between my hands,
is the result of my collecting, writing, and commenting-and the value of
each person is what he does well-then if there is a good feature in it,
it is from you and to you; if there is a slip in it, it is from my
disobedient pen. Still you are the best in forgiving short comings. My
hope is that you will be kind enough to buy these goods from your
follower. Its price is your acceptance. How high this price is!

**Your servant,  
 Mohammed al- Husayn aI- Muzaffar**
