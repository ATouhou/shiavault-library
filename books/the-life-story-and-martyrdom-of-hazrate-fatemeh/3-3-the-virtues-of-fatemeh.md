3. the Virtues of FÂtemeh!
==========================

Fâtemeh is the most gracious Lady that the world has known and seen so
far…! All the friends and all the enemies of Islam, are wont to admit to
her numerous virtues and to her great wisdom. Fâtemeh is so full of
magnificence, innocence and greatness, and possesses such a high rank in
the Divine Hierarchy, that God has promised Himself  to save all those
who truly love Fâtemeh, from Hell, and to bestow upon these faithful
believers, all the Benedictions that come forth from the adoration of
the Angels towards Himself.

In the Eyes of God, Fâtemeh possesses such magnitude and such closeness
to the Divine Love that God has named her : the most Dignified Lady
among all other women in the whole world … This divine title, means that
she is not only a perfect human being, but that she also has links with
the great entities of Islam.

Thus, God Almighty has promised Himself that whenever Fâtemeh Becomes
angry at someone, God Himself shall be angry at that person, and whoever
shall rejoice her, shall also rejoice God.
