Entrusting Oneself to Allah
===========================

The one who entrusts his affair to Allah is in eternal rest and
constant carefree ease of life; he is above caring about anything except
Allah, as the Commander of the Faithful said, I was content with what
Allah allotted me, and I entrusted my affair to my Creator. As Allah was
good in what has passed, so He will be good in what remains.

As Allah said, in the words of a believer among the people of Pharaoh,

>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَأُفَوِّضُ أَمْرِي إِلَى اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَصِيرٌ بِالْعِبَادِ.
فَوَقَاهُ اللَّهُ سَيِّئَاتِ مَا مَكَرُوا وَحَاقَ بِآلِ فِرْعَوْنَ
سُوءُ الْعَذَابِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"I entrust my affair to Allah, surely Allah sees the servants". So
Allah protected him from the evil consequences of what they planned and
the most evil punishment overtook Pharaoh's people.*** (40:44‑5)


The Arabic word for entrustment (*tafwid*) consists of five letters,
each letter having an injunction. He who heeds their commands brings the
*ta* of his abandoning (*tark*) plans in this world; the *fa* of the
annihilation (*fana*) of every aspiration other than Allah; the *waw* of
fulfilling (*wafa*) the contract and confirming the promise; the *ya* of
despairing (*ya's*) of yourself, and certainty (*yaqin*) in your Lord;
and the *dad* of a conscience (*damir*) which is purely for Allah, and
of the need (*darurah*) for Him. He who entrusts everything to Allah
wakes up in the morning free of all evils, and at night sleeps protected
in his faith.
