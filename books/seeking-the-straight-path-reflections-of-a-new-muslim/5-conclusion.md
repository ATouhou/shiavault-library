 Conclusion
===========

   
 I hope that you have found something in this work to be of use. I have
attempted it purely for the sake of Allah (swt), and I do welcome your
feedback. I know that it is not really a complete work or of an
adequately scholarly nature due to my own personal limitations. I have
attempted herein to outline my own path to Islam including a bit of
personal history, a modest portion of study in the field of comparative
religion, and a brief expounding on topical subjects in Islam that were
of particular interest to me as a female American convert to the
religion. All errors within the text are of course solely mine.  
    
 I owe thanks to a great many people who have helped me along my path
and who continue to do so.
