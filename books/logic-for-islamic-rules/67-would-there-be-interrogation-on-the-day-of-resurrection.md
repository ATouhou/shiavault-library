Would There Be Interrogation On the Day of Resurrection?
========================================================

**Question:** It is mentioned in Surah Rahman that:

*So on that day neither man nor Jinni shall be asked about his sin.
[Surah Rahman 55:39]*

Though in numerous other verses we read that the sinners will be
questioned on that day.

**Answer:** As testified by the very next verse of this Surah here the
statement that the sinners will not be questioned means that they will
not be questioned verbally so that they could reply with their tongue
like they do in this world. Rather their deeds will be exposed from
their faces themselves. And their hands, legs and other physical organs
will explain about all their deeds and actions.

In the same Surah after two verses it is mentioned that the sinners will
be recognized from their faces. In Surah Yasin also it is said that:

*On that day We will set a seal upon their mouths, and their hands shall
speak to Us, and their feet shall bear witness of what they earned.
[Surah Yasin 36:65]*

Therefore if in the captioned verse it is said they shall not be
questioned, it means that there will not be oral interrogation. But
other witnesses that are the physical parts will give the replies.
