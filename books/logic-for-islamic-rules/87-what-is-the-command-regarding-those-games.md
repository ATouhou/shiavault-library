What Is the Command Regarding Those Games?
==========================================

**Question:** Are games like boxing etc.  haraam (illegal) in Islam or
not? And also those who take it up as a profession and work for it, what
is the position of this action of theirs? Is it permitted?

**Answer:** Basically all those games and physical exercises are
permitted that are beneficial to the health and do not cause any danger
provided they are not connected to the illegal acts.

Because every dangerous act by which there is a danger to himself or
some other person is prohibited from the Islamic point of view and the
game of boxing is not without any risk. Therefore we must refrain from
these games. And we all know many young people have lost their lives in
boxing and many lives have been lost. On the basis there is no harm if
one participates or works for the games which are beneficial to the
people and society in general other than this all games are illegal.
