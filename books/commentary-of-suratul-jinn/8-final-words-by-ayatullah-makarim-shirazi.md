Final Words by Ayatullah Makarim Shirazi
========================================

 

O' Allah!  On that day when the Jinn and Mankind will be brought forth
the Court of Justice in Your presence and those who had committed wicked
deeds will feel remorse for their actions, cover us with the shadow of
Your Grace.

O' Allah!  The sphere of Your Dominion is wide and spacious and our own
knowledge and understanding is limited, therefore, please protect us
from the slips and errors and mistakes that we fall prey to.

O' Allah!  The station and rank of Your Prophet is so great that in
addition to his invitation (to the religion of Islam) being extended to
humanity, all other creations too answered his call - thus, please
accept and place us amongst the ranks of the true believers.
