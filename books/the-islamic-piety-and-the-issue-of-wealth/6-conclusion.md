Conclusion
==========

The process of wealth creation always needs a fluid interaction between
complex institutions to succeed. Through a brief review of the Islamic
worldview, we may conclude that Islamic piety, which originates from a
coherent system with well-connected components, is capable of motivating
the wealth creation process to create a higher quality of life.
Salvation as an indicator of high-level self-interest is regarded as a
high potential motivation to serve people and for society to
passionately pursue Godâ€™s pleasure. Since Islamic piety may not be
realized except by deep attention to the interest of people in all
generations and by strong endeavors to increase the stock of human and
social capital, it imbues every province of life completely. Hence, we
may expect that the Islamic worldview is capable of synthesizing all
various economic schools of thought in a convergent trend.
