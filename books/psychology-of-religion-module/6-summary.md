Overview
--------

Religion has been a potent influence in the history of humankind and
continues to exert a powerful influence in many people’s lives today.
People’s religious lives can be better understood by examining the
psychological dimensions of their religion. We began this chapter by
exploring the wide scope of religion, the history of psychology of
religion, linkages between psychology of religion and general
psychology, as well as psychological models and religion. Then we turned
our attention to defining religion and evaluating dimensions of
religious commitment, the science-versus-religion problem, and religious
orientation, especially focusing on intrinsic and extrinsic
orientations. Our coverage of religious development emphasized religious
development in children and adolescents, Fowler’s life-span
developmental theory, and religion and spirituality in older adults. We
also studied the fascinating topic of religious conversion and read
about religious experience, religious attitudes and behavior, and links
between religion and health.

<td align="left"><p>Psychology of religion was a part of the field of psychology from the beginning. William James wrote The Varieties of Religious Experience in 1902. Psychology of religion flourished until the 1930s, then was dormant for about three decades. In the last several decades, renewed interest in the psychology of religion has emerged.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>Defining Religion</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Defining religion is an inordinately difficult task, so difficult that there is no universally accepted definition. Batson defined religion in terms of its functional, existential nature. Another definition says that religiousness involves a conscious dependency on a deity or God. In general, we can say that religion is a set of beliefs that individuals adhere to and use as a guide in their personal life. In psychology of religion, an important strategy is to operationally define the aspects of religiousness that are being studied. One issue is whether religion and spirituality are different.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>Dimensions of Religious Commitment</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The concept of religion is multifaceted and multidimensional. The dimensions of religious commitment include religious belief, religious practice, religious feeling, religious knowledge, and religious effects. Conceptually, it can be useful to combine the dimensions in ways that are psychologically meaningful, such as high and low degrees of belief and knowledge.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>The Science-Versus-Religion-Problem</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Psychology (like any other science) is not necessarily in conflict with religion. The either/or view of psychology and religion is inaccurate. For the most part, scientists’ views are compatible with, rather than in opposition to, religious teachings. Psychology can neither prove nor disprove religion, but the psychology of religion can tell us much about how religion works in people’s lives.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>Religious Orientation</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>One of the most important concepts that have guided psychology of religion since the 1960s is the concept of intrinsic religious motives (motives within the person) and extrinsic religious motives (using religion for nonreligious ends). The notion that intrinsically religious individuals live their religion while their extrinsic counterparts use it also includes the concept that religion is a master motive in the lives of those who are intrinsically motivated. In actuality, religious orientation is more complicated than a simple dichotomy between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>Religious Development in Children and Adolescents</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Many children show an interest in religion, and religious institutions are designed to introduce children to religious beliefs. In many cases, the indoctrination works. Religious issues are important to adolescents, and adolescence may be a special juncture in religious development. Many adolescents incorporate a religious view into their identity development. The cognitive developmental theory of famous Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget provides a backdrop for understanding religious development in children and adolescents. Linkages between religiousness and sexuality occur in adolescence.</p></td>

Fowler’s six stages are intuitive-projective faith, mythical-literal faith, synthetic-conventional faith, individuative-reflective faith, conjunctive faith, and universalizing faith.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>Religion plays a special role in the lives of older adults. Many church leaders are elderly adults, and many elderly adults show a strong religiousness. Religion is linked to a sense of well-being among the elderly, and religion can fulfill some important psychological needs in old age.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>Two types of conversion are sudden and gradual. Another type is lifelong religious socialization. The old view was that religious conversion occurs against a person’s will. The new view is that converts are active and religion-seeking. More cognitively oriented versions of conversion have also been offered.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>Religious experience can be evaluated in two ways - from the inside or from the outside. Two general classes of factors that facilitate religious experiences are dispositional and situational. Religious orientation is a dispositional factor; taking drugs and floating underwater are situational factors.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>The grand paradox is that individuals who attend church tend to be more prejudiced than nonchurchgoers. However, Allport found that consistent churchgoers were less prejudiced than sporadic churchgoers. Two lines of research that followed after Allport’s work have focused on quest (high-quest individuals generally are less prejudiced and are less likely to discriminate against ethnic minorities) and means and ends (Pargament argues that religion involves the simultaneous interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation).</p></td>

However, religion and mental disorder likely co-occur in only a small number of people. Religion can play an important role in coping, for some individuals. Happy people tend to have a meaningful religious faith, but it is important to remember that the link is correlational, not causal.</p></td>

Many individuals who join cults are in a transitional phase of their lives and cults promise to fulfill most of their needs. Potential for the worse abuse is when the cult is physically and socially isolated from the outside community.</p></td>
