Entering Kufa
=============

On the twenty-fifth of Shawwal, he entered Kufa[^1] and stayed with
al-Mukhtar Ibn Abu ‘Ubayd al-Thaqafi[^2] who was highly respected among
his people, a generous man, a man of ambition and daring, one well
experienced and determined, and a formidable opponent of the enemies of
Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them.

He was a wise man, a man of great discretion especially with regard to
the rules of the battle and the means of subduing the foe. His
experience taught him wisdom. He underwent calamities from which he
learned self-discipline. He kept company with the Progeny of the most
holy Prophet (S), so he benefitted from their ethics and virtuous
morals, and he sought their advice publicly and privately.
