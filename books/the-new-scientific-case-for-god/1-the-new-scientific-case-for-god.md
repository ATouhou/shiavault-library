The New Scientific Case For God
===============================

The more we advance on the road to science in all directions, micro and
macro, the arguments in favor of an intelligent designer become
increasingly eloquent. The origin of the "laws" of nature and the
precise values of the "constants" necessitate intelligent design. The
precision in the "mix" of constants that were necessary preconditions
for the universe to evolve and for life to emerge provide mathematical
evidence in support of the "God" hypothesis.

The odds of obtaining these "constants" without putting "intelligent
design" in the equation is one out of 10,000,000 to the power 124. To
see how impossible it is, compare this number to the total amount of
subatomic particles in the whole universe, which has been calculated to
be 10 to the power 80 (Hoyle, Wickramasinge 1985).

Given the exact "mix" of these "constants", we can logically deduce
from inductive premises that they were "intelligently" set by one
source, i.e. one God. The "oneness" of this source is observed by the
uniformity in the workings of these laws of nature all through the
universe, the common origin of everything in the universe and the
blueprint of life all across the species.

Faced with such scientific evidence, justice demands that we
acknowledge the creator. These facts make clear the assertion that
Atheism is a "faith" based religion, with blind "belief" in nature as
the "deity" to be evoked as an excuse for every "cause" that cannot be
empirically explained. In this age of science, God is a fact. .

This paper DOES NOT present in any way the Christian Creationists
position on humankind's origin. The Koran does not set a time of 6000
years for the creation of the world neither does it support the
unscientific ideas in the Bible.

**THE CAUSE:**

The Universe consists of billions of galaxies and each galaxy has a
vast number of stars. To study a galaxy, scientists record light from it
on a strip of film. If the galaxy is moving away from our galaxy, the
lines on the spectrum will be towards the red end of the film, this is
called red shift. By this mechanism scientists conclude that with the
exception of a few nearby galaxies, all the galaxies are moving away
from us, and the further away they are the faster they are moving
away.

The Universe's expansion, discussed above began with an explosive
event, called the "big bang". In 1965 a type of radiation called the
"Cosmic Background Radiation" was discovered (also called the microwave
background radiation) by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson. All regions of
the sky send the same amount of this radiation to the earth. This was
the breakthrough for the big bang theory.

Long before 1965, scientists had predicted that we should be able to
find energy remaining from the Big Bang. They had now factually
confirmed the faint remnant of the energy produced during the explosive
birth of the universe. This radiation has a temperature of 3K (therefore
it is also called 3K radiation) and it is very close to the value
predicted by scientists before it was discovered.

This radiation is much different to the radiation coming from a
particular portion of the universe since it cannot be increased or
decreased by pointing an antenna and is uniform from all locations to
the earth.

In 1948, the "steady state theory" was advanced which now has fallen
out of favor and which was completely knocked out by the above discovery
of 3K radiation. Scientists today accept the Big Bang theory as being
the most reliable with the most evidence to back it up. However, they do
not know what CAUSED the big bang. The standard big bang theory does not
explain what caused the big bang. Thus, scientists face a reality.
Without God, the Big Bang is an impossibility.

"Do not the unbelievers see that the skies and the earth were one unit
(joined together), then we split them apart..." Koran 21:30 To clarify
some terms: If it is said that the universe is OPEN, it means it will
expand forever. If it is said that it is closed, it will not expand
forever. Whether a universe will expand, depends on if its average
density is less than or equal to its critical density.

Our universe at present according to estimates has less than 20% of the
density of matter to stop it from expanding. Essentially, it will
continue to expand.

The universe is not beginning-less. It was "born" out of the big bang
and had a beginning. Some people maintain the unscientific idea that the
universe is beginning-less like the steady-state theory.

This has been proven wrong according to the Second Law of
Thermodynamics. In a closed system (by closed here we mean one which
does not take energy from the outside- this is different to the closed
definition given above), entropy (a measure of the degree to which a
systems energy is unavailable to perform useful work) increases with
time. To restate this: In a system which doesn't take energy from the
outside (like our universe), entropy increases with time.

If the universe had existed forever, we would see maximum entropy
(complete disorder) which we do not see at all, something referred to as
the fate of excessive expansion.
