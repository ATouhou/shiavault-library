Merits of Marriage
==================

Marriage is the holy legal tie between man and woman through which they
share the same life and reciprocate definite rights and obligations. God
has passed the law of matrimony so as to keep humankind on this earth
and keep the earth constructed and pros perous.

“Marry the single people among you and the righteous slaves and
slave-girls. If you are poor, Allah will make you rich through His
favor; He is Bountiful and All-knowing (24:32).”

“His creating spouses for you out of yourselves so that you might take
comfort in them and His creating love and mercy among you re evidences
(of the truth) for the people who (carefully) think (30:21).”

The Prophet (s) said: “The most favorable thing to Allah that is ever
constructed in Islam is marriage.” ( 1 )

“He who gets married wins the half of his religion. Hence, he should
fear Allah in questions regarding the other half.” ( 2 )

“Marriage is my custom; therefore, he who rejects my custom is not
belonged to me.” ( 3 )

“Get married, for I will take pride in your great numbers on the Day of
Resurrection. The immature fetus, even, will stop on the door of
Paradise saying angrily, ‘unless my parents will be with me, I refuse to
be in Paradise.’” ( 4 )

“The two-rakaa prayer offered by the marrieds is preferred to the night
worship and the fasting of the bachelors.” ( 5 )

“The evilest dead are the bachelors.” ( 6 )

Imam as-Sadiq (a) said: “A two-rakaa ( 7 ) prayer offered by the
marrieds is preferred to a seventy-rakaa prayer offered by bachelors.” (
