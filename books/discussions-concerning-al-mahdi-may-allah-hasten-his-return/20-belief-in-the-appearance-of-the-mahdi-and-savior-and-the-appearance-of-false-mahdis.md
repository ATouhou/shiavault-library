Belief in the Appearance of the Mahdi and Savior and the Appearance of False Mahdis
===================================================================================

Question:
---------

Belief in the appearance of the Mahdi and savior has caused the
appearance of false Mahdis throughout history, and some make this
circumstance a justification for setting aside this idea. To what extent
can this viewpoint be accepted?

Answer:
-------

This viewpoint is absolutely unacceptable, or else humanity must set
aside all positive viewpoints. This is because all of them have more or
less been subject to misuse. All of the individuals who claimed to be
God or regarded themselves the manifestation of God, united with God, or
regarded God to have taken abode in them have all misused the principle
of belief in Allah. This action in no way harms the issue of belief in
Allah.

Similarly, all of the false prophets who claimed prophecy and misled a
people do not transmit any damage to the correctness of the principle of
prophecy. This issue arises in more or less every field and industry,
but that incident brings no harm to that field itself.

In short, if any name or word that has a good and attractive meaning has
been used for its opposite, this does not damage these values and good
affairs themselves, such as if a betrayer has been called trustworthy,
an oppressor called just, an ignorant person called learned, a sinner
called God-fearing, or if all treacheries and oppressions have been
committed in the name of well-wishing and seeking reform.
