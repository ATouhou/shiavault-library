Question 46: Hearing And Sight In The Holy Qur’an
=================================================

**Question:** What is the reason that in the following verse of the Holy
Qur’an the word “Samaa” is in singular, but “Qalb” and “Basar” are used
in plural form.

***“Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing and
there is a covering over their eyes.”***[^1]

**Answer:** Some commentators say that here, “Sama” is in the sense of
noun of action and when on some word there is an increase of noun of
action, then that noun of action gives the meaning of totality and
generality. And it is not dependant on that word to be plural. But the
other two words i.e. “Qalb” and “Basar” are used in the sense as a name
of a specific organ. That is why they have come in plural form.

Some research scholars have described this difference that every person
understands the things of various types with his heart and imagination.
And in the same way he perceives colors, faces, shapes and measurements
with eyes.

The perception of those two organs are numerous and exceptionally of
various kinds. According to this every person from among us has, so to
say, numerous hearts and eyes. But everyone from among us can hear only
the sound waves and for that reason the word “Sama” is used as a
singular.

It is true that voices are also of many varieties, but not that much as
those things, which can be seen with the eyes. In the same way those
things are also exceptionally various and diverse, whom man imagines and
understands.
