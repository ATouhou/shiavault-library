Heaven is a Garden
==================

With rivers flowing and fruits ever-available, both the Qur’anic and
universal depictions of Heaven are of an uncorrupted piece of nature, a
garden.15

Through not only describing Heaven as a garden, but also directly using
the word “Garden” (*Janna* ) in reference to Heaven, there is a Qur’anic
allusion to a link between sacredness and nature. If Heaven is a garden,
then the act of destroying the gardens of Earth (forests, rivers, etc.)
is metaphorically a destruction of the Heaven on Earth. Thus, with both
this and the status of natural creatures as worshippers of God in their
constant prostration to Him in consideration, nature is regarded as
sacred territory whose mistreatment is impermissible.

Nature is also a God-given gift. Throughout the Qur’an, and universally,
Heaven is described as a positive recompense that God provides to those
who deserve it.16 This heavenly reward comes in a form similar to that
of nature; it is this that God gives to people as a gift for their good
deeds. If the act of throwing money or anything valuable away is
regarded a great waste, then what is there to say about mistreating what
is similar to the invaluable reward that God sees most fit for the
righteous? These are just some of the many reasons of why humanity
should treat well, love, admire and understand nature-our holy gift and
friend.
