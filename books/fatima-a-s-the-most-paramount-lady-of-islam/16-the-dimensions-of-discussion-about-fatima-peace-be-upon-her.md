The Dimensions of Discussion about Fatima (peace be upon her):
==============================================================

Analyzing and evaluating Fatima’s aspects of life are beyond our power,
because it needs awareness and full knowledge of Fatima’s character. She
is also a symbol, the symbol of a distinguished wife, a distinguished
daughter, a distinguished mother, a distinguished heroin, a
distinguished companion, a distinguished fellow and confidant, the
symbol of worship, the symbol of love towards Allah, the symbol of pains
and efforts, the symbol of campaigner, the symbol of patience, the
symbol of administering justice, the symbol of serving people, the
symbol of speech, the symbol of forbearance and self-possession, the
symbol of politeness and humanity, the symbol of chastity and piety, the
symbol of bravery….

How can we swim in the deep sea of her life, hoping that we arrive to
the beach. Yes, everyone endeavors to trace some aspects of her life
according to his apprehension and perception.
