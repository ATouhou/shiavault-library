Question 36 : What Is the Criterion For Distinguishing 'unity' From 'polytheism'?
=================================================================================

**ANSWER:**

The most important matter in the subject related to unity and
polytheism is knowing the criterion for both; and as long as this matter
is not solved regarding its fundamental concept, some of the matters
that have an apparent concept will also not be solved. Thus we shall
present the meanings of both unity and polytheism in different
dimensions though briefly:

Unity in it's essence:

This can be presented in two ways:

God (and according to the scholars of dialectical theology: the
necessary existence) is an absolute one and has no homologue. This is
the same unity referred to as the one that is mentioned in the Holy
Quran in various ways such as, "Nothing is the likeness of Him."

And in another instance, "And none is like unto Him," This kind of
unity is of course interpreted in a manner that gives us the impression
of numerical interpretation, that God is one and not two. It is obvious
that this kind of numerical unity is not suitable for the divine
position of Allah.

The essence of Allah is simple and not compound, due to the fact that
compoundness of a being in mental or external parts, is the sign of a
need toward its parts; 'need' being the sign of possibility and
possibility is accompanied with a need for a cause, and all these are in
disagreement with the position of the necessary existence.

Unification in the creation:

This is one of the stages of unity which is accepted both logically as
well as according to the traditions:

From the logical point of view, there is a possible system lacking
every kind of perfection and whatever thing there is other than God,
which originated from the source of the self-sufficient. Thus all the
manifestations of beauty and perfection in the universe belong to the
Lord of beauty and perfection.

As for the Quranic point of view, there are many verses that state
about the unity of the creator, such as:

"Say, Allah is the creator of all things, he is one, the supreme."

Thus, there is no difference in opinion among the theologians regarding
the unity of creation in general. However, there are two interpretations
for the unity of creation that we shall mention to both of them:

A. All the kinds of reason and caused systems, and reason and caused
relations among the beings, terminate to the cause of all causes. In
reality the independent and original creator is God, and the effect of
other than God in causing anything is in succession with his permission
and will.

According to this theory, it admits of the system of cause and effect
in the universe which science has also uncovered, however, at the same
time, all the systems are in one way attached to God, and it is only He,
who is the one to bring about this system in the first place and give
cause to the causes, reason to reasons and effect to the effects.

B. There is only a single creator in the universe and that is the one
and only Lord of the worlds. In the system of existence, there is no
kind of effect and is not being influenced by other things, and God only
is the direct creator of all the natural phenomenon there is, such that
even the humans power is not able to depict His intricately-designed
actions.

Thus, there is left only one cause in the universe and this is the
replacement for what science identifies as 'natural causes'.

Such thinking is an interpretation for the unity in the creation and
meets the approbation of the Asharite scholars, however, some of their
personalities, such as Imam Al-haramain and lately, Sheikh Muhammed
Abduh in their treatise of unification, deny to this commentary choosing
the first interpretation.

**Unity in management:**

Since creation is specifically done by God, the management of the
system of the universe also belongs to Him. In the entire universe,
there exists only a single management and the logical proof that
stabilizes the unification in the creation also proves the unification
in the management of it.

The Holy Quran in several verses introduces Allah as the sole manager
of the universe by quoting verses like:

"Say, What! Shall I seek a Lord other than Allah? And He is the Lord of
All things."

According to both the Shia and Sunni commentators, they fully agree to
the unity regarding the creation, although from our point of view, the
meaning of unity in the managing of the universe is the restriction of
the independent management of God.

Thus, the entire management existing among the beings in the system of
creation takes place with the sole will and desire of God. The Holy
Quran also points to the kind of management that is usually attached to
the Lord such as:

"Then those who regulate the affair."

**Unity in Rulership:**

This concept is explained in that the rulership of a particular right
only belongs to God and it is only Him ruling over the individuals in
the society as a whole. As the Holy Quran mentions:

**"Judgment is only Allah's"**

Thus, the ruler ship of others ought to take place with His permission
such that only the earnest humanbeing may tend to control the affairs of
the society and lead the people towards happiness and salvation, as the
holy Quran states:

"O Dawood, surely we have made you a ruler in the land; so judge
between the men with justice."

Unity in Obedience:

The unity in obedience means that the essentially obeyed and the one on
whom obedience is an obligation, is none but the Glorious Lord, Allah.
Thus, the necessity to obey others such as the pr, imams, jurisprudent,
scholars, mother and father is all due to the will and command of Allah.
Unity in Legislation:

This means that the right of legislation belongs to God alone. Thus,
our heavenly book declares any other rule which is out of the framework
of the divine law as sheer infidelity, as the Quran states declares:

"and whosoever did not judge by what Allah revealed, they are those who
are the non-believers."

".., and whosoever did not judge according to what Allah has revealed,
they are those who are the transgressors."

", and whosoever did not judge accordingly to the commands of Allah and
what He has revealed, they are those who are the unjust."

**Unity in Worship:**

The most important subject regarding this unity is identification of
the meaning of 'worship'in itself due to the fact that all the Muslims
agree upon this matter that worship only belongs to Allah and one cannot
claim to worship other than Him. As the Holy Quran states in this regard
that: "Thee alone we serve and thee alone do we seek for help."

When looking at the verses of the Holy Quran, one can derive to the
point that this is a matter of joined principle amongst the call of all
the prophets and all the divine messengers who were appointed for the
purpose of propagating this. The Holy Quran says to this regard: "And
certainly We raised in every nation an apostle saying: Serve Allah and
shun the Satan."

Therefore, there lies no disparity in this principle of the unity in
worship being exclusive for God and no one other than His who is worthy
to be worshipped; and no individual is a believer in the unity of Allah
except when he implies to this principle.

The contradiction lies somewhere else i.e. what is the criterion for
distinguishing 'worship' from non-worship?

Or maybe in other words, is the paying of homage to the saints of God
or even for instance kissing the hand of a teacher, father, mother,
scholar, considered to be worshipping them? Or is it that worship other
than the absolute meaning of extraordinary homage and submission, where
the element is to be considered that if that element is not to be
achieved in practice, no kind of submission, not even to the limit of
prostration is considered as worship.

At this point, let us observe that particular element which gives the
submission and paying of homage the name of worship and this subject
seems to be of paramount importance.

**The Misconception Of Worship:**

A group of authors came up with the meaning of worship as 'submission'
or the 'extraordinary submission.' However, this group failed to solve
it accordingly to the chain of the Quranic verses. The Holy Quran says
declares that:

"we ordered the angles to prostrate in front of Adam." "And when we
said to the angles: Make obeisance to Adam."

The prostration for Adam is done as the same manner as the prostration
for God. Whereas the first shows humility and submissiveness, the second
is regarded worship.

Now why do these two similar prostrations have two different
quiddities?

The Quran at another instance said:

Prophet Yaqub together with his sons prostrated to prophet yusuf:

"And he raised his parents upon the throne and they fell down in
prostration before him, and he said, O my father! This is the
significance of my vision of old, my Lord has indeed made it to be
true."

It is necessary to mention that what Yusuf meant by his previous
dreams, the one whereby he saw the eleven stars, the sun and moon
prostrating before him. As the Holy Quran states for Yusuf says:

" O my father! Surely I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon I saw
them making obeisance to me."

Since prophet Yusuf mentioned the prostration as the interpretation to
his dream, it becomes clear that which was meant by the eleven stars
were his eleven brothers, and the sun and moon as his parents.

Thus, not only Yusuf's brothers, but also his father yaqub prostrated
to him.

The question arises here, why was this prostration that was the sign of
utmost humility and submission not referred to as 'worship'? A mere
Excuse worse than the sin:

Hereby, the mentioned group that is helpless from answering say the
following, "Since this submission occurred with the command of God, it
is no longer regarded as polytheism."

However, it is quite obvious that this answer is unskillful because of
the quiddity of a work being polytheism, God would not have ordered for
it to be observed in the long run.

The holy Quran states:

"Say, surely Allah does not enjoin indecency; do you say against Allah
what you do not know?"

Basically, God's command does not transform the quiddity of the thing;
if the reality of the submission before a human is worship to him and
God has commanded to performing it; the result is the command of the
worship to him.

**Solving the problem by stating the real meaning of 'Worship'**

To this point, it has become clear that the principle of the
prohibition of worship other than God is agreed upon by all those who
believe in the unity of God. On the other hand, it becomes clear that
the prostration of the angles for Adam and Yaqub and his son's
prostration for Yusuf (p) is not considered as worship to them.

So let us see to the element causing the movement at a single time to
have the title of worship at the same time the very movement with the
same properties is not worship at another.

By referring to the Quranic verses, it becomes clear that worship is
the submission before a being that is accompanied with considering him
as God or attributing Godly works to him. It becomes very clear that the
belief in God or the belief in his ability to the performance of Godly
works is that element when accompanied by any submission, makes it to be
worship.

The polytheists, including the inhabitants of the Arab peninsula and
others, had the submission before certain beings whom they considered to
be created by God, however, at the same time, also believed that some of
the Godly works were also assigned to them, the least of which being the
right to the forgiving of sins, and the freedom of intercession.

A group of the Babylonian polytheists worshipped celestial bodies
considering them as their 'Lord' and not their 'creator', as the ones
assigned for the management of the universe and the humans. The history
of prophet Ibrahim when came across these people, was also based on this
fact. The polytheists of Babylon never considered the sun, moon and
stars as the created by God, rather, accepted them to be powerful
creatures that were assigned to the management of the universe.

The Quranic verse explains Ibrahim's debate with these polytheists and
depended on the word. 'Rabb-Lord' in his argument meaning the owner and
m anager of ones slave.

The Arabs called the owner of the house as 'Rab al bait' and the owner
of the farm as rab al dai-ah, because the management of the house and
the farm is assigned to them.

The Quran, by introducing God as the only manager and the 'Lord' of the
universe combats against the polytheists calling them all towards the
worship of the one and only God and says:

"Surely, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, therefore, serve Him; this is
the right path."

Yet elsewhere states:

"That is Allah, your Lord, there is no God but He; the creator of all
things, therefore, serve him,."

It is said in sura 'al-Dukhan':

"There is no God but He; he gives life and causes death, your Lord and
the Lord of your fathers of yore."

The Holy Quran quoting from prophet Jesus says: and the Messiah said:

"O children of Israel! Serve Allah my Lord and your Lord."

Thus, it clearly becomes apparent that any kind of submission which is
free from belief in being God and attributing divine works to him,
cannot be referred to as 'worship' even if it is with utmost submission
and humility.

Therefore, the submission of the children before their parents and the
nations submission towards the prophet (p) which is free from that
condition will never be called as worshipping them.

Thus, the subjects such as, 'seeking blessings with God's close and
pious servants, kissing the shrine, thdoor, wall of the sanctuaries,
seeking the aid through the beloved of God, calling upon the upright
slaves of God, commemorating the death and birth ceremonies of the
saints of God and that some unaware people refer to as the act of
worship and regard as polytheism, are all in actuality free from the
worship to other than God.
