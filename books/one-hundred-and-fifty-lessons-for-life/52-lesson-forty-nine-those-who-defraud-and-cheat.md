Lesson Forty Nine: Those who Defraud and Cheat
==============================================

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَيْسَ مِنّا مَنْ غَشَّ مُسْلِماً أَوْ ضَرَّهُ أَوْ ما كَرَهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

One who defrauds or causes a loss to a Muslim or tricks him, does not
belong to us.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Those who find their happiness in misfortunes of others and their profit
in loss of others are neither human nor true Muslims. They lack that
social character which gives man superiority over other creatures.

Losses can be inflicted openly or may be hidden through frauds and
tricks and other forms of dishonesty. Islam forbids these, whatever the
form, as is apparent from the disgust expressed in the above saying of
Imam Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.)

[^1]: Safinat’ul-Bihar
