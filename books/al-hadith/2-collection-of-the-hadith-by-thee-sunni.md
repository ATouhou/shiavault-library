Collection of the Hadith By Thee Sunni
======================================

1. Collection during the 1st Century H.:

1. The administration discouraged putting the Hadith in writing,
instead, they encouraged committing the Hadith to memory. The general
public went along but soon it was discovered that confusion about the
authenticity of the Hadith was taking place. For one thing many of the
Sahaaba had died, and for another that committing to memory was not
reliable at large, especially if you want the Hadith verbatim as the
Prophet (pbuh) had said it at the circumstance it was said.

2. Al-Zuhri, Al-Hazm (both commissioned by Khalifa Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz)
but the work was probably not done, due to early death of the Khalifa in
101 H.

2. Collection during the 2nd Century H.:

1. Ibn Jarih, Al-Thawri, Ibn Basheer, Malik Ibn Anas in his
Mu'watta1.
2. The necessity of Ilm Al-Rijaal, (Science of Cognizance of
Transmitters): Their Background, Intelligence, Authenticity,
Reliability, Capacity to Memorize, Manner of living, Reputation,
Criticism, etc.
3. Compiling books about forged Hadiths: To warn the Scholars as well
as the public.

3. Collection during the 3rd Century H.:

The Hadith was collected and categorized in the latter part of the
third century of Hijrah resulting in six canonical collections
(Al-Sihaah Al-Sittah):

1. Sahih of Al-Bukhari, d.256 A.H: 7275 (2712 Non-duplicated) out of
600,000.
2. Sahih of Muslim, d.261 A.H: 9200 (4,000 Non-duplicated) out of
300,000.
3. Sunan of Abu Dawood, d.276 A.H. 4,800 of 500,000.
4. Sunan of Ibn Maajeh: d.273 A.H.
5. Jami' of Tirmidhi, d.279 A.H.
6. Sunan of al-Nisaa'i, d.303 A.H2.

The number of the Shi'a transmitters of Hadith quoted in the Al-Sihaah
Al-Sittah is over 3003.

**Al-Bukhari, of Sahih Al-Bukhari, 194-256H**

Collected the Hadith over a period of many years, having established
certain strict criteria. Political times were very troublesome
especially against Ahlul Bayt (during Al-Mutawak'kil's rulership),
therefore Bukhari was circumspect, having mentioned less about Ahlul
Bayt's narrations than others of the Al-Sihaah Al-Sittah. Of the 2210
Hadiths claimed to have been narrated from A'isha, Bukhari and Muslim
accepted only 174 as genuine according to their criteria4.

**Muslim, of Sahih Muslim, 204-261H**

It is said he was student of Al-Bukhari and 8 years younger. He
differed from Bukhari in his methodology and criteria. He collected the
Hadith over a number of years, having established his own criteria.
Political times were less troublesome against Ahlul Bayt, (after
Al-Mutawak'kil was killed by his own son), therefore Muslim narrated a
large number of Hadiths about Ahlul Bayt.

**Al-Nisaa'i of Sahih Al-Nisaa'i, 215-303H**

Good Hadith collection, more credible. He wrote Al-Kha'sa'is book,
about the eminence of Ali and Ahlul Bayt and the Hadiths about them.
Al-Nisaa'i was 88 years old when in Damascus, answered about Mu'awiya by
saying, "All I know is that the Prophet (pbuh) said about him, \`May he
be the glutton whose devouring food ever become worse'." This infuriated
Mu'awiya's sympathizers, they attacked him, trampled upon him, crushed
his testicles, after which the infirm Nisaa'i was taken to Mecca where
he died. He was buried between Safa and Marwa5.
