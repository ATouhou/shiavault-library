Lesson Twenty Six: Key of Misfortunes
=====================================

Imam Hasan Al-’Askari (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إنَّ اللّهَ جَعَلَ لِلشَّرِ أَقْفَالاً وَ جَعَلَ مَفاتِيحِ تِلْكَ
الأَقْفالِ اَلشَّرابَ، وَ الْكِذْبُ شَرٌّ مِنَ الشَّرابِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

God has placed evils and maladies under locks, the key of which is wine,
and lying is even worse than wine. [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The greatest and most effective tool against evils and maladies is
wisdom and intellect, and this is a strong lock set on them. When the
lock of “wisdom” is opened by the key of “wine”, all evils and
obscenities are let loose and a drunk person is vulnerable to committing
all sorts of crime, sin and corruption.

While a drunkard commits a sin under the influence of the mind numbing
drink, a liar pollutes the social environment knowingly . When lying
permeates a society, it kills the spirit of trust and reliance leading
to sins and corruption. Hence lying is even more dangerous than wine.
