Second Level:
=============

It is when one flirts with Allāh Almighty through the intensity of
conceit in his heart. This flirtation is different from the feeling of
having obliged, although some scholars do not differentiate between
them. A person filling this category claims he is loved by Allāh
Almighty, considering such love to be extended to those who are close to
him and to those who preceded him.

When one of the friends of Allāh is mentioned by name, or when a talk
goes on about those who are loved by Allāh or who love Allāh or the one
on such a path who attracts others to Him, one of them feels in his
heart that he is one of them. Pretension may humble itself and appears
to be different from that. Or, in order one may confirm such a station
for himself, one may deny it in a way when the denial is akin to
confirming! If Allāh afflicts him with an affliction, he will then beat
the drum of "only friends [of Allāh] are afflicted".

Those who claim that they offer guidance to others, the men of
knowledge, the Sufis, the men who study behavior and mathematics, are
all closer to this danger than all others.
