Lesson Eighty Nine: Illegitimate Property
=========================================

Imam Al-Baqir (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ الرَّجُلَ إذا أَصابَ مالاً مِنْ حَرَام لَمْ يُقْبَلْ مِنْه حَجُّ
وَ لا عُمْرَةٌ وَ لا صِلَةُ رَحِم
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Whenever a man gains a property in an illegitimate way, neither his Hajj
and Umrah performed with that property is accepted, nor the uniting of
kindred.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Islam cares not only about the results but also about how the results
are achieved. Those who are contented with their good deeds, but do not
think about the means by which they perform the good deed, neglect this
reality that none of them is accepted by God, unless the means are pure
and sacred.
