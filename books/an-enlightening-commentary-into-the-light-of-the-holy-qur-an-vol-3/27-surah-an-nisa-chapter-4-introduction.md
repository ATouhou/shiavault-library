***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

This Surah, which contains 177 verses, was revealed in Medina. Next to
Surah Al-Baqarah, it is the longest Surah of the Qur'an from the point
of the number of words and letters.

Its contents invite to Faith, justice, taking examples from the nations
of the past, breaking the ties of friendship with the enemies of
*Allah,* and supporting the orphans.

In this Surah there are subjects such as marriage, equitable
distribution of property after death, the necessity of obeying the
divine leader, immigration, Holy War in the way of *Allah,* and so on.

This Surah is entitled An-Nisa, (the women), since the first thirty five
verses of it are about women and family affairs.

The Virtue of Studying This Surah
---------------------------------

According to a tradition, the Prophet of Islam (S) said:

*"Whoever recites Surah An-Nisa, as if this person has spent property in
the path of Allah as much as any Muslim inherits by virtue of the
purport of this Surah, and also, a similar reward of a person who has
freed a slave, will be given to him."*[^1]

It is evident that the purpose in this tradition, and all of the similar
traditions, is not a bare recitation of the verses, but recitation is a
preparation for comprehension, the which is, in its turn, a preparation
for action and behaving accordingly in personal and social life.

Thus, it is certain that if Muslims take lessons from the contents of
the verses of this Surah and apply them in their own lives, besides
their worldly advantages, they will enjoy of all these rewards in the
Hereafter.
