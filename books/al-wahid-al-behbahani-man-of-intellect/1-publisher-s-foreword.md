Publisher’s Foreword
====================

***In the Nameof Allah, theBeneficent,theMerciful***

The Ansariyan Publications received many requests, through telephone
contacts or readers’ letters, all asking to publish books exposing
biographies of those scholars having played a bright role in the world
of thought and knowledge.

So this subject was put under attentive perusal of our Foundation, in
response to the sincere desires curious for Islamic culture and ensigns.

While Ansariyan Foundation presents the series of Liqa’ ma’a al-’Abrar
(A Meeting with the Righteous), it hopes for attaining approval and
pleasure of all dear readers, and all success is only from Allah.
