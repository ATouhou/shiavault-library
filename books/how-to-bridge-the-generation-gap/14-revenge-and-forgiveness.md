Revenge and Forgiveness
=======================

The Father
----------

My child! When a person insults your mother or father or even treats
them with disrespect, it is possible that because of natural instinct
they may keep it in their heart and may look forward for a proper
opportunity to take revenge from the person. However, no matter how you,
my beloved child, mistreat them or how unpleasantly deals with them,
they not only will not find a hatred against you but they also will not
attempt to get revenge from you.

The Child
---------

The purity of your hearts has impressed me so deeply. No matter how bad
my behaviour should cause a slightest heartbreak, you would soon forget
about it and would resume your cheerfulness.

This is because of my good fortune that the Almighty Creator has created
you so compassionate to treat me with kindness and love and to never
ignore me.
