“... a little philosophy inclineth man’s mind to atheism, but depth in
philosophy bringeth men’s minds about to religion.” [Francis Bacon, Of
Atheism]

The philosophy of religion is replete with arguments that purport to
prove the existence of God. Not all of these arguments have their
origins in Christian philosophy; Jewish and Muslim philosophers have
made significant contributions to the philosophy of religion, and both
Plato and Aristotle have influenced its development. Recent decades have
seen something of a revival of interest in natural theology and the
philosophy of religion. Each of the classical theistic proofs has been
revived and refined, presented in revised form and defended afresh.
Whether any of these arguments for the existence of God is successful,
of course, remains controversial. The theistic proofs section sets out
to explain each of the common philosophical arguments for theism, and so
to explore the case for the existence of God.
