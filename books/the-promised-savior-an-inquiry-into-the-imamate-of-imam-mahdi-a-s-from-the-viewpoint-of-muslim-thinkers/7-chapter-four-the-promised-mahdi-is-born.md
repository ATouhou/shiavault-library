Chapter Four: The Promised Mahdi is born
========================================

The fourth point is that Imam Mahdi (a.s) is born and he is the son of
Imam Hasan Askari (a.s).

In the light of many successively reported traditions accepted by all
Muslims, we have thus far reached the following conclusions.

1. This community has one Mahdi and it is a must to believe in him.

2. Mahdi is from the Holy Prophet's progeny whom we are required to
follow and obey not surpassing them in any matter.

3. Mahdi (a.s) is among those twelve persons whom the Messenger of Allah
(s) has introduced as his successors and the leaders of Muslims after
his demise and whom we are supposed to obey and follow for they
belongthe Holy Prophet's progeny.

4. Mahdi is from the offspring of Husain bin Ali, the martyr of Karbala.
He is the son of Imam Hasan Askari, the son of Imam Hadi, the son of
Imam Jawad, the son of Imam Reza, the son of Imam Kazim, the son of Imam
Sadiq, the son of Imam Baqir, the son of Imam Sajjad, the son of Imam
Husain and the son of Imam Ali bin Abi Talib.

The conclusions drawn show that the earth is never devoid of righteous
leaders. These righteous leaders who are from the progeny of the Holy
Prophet (s) are twelve persons. It is also clear that he is the twelfth
Imam and that he is born and is alive now.

It is on the basis of these facts that most of Sunni scholars confess
that Imam Mahdi (a.s) is born and is alive now. They think that he is
the son of Imam Hasan Askari (a.s). Below are the names of some of these
