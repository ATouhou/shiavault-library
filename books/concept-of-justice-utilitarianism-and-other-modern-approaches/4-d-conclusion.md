(D) Conclusion
==============

The above discussion of various approaches about the notion of justice
has clearly revealed that we face an irresoluble pluralism of
ideologies. If the structure of legalism embodies one dominant set of
ideologies it will appear unjust from another perspective .

Kelson36 has rightly concluded that there can not be a formal science of
justice, since even if a theory of justice were logically constructed it
would be based on emotive premises. It is not possible to identify in a
scientific way the supreme values that a just order of social life
should attempt to promote one person may regard the advancement of
individual autonomy as the foremost aim of legal ordering another person
may argue that law-makers should promote the goal of equality. Yet
another may claim that security is the overriding interest and he is
willing to sacrifice equality and freedom for the fullest resolution of
this value. Therefore, it has rightly been concluded that the concept of
justice is not amenable to rational determination.
