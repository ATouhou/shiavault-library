Sorrow as a Bond of Union
=========================

I am going to talk this afternoon about a very solemn subject, the
martyrdom of Imam Husayn at Karbalaâ€™, of which we are celebrating the
anniversary. As the Chairman has very rightly pointed out, it is one of
those wonderful events in our religious history about which all sects
are agreed. More than that, in this room I have the honour of addressing
some people who do not belong to our religious persuasion, but I venture
to think that the view I put forward today may be of interest to them
from its historical, its moral and its spiritual significance.

Indeed, when we consider the background of that great tragedy, and all
that has happened during the 1289 lunar years since, we cannot fail to
be convinced that some events of sorrow and apparent defeat are really
the very things which are calculated to bring about, or lead us towards,
the union of humanity.
