Story no. 14: The children’s beds
=================================

Mustafa and Murtaza shared one bed between them at night. One night when
Mustafa went to their room thinking to sleep early he saw two beds
instead of one.  
 He asked his mother “Do we have guests tonight?”  
 Mother replied “No, but you must have your beds separate from now
on”.  
 When Murtaza was made aware of this story, he asked “Mother, may I ask
you why?”  
 Mother replied “Because it is one of the rules of Islam that the beds
of children of six years and onwards should be separated”.
