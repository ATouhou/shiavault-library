***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

The Surah, in spite of its brevity, contains some thought provoking
ideas:

In the first part of the Surah, after mentioning some meaningful oaths,
this fact is pointed out that Man’s life, in this world, is always full
of toil and struggle which prepares him to be able to face troubles and
difficulties and therefore, he should not expect absolute tranquility
and comfort in the present world; that which is possible only in the
next life.

In the next part of this Surah, a few of the greatest divine bounties
created for Man are enumerated and then, discussion is given showing his
ingratitude.

In the last part of the Surah, people are divided into two groups: the
people of the Right Hand and the people of the Left Hand. Then, some
characteristics of the good deeds of the first group and their final
fate are stated and are compared to the destiny of the opposite group;
the Unbelievers and sinners.

The senses derived from the verses of this Surah are decisive and
vigorous, the statements are short and categorical and the words are
extremely effective and explicit. The form and content of the verses
show that the Surah is one of the Meccan ones.

The Virtue in Studying Surah Balad
----------------------------------

Regarding the virtue in studying the Surah, the holy Prophet (S) is
narrated to have said:

*"He who studies it, Allah will make him safe from His wrath on the Day
of Judgement.”*[^1]

A tradition from Imam Sadiq (as) says:

*“He who recites Surah Balad in his obligatory prayers will be known as
a good-doer in this world, and in the Next World he will be considered
among those who have rank and privilege with Allah, and he will be of
the friends and companions of the prophets, martyrs, and the pious
men.”*[^2]

### By This Sacred City!

It is the style of the Qur'an when stating facts of very great
importance, to often begin with oaths. These oaths, themselves, evoke
thought and intelligence in Man.

Here, too, in order to state the fact that Man's life, in the present
world, is always associated with toil and struggle, it begins with a new
oath and says:

***"Nay! I swear by this city (Mecca),"***

***"And you are an inhabitant of this city".***

Mecca is not directly mentioned in these verses, but regarding the
Surah, on the one hand, which is Meccan, and the extraordinary
importance of this sacred city, on the other hand, it is clear that it
is in reference to Mecca. The consensus of commentators concur.

Of course, the holiness and greatness of Mecca requires that Allah makes
oath to it. The first center of monotheism and worship to the Lord has
been built here and great prophets have circumambulated it.

But the verse:

***"And you are an inhabitant of this city"***

contains a new matter. It says that this city is so highly sacred and
holy because of the Prophet (S), and his blessed existence in it, that
it deserves to be sworn to.

The fact is that the spiritual value of land is due to the value of
those who dwell there. The pagans should not think that the Qur'an has
made worthy this land and made oath to it because it is their home or
that it is the central place of their idols. Nay, it is not so. The
value of this city, besides its special historical background, is for
the sake of the blessed existence, in it, of Muhammad (S); Allah's
unique servant.

There is also another commentary which says: 'We do not swear by this
sacred city when they treated you disrespectfully and bid that your
life, wealth and honour be free and permissible for all. '

This is a terrible disgrace to the pagans of Quraish who considered
themselves the servitors and protectors of the temple of Mecca and
respected it so highly that if a murderer of their father were seen
there, he would be left safe. It is said that even those who took the
bark of the trees of Mecca with them were safe because of this respect.
Ironically, in showing this kind of respect they did not observe these
customs and traditions regarding the Prophet (S)

Why did the pagans hurt him and his companions with every kind of
torment that they could, so that they even counted the slaying of them
lawful?

This commentary is also narrated in a tradition from Imam Sadiq
(as).[^3]

***"And by the begetter and whom he begot".***

To answer the question of who is the parent and who is the child,
different commentaries have been cited:

1. The father is Abraham and the child is Ismail. Referring to the oath
in the previous verse made to the city of Mecca, and we do know that
Abraham and his son were the founders of Kaaba and Mecca, this
commentary seems very appropriate; in particular, that the pagan Arabs
maintained an extraordinary importance for Abraham and his son and they
were very proud of them. Many of them have claimed that they have
descended from Abraham.

2. The begetter is Adam and whom he begot is his children.

3. The meaning is Adam and all of the Prophets who came from his
descendents.

4. It is an oath to any father and child because the process of human
reproduction and its survival throughout history is one of the most
wonderful things in the creation to which Allah has sworn.

To gather, these four commentaries, together, is not impossible, but the
first one seems the most fitting.

Then, the attention is paid to a thing which is the final purpose of
these oaths:

***"Certainly We have created man to be in distress.”***

The term /kabad/, as Tabarsi cites in Majma'-al-Bayan, originally means
'intensity’.

But, as Raqib cites in Mufradat, the word /kabad/ means 'a disease in
the liver of a person’. and so, it is used for any trouble and misery.
Whatever the root of this word might be, its present use means trouble
and misery.

Yes, from the early moments of life, even as a foetus in the womb, Man
passes through different, difficult stages with pain and toil until the
time he is born, and even from then on; during his childhood, the period
of his adolescense, and the most difficult times, his mature years, he
is always faced with many kinds of trouble and misery. This is the
nature of the present world. Those who have other expectations, about
this world, other than that there is pain and toil, here are wrong.

The lives of the prophets and saints of Allah, who have been the best of
all creatures, have been full of diverse difficulties and painful
situations. When the world has been like this for them, then, the status
of others is clear.

We may see some people or some societies which have no apparent trouble
and seem to live in ease. It is either because of our insufficient
information about them, and when we approach them and study their
outwardly comfortable lives, we see the depth of their pain and
suffering; or their comfortable situation exists for a short time or in
an exceptional period, but, however, it does not change the general law
of the world.

***"Does he think that no one has power over him?"***

The verse denotes that the life of Man, which is mixed with pain and
toil, is an evidence that he has no power.

But, Man is proud and commits any sin and crime as if he were quite safe
and were out of the limits of AlIah's punishment. When he gains power,
he neglects all the laws of Allah and disobeys Him, totally. Does he
really think that he can escape from the grips of divine punishment?
What a great error!

It is also probable that the objective point of the verse is directed
toward the rich people who thought no one could take their wealth from
them.

Also, it has been cited that the objective point is of those who thought
that they will never be questioned about their deeds. The scope of the
concept, of the verse, is so vast and wide that it may cover all of
these commentaries, combined.

Some have said that the above verse is about a man from the tribe of
Jamh by the name of Abul-Asad. He was so powerful that when he sat on a
piece of leather and ten men tried to take the leather out from under
him they failed. Sometimes the leather might have been torn to pieces,
but he would remain sitting. [^4]

In any case, the verse pointing to these arrogant people does not limit
the generality of its meaning.

Then, on the same theme, it continues stating:

***"He says: I have squandered wealth abundant!"***

The verse is about those of whom when they were told to spend some money
on good deeds, they would respond, boastfully, that they had spent much
in that way; but they had spent nothing; and if they had given something
to anyone it had been for personal intentions and hypocritical aims.

Some have said that the verse refers to the ones who had spent much
wealth on enmity against Islam and the holy Prophet (S) and for the
plots against Islam, and for this they boasted.

As an evidence, a tradition says that in the battle of Khandaq when
Hazrat Ali (as) invited 'Amr-ibn-i-'Abdud to Islam he protested thus:

*"What about that which I have spent, abundantly from my wealth, against
you?"* [^5]

Some have also said that the verse points to some of the chiefs of
Quraish such as one of the worst enemies of the Prophet (S).
Harith-ibn-'Amir, who had committed a sin and asked the Prophet (S) what
he should do about it and Hazrat ordered him to pay atonement, then he
replied:

*"From the day I became a Muslim I have squandered wealth
abundant”.*[^6]

It is of no consequence whether all of these three commentaries are
combined, though the first one is more fitting with the next verse.

The term

***/ahlakta/ ‘I have squandered'***

denotes that he has, indeed, wasted his wealth, but has not gained
anything beneficial.

The term /lubad/ means 'a dense crowd or thing' and. here it means 'much
wealth’.

***"Does he think that no one see him?"***

He does not pay attention to the fact that Allah not only sees the deeds
he has done in private and in public, but He also knows all that goes
through his mind and what he keeps hidden in the depth of his heart or
what he intends to do in the future. Is it possible for the infinite
Creator Who knows everything not to be able to see or know about a
single thing'? These neglectful people think that they are out of the
scope of His constant watch, but it is because of their own ignorance.

Yes, Allah knows where they have obtained their wealth and how and for
what purpose they have used it.

A tradition is narrated by Ibn-Abbas that the Prophet (S) said:

*"(On Dooms Day) no servant can walk forth unless he is asked about four
things:*

*1) about his lifetime and how he spent it,*

*2) about his wealth and where he gathered it from and what he spent it
for,*

*3) about his deeds and what he has done, and*

*4) about his love for us; the Ahlul-Bait".* [^7]

In short, how can Man be proud of his wealth and boast that he is
powerful while all his life is spent in pain and toil, and if he has
some wealth it can disappear in one day and if he has strength it can be
removed by a fever?

Furthermore, how can a person claim that he has spent much wealth for
the sake of Allah when He knows his intentions? Allah knows both the
source of that unlawful wealth and how he spent it hypocritically and
grudgingly.

***8. “Have We not made for him two eyes?"***  
***9. “And a tongue and two lips?"***  
***10. “And showed him the two ways (of good and evil)?"***

### The Gifts of Eyes, Tongue and Guidance!

In the former verses the discussion was about the pride and negligence
of neglectful Man, but in the following verses, a part of the greatest
material and spiritual gifts of Allah to Man is described, in order to
break his pride and negligence, on the one hand, and to make him think
about the Creator of these gifts and on the other hand; for stirring the
sense of gratitude inside his soul, which sends him forth to the
knowledge of Allah.

***"Have We not made for him two eyes?"***

***"And a tongue and two lip?"***

***"And showed him the two ways (of good and evil)?"***

Thus, in these short sentences, three great material gifts and a great
spiritual gift, all which are from the most important divine gifts, are
pointed out. The gifts of eyes, tongue and lips are on one side, and the
gift of knowledge and guidance is on the other side.

(It should be noted that the term /najd/ originally means 'an open
highway' and here /najdayn/, in contrast with /tihamah/ 'low land ', is
to be understood as 'the two highways of good and evil ').

For the importance of the above gifts it is enough to know that the eyes
are the most important means by which to communicate with the outside
world. The wonder of the eyes is such that makes Man humiliate himself
in front of the Creator of them.

Each of the seven parts of the eye; the sclerotic cornea, choroid, iris,
dermoid, aqueous humor, vitreous humor, and retina has a wonderful,
special and delicate structure in which the laws of light and mirrors,
physically and chemically, are so precisely coordinated that the most
modern cameras are worthless in comparison to them.

In fact if there were nothing in the world except Man and of all parts
of his body only his eye was studied, its wonders would be enough to
recognize the greatness of the knowledge and power of Allah.

Next, the tongue is referred to, which is the most important means of
speech and speech itself is the most important means of communication
for human beings. It is with language that humans are able to convey the
experience and information of one nation to another, or from one
generation to another one. If it were not so, Man could never develop so
well in knowledge, science, and civilization both in material and
spiritual affairs.

Then, the lips are mentioned. They have an effective function in speech
because many sounds and phonemes, in language, are produced by the lips.
Besides, the lips are useful in eating foods, preserving the moisture of
the mouth, and drinking water.

If they were not so, the function of eating and drinking would be
difficult for Man, and even his face, with water flowing out of his
mouth and the absence of some phonemes in his speech, would be in a
disgraceful state.

We know that the first steps in learning many facts are doubled with the
help of eyesight and language.

Therefore, the gifts of reasoning and guidance, which are natural and
intellectual, are pointed out. The verse can even cover 'religious
guidance' which is introduced by prophets and Saints.

In fact, Allah has given us eyesight and the light; i.e. guidance to use
them which enables us to discover what is right and what is wrong and to
know them and then we choose between them, ourselves. Thus, if we go the
wrong way and stray we deserve the fruits of our decision.

The sentence:

***"And showed him the two ways (of good and evil)”,***

besides stating Man's free will, regarding. 'his way' denotes that going
the right way is not free from difficulties and toil, as even climbing
the high lands has some difficulties, doing wrong has some troubles,
too. So, Man should try to choose the right way.

It is Man, himself, who chooses the way for which he can use his eyes
and tongue in a lawful direction or an unlawful one and then, follows
the good way or the evil one.

That is why the Prophet (S), in a tradition has said:

*"Allah told mankind:*

*‘O children of Adam! If your tongue wants to make you commit sin, I
have supplied you with two lips to control it, and if your eyes are
going to attract you to something unlawful, two eyelids are with you;
close them!’”* [^8]

Thus, Allah has given Man the means of controlling these gifts which is
one of the great blessings that He has bestowed on him.

It is noteworthy that in the above verses, when speaking of the tongue,
the lips are mentioned but, in talking about the eyes, eyelids are not
referred to. Apparently, it is for two reasons: the first is that the
function of the lips in eating, drinking and speaking is more important
than the function of the eyelids with the eyes; and the second is that
the ability to control the tongue is more effective than that of the
eyes.

### An Arduous Uphill Climb!

After mentioning some great gifts, in the previous verses, which are
given to Man, the ungrateful persons who, having all the means of
felicity, have not taken its path, are blamed in the following verses:

***"But he would not attempt the uphill road,”***

The term

***/‘aqabah/ ‘the uphill road’***

is commented on in the next verses.

***"And what will make you comprehend what the uphill road is?"***

***"(It is) freeing of a slave (or a captive)”***

***"Or the feeding on a day of hunger,"***

***"Of an orphan near of kin,"***

***"Or to the indigent (down) in the dust.”***

Therefore, this arduous uphill road, for which the ungrateful persons
have never prepared themselves to pass, is a collection of good deeds
and pivots on helping people, especially the poor, and is also a
collection of the pure, righteous believers which are mentioned in the
following verses.

Truly, regarding the intensive love of most people for wealth, climbing
this arduous uphill road is really difficult.

Being a true Muslim and having true Faith are not obtained simply by raw
claims and merely stating such.

There are some difficult uphill roads in front of every Muslim believer
which he must pass, one after another, and by the help of Allah and
under the light of Faith and Sincerity he can succeed.

Some have rendered the term /'aqabah/, here in the sense of 'low desire'
and standing against these is called 'the Inner Warfare' as a tradition
by the Prophet (S) denotes.

Of course, regarding the interpretation of the verses, themselves, about
/iaqabah/ ‘uphill road' the meaning of this commentary must be such that
the main uphill road is considered 'low desire', and freeing the
captives and feeding the indigent are considered as its clear examples.

Some other commentators have said that the meaning of /'aqabah/ is 'an
arduous uphill road in the Hereafter’; as a tradition from the Prophet
(S) says:

*“There is an arduous uphill road in front of you, those whose load is
heavy cannot pass it. I try to lighten your load to enable you to pass
that uphill road.”*[^9]

This tradition from the holy Prophet (S) has not been cited for the
commentary of the current verse, but the commentators have applied it to
this verse. However, regarding to the commentary clearly expressed in
the verses, their application does not seem appropriate.

The objective idea is that the uphill roads of the Hereafter are
illustrations of the hard arduous climbs, here in this world and whose
paths are subdivisions of the paths of this world.

It is worth noting that the term /iqtahama/ based on /iqtiham/ which
originally means 'to undertake a task which is frightful’[^10], or 'to
enter and pass somewhere with toil and difficulty'[^11]; denotes that
passing this uphill road is not an easy thing to accomplish.

This is an emphasis on what was mentioned at the beginning of the Surah:

***"Certainly We have created man to be in distress".***

That is, both his life and his obedience to Allah are full of
difficulties.

It has been narrated that Hazrat Ali (as) has said:

*"Paradise is surrounded by unpleasantness while Hell is surrounded by
desires.”*[^12]

Some points that should be noted, here are:

1. The phrase /fakka raqabah/ seems to mean 'the act of freeing
captives'.

2. The term

/masqabah/ 'famine'

is based on /saqab/ 'to suffer from hunger’. So, the words /yaumin thi
masqabah/ mean 'on a day of hunger' which emphasize on feeding the needy
in the time of famine, drought and the like.

3. The term /maqrabah/ means 'relationship' and it is an emphasis on the
orphans of relatives who are close to the person, or else, we should
feed all orphans whoever they are, but this shows that we are more
responsible for the orphans who are of our kith and kin.

4. The term /matrabah/ is derived from /tarab/ but, originally is from
/turab/ which means 'soil’ and is used for 'a poor person intimately
acquainted with his mother Earth'. This is, again, an emphasis on those
types of indigent ones who are more deserving of help but of course all
indigent ones should be helped.

In the next verse, to continue commenting on the 'uphill road', it says:

***“Then will he be of those who believe, and enjoin (on each other to)
patience, and enjoin (on each other) mercy.”***

Thus, such believers can pass this arduous uphill road who have both
faith and the humane characteristic of self-restraint and enjoining
patience along with doing good deeds such as freeing captives and
feeding orphans and the indigents.

In other words, these persons are those who have shown strong sincerity
in three dimensions of Belief, morals, and action and can be successful
in climbing that uphill road.

The term

***/thumma/ ‘then'***

does not always mean 'next in time or order' to indicate that they
should feed and help the needy first and then they will believe. But, in
these cases, as some commentators have mentioned, it is for priority of
rank because, the position of Faith and enjoining patience and
compassionate kindness is definitely higher than the value of helping
the indigent, or, it is better to say that good deeds originate from
Faith and high morals.

Some others have also said that the term /thumma/, here may mean 'next
in time', since good deeds are sometimes the cause of Faith and they are
especially effective in fixing the basis of high morals, because Man's
behavior manifests itself, first, into 'practice' then, into 'mood' and
then, into 'habit', and finally, into the form of' 'a firm
characteristic', and settles in his spirit or nature as a result of that
constant practice.

The term /tawasau/ with the sense of 'enjoin each other to (charity and
good deeds)’ contains an important point.

It shows that patience and perseverance on the path of obedience to
Allah, and the challenge against one's own desires, and also
strengthening the principle of compassionate kindness should not occur
in the society only in the form of individual behaviour, but it should
appear as a common current in the whole society, and all the members of
a society should enjoin observing and preserving this principle on each
other in order to make their social relationship, in this way, closer
and stronger.

Some have said that the term

***/sabr/ ‘patience'***

here means 'to be patient in obeying Allah's command and being studious
in practising His instructions'.

And the term

***/marhamat/ ‘compassionate kindness'***

points to 'love shown to the creatures of Allah' and we know that the
relation between the Creator and His creatures establishes the
foundation of religion. In any event, patience and perseverance are the
main causes of any obedience and servitude and also of avoiding sin and
rebellion.

After describing these characteristics, the position of the possessors
of them are introduced:

***“These are the people of the Right Hand.”***

They are those whose record will be given to their right hand,
indicating that their deeds are accepted by Allah.

It is also probable that the term /maymanah/ is derived from another
root with the sense of 'grace'. If so, it means that they are merciful
and helpful both to themselves and to others in the society.

Then, the contradictory group is pointed out; i.e., those who were not
successful in passing the arduous uphill road.

It says:

***"And those who disbelieve in Our signs, they are the people of the
Left Hand.”***

This position shows that they do not possess good deeds and their
records contain nothing but sin and corruption.

The term /mas'amah/, based on the root /sum/, contrasts with the term
/maymanah/. It means that these disbelievers are some ominous people who
cause disaster both for themselves and for others in the society. But,
since being fortunate or unfortunate, in the Hereafter, is known about
people by having their 'record' in their right hand or left hand, some
commentators have accepted this idea for it, in particular, that the
term /sum/ in Arabic philology refers to’ a tendency to the left’.

In the last verse of this Surah, there is a short, meaningful hint to
the punishment of the latter group.

It says:

***"On them shall be a fire closed over.”***

The term /musadah/ is based on /isad/ which means 'to close the door,
and secure it'. It is obvious that when a person is shut in a room with
hot, stuffy air, he wishes to open the doors and let the fresh air come
in; making the room comfortable to live in. With this thought in mind,
we may now consider the status of the fervent Hell with all the doors
closed. What a suffocating condition it will have![^13]

Supplication
------------

*O Lord! Save us from such a painful punishment!*

*O Lord! To pass the uphill roads we have in front of us is not possible
save with Your help. Please bestow Your help on us.*

*O Lord! Please count us among the people of the Right Hand and make us
successful to be with the good-doers and the Righteous in the
Hereafter.*
