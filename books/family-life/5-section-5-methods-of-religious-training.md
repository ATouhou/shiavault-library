Section 5: Methods Of Religious Training
========================================

Be A Model To Your Children
---------------------------

Actions speak louder than words. No pieces of advice of a parent
refrains child from backbiting if the child often hears the parents
backbiting themselves. When the child is exposed to these vices, it is
very likely that he will grow up following the same. A good example from
the parent works even without words. Although it may seem a huge task to
be able to be a good model for the child, parents should know that it is
the only way they can really teach their children. No other way is as
effective as mentioned.

Relate Stories
--------------

   
 Stories are a very appealing way to teach lessons. The Qur’an says:  
    
**“*****In their narrations there is certainly a lesson for men of
understanding.”(Holy Qur’an 12:111)***  
    
 Children are especially fascinated by stories. They can become absorbed
in a story without realizing that they are learning some lessons.
Parents should encourage them read Islamic and moral books.

Questions And Answers
---------------------

   
 Children ask a lot of questions. Sometimes parents may lack the answers
and must admit to look it up. But it is unfair to ignore the questions
or dismiss them as unimportant. The more they ask the more they learn.
An interest in his question and confusions will help the child develop
his mental and intellectual abilities. Encourage the child to learn more
by asking more.

Some Don’ts In Religious Training
---------------------------------

   
 Don’t do it harshly. Getting angry with the child and forcing him
leads to resentment. It is better to explain, and discuss with the
child.  
    
 Don’t overdo it. Teach religion in moderate doses. Overdoing it ca be
harmful and can be a burden for a child.  
    
 Don’t teach Islam to show off. Children should not be taught to be
religious, so parents can be proud of them in the community.  
    
 Don’t make Islam a burden. Some parents believe that Islam is too
difficult. Although they practice it, they pass on the feeling that to
them hijab, fasting and other such rules are really a great burden this,
will discourage the child.
