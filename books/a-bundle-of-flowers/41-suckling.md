Suckling
========

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Yes, the reward of a woman during her
pregnancy until childbirth, and unto when she weans the child, is like
that of a stationed (soldier guarding the Muslims' borders against the
attack of pagan enemies) for the sake of Allah. So, if she dies during
that, she will have the rank of a martyr."

Man La Yahduruhul Faqih, vol. 3, p. 561

Imam Amir-ul-Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) said: "No milk is greater in prosperity
than the mother's milk for the baby to suck from."

Wasa'il-ush Shi'ah vol. 21, p. 452

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "When a woman conceives with child she will
be as a warrior who fasts during the day and keeps vigil at nights
praying, and strives with his soul and wealth on the way of Allah. Then,
when she delivers, there will be for her such a great reward with Allah
that she does not know how magnificent it is. Thereafter, when she
suckles (the child), she will have as much reward as freeing a child
from Ismail's descendants for every suck. And, when she brings suckling
the child to an end, an angel beside her tells her to begin the action
again for she has surely been forgiven."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 104, p. 106

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "There is no milk for a baby better than the
milk of its mother."
