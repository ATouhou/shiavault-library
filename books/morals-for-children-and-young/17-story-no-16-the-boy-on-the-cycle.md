Story no. 16: The boy on the cycle
==================================

One of the children was on his cycle.  
 He parked his cycle beside shop to buy something, and went inside the
shop.  
 Another boy came with a matchstick, began poking it in the tube, and
tried to get the air out of it.  
 Mansur who was witnessing the scene, came slowly near him and said in a
gentle tone “Hey boy, don’t pester the people”.

Yes, some of us *do* pester people during our childhood and if we do not
stop this habit during our childhood, we may make bigger violations when
we grow up.
