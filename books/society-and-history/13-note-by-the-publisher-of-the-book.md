Note by the Publisher of the Book
=================================

It is a matter of obvious regret that the manuscript of Martyr Mutahhari
ends at this point. It is obvious that the author had in his mind many
other ideas which he could not enter. He achieved this cherished desire
to obtain martyrdom in the way of God.

We hope, in future, to present a more complete discussion with the help
of his scattered notes, added them to the future editions of the book.
