In Karbala
==========

Mu'awiyah died. His son Yazeed succeeded him. So, the Caliphate became a
kingdom.

Yazeed was a bad man. He drank alcohol. He committed illegal actions. He
amused himself with his dogs and monkeys. Thus Imam Husayn [s] refused
to pay him homage.

The people in many Muslim cities suffered from Mu'awiyah's unjust
policy. They wanted him to die to get rid of his bad behaviour. When the
Muslims knew that Yazeed would be the Caliph, they felt pain and were
full of anger. They opposed his rule because he did not respect Islam
and Muslims.

The people in Kufa liked Imam Ali [a] because he was just and merciful.
Besides they knew al-Husayn's good behaviour and his kind treatment
towards his Muslim brothers. Therefore, they sent him many letters.

In Makkah, Imam Husayn [s] received the Muslims messengers. In their
signed letters, the Muslims said to Imam Husayn [a]:

*Come to us! You are our leader only!*

Imam Husayn [a] accepted the Muslims request. He decided to revolt
against Yazeed bin Mu'awiyah. He took his family and supporters and left
for Kufa.
