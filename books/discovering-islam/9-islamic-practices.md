Islamic Practices
=================

Islam is like a tree whose roots are its beliefs and whose branches are
its practices. If the roots are not firm and healthy, the tree will not
survive; the roots only form the foundation of the tree. Islamic
practices are referred to as such because they are the ways in which the
beliefs of Islam are transformed into reality. The different forms of
outward worship translate a person's inner love and connection with God
into a physical form.

Islam has ten fundamental practices: prayers, fasting, two forms of
almsgiving, pilgrimage to the city of Makkah, *Jihad*, enjoining good,
forbidding evil, supporting those who walk in the path of God, and
turning away from the enemies of God.

Prayer (Salaat)
---------------

Prayers are the pillars of faith. Through prayer people establish
communication and dialogue with God. It makes one become aware and
realize that he or she is not alone in this universe; each person has
been created for a legitimate purpose. God created human beings to
recognize and appreciate His grace and blessings.

### The Necessity of Connection with the Absolute

The instinct to worship is an innate aspect of human beings; it is part
of their natural disposition (*fitra*). Since the dawn of humanity,
civilizations have worshipped the Creator in many different ways. The
need for prayer is great, and a deep, strong, innate feeling within
people drives them toward the Absolute Power to seek His help and
assistance.

Just as the body needs food to survive and grow, so does the soul. The
food of the soul is prayer. In order for people to receive their
necessary spiritual nourishment, and to maintain a strong connection
with God, Islam instructs Muslims to pray at five particular times
during the day. For example, the Quran states:

**Establish regular prayers from mid-day till the darkness of the night,
and recite the Quran in the early** **dawn; verily, the recitation of
the Quran in the early dawn is an act witnessed. (17:78-79)**

Islam has set five prescribed forms of prayers that must be completed
everyday at specific times. All the daily prayers consist of recitations
from the Quran and various bodily movements (prostrations).

People offer their prayers to God for many reasons; the first being the
grandeur of the Creator.

When one ponders and reflects upon the nature of the universe, and all
the diverse and intricate matters that keep life in harmony, one would
automatically conclude the existence of a mightier power—God. The Quran
states:

**Truly, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the
succession of night and day, there are signs for all who are endowed
with insight, and who remember Allah standing and sitting and lying on
their sides, and contemplate creation of the heavens and the earth,
[saying]: “Our Lord, You have not created this without meaning and
purpose, limitless are You in Your subtle Glory!” (3:191)**

When a Muslim prays, he or she is acknowledging the grandeur of God.
Prayer is a serene and uninterrupted time of communicating and building
a relationship with one's Creator. The recitation of the Islamic prayers
encompasses a complete mental and spiritual concentration. It is a
commitment not to leave the prayers aside. Those believers who establish
prayers and show their devotion through them have mastered one of the
foremost qualities of reverence toward God:

**Successful are the believers—those who offer their prayers with
humility and submissiveness…and those who guard their five compulsory
prayers. These are indeed the inheritors who shall inherit Paradise and
abide forever therein. (23:1, 23:9-11)**

Prayers render moments of reflection and are a reminder of one's actions
throughout the day. Prayers have significant benefits upon an
individual, such as discouraging bad actions or seeking forgiveness. The
Quran states, **“Truly, prayer restrains from evil and shameful deeds”**
(29:45). Prayers keep one's perspective of life's ultimate meaning and
goal. Imam Ali said, *“If a prayerful person knew to what extent he was
surrounded by God's mercy, he would never raise his head from
prostration.”*[^1]

The need to worship is as strong as the need to eat, and just as the
person who lacks proper food will eat anything to put an end to his or
her hunger, the person who does not find proper spiritual nutrition will
be led to unlawful worshipping such as the worship of animals, fire,
stars, art, materialism, or anything else that has no power to aid nor
harm anyone. Whether people have a structured religion or not, everyone
worships something.

In society, whenever people meet others who they perceive to be of a
high rank, such as celebrities, politicians, doctors, and scholars they
show considerable respect for them, sometimes, at the expense of their
own dignity. If people show this much respect for other human beings
(who were also created like them from dust) then how much respect should
they show before the Creator whose knowledge, superiority, and grandeur
is limitless and eternal? Should they not, at least, stand before Him
many times a day and bow in respect and gratitude?

Human beings feel frail in front of God. If they try to act on their
own, without the help of their Lord, they will be prone to failure
because the source of all power and might is with God. Those who
accomplished great feats for humanity—scientists in the laboratory,
soldiers in the battlefield, astronauts in space, doctors in the
hospital—all sought assistance from their Lord before embarking on their
adventures. Alone, human beings are inferior and in need of God. The
Quran states:

**O mankind! You are the ones who are in need of Allah, but Allah is
free from all needs,** **worthy of praise.** **If He wanted, He could
destroy you and bring about a new creation, and that is not hard for
Allah.** **(35:15-17)**

### When a Society Ceases to Pray

Forsaking prayer is perilous. The Quran states:  
**There has succeeded them a posterity who have given up the prayers and
followed their lusts, so they will be living lost, in confusion and
disarray…. (19:59)**

### Details of the Five Prescribed Prayers

• **Preconditions**

**Times:**

1) *The dawn prayer (Fajr)*: This prayer should be done between the time
the first ray of light appears in the sky and the time of sunrise.

2) *The noon prayer (Duhr)*: The specific time for this prayer is right
after the sun passes over its noon position. However, it can be done up
until sunset.

3) *The afternoon prayer (Asr)*: This prayer can be done any time after
the noon prayer and before sunset.

4) *The sunset prayer (Maghrib)*: This prayer should be done after the
sun sets at the time when the red sky on the eastern horizon disappears.
Yet, it can be done up until midnight.

5) *The night prayer (Isha)*: This prayer can be done any time after the
sunset prayer and before midnight.

**Direction (al-qiblah):**

During prayer, all Muslims must face the Kabah, the House of God, built
by Prophet Abraham and his son Ishmael. The Kabah is located in the city
of Makkah, in the Arabian Peninsula (Middle East). One way to determine
the precise direction of prayer (called *al-qiblah*) is to use a
compass. In North America, Muslims face northeast to locate the shortest
path to Makkah.

**Place:**

The place where a person is going to recite his or her prayer should
either belong to that person or that person must have permission to pray
in that area unless the place is public. The spot where the forehead
touches the ground should be clean (*tahir*), and prostration must be
done on earth or inedible plants (including paper or wood).

**Purity of the body:**

Just as the soul must be pure, concentrated, and calm before the
prayers, the body must also be free from impurities. Certain items are
considered ritually impure and must be avoided, removed, or purified
before the prayers. A specified washing (*wudhu*) must also be done
before the prayers:

**O you, who believe, when you intend to offer prayers, wash your faces
and your hands from the elbows to the fingertips. Rub [with wet hands]
your heads and your feet up to the ankles, and if you are in a state of
sexual impurity [jenaba], purify yourself [by bathing your entire
body].** **(5:6)**

If water is unavailable, dust may be used out of necessity. The Quran
explains:

**But if you are ill or on a journey and you come from the call of
nature or have been in sexual contact with women and do not find water,
then take clean sand and rub your faces and your hands. Allah does not
want to place you in any difficulty, but He wants to purify you and to
complete His favor on you that you may be thankful.** **(5:6)**

**Clothing:**

During prayer, a man must wear enough clothing to cover his body, and a
woman must cover her entire body (including the head and hair), except
for the face and hands. Clothing worn during prayer must be clean and
lawfully obtained; it must not be stolen or borrowed without permission.

**The call to prayer (adhaan):**

The call for prayer is highly recommended and is one of the
distinguishing emblems of the Islamic faith. The call to prayer consists
of two parts: the *adhaan* and the *iqaama*.  
 The person reciting the *adhaan* should stand facing the direction of
prayer and say:

Allahu akbar.
-------------

Allah is the Greatest (4 times).

*Ashhadu an laa ilaaha illa Allah.*

I testify that there is no Allah but Allah (2 times).

Ashhadu anna Muhammadan-rasul Allah.
------------------------------------

I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (2 times).

Ashhadu anna Alian walu’u Allah
-------------------------------

I testify that Ali is the friend of Allah (2 times).[^2]

*Hayya 'alaa as-salaah.*

Hasten to prayer (2 times).

*Hayya 'alaa al-falaah.*

Hasten to success (2 times).

*Hayya 'alaa khayr al-'amal.*

Hasten to the best of deeds (2 times).

Allahu akbar.
-------------

Allah is the Greatest (2 times).

*Laa ilaaha illa Allah.*

There is no Allah but Allah (2 times).

The *iqama* should be said immediately before the prayer. It is
identical to the *adhaan* with three exceptions:  
 1. The initial phrase, ”*Allahu akbar*,” is only said twice.

2. The final phrase, ”*La ilaaha illa Allah*,” is only said once.

3. The phrase ”*Qad qaamat as-salaah*” which means “prayer is being
offered” should be said twice; it should be inserted after ”*Hayya 'alaa
khayr al-'amal* ” which is repeated twice as well.

**The prayers:**

Each of the prayers consists of a specific number of units (*rakat*).
The dawn prayer has two units, the noon and afternoon prayers have four
units, the sunset prayer has three units, and the night prayer has four
units. The simplest prayer to learn is the two-unit dawn prayer, which
will be described here.

Once all of the preconditions above have been fulfilled, and the person
intending to offer the prayer is facing the proper direction (*qiblah*),
and a sincere intention has been made for that particular prayer (in
this case the dawn prayer), then the prayer may be begun. The hands
should be placed behind the ears and the following said:

Allahu akbar.
-------------

Allah is the Greatest.  
 The first chapter of the Quran (*al-Fatiha*) must be recited.  
**Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim.**  
**Al-hamdu lillaahi Rabb al'aalamin.**  
**Ar-Rahman ar-Rahim.**  
**Maaliki Yawm-id-Din.**  
**Iyyaaka na'budu wa iyyaaka nasta'in.**  
**Ihdina-s-siraat al-mustaqim.**  
**Siraat alladhina an'amta**  
**'alayhim ghayr al-maghdubi 'alayhim wa laa adh-dhaalin**.  
**In the name of Allah, the most Merciful, the most Compassionate.**  
**Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.**  
**The Merciful, the Compassionate.**  
**Master of the Day of Judgment.**  
**You alone do we worship, and from You alone do we seek help.**  
**Guide us the straight path.**  
**The path of those whom You have blessed, not of those on whom is Your
wrath, nor of those who have gone astray.**

Next, another full chapter of the Quran must be recited. The example
given below is the chapter entitled, **“The Oneness of Allah.”**4  
**Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim.**  
**Qul huwa Allahu Ahad**  
**Allahu-s-samad**  
**Lam yalid wa lam yulad**  
**Wa lam yakun lahu kufwaan Ahad.**  
**In the name of Allah, the most Merciful, the most Compassionate.**  
**Say, He is Allah, the One**  
**Allah, the Eternal He begets not, nor was He begotten and there is
nothing comparable to Him.**  
 At this point, *“Allahu akbar*” should be said and the person should
bow, placing the hands on the knees and keeping the back straight. While
bowing, the following should be recited:  
**Subhaana Rabbi al-Athim wa bihamdih.**  
**Glory be to my Lord, the Great, and praise be to**  
**Him.**  
 Then, while resuming the standing position, the following should be
said:  
**Sami'a Allahu liman hamidah.**  
**Allah hears the one who praises Him.**  
 Then, ”*Allahu akbar*” is said, and the person does prostration
(*sujud*) on the ground. In *sujud*, the forehead, palms of the hands,
knees, and tips of the toes must all touch the ground. The following
must be said one or three times:  
*Subhaana Rabbi al-a'laa wa bihamdih.*  
 Glory be to my Exalted Lord, and praise be to Him.  
 ”*Allahu akbar*” should be said, and the person should sit up on his or
her knees and say:  
*Astaghfirullaaha Rabbi wa atubu ilayh.*  
 I seek forgiveness of Allah, my Lord, and turn toward Him.  
 Again, ”*Allahu akbar*” should be said and *sujud* repeated. Then, the
person should stand up and repeat the same process (*e.g.* recite the
first chapter of the Quran; recite another chapter of the Quran, bow,
and do the two *sujuds*). Finally, sitting on the knees, the following
must be said:  
**Ashhadu an laa ilaaha illa Allah, wahdahu la sharikalah wa ashhadu
anna Muhammadan, abdahu warasuluh.**  
**I testify that there is no Allah but Allah, alone without associate,
and that**  
**Muhammad is His servant and messenger.**  
**Allahumma salli 'alaa**  
**Muhammadin wa aal-i Muhammad.**  
**O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.**  
**Assalaamu 'alayka ayyuha an-nabiy sa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuhu.**  
**Assalaamu 'alayna wa 'alaa 'ibaad allahi-s-saalihi.**  
**Assalaamu 'alaykum wa rahmatullahi**  
**wa barakaatuhu.**  
**Peace be upon you,**  
**O Prophet, and the mercy**  
**of Allah and His blessings.**  
**Peace be upon us, and upon all the righteous Servants of Allah.**  
**Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah,**  
**and His blessings.**  
 It is recommended that ”*Allahu akbar*” be said three times by raising
each hand to each side of the face. This action concludes the two-unit
prayer. However, it may be followed by supplications or other
recitations.

Fasting (Sawm)
--------------

Almost every religion adopts some form of fasting. The Prophet Muhammad
and the prophets before him all called upon their followers to fast. The
Quran states, **“O you who believe! Fasting has been prescribed for you
just as it was prescribed for those before you so that you may be pious
and learn self-restraint”** (2:183).

Islam prescribes complete fasting. It requires complete abstinence from
food, drink (including water), smoking, and sexual activity. Hence, from
dawn until the time of the sunset prayer, one must abstain.

Although fasting is recommended on other significant Islamic dates, it
is however, required every day during the month of Ramadan, the ninth
month of the Islamic lunar calendar. The month of Ramadan is revered and
honored by all Muslims. It was on a particular night called the “Night
of Destiny” (*Laylatul al-Qadr*), during the month of Ramadan that the
Quran was revealed to the Prophet.

Muslims believe that on this night, every year, God determines the fate
of each person for the year to come. Therefore, worshipping on the Night
of Destiny is considered, “**Better than a thousand months”** 97:3**.**
Although the exact night of the Night of Destiny is not known, Islamic
scholars approximate the date to fall on either the 19th, 21st, 23rd,
25th, or 27th of the month of Ramadan. Therefore, Muslims copiously
worship God on these specific nights. The Quran states:

**Verily, We have sent it [Quran] down on the Night of Destiny and what
would make you** **know what the Night of Destiny is? The Night of
Destiny is better than a thousand months; He** **sends down the angels,
and the Spirit during it by His will for every matter; Peace! Till the
rising of the dawn.** **(97)**

As with prayers, the benefits of fasting are innumerable. Fasting
strengthens one's willpower, teaches discipline, encourages sympathy
with the poor, breaks harmful habits, strengthens one's health, and
establishes a sense of religious brotherhood and sisterhood. However,
the strongest benefits are spiritual. Lady Fatima al-Zahra, the daughter
of Prophet Muhammad said, *“Fasting is to deepen and strengthen faith.”*
Fasting sharpens the spiritual awareness and inspires a sense of
gratitude toward God.  
 Apart from refraining from food and drink, Muslims are also encouraged,
during the month of Ramadan, to give additional charity toward the poor
and the needy.

Almsgiving (Zakaat and Khums)
-----------------------------

The act of sharing and providing others who are less fortunate is not
only mandated upon Muslims but is also considered one of the noblest
acts that can bring a person closer to God. Giving charity benefits the
individual and society; it purifies the soul from stinginess and
meanness. The Quran says, **“Take alms** **from their wealth in order to
purify and sanctify them”** (9:103).

From a moral perspective, the obligation to pay the obligatory charities
is no less important than the obligation to pray. Whenever the Quran
refers to people who pray, it also refers to people who pay obligatory
charities. Charity is not considered as a gift for the poor but rather a
right for the poor. The Quran states, **“And in their properties
[fortunate ones] is the right of the beggar and the destitute”**
(51:19).

Every monetary or material possession that people acquire comes through
the generosity of God. Mary, the mother of Jesus was known to have
received her sustenance unconditionally:

**Every time Zachariah entered the sanctuary to visit her, he found her
supplied with sustenance. He said, 'O Mary! From where did you get
this?' She said, 'This is from Allah; verily, Allah provides sustenance
to whomever He wills without limit.** **(3:37)**

Although people must work to earn a living, God is the one who
determines the amount and the form of sustenance they will receive
throughout their lifetime. Therefore, when people are directed to return
some of their wealth toward charity, in reality they are not
relinquishing their own property, but merely returning what God has lent
them. God said, **“O you who believe! Spend out of what We have provided
for you”** (2:254), and **“Surely those who recite the Book of Allah and
keep up prayer and spend out of what We have given them secretly and
openly hope for a gain which will not perish”** (35:29).

The supply of provision and sustenance not only applies to humankind but
all kingdoms of God's creation (i.e., animal and plant). The Quran says,
**“Many are the creatures that carry not their own provision; Allah
provides for them and for you.”** (29:60)

Money that comes from obligatory charities (*Zakat* and *Khums*)
provides security and dignity within society by providing for the needy,
bridging the gap between the rich and the poor and eliminating poverty.
The money collected is used for food, shelter, education, health care,
orphanages, libraries, transportation systems, and other public
services. A community in which everyone pays their dues (*Zakat* and
*Khums*) will be successful. Just as a community in which people do not
pay the *Zakat* and *Khums* will fall apart.

Prophet Muhammad said:  
*My community will continue to live fairly if they are faithful to each
other, return deposits to their owners, and give alms [Zakat] to the
poor. But if they do not fulfill these duties, they will encounter
famine and scarcity.*[^3]

Imam Ali said:  
*God the Glorified has fixed the livelihood of the destitute in the
wealth of the rich. Consequently, whenever the destitute remain hungry,
it is because some rich persons have denied him his share.*[^4]  
*When charity is delivered out of the hand of its owner, it says five
things: at first, I was perishing and you gave me life. I was
insignificant and you made me greatness. I was an enemy and you turned
me into a friend. You used to protect me then, but now I will protect
you up till the Day of Resurrection.*[^5]

These traditions and legislations only refer to obligatory almsgiving;
however, there is, in addition to alms, voluntary charity of any kind,
such as money, words, or deeds. Voluntary charity is called *sadaqah*.
Like *Zakat* and *Khums*, benefits both the individual and society.
Prophet Muhammad said, *”Give charity and cure your sick persons by it
because charity can surely remove your bad fortunes and ailments, and it
causes prolongation of your lifetime and increases your rewards.”*[^6]

### Specifics of the Zakat and Khums

1) ***Zakat*** is a traditional type of almsgiving that must be paid
yearly on the following items, if they are possessed in sufficient
quantities: wheat, barley, dates, raisins, gold, silver, camels, cows,
and sheep.

2) ***Khums*** is an excess profit that is taxed. It should be paid
yearly on 20% of the excess profit that a person acquires. Excess profit
refers to the profit that remains after a person has paid for food,
clothing, shelter, and other living necessities for himself or herself
and the immediate family. It is advisable that *Khums* be given to a
religious authority so that it can be distributed in the appropriate
way. *Khums* must also be paid on six other items, for example, gems
obtained while diving. However, this case in modern society tends to be
rare.

*Khums* has been ordained in the Quran:

**And know that whatever profit you may attain, one fifth of it is
assigned to Allah and the Messenger, and to the near relatives [of the
Messenger] and the orphans, the destitute, and the wayfarer, if you have
believed in Allah and that which We sent down to our servant
[Muhammad].** **(8:41)**

Pilgrimage to The City of Makkah (Hajj)
---------------------------------------

Every Muslim who is able must make the *Hajj* pilgrimage to the city of
Makkah at least once in his or her life. This pilgrimage occurs every
year during *Dhul al-Qadah* and *Dhul al-Hijjah*, the 11th and 12th
months of the Islamic lunar calendar. Those who make the pilgrimage
follow in the footsteps of the Prophet Abraham, “the father of the
prophets.”

Four thousand years ago, Prophet Abraham along with his wife, Hagar, and
his son, Ishmael set out on a vast journey wandering through Babylon,
Syria, and Arabia. They crossed vast hills, rivers, and deserts until
arriving in the land of Makkah where Prophet Abraham received a
revelation from God. The Quran states:

**And remember when we showed Abraham the site of the House saying… Do
not associate with Me anything, and purify My house for those who circle
around it and stand to pray and bow and prostrate themselves. And
proclaim among the people the pilgrimage. They will come to you on foot
and on every lean camel from every remote path that they may witness the
benefits for them and mention the name of Allah during the appointed
days over what He has given them.** **(22:26-28)**

Prophets Abraham and Ishmael were instructed by God to raise the cubic
structure, the Kabah. According to the Quran, it is the, **“First house
(of worship) made for mankind”** (3:95). Its original foundation was
built at the dawn of creation by Prophet Adam. Prophet Abraham was then
ordered to proclaim the pilgrimage to humankind.

Perplexed as to who would hear his voice in the desert land of Mekkah,
Abraham climbed atop a nearby mountain and proclaimed to humanity the
divine message of the *Hajj*. This call has passed through the distance
of time, and it still reverberates to the millions of Muslims around the
globe who answer God's call to make their pilgrimage.

### Significance of the Hajj

The *Hajj* is the supreme symbol of universal brotherhood, and it is the
greatest annual congregation in the world. Every year in Makkah,
millions of Muslims from diverse origins stand shoulder-to-shoulder,
clad in the barest of materials (two pieces of white cloth) and perform
the same rituals. Not one person can be distinguished from another on
the basis of wealth, lineage, or power.

The most powerful leaders are on the same level as the general public.
All artificial or human-imposed distinctions among humankind are lifted,
and people have, for the span of a few days, the opportunity to know
each other solely as brothers and sisters of humanity.

The *Hajj* also develops the human soul. Every human being (whether
aware of it or not) is traveling toward God, and the essential part of
the spiritual development in life is to recognize the returning journey.
The *Hajj* not only represents a physical journey, but also compels the
pilgrim to demonstrate his or her willingness to leave behind everything
in his or her life for God.

God has made it known that one of the ways to approach Him for
forgiveness is to journey to His emblematic house—the Kabah in Makkah.
Once, Imam Ali was with a group of his followers in the vicinity of the
Kabah. They saw a man holding the cloth cover of the Kabah while
supplicating, *“O Keeper of the House! This house is Your house, and
this guest is Your guest. Each guest sees goodness from its host.
Tonight, let Your goodness be the forgiving of my sins.”* Imam Ali asked
his followers, *“Did you hear the words of this man?”* They said, *“Yes,
we did.”* Imam Ali replied, *“Almighty God is more forgiving than to
drive away His guests.”*

The sense of equality and humanity that is present during the *Hajj*
should be reflected in one's own everyday life. The person who has
experienced the *Hajj* ought to return home freed from the erroneous
notions of race and class that often are prevalent in some societies.

For many Muslims, the *Hajj* serves as an enormous convention or
conference in which information is exchanged and problems are solved.
Since the advent of Islam, the *Hajj* has been one of the major unifying
cultural factors for Muslims. This is based on the fact that every year
Muslim delegates from every civilization meet in one place to discuss
and solve Islamic matters.

### The Rites of Hajj

The beginning of the pilgrimage is marked by proclaiming, ”*Labbayk,
Allahumma, Labbayk*” which means “I am here, O Lord, I am here!” This
should be followed by, “You, Who have no partner—I am here! Surely all
praise and blessings are Yours, and the Kingdom—I am here, O Lord, I am
here!”

During the *Hajj*, the millions of pilgrims present engage in circling
the Kabah (a practice called *tawaf*). The pilgrim's circling (*tawaf*)
around God's house symbolizes one's dependence and needed assistance of
God. The circumnavigating (tawaf) also illustrates how one's ultimate
being constantly revolves around God.

After *tawaf*, the pilgrims hasten between the two small mountains of
Safa and Marwa. This rite reenacts Hagar's search for water for her
infant son Ishmael. Alone in the desert, Hagar and her baby were in
desperate need for water. She ran back and forth looking desperately for
some hint of moisture in the desert sands.

Seeing Hagar's effort, God produced for her the spring of Zam Zam—a
spring of cool, pure water which gushed forth at Ishmael's feet and
continues to flow until this very day. By imitating Hagar's search, the
pilgrims remember her plight, but also assimilate a message within
themselves that they cannot sit and wait for God's blessings to unfold
magically upon them. Rather, if people are in need of something, they
should work hard for it and hope for the munificence of God.

The most significant day of the pilgrimage is the Day of Arafat. Arafat
is a desert outside the city of Makkah in which all the pilgrims must
stand from noon to sunset and commune with God. The time spent in Arafat
marks the real essence of the *Hajj*; Prophet Muhammad said, *“The Hajj
is Arafat.”*

In Arafat, pilgrims leave behind all material possessions except for the
two pieces of cloth worn during their pilgrimage—a symbol of returning
to the same condition in which one was wrapped in at birth and death.
The vast gathering consists of millions of people all dressed alike
standing in the same place at the same time; this represents the true
origin and fate of humanity. We are born from dust, then we live for a
short while, and in the end we are resurrected from dust again. The
scene of Arafat resembles what the Day of Resurrection will be like;
countless of individuals are pieced back together from dust to withstand
the judgment of God.

At a place called Mina, on the outskirts of Mekkah, the pilgrims throw
pebbles at three stone pillars symbolizing Satan. For the pilgrims, this
demonstrates their continuing struggle and treatment of fighting against
Satan, who is sworn to be the enemy of humankind. Pebble throwing is
also another historical reenactment of Prophet Abraham and Ishmael's
sacrifices for God. Abraham, along with his son Ishmael, were on their
way to fulfill the command of God; the slaying of his son, Ishmael.
Prophet Abraham encountered Satan three times disguised as a man. Satan
attempted to discourage Prophet Abraham. Instead of listening to Satan's
dissuasions, Prophet Abraham threw stones at him in each of these three
areas.

At the end of the *Hajj*, on *Eid al-Adha*, each pilgrim sacrifices an
animal similar to what Prophet Abraham did in lieu of his son. The
sacrifice denotes the pilgrim's willingness to adhere to God's
commandments unconditionally. The meat of the animal must not be wasted;
one-third may be kept for personal consumption, the other two-thirds
should be divided equally among friends and the indigent.

Striving (Jihad)
----------------

The literal meaning of *Jihad* is “to strive.” More importantly, it
means to progress in all aspects of one's life. Although the word
*Jihad* is used by the western media with militant connotations, in
truth, it covers a vast range of human activity, such as family life,
work, spiritual development, and justified military defense.

The most important *Jihad* is the struggle to purify the soul, and this
*Jihad* far outweighs any military *Jihad*. Prophet Muhammad once met a
group of soldiers returning home from a defensive battle and said,
*“Welcome to the people who have concluded the minor Jihad [struggle].”*
Astonished, the soldiers asked, *“Was this [military battle] a minor
Jihad? Then what is the major Jihad?”* Prophet Muhammad replied, *“The
major Jihad is the Jihad to purify one's self.”*

The beginning steps of *Jihad* are to purify the soul by restraining
one's self from committing sins that corrupt the soul. One must control
material desires, overt selfishness, and remain uninfluenced by forces
(internal or external) that distract one from the remembrance of God.
All the forms of worship in Islam such as prayers, fasting, and charity
exist as a means to purify and perfect the soul. Only in the upward
development of the soul will one find happiness in this life and in the
next life.

If the soul is unhappy, a person will be miserable, regardless of how
materially wealthy he or she may be. The Quran says, **“And by the soul
and Him Who perfected it, then showed it what is right and what is wrong
for it—indeed, he succeeds who purifies his soul, and, indeed, he fails
who corrupts his soul”** (91:7). The soul is the essence of humankind;
it is the element that will outlast this life and be judged in the next.
One of the primary reasons humankind was placed in this world is to test
and develop their souls.

*Jihad* also refers to the legitimate struggle to defend human rights,
such as personal and religious freedom, as well as the defense of land,
property, and family:

**Permission [to fight] is given to those against whom war is being
wrongfully and offensively waged, and surely Allah is able to give them
victory. Those who have been expelled from their homes unjustly, only
because they said, “Our Lord is Allah…”** (22:39-40).

When people are being oppressed, Islam commands believers to defend the
rights and integrity of the people. Fighting in the form of defense is
not only permitted but required. The Quran explains, **“Fight against
aggressors until oppression is stopped”** (2:193). *Jihad*, as a form of
fighting, must be for just causes and to defend the freedom, liberty,
and integrity of society:

**And why do you not fight in the way of Allah and the utterly oppressed
men, women, and children who are crying out, “O Lord! Rescue us from
this town whose people are oppressors, and raise for us from You one who
will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help.” (4:75)**

Peaceful countries today could not have achieved their stature without a
campaign for independence or a struggle for freedom. Furthermore, such
countries could not have retained their positions without a strong
force. In life, struggle will always exist between good and evil, truth
and falsehood, and societies cannot progress if oppressors are left
unchallenged.

Enjoining Good and Forbidding Evil (Amr Bil-Ma’rouf -Nahiy An Al-Munkar)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Let there arise from you a group of people inviting what is good,
enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong; these are the
ones who will be successful.** **(3:104)**  
 In order for religion to progress and society to flourish, people must
initiate, advise, and attempt to guide each other toward righteousness
by deterring each other away from misconduct. This action is mandatory
for those who believe in God and the Day of Judgment. Giving sincere
advice is not, as some may argue, meddling in someone's business; it is
a valuable favor and one of the best forms of charity.

Supporting those who Walk in the Path of God (Tawalli Li Awliyaa’ Allah)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This entire phrase means to be a friend and a helper of the righteous
and pious people who maintain religion and believe in God. Specifically,
it is directed to the prophets and imams (successors to the prophets),
as well as those who work to establish order, justice, and religion on
earth.

**“And whoever takes Allah, His messenger, and those who have belief as
protectors and guardians, then the party of Allah will be victorious.”**
(5:56)

Turning Away from the Enemies of God (Tabaari min A’daa Allah)
--------------------------------------------------------------

This phrase refers to the opposite of *tawalli li awliyaa' Allah*. Those
who sincerely believe in God must dissociate themselves from those
people who obstruct truth and justice and prevent the light of God from
reaching others. The Quran states:

**Allah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who
fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you out
of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity. It is
regarding those who fought against you on account of religion and have
driven you out of your homes and helped to drive you out that Allah
forbids you to befriend them, and whoever will befriend them, then such
are the wrongdoers.** **(60:8-9)**

**O you, who believe, take not for protectors and helpers those who take
your religion as a mockery and fun from among those who received the
scriptures before you, or from among the disbelievers, and fear Allah if
you indeed are true believers. (5:57)**

**Let not the believers take the disbelievers as supporters and helpers
and friends instead of the believers. And whoever does that will never
be helped by Allah in any way.** **(3:28)**

It is for the benefit of believers that God warns them against
associating with unbelievers, tyrants, and enemies of God and humankind.
