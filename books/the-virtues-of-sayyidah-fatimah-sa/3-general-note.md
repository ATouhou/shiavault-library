General Note
============

For the ease of common readers the following formula has been used for
Arabic words and names.

Various transliteration symbols which are commonly used have not been
used in this book as not everyone is familiar with exactly what they
stand for. For a few words where there has been no other way but to use
an apostrophe, it has been used such as Ka‘b and Mu‘adh.

Other than the omission of transliteration symbols, all other rules of
transliteration have been applied.

The Arabic form of names has been used rather than the European ones
such as Ibrahim and not Abraham.
