89: Daybreak (fajr)
===================

These 30 very early Meccan verses were revealed after Night 92 and
before Morning Bright! 93. Its title of Daybreak \`or AI-Fajr should be
compared with that of Al-Falaq or Dawn \`113 (and also with the last
line in Chapter 97).

This chapter ends with a short but moving passage on "The Tranquil soul"
which finally has found rest.
