Ayat no.  77
============

***In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful***  
***Does not man see that We have created him from the small seed? Then
lo! he is an open disputant. (36:77)***

Benefits of remembering ones origin
-----------------------------------

On many occasions in the Holy Quran, God had reminded man how he was
created. He was a puny sperm. It is commanded that man must always
remember this. Allah says, “Man must obligatorily ponder over this.” He
should think deeply and see from what he is created, from a drop of
gushing water which came from between the back of his father and breasts
of his mother.  
    
***So let man consider of what he is created. He is created of water
pouring forth, coming from between the back and the ribs. Most surely He
is able to return him (to life). (86:5-8)***  
*** ***  
 Thus man should never forget from what he is created. What is desired
from such pondering is to understand the beginning and it also proves
the Hereafter. The third benefit is that it makes man give up the animal
like habits such is ignorance, ego, pride and selfishness.

Proof of origin through embryo
------------------------------

From the viewpoint of proof of the origin, when an intelligent man
thinks over it, he sees that he was a drop of semen, which is
detestable. Then the Designer Lord drew a wonderful picture! He formed
the heart, liver, brain and all other parts and organs of body.

Then see the arrangement of bones from a fluid and that too in a dark
and uneven place. In the words of Quran: In three-fold darkness of the
umbilical membrane, the womb and the abdomen.

Is it ever possible that all this should happen automatically and
without any higher power? Can there be an effect without a cause, a
creation without a creator? Reason and intelligence do not accept this.
Such a wonderful creation! The more man ponders over his own creation,
more he understands and realizes the Might of God.

The second rising must also occur
---------------------------------

Regarding the second rising or the Hereafter, after man pays attention,
he sees that first he was an embryo. The semen came out of the passage.
It contained or it was made up of liquids spread all over the body. It
is only by the Might of God that these liquid particles gather in semen.
That is why ejaculation makes the whole body sluggish.

According to a narration, they once asked the Imam (‘a), “Why is it so
that after urination, it is enough purification to wash only the organ
and parts to be washed during ablution, whereas ejaculation requires
washing of the entire body?” Imam replied, “Particles of semen come from
all the parts of the body.”

On another occasion too he (man) was diffused and scattered because
semen is obtained from food that man eats. A portion of it also is
released in the form of semen. What was his food? Rice, wheat and
vegetables, which also were scattered in the earth.

These scattered particles got together to form food. They entered the
body of the father and then gathered in the form of semen at one place.
Thus you have gone through collection and scattering twice during your
life. So, after your death also, your body will get scattered and again
recollected. Are you astonished at this third occasion?  
    
***Does not man see that We have created him from the small seed?
(36:77)***  
*** ***  
 In the next verse also He says:  
*** ***  
***And he strikes out a likeness for Us and forgets his own creation.
(36:77)***  
*** ***  
 That is, he has forgotten his own creation and therefore, astonishingly
asks as to how God will gather or recollect the rotten bones?

Mention of the first and the last condition removes ego
-------------------------------------------------------

The third benefit of mentioning man’s origin is improvement of man
himself. He realizes that he is born of a despicable drop. His beginning
was dirty and smelly. So will be his corpse, dirty and stinking. Then
what is there to be proud of and to be egoistic?

One of the reforms that such admonition brings is submission to Almighty
God and acceptance of every truth. When he thinks that in the beginning
I was merely a drop. What did my Lord do to this drop? He gave eyes and
ears.  
    
***There surely came over man a period of time when he was a thing not
worth mentioning. (76:1)***  
*** ***  
 He also provided a tongue, hands and feet. He remembers such great
bounties of God and becomes thankful to the One Who granted all this. He
should be thankful unless he is blind and deaf and does not understand
how great and precious these bounties are.

How much submissive you should be to the Lord Who gave so many precious
and invaluable bounties to you? One who denies this truth is, first of
all, inimical to his own Lord. In fact he is denying God.  
    
***Then lo! he is an open disputant.***  
*** ***  
 That is, he is an open enemy. O the one who is unmindful of your own
origin! You say, “I am, but there is no God.” How foolish and silly you
are! You enter into altercation and hostility! This is because you do
not think. Otherwise you will be thankful, not hostile. You must never
forget you original and initial weakness so that you may not become a
rebel like this.

Your rebellion is because of ignorance, negligence, and unmindfulness.
*Tafsir Ruhul Bayan* has mentioned an Arabic proverb:

**A fellow didn’t know shooting. I gave him daily lessons. When he was
able to shoot, he shot, first of all, me. The one who knew nothing of
poetry, when I taught poetry, he first of all, sang in my
condemnation.**

A third example
---------------

**I saw a puppy and I brought him home to feed. When it grew up, first
of all, it has bitten me!**  
 Man’s condition is also like this. He had nothing and God gave him
everything. Now he denies God and does not accept the One Who gave him
all kinds of bounties and abilities. He believes in his own being but
not in God’s existence.

He does not accept his responsibility and forgets his connection with
God, that is, the eternal self-existence of God. He believes in
self-reliance and independence for himself, which in itself is
blasphemy, and finally he does not submit to Truth.
