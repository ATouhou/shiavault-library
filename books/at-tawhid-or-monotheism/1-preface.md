Preface
=======

The Establishment and Stability of the Islamic system requires, more
than anything else, the firmness of the beliefs and values of Islam in
the hearts of the people. The realization of this very significant
matter, in its own turn, depends upon the universality of Islamic
education at different levels, by using multifarious means and
opportunities. One of the best of such occasions and opportunities is
the weekly congregations of Salatul-Jumu’ah (Friday Prayer),
particularly in cities where the proceedings of the Salatul-Jumu’ah are
directly broadcast by the radio and television.

Hence, in response to the request of the management committee, in charge
of the affairs of the Salatul-Jumu’ah in the city of Tehran, I delivered
a series of lectures on “The status of At-Tawhid in the ideological
system and value system of Islam”. The texts of these lectures were
regularly published in the Persian language daily, viz:
“Jamhuriyyi-Islami (The Islamic Republic)”,

Now, responding to the requests made by a large number of the listeners
and also by some friends, an abridged version of these lectures is being
published for the interested readers. It is hoped that this humble
service will please Al-Imam Muhammad Al-Mahdi (AS)-may Allah the
Almighty hasten his auspicious reappearance.

Muhammad Taqi Misbah Yazdi
