7. The Image of Reappearance
============================

In this booklet, a picture of the divine government that will be led by
Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) is outlined. All Prophets (a.s) and their
successors are keenly awaiting his reappearance, from the beginning of
creation till date.

• Imam az-Zamaan’s (a.t.f.s.) justice is a striking aspect of his
government that will be complemented by a sense of justice and equity
even among his subjects.

• The entire creation shall be in perfect harmony and compatibility with
man.

• Economic and social welfare of man will be the order of the day.

• The boundaries of Imam-e. Zamaan’s (a.t.f.s.) government will extend
across the length and breadth of the world.

• It will be a universal government, the likeness of which cannot be
found in human history.

• Shiism will be widely practiced among the people of the world.

• The followers of other religions and schools of thought will also turn
towards Islam with their own free will after seeing its truthfulness.

• This government shall endure and rule the entire world.

• The peculiarities of this government (from the aspects of Imam and the
nation) have rendered it as the unparalleled regime of the world.

Some of the prominent features of Imam Mahdi’s (a.t.f.s.) government
include rapid development of knowledge and sciences, universal hygiene
and safety, excellent ethics and high standards of morality,
non-existence of disputes, perfection of intellect, dispelling of
difficulties and calamities. [^1]

Everything that we have outlined above is derived directly from reliable
traditions from the infallible progeny of the Messenger of Allah
(s.q.w.a.) without any interpretation or analogies.

book.)
