Chief Justice
=============

Select as your Chief Justice from the people, one who is by far the best
among them â€“ one who is not obsessed with domestic worries, one who
cannot be intimidated, one who does not err to often, one who does not
turn back from a right path once he finds it, one who is not
self-centred or avaricious, one who will not decide before knowing full
facts, one who will weigh with care every attendant doubt and pronounce
a clear verdict after taking everything into full consideration, one who
will not grow restive over the arguments of advocates and who will
examine with patience every new disclosure of fact and who will be
strictly impartial in his decision, one who flattery cannot mislead or
one who does not exult over his position. But it is not easy to find
such men.

Once you have selected the right man for the office, pay him handsomely
enough, to let him live in comfort and in keeping with his position,
enough to keep him above temptations. Give him a position in your court
so high none can even dream of coveting it and so high that neither
back-biting nor intrigue can touch him.
