Lesson One Hundred Twenty: Sinful Feast
=======================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لا يَنْبَغِى لِلْمُؤْمِنِ أَنْ يَجْلِسَ مَجْلِساً يُعْصَى اللّهُ
فِيْهِ وَ لا يَقْدِرُ عَلَى تَغْيِيرِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

It is unjust for believers to participate in a feast where sin is
performed and they do nothing to change the situation.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Even if one does not commit the sin and does not cooperate with
participants of the feast, participation in a sinful feast is itself a
sin . It amounts to endorsing a sin unless one participates in order to
remedy the situation and perform the critical duty of enjoining good and
forbidding evil.

Furthermore, when a person keeps observing sinful scenes with
indifference and without protest, it darkens his spirit and decreases
his sensitivity so that sins no longer appear so bad to him and this can
lead him to commit sins.
