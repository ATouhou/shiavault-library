Part 3: Dhikr, the Beautiful Names of Allah
===========================================

Names of Allah are recited to invoke Him (as *dua'as)* for obtaining
benefits.

A'dads (total of numbers assigned to alphabets) are mentioned in
brackets against each *dua 'a.*

It is the duty of the sincere and pious servants of Allah to seek help
and fulfillment of their desires from their Lord, but He knows what is
good for us and therefore we may not have that, which is asked for, yet
we are bound to go on invoking Him, in strict compliance with the
instructions of Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib.

(1) Yaa Allaahu {66}
--------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَااَلله
  </p>
</blockquote>

Allah is the (proper) name of God. "Allah" is cited 2607 times in the
holy Qur’an.

(a) To seek acceptance of prayers and fulfillment of legitimate desires
recite 66 times immediately after sunrise, or at the time of sunset, or
in the late hours of the night.

(b) To obtain full satisfaction of all legitimate desires recite 200
times, after *wuzu,* on Fridays.

(c) To be aware of the unity of Allah, to become pious and to wipe out
the love of worldly things, recite it 1000 times daily.

(d) Make pills of flour, recite it 11000 times over them and drop them
into a river or sea, all your difficulties will be made easy.

(e) Allah sends blessings on that house in which "Yaa Allaahu" is
written and pasted or mounted on the wall.

Many *ulamah* (religious scholars) have said that this could be the
*ismi aa 'z 'am,* the great name of Allah.

There are innumerable merits of the following *dua'a:*

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لاَ إِلهَ إِلاَّ اللهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

‘Laa Ilaaha Illallaah’

Recite it as many times as possible to obtain the benefits mentioned in
the following traditions.

The Holy Prophet said:  
 “Allah revealed to Prophet Musa that all the heavens and the earths
with whatever is in them, if put into one plate of the (divine) scales,
will be outweighed by ‘Laa Ilaaha Illallaah’ in the other.

At the time of death say again and again ‘Laa Ilaaha Illallaah’ to wash
away the sins.

‘Laa Ilaaha Illallaah’ is the heart and soul of a believer's life in
this world, a companion in the hour of death and a helping friend at the
time of resurrection on the Day of Judgment.

Jibrail gave me the message of Allah that two groups of people, on the
day of resurrection, will come up from the graves, one, with smiling
faces, ‘Laa Ilaaha Illallaau Wallaahu Akbar’ on their lips; and the
other, with disgraced faces, crying in despair”.

Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib said: “The words ‘Laa Ilaaha Illallaah’ move
upwards, as soon as they come out from the mouth of a Muslim, and
clearing away all sins that they make contact with, settle down with the
good deeds.”

Imam Muhammad Baqir said; "Nothing brings more rewards than the regular
recitation of ‘Laa Ilaaha Illaallaah’".

Imam Jafar Sadiq said: "The good deeds of a person who recite one
hundred times the words ‘Laa Ilaaha Illaallaah’ carry more weight than
all other good actions, done on that day, except, of course, of that
person who has recited the same a greater number of times."
