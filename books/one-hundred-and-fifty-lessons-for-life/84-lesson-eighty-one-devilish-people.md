Lesson Eighty One: Devilish People
==================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إذا رَأَيْتُمُ الرَّجُلَ لايُبالِى مَا قالَ أَوْ ما قِيْلَ فِيْهِ
فَإنَّهُ لَبَغيَّةٌ أَوْ شَيْطانٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

When you find that a person is indifferent to what he says or what is
said about him, you shall know that he is either unchaste or
devilish.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Drowning in various sins makes man indifferent to any and every
accusation. He does not care about what he says about others and what is
said about himself. Such persons are mean, shameless , devilish.
