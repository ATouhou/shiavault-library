The Hussain’s Convoy in Bin Ziad’s Prison
=========================================

Bin Ziad ordered that the captive ladies to be taken to a jail far from
the castle and the mosque, thus the guard who was taking them to the
prison said: "There was no alley that we passed by that was not full of
men and women who were hitting their faces and crying".

After the daring discussions that went between Bin Ziad and the captive
ladies, Bin Ziad feared that things might go against him, especially
that people started to blame him. So he ordered that they be put in a
closed jail in a confinement near the mosque or inside the castle, and
he tightened the security around them so that no one would dare enter
their prison.
