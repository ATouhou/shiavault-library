76: [every] Man (dahr)
======================

This chapter of 31 early Meccan verses was revealed after The
Mercy-giving 55 and before Divorce 65. Both alternate titles of [Every]
man (or Al- \`Insan) and This [Day and] Age (or Ad-Dahr) are contained
in the first verse. The name Insan is also inferred in Chapter 36,
Ya-Sin.

The chapter deals with the subject of eschatology or how we shall spend
our afterlife. It also speaks of freewill. We are told how to attain
perfection or, as some phrase it, how to progress into sinlessness.
