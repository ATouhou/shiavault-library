Story no. 38: Mu’in - the boy who pestered people
=================================================

Mu’in was a naughty boy of 8 years.  
 He used to ring the doorbells of the people of his street and used to
run away.  
 When the people opened their doors and found no one, they were very
angry indeed.  
 After that, the children of the street kept watch of their street to
catch the bad boy.  
 One day, at last they saw him ringing the bell of a house.  
 At once they surrounded him and caught him. Some children wanted to
punish him, but one of the children suggested that it would be best if
they handed him over to his parents and made them aware of these
events.  
 When his parents were made aware of these happenings, they were very
unhappy. But they did not have any choice except for advising him.  
 It wasn’t long before Mu’in, from the advice of his parents, left these
bad actions and was in the circle of the good children of the street.
