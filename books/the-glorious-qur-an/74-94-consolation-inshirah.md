94: Consolation (inshirah)
==========================

These S early Meccan verses were revealed after the previous chapter
called Morning Bright! 93, and before Eventide 103. The chapter marks
Divine confirmation of the Prophet's mission, and it brings him further
comfort. During any depressed mood we can find much solace by repeating
it.
