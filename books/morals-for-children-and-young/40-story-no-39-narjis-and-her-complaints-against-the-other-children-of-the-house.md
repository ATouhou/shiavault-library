Story no. 39: Narjis and her complaints against the other children of the house
===============================================================================

Whenever Aqa Abbas came home, he greeted his children, and the children
also became happy at their father’s arrival. Aqa Abbas never came home
empty handed. Sometimes he brought ice cream, and sometimes fruits for
the children.  
 Mrs. Khadija, their mother, used to distribute it among the children.  
 But Narjis complained to her father about her siblings. Sometimes she
would say “Father, today Ali broke a glass, Sometimes she would say
“Father, Ahmad pestered Mamma today” , and these complains were the very
cause of some of the other children quarreling with her.  
 Her mother was unhappy with these happenings, so one day she called
Narjis and said “ Do you know that complaining about others is a very
bad action in Islam and that you should not complain about others to
Father.”  
 Narjis replied “ I did not know that, thank you Mamma for guiding me”.
