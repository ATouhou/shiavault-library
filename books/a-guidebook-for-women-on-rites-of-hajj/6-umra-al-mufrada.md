===============

Miqat for Umra al-Mufrada
-------------------------

If the pilgrim is in Makkah then the *miqat* (a special place designated
by the sacred rules of Islam for wearing ihram) is Hudaybiyyah. Ja'ranah
or Tan'eem.

Rules for Umra al-Mufrada
-------------------------

1. Ihram.

2. Tawaf (circumambulation).

3. Salaat for tawaf.

4. Sa'ee between Safa and Marwah.

5. Taqseer. (Cutting the hair of the head).

6. Tawaf-un-Nisa.

7. Salaat for tawaf-un nisa.

Conclusion
----------

The main difference between *Umra al-Mufrada* and *Umra-ut­Tamatu* is
that there is no *tawaf-un-nisa* in *Umra-ut-Tumatu*. The second
difference is that *miqat* for *Umra-ut-Tamatu* is from the five main
designated places.

Repetition of Umra al-Mufrada
-----------------------------

A person is not allowed to perform two Umras in the same month (either
for himself or for someone else). But if the Umras are for two different
people then it is permissible.
