Bahlool and a Vizier
====================

One day a vizier said to Bahlool, “The Khalifa has made you Amir and
commander of dogs, chickens, and pigs.”

Bahlool replied, “Then from now on don't disobey my orders because you
have become my subject.”

All of the vizier's companions laughed. The vizier was very ashamed and
embarrassed because of Bahlool's reply.
