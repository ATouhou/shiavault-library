Being Attentive to the Hereafter
================================

The Holy Prophet (S) said that the disciples of Jesus (‘a) asked him
with whom they should make friends, and he (‘a) replied: "With one whose
presence reminds you of God, his speech increases your knowledge and his
deed inspires you (to work righteously for) the next world."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 1, p. 203

Amir ul Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) said: "No business should hinder you from
being busy doing good for the coming world, hence, surely, the length of
opportunity is a very short time."

Ghurar-ul-Hikam, p. 335

Amir ul Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) said: "He who sells his next life for his
present life in this world, loses both of them."

Ghurar-ul-Hikam, p. 274

Imam Hadi, the tenth Imam, (‘a) said: "Remember when you are on your
deathbed and your body is lying before your family members, then there
is no physician to prevent you (from death) nor a friend to avail you."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 78, p. 370
