Preface
=======

Surely, a human being cannot be a perfect being unless he is under the
direct supervision of the Mighty, Perfect God. On the other hand, the
Almighty Creator of this world should be perfect in every way, making no
mistakes at all.

If a human being, with his/her imperfections, writes a book, that book
will be written on his/her level and time will show his/her mistakes.
History will reveal them.

In the ancient ages, people believed that the earth was flat! The sun
revolved around the earth! At the time, they were known facts. Where are
these facts today?

Theories come and go and humans live and die. So is the way of the
world. But the One, the Everlasting, is always here with us and so is
His Book. The Almighty Lord's Book must be perfect, with no mistakes.
Should any mistake be detected, then we must deduct that the Book could
not have been written by Him or under His supervision by His Prophets.

The Books which dominate the world today as Gospel, the Books of God,
are the Bible and the Qur'an. We should research these two Books. We
should not rely on the words, "Just believe". After all, we have a
device to think with, we have a tool to undo the mistakes with, and to
enable us to distinguish between right and wrong. If we did not have
such power, then it really would not matter what book we followed or
what belief or religion we adopted. We might as well be as animals, just
eat and sleep...

As Godâ€™s book is perfect, I am a faulty, small creature in His kingdom
with many mistakes, wishing by His grace to lift me up.
