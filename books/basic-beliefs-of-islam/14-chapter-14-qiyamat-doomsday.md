Chapter 14 : Qiyamat - Doomsday
===============================

Qiyamat, resurrection or the day of judgment is the fifth fundamental
belief in Islam. The doctrine of Tawhid and resurrection are the most
basic concepts of Islam which were emphasized by all the prophets. This
is the reason that we find these two concepts in almost all the
religions of the world. However, in other religions, the concept of
resurrection has been distorted like other teachings of the prophets and
only Islam gives correct and accurate information about the occurrence
of this great event.

The Doomsday: Why! How! and When!

Why the Doomsday must occur ?
How the Doomsday would occur?
When the Doomsday shall occur?

These are indeed very pertinent questions. Almost every nation has
asked these questions from their prophets. But mostly the questions were
asked in sarcastic manner to ridicule the actuality of the concept.

Basically, those who are not capable to understand, why the universe
was created, are not qualified to comprehend, why the universe should
have an end. But, even those scientists who reject the core concept of
the creation, believe in an inevitable occur rence of the Doomsday.

The Holy Quran has answered these and many other related questions
about the Doomsday in hundreds of verses. Allama Faiz-i-Kashani, one of
the renowned scholar of Islam, has discovered more than 100 names of
this great event and said that the significance of each name is that it
reveals a peculiar secret about the incident . The most common name of
this event is Qiyamah which has appeared 70 times in the Holy Quran.

**Different names of Qiyamat**

Some other names of Qiyamat which throw considerable light on what will
happen on this day are as follows

1 - Yaumul- Hisab: i.e., The day when the final and total
accountability of all human deeds will take place.

2 - Yaumul-Akhera: i.e., The final and the last day after which no any
other event will occur.

3 - Yaumut- Talaq: i.e., The day when all belongings will be detached
from their owners.

4 - Yaumul- Hashr: i.e., The day when all the human beings will gather
to know their ultimate fate.

5 - Yaumul-Fasl: i.e., The day when a clear separation between the
evil-doers and vir tuous will take place or the day when all existing
relationships among humans will be cut off.

6 - Yaumul-Jamaa: i.e., The day when every thing that existed will be
brought into account.
7 - Yaumud-Deen: i.e., The day when the final judgment of all affairs
with absolute justice will be declared.

8 - Yaumul- Huq: i.e., The day when only truth will prevail.
9 - Yamus-Saah: i.e., The definite time when all of us will be
resurrected for final judgment.
10 - Yaumul-Baath: i.e., The day when all dead people will be given a
new life.
11 - Yaumun-Nashr: i.e., The day when who were born in this world will
rise.
12 - Yaumul-La-yanfaul maal wala banoon: i.e., The day when all
material belongings and family relationships will be of no use.

Thus, summing-up the meanings of these words used in the Holy Quran,
and connecting it with other facts described in other verses and
hadiths, a clear picture of the Doomsday can be visualized.

**When the Doomsday will occur ?**

Scientists strongly believe that one day the world will cer tainly come
to an end but do not know when it will precisely happen. It is vir
tually impossible to know the timings of the Doomsday. From the Quran
and the hadith, it is clear that the exact timings of the Doomsday is an
absolute Divine secret. No one except Allah (swt) knows the time of
Qiyamat. Quran clearly tells us, why the time of the Qiyamat is held in
secret. "The Hour of Doom is sure to come. But I choose to keep it
hidden, so that every soul may be rewarded for its efforts". (20:15)

"They question you (Muhammad) about the Hour of Doom: When shall it be
? (say) you have no knowledge to say anything about it. Allah alone
knows when it will come. You are but a Warner for those who fear".
(79:42-44) The Doomsday will come suddenly at its own time fixed by
Allah (swt). The time is fixed but no one knows it except Him.

"They ask you (Muhammad) about the Hour ( of Doom ) and when it is to
come. Say : None knows except my Lord. He alone will reveal it at the
appointed time. A fateful hour it shall be , both in the heavens and the
earth. It will come suddenly." (7:187) " People ask you about the Hour
of Dooms. Say: the knowledge of it is with Allah alone. Who knows? it
may well be that it is near at hand". (33:63)

**What will be the length of the Doomsday?**

No one knows the actual length of the Doomsday. However, we can guess a
figure from the reliable data available to us. The Doomsday will cause
complete destruction of the universe. There are billions of galaxies in
the universe and each galaxy contains billions of stars. Thus, from the
size of the universe as well as from the hadiths, it seems that the
whole event of Doomsday will take quite a long period of time.

Professor Bashiurdin Mahmood has given an approximate length of the
Doomsday. He said that from the Quranic verse 70:4, the minimum length
of the Dooms may be as long as 50,000 solar years. But the length of one
day of Allah is equal to 1000 solar years (32:5) . In this proportion,
the period of Universal Doomsday from the star t to the end may be as
long as 18 billion solar years of our ear thly measure of time.

However, this is just a figure based on some reliable calculation. But
no one knows the actual duration of the Doomsday. Allah is All- Mighty.
He can do everything. He can complete it in 18 seconds or less, and He
can spread it in 18 billion of solar years.

Another clue in support of the above calculation is that Allah (swt)
has created the universe in six days. These days are not cer tainly the
24 hours days of ours, as the sun and the ear th were not created then.
Six days means six periods which may be of billions or trillions of
years duration. Thus, as creation of the universe has taken trillions of
years, the distraction process can also consume billion years. [Allah
knows better.]

**How the Doomsday will start ?**

The Doomsday will appear all of sudden with a catastrophic big bang. It
has been referred in the Holy Quran as Soor. No one knows the actual
nature of the Soor. But Quran tells us that the Soor will be a
tremendous bang which will spread a wave of terror throughout the
universe. "And the day when the Soor will be blown and all who are in
the heavens and the earth, will stare in terror, save him whom Allah
wills." (27:87)

There will be two Soors:

**The First Soor**

The Divine Bugle! The Big - Bang - Sound! - The star t of the Universal
Doomsday. It will be a horrible event. The whole universe will star t
shaking causing to shake everything everywhere. The Quran has called it
a 'heavy day ' "Heavy day in the Heavens and the Earth". (7:187 )

An unprecedented and an unexampled condition of sweeping chaos on a
cosmological scale will grip the entire universe. The residents of
planet ear th will experience tremendous turbulence of whole-earthquake,
that has never occurred before in the entire history of mankind. Then a
chain of disastrous events will occur one after the other destroying the
whole universe. Every living creature living anywhere in the universe,
including the Angel of Death and the Angel who will blow the Soor, will
finally die.

"Every thing that exists will perish, except the Face of your Lord,
Full of Majesty, Bounty and Honor". (55:26-27)

**The Secound Soor
Resurrection Day :**

Allah will then command the blowing of the second Soor by His will for
resur rection of the dead souls. The second Soor will bring the new
order of creation. Allah will create a new universe much larger than the
present one and the most beautiful one. This will be the fulfillment of
the promise of Allah Subhanahu taala, made in the Holy Quran.

"He will surely repeat the creation of the universe again" (21:104) The
new world will be unimaginably different (but with some resemblance
also) in all respects viz. shape, size, climate, laws and living
conditions. "On that Day when the earth will be changed into another
earth and the heavens (they will also be changed)" (14:48)

An Important hadith about the initiation of the Doomsday. Some one
asked a question to Imam Zainul-Abideen (as) about the duration between
the two soors. Imam replied: "As much as Allah would please."

Then Imam was further asked by the same person about the nature of the
soor and how it

would be blown.

Imam replied: "So far as the first blowing is concerned, verily Allah
will command angel Israfil to come down towards the earth to blow the
Soor. The Trumpet will have one mouth-piece and two tubes. The space
between the two tubes will be like the distance between the sky and
earth.

When the angels will see Israfil descending towards the ear th with his
Trumpet, they will say: Verily, Allah has ordered the inhabitants of the
earth to die, and the inhabitants of the heaven to die.

Then Israfil will bump into it, and the voice will come out from that
tube which is towards the earth side. All living beings on the ear th
will die. And the voice will come out from that tube which is towards
the heaven side, and all living beings in the heaven will die, except
Israfil. Then Allah will say to Israfil: "O Israfil, Die. and he will
die."

Then they will remain in this condition as long as Allah would wish.
And His ARSH will retur n upon the water, as it was in the beginning,
independent with His Majesty and Power. At that time, Allah will create
a very loud voice which will reach in every part of the heavens and the
earth, saying: Whose is the Kingdom this day? No one will answer as
there will be none alive.; then Allah will answer Himself creating a
loud voice: It is of Allah, the One, the Irresistible (Quran 40:16).

The One Who created all the creatures and gave them death; verily, I am
Allah, there is no god except I alone, there is no par tner for Me nor
any minister; and I made the creatures by My hand (power) and I made
them die by My Will; and I shall resurrect them by My power. Then Allah
will cause the second blowing of the Trumpet; the voice will come out
from the side which is towards the Heavens, and all inhabitants of the
heaven will become alive. and will take their previous positions, and
then all people will be gathered for reckoning."

While Imam was saying all this, he was weeping profusely.
[Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. iii] The important part of the Imam's narration is
the eventuality of the whole episode, i.e., when all living creatures in
the universe i.e. both, the inhabitants of the earth and the heavens
will die by the order of Allah, and then Allah alone will sustain His
Arsh and will create a loud voice saying, There is no god but Allah.
This would be an absolute affirmation that,

He is the sole creator of everything, and He is alone and absolutely
one, He has no partner, no Prime Minister, no father and no son, and
there is no god of any kind but Allah, and there is no power other than
Him who can create and destroy.

Absolute silence other than His one voice is an absolute proof of His
absolute oneness. The scientific clues of the Doomsday - From Big-Bang
to Big-crunch. Scientists can explain how and why the Doomsday would
occur. As the Big-bang theory explains how the universe came into
existence, the Big Crunch theory explains how the universe will come to
an end.

Scientists believe from observing the red shift in distinct galaxies
that the universe is currently expanding. According to Einstein theory,
the universe has a finite volume and finite number of hydrogen atoms. At
some time in the future, no one knows when, the expansion of the
universe would stop. The galaxies which are now receding from one
another will star t to approach towards each other and finally they will
star t colliding with each other. As there are more than 100 billions of
galaxies, billions of collisions will occur one after the other - that
is how the scientists believe in the occurance of the Doomsday. The Holy
Quran confirms it.

"All that is there will perish, except the Countenance of your Lord,
Full of Majesty and Bounty and Honor." (55:26-27) The Big Crunch will be
like the Big Bang in reverse. At present the universe is expanding, but
it is being observed that the rate of expansion of the universe is
gradually slowing down. This shows that the time of the Doomsday is
approaching nearer and nearer.

Quran warns:

"Closer and closer to mankind comes their reckoning, yet they heed not
and they run away." (21:1)

This verse is a dire reminder to all the inhabitants of the ear th that
the Doomsday is not too far but is gradually approaching its appointed
time. "Every event has its appointed times." (54:3).

The possible scientific explanation of the Doomsday in the light of the
Holy Quran has been described by a renowned Muslim scholar Professor S.
Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood in his monu- mental book Doomsday and Life after
death. We shall take relevant material from his book.

**Why the Doomsday will be indescribably a horrible day?**

The earth is a planet out of the nine planets of the solar planetary
system. The sun is one star out of billions of stars in the Milky Way.
The Milky Way is just one galaxy out of billions of galaxies floating in
the universe.

There are more than 200 billion [200,000,000,000,000,000,000.] stars in
the universe. Many of these stars are bigger than the sun. The sun is
only a medium-sized star, but its diameter is more than 100 times the
diameter of the ear th. The Doomsday will be a universal event in which
billions of galaxies and their trillions of stars along with their
planets, satellites and all other kinds of heavenly bodies will collide
with each other and will ultimately come to an end with high
explosion.

Both, Quran and science explain, how all this will happen in a
chain-reaction immediately after the Soor is blown.

A star is a huge ball of gas. The sun is also a star like other stars
in the sky. It looks different from other stars in its size and
brightness because it is the only star which is very near to our earth -
150 million Km. The other billions of stars are so far away that they
appear to be like phosphorescent dots. We can hardly imagine the great
size of these stars. They look like the tiny dots of light because they
are billions of kilometers away from us. For example, the nearest star -
other than the sun - is more than 40 million million kilometers away.
The fastest

Jet would take a million years to fly that far. But even this great
distance is only one-billionth the distance to the farthest stars. Stars
produce nuclear energy by changing hydrogen into helium through a series
of nuclear reactions. This is just like the explosion of atom bomb.

Billions and trillions of atoms are exploding every second in sun and
in other stars producing tremendous amount of energy. It is a great
mercy of Allah Subhanahu taala and His Hikmat that He equipped the light
to travel without a material medium but did not fit out the Sound Waves
to travel in this way. Thus, by His mercy, the residents of earth
receive only light from sun and not the horrible sound of nuclear
reactions.

**The First Soor**

The great natural events that will occur on the planet ear th and in
other parts of the cosmos will start with the Soor - The Divine Alarm.
It would be a bugle raised by a special angel - Hazrat Israfeel, who has
been appointed by Allah (swt) to declare the Doomsday. The bugle will be
an indescribably high - pitched sound which will be heard by everyone as
if it were near and will make all resident of the earth instantly
unconscious for some time.

A series of earthquakes of extremely high intensity, massive volcanic
eruptions on earth, and gigantic thermonuclear explosions in the solar
system and in other heavenly bodies will combine to bring the following
chaotic changes in the universe.

"One Day We shall remove the mountains, and thou wilt see the earth as
a level stretch, and We shall gather them, all together, nor shall We
leave out any one of them.[18:47] Other Quranic Reference :

[18:49, 20:102, 23:101, 27:87, 30:25, 36:51, 38:51, 39:68, 50:20,
50:42, 69:13, 74:8, 78:18, 79:13-14.]

1 - The loudness of the Sound of the Soor will make everyone in the
heavens and the earth unconscious.

Sound is produced by vibrations of cer tain object. The intensity of a
sound depends upon the amount of energy flowing in the sound wave. At a
given frequency, the more intense a sound is, the louder it seems. Sound
of 140 decibels produce severe pain in the ear and can damage the
tissues. A supersonic jet airplane creates shock waves which is 130
decibels at close range. No one can imagine the intensity of the Soor
and its immense vibrational pressure. The loud noise, known as a sonic
boom, of the Soor will sweep over the vast universe. All who are in the
heavens and ear th shall fall down fainting except those who will be
spared by Allah's mercy.

"On that day the Trumpet shall be sounded and all who dwell in heavens
and earth be seized with fear, except those whom Allah will be pleased
(to exempt). All shall come to Him." (27:87)

Other Quranic Reference :

[22:2, 52:45 27:87, 39:68,] 2 - The earth will burst and will be
leveled flat.

It is more likely to happen due to bursting of the ear th's interior
explosive materials. There are millions of tons of molten lava inside
the ear th. According to the modern geologists, the earth is gradually
contracting since its beginning. As the ear th is constantly
contracting, its internal pressure is also continuously rising. At its
climax, when it can no longer hold back its internal pressure, the earth
will explode like a bomb. This theory is supported by the Holy Quran.

"See they not ? How We are reducing the earth gradually, from all its
sides."( 13:41) As the Quran has told us 1400 years ago, the modern
geologists have also reported in their recent findings that the earth
has been shrinking in size since it came into existence 4.5 billion
years ago. This shows that like living species, the earth is also
approaching its end with its age.

· "They wait not but one blast, which will surprise them, while they
are disputing." (36:49) The continous powerful earthquake can also level
the earth. Earthquake greater than 8.5 on Richter scale can level the
skyscrapers and huge mountains. A severe ear thquake may release energy
10,000 times as great as that of the first atomic bomb. Rock movements
during an earthquake can make rivers change their course.

84:3,84:4-5,99:2]

3 - The gigantic mountains will fly like dust particles. Massive
earthquake, volcanic eruptions, and continuos showers of meteorites will
grind the huge mountains into pieces.

Prof. SB Mahmood gives some other explanations of how the gigantic
mountains like Himalayas and Kilimanjaro will become like carded wool.

According to him, this is likely to happen due to the increased
centrifugal forces acting on the body of the earth. The increase in the
magnitude of centrifugal force will be due to the increasing speed of
rotation around the axis and on its orbits. First the mountains will
break apart, and then, they will be thrown around like the projectiles
from a potter 's vessel. Another possible explanation rendered by him is
that the ear th may explode like a powerful bomb by its massive internal
pressure.

"The mountains which you see to be firm will pass away like clouds.
Such is the Might of Allah, Who has rightly perfected all things. He has
knowledge of all your actions". (27:87) Quranic Reference :

[18:47, 20:105-107, 27:88, 52:10, 56:5-6, 69:14, 70:9, 72:10, 73:14,
77:10, 78:20, 81:13, 101:15.]

4 - Vigorous shaking of the earth.

Vigorous shaking of the earth may be caused due to the combined effect
of powerful earthquake, disturbance in the gravitational equilibrium of
the ear th - sun - moon and other planets in the solar system.

It is possible if a giant asteroid or any other heavenly body of a
extremely large mass strikes the earth and pushes it out of its orbit.
The ear th will start shaking vigorously as a result of being hit by the
massive asteroids and also due to the expulsion from the orbit. Ground
shaking by the normal earthquake causes huge structures to sway from
side to side, bounce up and down, and move in other violent ways.

"One Day We shall remove the mountains, and thou wilt see the ear th as
a level stretch, and We shall gather them, all together, nor shall We
leave out any one of them". (18:47) "When the earth is shaken with a
(violent)shock, and the mountains crumble away and scatter abroad into
finest dust". (56:4-5)

Quranic Reference :

[22:1, 56:4-5, 18:47, 73:14, 79:6-7, 99:1.]

5- All oceans will boil and catch fire.

The fire in oceans has been scientifically explained by Prof. S.B
Mahmood in two ways.

1 - Violent release of red hot lava beneath the sea due to the volcanic
activity.
2 - There is a large amount of hydrocarbon in the interior of the ear
th. As it is highly explosive in nature, it can easily catch fire
beneath the sea beds during the massive ear thquakes.

When it happens, the oceans will become the fireballs.

Also, an earthquake on the ocean floor can ignite the
under-sea-petroleum reservoirs, which on explosion can cause fire in the
oceans.

Quranic Reference : 81:6, 82:3-4 6 - The earth will pour out its entire
contents.

This may be the result of ear thquakes and volcanic eruptions.
Earthquake usually begin deep in the ground in a range of 70 to 700
kilometers beneath the surface of the earth. Powerful earthquake will
throw out the contents of the ear th with pressure.

"When the earth is expanded and casts out all that is within it and
becomes empty, obeying its Lord as it must do". (84:4) Quranic Reference
: [99:1-2, 84:4-5, 99:3, 99:4-5,86:9, 100:10. 7 - The earth will be
pounded and pounded again and again.

The earth is revolving around the sun in its orbit and also spins on
its own axis. The centrifugal force and electrostatic force keep the
earth in equilibrium. The disturbance in these forces will cause
imbalance in the ear th's motion.

Quranic Reference :[56:4,69:14,89:21] 8- The normal atmosphere of the
earth will be filled with suffocating smoke. The combined effect of
massive volcanic eruption, gaseous material from the heavenly bodies and
the bombardment by meteorites may fill the ear th's atmosphere with
dust, porous glassy matter and mixture of gases.

Volcanoes release gases like carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen
sulfide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, carbon monoxide and water
vapors. These volcanic gases go up to the 15 kilometers height in the
stratosphere. "Then watch thou for the Day that the sky will bring forth
a kind of smoke (or mist) plainly visible".

The Holy Prophet said:

"Dukhan refers to the smoke which will be seen on the day of
judgement." This is a warning to those who reject the true faith. They
will see smoke every where on the day of reckoning. It will envelop them
as a grievous penalty.

Quranic Reference : [44:10-11] 9 - The sun, planets and the moon will
collide with each other. There are many possible explanations.

1- All heavenly bodies are floating in their respective orbits under
the influence of gravitational and other kinds of forces. The
disturbance in the equilibrium of these acting forces will bring the
heavenly bodies out of their orbits. Inevitably they all will start
colliding with each other.

2- After the sun becomes a red giant, it may explode and the debris may
be blasted into space.

3- The sun and its planet are in equilibrium. When the nuclear fuel of
the sun would be exhausted, the planets including our ear th will fall
into the sun.

"When the Sun is folded up" (81:1)
Quranic Reference : [84:4-5, 99:2-3, 75:8, 75:9. 44:10-11]
10 - The dazzling light will blind the eyes.
"So when the sight becomes dazed". [75:7]
11 - The galaxies will be split asunder.
Once the precise equilibrium of the universe is disturbed, billions of
stars and planets will crash into one another filling the space with
gases.
"A day, when the heaven splits asunder, with a dazzling white cloud,
and the angels ascend in continuos stream." (25:25)

Quranic Reference: [25:25, 55:37, 69:15, 73:18, 77:9, 78:19, 82:1,
84:1-2.] 12 - The stars will disintegrate and will be scattered into
dust balls. In the receding universe, stars, embodied in white hot space
will star t to boil, then explode. The stars will disintegrate and their
atoms will be smashed to pieces.

Quranic Reference: [77:8, 81:2, 82:2,70:8, 55:37]

13 - The galaxies will shake vigorously and the entire space will be
filled with gaseous material.

It would be the scene of a contracting universe. Galaxies will be full
of turbulence as the stars would be crashing into each other, spewing
out hot plasma gases, space filling up with smoky radioactive particles,
the skies littered all round with the radioactive debris.

Thus, when clusters of galaxies containing billions of stars will
collide with each other, the entire space will be filled with their
radioactive gaseous materials by nuclear blasts. Quranic Reference:
[52:9, 44:10, 39:68]

14 - The stars in their galaxies will be rolled back like the scroll of
papers. According to the modern cosmological theories, the present
universe is not open but closed one. This precisely means that the
universe has a beginning and eventually it would come to an end. This
phenomenon of creation and then annihilation is described as
cosmological expansion and contraction.

Quran also tells us that there was a time when Allah (swt) created the
universe, gave a full course of its evolution, and finally He will fold
it back. Allah Subhanahu taala will then recreate a new more larger and
magnificent open universe which will never end.

"Remember the Day When We shall roll up the Heavens As a Recorder rolls
up a Scroll:

Likewise We began the First Creation, Surely, We are going to repeat
it" (21:104) Quranic Reference: [21:104, 39:67] 15 - The whole universe
will collapse and will take a new shape.
The universe will be shrinking more and more. Finally the cosmic
contraction will end into an uncontrolled implosion, Big-Crunch, setting
the stage for a re-beginning. Quranic Reference: [14:48, 55:26]

Thus, these were some of the conditions of the Doomsday, but no one can
imagine its full destructive nature. In one verse of the Holy Quran, the
condition of the men at the initial occurrence of the Doomsday has been
pictured as;

"O mankind! Fear your Lord and be dutiful to Him. Verily, the
earthquake of the Doomsday is a terrible event. The day you shall see
it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling, and every pregnant
mother will drop her load, and you shall see mankind reeling like
drunkards although not drunk ; but dreadful will be Allah's
chastisement." (22:1-2)

Thus, the First Divine Doomsday bugle - will envelope the entire
universe and will shake the billions of galaxies at once. Everyone in
the heavens and the earth will die except what Allah wills. The whole
course of destruction of the universe might take billions of years.

**The Second Soor**

1 -The Second and the last soor will bring the new world into
existence. [17:51]
3- The Resurrection Day Begins ! All men will be brought into life and
will be assembled in groups and nations. Each group will attend the
Divine Cour t with his Imam. Every event

recorded or not recorded in the history of the previous world will be
discussed with the highest accuracy and with all minor and major
details. Allah, The Master of the Day of Judgment will give His final
judgment.

83:4-6, 89:25, 99:6,45:28, 101:9.]

All Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus and atheist scientists strongly
believe that the world is not a permanent place to live. A day will come
when the whole solar system will collapse. According to the modern
astronomical findings, the sun has passed 4.5 billions years of its age
and has another 4.5 billions of years to live. But ultimately the sun
will also die like many other stars in the galaxy.

It is not very difficult to perceive the concept of the Doomsday. We
know that the usual small scale Doomsday have occurred several times in
the universe.

Astronomers know very well that a large number of stars die somewhere
in the universe at all times. Similarly, the earthquakes and natural
disasters frequently occur on the earth. Doomsday would be just the
universal disaster with total collapse of the cosmos. However, only
Islam gives the most precise picture of the Doomsday and its purpose.
Islam teaches its adherents to do all the necessary preparations to
escape from the horrors of the Doomsday.

Both, creation and the destruction of the universe is according to the
Divine planning. Neither the universe came into existence accidentally
nor it will be destroyed by any accident. "We have not created the
heavens and the earth, and all that lies between them but with a
purpose, according to a pre-fixed measurement. [Quran - 46:3]
