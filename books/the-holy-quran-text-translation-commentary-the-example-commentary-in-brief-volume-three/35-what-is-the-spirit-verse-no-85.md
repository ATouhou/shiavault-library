What Is the Spirit (verse No. 85)
=================================

Commentators have had very long discussions about this verse (NO.85) in
general, and about Man's \`\`SPIRIT'', or what is called the, \`\`SOUL''
in particular.

In our comments we shall begin to explain the literal meaning of the
word, then we shall see how the word is used in Qura"n; and finally will
give our comments:ِ

1ِ The Arabic, \`\`ROOH'' and, \`\`RIH'' which means, \`\`WIND'' both
are from the same root. It has many connotations and shades of meaning,
like, RA"HAT=COMFORT, HAPPINESS, KINDNESS, INSPIRATION, HOLY SPIRIT,
GOD'S AID, FINE, MERCURY and etc.

Therefore, if the Spirit of Man which is an independent, and
incorporeal created essence is called ROOH, it is due to its similarity
with the wind, in movement, life inducing, invisibility, and etc.

2ِ

A) The word, \`\`ROOH'' has been used in Qura"n in a various way to
bear a diversity of meanings:ِ

In S 2:253, it is used to show the HOLY SPIRIT which came from God to
strengthen the Apostles in their missions;ِ

\`\`And those Messengers We have exalted; some above the athers. Among
them are some to whom Allah spoke. (MOSES THE INTERLOCUTOR) Others He
raised in grades, and We gave Jesus the son of MARY, evidences, and We
strengthened him with the Holy Spirit.''

B) In some passages it is used to mean SPIRITUAL POWER by which Allah
strengthens the believers, e.g. in S 52:22;ِ

\`\`They are those on whose heart, the faith is written, and Allah has
strengthened them with a SPIRIT from Himself.''

C) Sometimes it is used in Qura"n to illustrate the angel of
inspiration as in, S 26:193:ِ

\`\`This is a revelation from the Lord of the world, with which comes
down the Trustworthy Spirit.''

[ 589 ]

D) In other cases it is used to imply an Arch angel such as Gabriel, as
we read in S 97:4:ِ

\`\`There comes down in the night of Ghadr, the angels and the SPIRIT,
by Allah's permission, on every affair.''

The verse implies that the Spirit (GABRIEL) does not come down of his
own accord. He, in accompany with the other angels, come down to dispose
every affair of Man.

E) And finally the word may mean the soul, or the life bearing Spirit
which God has blown it to Man. An instance of this is found in S
32:9:ِ

\`\`He fashioned Man in due proportion and breathed into him of His
Spirit.''

3ِ We now come to know what the word, \`\`ROOH'' that is translated to,
\`\`SPIRIT'' may mean in the verse under our discussion. (NO.85) In
other word, find the answer that what sort of a ROOH was the object of
their question from our prophet?

All evidences prove that the questioners wanted to know what sort of a
creature is the SPIRIT, or the SOUL of Man, which distinguishes him from
other animals. What is the intelligent power which is the main source
and the foundation of all our faculties, such as the wisdom, memory,
knowledge, seeing, hearing, decision, love, faith, and etc.?

The Spirit has a structure which is different from that of our material
body, and the laws and regulations that govern the Spirit are not
similar to the laws that govern the body, and what we know about our
soul is indeed very little, to compare it to what we must come to
know.

Therefore our prophet is instructed to answer:ِ

\`\`The Spirit is of the order of my Lord, and you are not given of
knowledge, but a little.''

So the Spirit is one of the high mysteries which cannot be explained in
our physical and material terms. Imam Sadiq (AS) has said:ِ \`\`Rooh is
a creature created by God, which has power and can see. It belongs to
the kingdom of heavens.''

Although our Spirit is nearer to us than everything else, we know
[ 590 ]

very little about it. Our knowledge of past and present have not given
us enough information about our ownself and soul. We cannot yet answer
even to some of the fundamental question about our Spirit like;ِ Of what
sort of material is it made of. Or how is its structural form?

Inspite of all the mysteries of the Spirit, and so many unanswered
questions about it, we are not very stranger with the matter, that no
one denies that a fact or an entity which is named Spirit exists in us,
or we exist in it.

OUR SOUL, THE IMMATERIAL ENTITY

HAZRAT AYATULLAH-AL-OZMA" MAKA"REM has a long discussion about Man's
Soul in his great Example Commentary, a summary of which I have quoted
and translated in the above passage. The whole commentary needs a great
amount of knowledge to understand, and a high skill to translate.

On the other hand, my style in this translation and all the books that
I have written and published, has been to write the most complex matters
that I may understand, in the simplest possible language. This is
because my aim is to write for the common people, and not for the
learned and scholars. I therefore left the translation of the article
about Spirit for an expert and skilled translator that I hope will in
future translate the complete work of his holiness. But in order to fill
up the vacancy of the matter, in the following Translator's Note, our
dear readers will have the results of my own studies in the field of the
Spirit, and the views of some of the Persian Great scholars and
philosophers, like FARABI and AVICENNA.


(1)

Our soul is an inmaterial entity, distinguishable from, and superior to
our body. It is the animating principle, and actuating cause of life,
manifested in thinking, willing, and knowing. The Soul is a
[ 591 ]

substance of the spiritual world, which takes no form, and cannot be
pointed out. It has no motion or repose. It can perceive that which is
lost, and conceive that which is expected. The Soul goes to sightseeing
in the kingdom of heavens. We do not know much about it, as the
knowledge that has been vouchsafed to us is only a little. The wisdom
may reach the Soul, but imagination never.


(2)
THE SOUL IS IMMORTAL AND SEPARABLE FROM THE BODY

There are so many reasons by which we prove that Man's Soul is immortal
and separable from his body. Some of the reasons that are given to prove
the proposition by Persian Scholars Like FARA"BI and AVICENNA; SHAIKH
ESHRA"GH, and other philosophers are as follows:ِ


Aِ No one can forget his own very self, which is his soul; but every
one does forget his body, and most of his organs. There are some organs
in our body, that we may never know them in the whole life; but we know
the self all the times, and we can never forget that we are, and we
exist, in any condition! This fact proves that the Soul and the Body are
two different and two separate entities.


Bِ Our material body has some function that matter and material is not
able to accomplish them. Our intellect, and understanding, for instance,
are not the function of Matter. How can a stone or a piece of gold or
any other material understand, think, and distinguish and finally
decide!? Therefore it follows that the Soul is something other than the
body.

Cِ The body changes all the time. No one is like his childhood. The
body changes all the time but the self never changes! Yes! You old man
are that boy who....

There are millions of billions of cells in our body. The red blood
cells number to some twenty-five trillions, and yet each one of us has
been originated as a single cell, or what they call it a fertilized egg.
It was from this single egg that all our cells were then derived by a
[ 592 ]

process of cleavage, or division!

Cells are continually dying and being replaced in our body. Millions of
dead cells are washed from the surface of the skin, every time we bathe.
It has been scientifically estimated that during every second of our
life ten millions of our red cells die, and are replaced by the new
ones!

It follows therefore, that our body is periodically dying a natural
death, and is then revived! Thus far in your life, you have died a
natural death so many times, and your old body has been perished, and
replaced with a new one, and you have always been yourself without any
change!

Doesn't this change of our body prove that we are not the body, and
that our body is only a veil upon us, or something like our clothes that
are easily replaced?


Dِ If all the organs of the body; like the heart, the head, the lungs,
the limbs and etc., be replaced with that of another person, still the
self and personality of the donor and acceptor will remain fixed and
unchanged!


Eِ A material body will never take a new form, unless the old form is
destroyed. But the mind takes one form upon another up to millions of
new forms, and retains the original forms as they are introduced to
it.

Millions of forms of knowledge, memories, poetries, and observances,
are stored, and piled up, in your mind with their original forms all
preserved; and you may remember and distinguish them whenever you want.
This also proves that the mind and the material body are different
substances.

Fِ No material body can comprehend itself, but the self of Man does! A
hand, for example, can never know its condition of being hot or cold,
long or short, white or black; but, the soul does comprehend its
existence; which is a proof that the soul is something other than the
body.

[ 593 ]

Gِ Too much work wears out every material instrument, and in particular
the body organs, but will refresh the soul and renew its power for
continuous working. Gaze at the sun for a while; and your eyes shall get
temporarily blind, but the more you think, the more you will know, and
the stronger your mental power shall become! This also can prove that
our mind and body are two different substances.


(3)
HYPNOSIS

By hypnosis one easily prove that the \`\`self'' is not the body.

Hypnosis is a psychological state of altered attention and awareness in
which the individual is usually receptive and responsive to
suggestions.

The outstanding characteristic of the hypnotic state is the
suggestibility of the object. He readily accepts and responds to ideas
offered by the hypnotist. He may even carry out suggestions offered to
him while in hypnosis sometimes after he emerges from the hypnotized
state!

Psychiatrists use hypnosis to enable the patients to recall early
painful or happy experiences that he may otherwise not recall.

Hypnosis has also been used in surgery. It is also used to overcome
undesirable habits such as smoking, overeating, and nail-biting.

I have seen myself, hypnotizers who have made their objects absolutely
soul-less! They concentrated all the sensations and emotions of object
into another pieces of a material body. Therefore, when the body of
their object was severely pinched or harmed, by say a pin, or a nail,
the object felt no pain! But when the material body, say a handkerchief,
in which the object's soul was concentrated, was pinched or pinned, the
object really suffered the pain!

I have also seen myself persons that practise asceticism such as the
Indian Fakirs. They do incredible things! For instance they thrust nails
and bars in every point of their bodies, including their heads and
[ 594 ]

their faces! And even in their eyes. They then drive the nail out, and
prevent any blood shed with the help of their spit! When you ask them
about it they answer:ِ \`\`We do not live with our body. We rather live
with our God, and our soul. It is the self that makes our body. The body
does not make the self.''


(4)
TELEPATHY

The thought transference which is known as TELEPATHY, is another reason
to show that the body and mind are two different substances. Telepathy
is apparent communication from one mind to another, otherwise than
through the channel of senses. There are many persons who can transfer
their thoughts to some other who is far away. There are also persons who
can see the absent, or who can read the others mind.


(5)
TRUE DREAMS

True dreams that are conformable to facts and reality, are among the
reasons to prove the distinction of the soul from body. As a matter of
fact, the soul leaves the body during sleep, and participates in the
dream activity.

That, which Freud considered the dream to be an expression of our
suppressed wishes, or the outcome of unresolved problems arising in real
life, does not explain the existence of True Dreams; or the dreams that
come to pass exactly as they were dreamt.

Many a time, a person dreams of something unknown to him, and yet the
dream comes to pass a couple of years later more or less.

Once I myself dreamt of a house of three stories, situated in another
city with such a special form that I had never thought of. There were
two young girls in a certain place of the house, one of them known and
the other unknown to me. I tried to catch the one I knew but I failed.

Two years later it happened that I went to that city, and to that
[ 595 ]

very house, and things happened to be as I saw them in my dream a
hundred percent true!

Almost all people have had some sort of a true dream that have come to
pass. In QURA"N, it is narrated that Joseph explained the Pharaoh's
dream of seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean cows, as a prophecy of
seven years of famine following seven good years.


(6)

Aِ Prophets, apostles, saints and all the men of God, have been
convinced that the soul is immortal and separable from the body. Such
godly persons never tell lies and are truthful and trustworthy, and we
better deny them not.


Bِ \`\`Self'' is indivisible, but the body is divisible and therefore
they should be different entities.


Cِ The Soul is attracted by morals, philosophy and divine phenomenons,
and knowledge. It must therefore be of the divine nature, as the birds
of a feather fly together, or flock together.


TRANSLATOR'S NOTE)


وَلَئِنْ شِئْنَا لَنَذْهَبَنَّ بِالَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ ثُمَّ لاَ
تَجِدُ لَكَ بِهِ عَلَيْنَا وَكِيلا(( 86 ))

56- IF WE WILL WE CAN TAKE AWAY THAT WHICH WE HAVE INSPIRED IN YOU,
THEN YOU WILL FIND NO ONE TO DEFEND YOU AGAINST US.

إِلاَّ رَحْمَةً مِّنْ رَبِّكَ إِنَّ فَضْلَهُ كَانَ عَلَيْكَ كَبِيراً((
87 ))

87- EXCEPT A MERCY FROM YOUR LORD; THAT HIS GRACE TO YOU HAS BEEN
GREAT.

[ 596 ]

THE COMMENTARY


WHATEVER YOU HAVE IS A BLESSING OF HIS MERCY (VERSE NO. 86 - 87)

Here Allah addresses His prophet saying:ِ

\`\`It is We who have inspired you with all that knowledge and wisdom
that you have, in order to lead and to guide my servants. We can easily
take them back and make you forget all that you knew, and no one can
help if we do so except our own Mercy.

If we take the verse in a wider sense; all our knowledge come to us
from God, and through His Grace and Mercy.

If He takes them back, no one else can teach them to us, except his own
Mercy. So was also the case with our prophet, who never read nor he
wrote anything for being illiterate, and yet all the learned and
scholars bow their heads to him for his great knowledge and wisdom!
Indeed the Grace of God to His Messenger, Mohammad (AS) has been
great.


قُلْ لَّئِنِ اجْتَمَعَتِ الاِْنسُ وَالْجِنُّ عَلَى أَنْ يَأْتُوا
بِمِثْلِ هَذَا الْقُرْآنِ لاَ يَأْتُونَ بِمِثْلِهِ وَلَوْ كَانَ
بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْض ظَهِيراً(( 88 ))

88- SAY:ِ \`\`IF MAN AND JINN GATHER TOGETHER, SO AS TO BRING THE LIKE
OF THIS QURA"N, THEY WILL NOT BRING THE LIKE OF IT, EVEN IF SOME OF THEM
BACK UP SOME OTHER.''

وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَا لِلنَّاسِ فِي هَذَا الْقُرْآنِ مِنْ كُلِّ مَثَل
فَأَبَى أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ إِلاَّ كُفُوراً(( 89 ))

89- AND VERILY WE HAVE EXPLAINED FOR PEOPLE, EVERY KIND OF SIMILITUDE
IN THIS QURA"N; YET MOST OF THE PEOPLE ACCEPT NOTHING BUT PROFANITY.

[ 597 ]

THE COMMENTARY


NO ONE CAN EVER PRODUCE THE LIKE OF QURA"N

EXCEPT ALLAH

VERSE NO. 88 - 89

The above verse is a prelude to the next discussion which is about the
flimsy pretexts and vain excuses of the idolaters, to imply that Qura"n
is the everlasting wonderful miracle of our prophet, if they could only
apprehend. Here the prophet is commanded to tell the unbelievers
that:ِ

\`\`If man and Jinn gather together, so as to bring the like of this
Qura"n, they will not be able to do it, even if some of them back up
some other.''

Here the Jinn and Man, are challenged to produce a book the like of
Qura"n; and Qura"n has claimed that all endeavours to reach this goal,
will fail in every time and in every place! Qura"n is the only Divine
Scripture which has stood pure and unchanged throughout ages.

The second verse (NO.89) refers to the perfection of Qura"n, which is
another miraculous aspect of this wonderful book:ِ

\`\`And verily We have explained for people every kind of similitude in
this Qura"n.''

Anything that is good for the guidance of Man to prosperity and
salvation, has been eloquently explained in this Book through stories,
commands, prohibitions, similitude, examples, warnings, and etc.

The Arabic, \`\`KAFUR'' translated to, \`\`PROFANITY'' may mean to
violate or treat with irreverence, obloquy, or contempt a truth, a fact,
or something that is regarded as sacred.


وَقَالُوا لَنْ نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ الاَْرْضِ
يَنْبُوعاً(( 90 ))

90- THEY SAID:ِ \`\`WE WILL NEVER BELIEVE YOU UNTIL YOU MAKE A SPRING
FOR US TO GUSH OUT OF THE LAND.

[ 598 ]

أَوْ تَكُونَ لَكَ جَنَّةٌ مِّنْ نَّخِيل وَعِنَب فَتُفَجِّرَ الاَْنهَارَ
خِلاَلَهَا تَفْجِيراً(( 91 ))

91- OR THERE SHOULD BE YOURS A GARDEN OF DATE-PALM AND GRAPE, AND YOU
GUSH OUT STREAMS TO FLOW IN THEIR WHOLE INTERIOR.

أَوْ تُسْقِطَ السَّمَاءَ كَمَا زَعَمْتَ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً أَوْ تَأْتِىَ
بِاللهِ وَالْمَلاَئِكَةِ قَبِيلا(( 92 ))

92- OR MAKE THE SKY TO FALL DOWN ON US, AS YOU THINK SO, IN PIECES; (IN
METEORES); OR BRING ALLAH AND ANGELS FACE TO FACE (WITH US).

أَوْ يَكُونَ لَكَ بَيْتٌ مِّنْ زُخْرُف أَوْ تَرْقَى فِي السَّمَاءِ
وَلَنْ نُّؤْمِنَ لِرُقِيِّكَ حَتَّى تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا كِتَاباً
نَقْرَؤُه قُلْ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّي هَلْ كُنتُ إِلاَّ بَشَراً رَسُولا(( 93
))

93- OR YOU OWN A HOUSE ADORNED WITH GOLD; OR ASCEND TO THE SKY. AND WE
WILL NEVER BELIEVE YOUR ASCENSION UNTIL YOU BRING DOWN FOR US A BOOK
THAT WE MAY READ!

SAY:ِ\`\`GLORY TO MY LORD! AM I (ANY ONE) OTHER THAN A HUMAN
MESSENGER?''


THE COMMENTARY


OCCASION OF THE REVELATION (VERSE NO. 90 - 93)

A group of the pagan Arabs including some of their high ups and chiefs
of tribes gathered together in the Sacred Shrine of Mecca, and
[ 599 ]

also invited the Messenger of God, too, to attend their meeting which
he accepted.

They said to the prophet:ِ \`\`Tell us frankly what is your aim and
object in despising our gods, and contempting our religion? If you look
forward to become wealthy, we promise to give you enough to satisfy you.
If you are driving at rank and position, we shall raise you up to our
head.''

The prophet said to them:ِ

\`\`The Lord has guided me to a way that is straight; to an upright
religion, that of Abraham, who was true in faith and not a polytheist.
So, my prayer and service, my life and death, belongs all to Allah who
has no partner; and I am the first Muslim who submits to Allah who is
the Lord and the Cherisher of everything. I am the Messenger of God who
has created you and all things, and I convey God's Message to you
through the Book that Allah has inspired to me. A Book which is indeed a
cause of prosperity for you in this present life, and a source of
felicity in the life to come, and I want nothing of you, but, to follow
your Lord's order and religion.''

The pagans said again;ِ \`\`O.K.! You know well that we have not enough
land to live in, and we are surrounded by high mountains. Tell your God
then to push back the mountains to make a fertile land for us, like the
Syrians and Iraqies. So, also tell your Lord to raise up some of our
forefathers including GHAIS-IBN-AL-KALA"B to testify that you are truly
the Messenger of God.''

Mohammad (AS) said to them:ِ \`\`These things that you request for, are
none of my business; and not in my power.''

They said again:ِ \`\`Then if you are the Messenger of God; and you are
in contact with God's Archangel, \`\`GABRIEL'', bring down with you some
angels to testify your truthfulness. And also, tell them to make you
have gardens of fruits well-watered, and a beautiful house adorned with
gold; like those that you promise your followers to have in the life to
come.''

The prophet answered:ِ

\`\`My mission is not to perform such things that you people ask.''

The pagans said again to the prophet:ِ

[ 600 ]

\`\`In this case, make the pieces of sky (THE METEORES) to fall upon us
as you may think so; or at least ascend to the sky....''. One heathen
from among them shouted loudly:ِ

\`\`Even if you ascend to the sky, we will not believe your ascension
until you bring down for us a Book that we may feel it and read it!''

All these flimsy pretexts and foolish excuses were rejected by the
prophet; and eventually ABUJAHL said:ِ

\`\`My People! Let him go away! He can do nothing except abusing our
gods, and insulting the religion of our forefathers. I will give him his
deserved reward; and when he is in a prostration, I will give an end to
all this, by casting a stone upon his head!''


VARIOUSLYِCOLOURED EXCUSES

Following the argument about Qura"n's miraculous greatness and
limitless wonders, reference is made to some of the flimsy pretexts, and
foolish excuses of the heathens and idolaters. In order to accept the
prophetic mission of the Messenger of God, they proposed six request as
follows:ِ

1ِ Make a spring for us to gush out of the land.

2ِ Have a garden of date-palm and grapes well-watered.

3ِ Make the sky to fall down upon us, as you threaten.

4ِ Bring Allah and his angels down and face them with us.

5ِ Have a beautiful house adorned with gold.

6ِ Ascend to the sky and bring down to us a book.

At the end, Allah instructs His Messenger to answer the pagans with the
following words:ِ

\`\`Am I anyone other than a human Messenger?''

The Arabs were a thirsty people dwelling in a hot dry land in which
vegetation and plants was very rare. To this effect, finding another
spring of water like ZAMZAM, meant a great bounty to them, and the most
valuable miracle too. They of course, did not know what
[ 601 ]

does crude oil and petroleum mean, and in the lands that seas of oil
exist, springs of water are rare. To them having a house adorned with
gold and silver, and a fruitful garden well-watered was a sign of
felicity and prosperity. A disbeliever is usually secular minded, and
can only think of physical and material profits. He forgets or ignores
all about the spiritual matters. Their ridiculous demands like seeing
God, face to face, the God who has not a visible face at all; or the
fall of sky and stones from overhead; ascension to the sky and bringing
down a book to be read, are all the signs and symptoms of their
materialistic ideas.

On the other hand a Messenger's duty is only to convey his message, and
can do nothing other than following what he is ordered to. So the
Messenger of God would say nothing except that with which he was
inspired. He was not sent to satisfy the mean fancies, and vain desires
of some foolish unbelievers.


وَمَا مَنَعَ النَّاسَ أَنْ يُؤْمِنُوا إِذْ جَاءَهُمْ الْهُدَى إِلاَّ
أَنْ قَالُوا أَبَعَثَ اللهُ بَشَراً رَّسُولا(( 94 ))

94ِAND NOTHING PREVENTED PEOPLE TO BELIEVE WHEN THE GUIDANCE CAME TO
THEM; EXCEPT THAT THEY SAID:ِ

\`\`HAS ALLAH RAISED UP A HUMAN AS (HIS) MESSENGER?''

قُلْ لَّوْ كَانَ فِي الاَْرْضِ مَلاَئِكَةٌ يَمْشُونَ مُطْمَئِنِّينَ
لَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ مَلَكاً رَسُولا(( 95 ))

95- SAY:ِ \`\`HAD THERE BEEN ANGELS IN THE EARTH WALKING IN SURETY, WE
WOULD CERTAINLY SEND DOWN ON THEM AN ANGEL FROM THE SKY AS
MESSENGER.''


[ 602 ]

THE COMMENTARY


THE EXCUSE OF CONFORMITY (VERSE NO. 94 - 95)

One of the factors that may hinder some people from believing, is the
conformity of the kind. They say:ِ \`\`How such a great and high rank of
being the Messenger of God, which is becoming to an Archangel; may be
given to a Mortal Man like me and you!?'':ِ \`\`Nothing prevented the
people to believe, when the guidance of God came to them, except that
they said; has indeed Allah elected a Messenger for Himself from among
men?''

This question has always been raised up throughout the history of Man.
The people of Noah did shout out; \`\`He is nothing except a Mortal Man
like ourselves.'' The people of Hud, as well as the people of Mohammad
(AS), said also to their prophets:ِ \`\`What sort of a Messenger of God
is this man who eats and drinks, and walks in the markets? If you obey a
man who is like yourself you will join the group of losers!''

In answer to such a futile objection, and unreasoned suggestion, Allah
said:ِ

\`\`Had there been angels in the earth, walking in surety, we would
certainly send down on them an angels from the heavens as Messenger.''

Mutual understanding between the leader and the leaded is a very
important factor that must be considered. When there is no conformity,
harmony, and congruity between the parties, there won't be co-operation
and success. Therefore, if even a population of angels inhabited this
earth, only an angel from the earth or from the heaven could be sent
down to guide as an apostle, so that they could mutually understand each
other; and communicate with the language of their kind.

But now that the earth is inhabited by mankind, there must be sent a
Man Messenger from the presence of our Lord for the said reasons, in
order to carry an effective mission among men.

[ 603 ]

قُلْ كَفَى بِاللهِ شَهِيدا بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ
بِعِبَادِهِ خَبِيرا بَصِيراً(( 96 ))

96- SAY:ِ \`\`ENOUGH IS ALLAH FOR A WITNESS BETWEEN ME AND YOU, THAT HE
IS AWARE AND SEEING HIS SERVANTS.

وَمَنْ يَهْدِ اللهُ فَهُوَ الْمُهْتَدِ وَمَنْ يُضْلِلْ فَلَنْ تَجِدَ
لَهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءَ مِنْ دُونِهِ وَنَحْشُرُهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عَلَى
وُجُوهِهِمْ عُمْياً وَبُكْماً وَصُمّاً مَّأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ كُلَّمَا
خَبَتْ زِدْنَاهُمْ سَعِيراً(( 97 ))

97- AND HE WHOM ALLAH GUIDES, THEN HE IS (REALLY) GUIDED. AND HE WHOM
HE LEAVES ASTRAY; YOU WILL NEVER FIND THEM GUARDIANS OTHER THAN HIM. AND
WE MUSTER THEM ON THE RESSURRECTION DAY UPON THEIR FACES, (WHILE THEY
ARE) BLIND, DUMB, AND DEAF. THEIR ABODE SHALL BE THE HELL. WHENEVER (ITS
FIRE) DIMINISHES, WE INCREASE THEM THE BLAZE.


THE COMMENTARY


THE REAL GUIDANCE (VERSE NO. 96 - 97)


The next verse (NO.97) implies that, the only real guidance is the
guidance of Allah, whose knowledge encomposes all the events and
[ 604 ]

phenomenones. The Merciful who loves His servants more than all, even
their mother. He is the best of friends, protectors, and guides.

The verse also warns us, not to fall in the claws of evil, so that we
incur the wrath of Allah; and lose the care of our Merciful Lord and His
guidance too. If so we may come to shame and ignominy in here, and in
the Hereafter. This results in being affected with mysterious diseases
that renders us blind of seeing the signs of God, will make us so dumb
that we may not utter a word of truth, and we shall lose our ear of
hearing what is wrong and what is right. When so, the Fire of punishment
which overtakes us, will not lessen, and even if it diminishes, God will
increase its blaze!


ذَلِكَ جَزَاؤُهُمْ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِنَا وَقَالُوا أَءِذَا
كُنَّا عِظَاماً وَرُفَاتاً أَئِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ خَلْقاً جَدِيداً(( 98
))

98- THAT IS THEIR REWARD THAT THEY DISBELIEVED OUR SIGNS, AND SAID:ِ
\`\`WHEN WE BECAME BONES, AND SCATTERED DUST, SHALL WE BE RAISED UP TO A
NEW CREATION?''

أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّ اللهَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالاَْرْضَ
قَادِرٌ عَلَى أَنْ يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُمْ وَجَعَلَ لَهُمْ أَجَلا لاَّ
رَيْبَ فِيهِ فَأَبَى الظَّالِمُونَ إِلاَّ كُفُوراً(( 99 ))

99- DO THEY NOT SEE THAT ALLAH WHO CREATED THE HEAVENS AND EARTH IS
ABLE TO CREATE THE LIKE OF THEM? AND APPOINTED A TERM FOR THEM IN WHICH
THERE IS NO DOUBT. BUT THE OPPRESSORS REFUSE ALL, EXCEPT PROFANITY.

[ 605 ]

قُلْ لَّوْ أَنتُمْ تَمْلِكُونَ خَزَائِنَ رَحْمَةِ رَبِّي إِذاً
لاََّمْسَكْتُمْ خَشْيَةَ الاِْنفَاقِ وَكَانَ الاِْنْسَانُ قَتُوراً(( 100
))

100- SAY:ِ\`\`IF YOU OWNED THE TREASURES OF MY LORDS MERCY, IN THAT
CASE YOU WOULD WITH-HOLD (CHARITY) FOR THE FEAR OF (BEING POOR BY)
SPENDING. AND MAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN NIGGARDLY.''
