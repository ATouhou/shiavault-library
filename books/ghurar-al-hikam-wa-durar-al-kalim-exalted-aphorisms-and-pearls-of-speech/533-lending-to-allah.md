Lending To Allah
================

**Lending to Allah-إقْراض اللّه**

1. One who gives a loan to Allah is recompensed by Him.

> 1ـ مَنْ أقْرَضَ اللّهَ جَزاهُ.

2. Take benefit from the one who takes a loan from you in your time of
prosperity so that you may take its repayment in your time of hardship.

> 2ـ اِغْتَنِمْ مَنِ اسْتَقْرَضَكَ في حالِ غِناكَ لِيَجْعَلَ قَضاءَهُ
