Dedication
==========

To the pioneer of the human intellect,

To the establisher of human civilization,

To him who has filled the world with virtues and knowledge,

To the imam and teacher Jaâ€™far as-Sadiq,

I offer humbly and reverently to his highness this effort about his
grandson Imam Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Askari (a.s.) who had raised the
banner of truth and justice in the world of Islam, and I hope it will be
accepted.
