The Prophet’s Grandson Most Revered Imam Husain (‘a)
====================================================

("Jab qaatema ba qaer hue foj a Shah kaa" )

When the army of the Prince was no more

Thirsty, it had departed to Kausar's shores

His friends murdered, His family destroyed

The home of the Prophet was plundered to the core

No brother or friend or loved ones remained

Two sisters to mourn, and there was Husain

Earlier in the day, sons and friends were around

But by the afternoon, everyone was gone

The sun blazed, wind blew, the desert scorched

The tents flapped with a desolate sound

Husain was surrounded, alone in His pain

A commander but no army, all had been slain

"Why delay oh Death" in misery He asked

"Why must I live after Alder has passed?

Every moment feels like a lifetime to me

Only in Death will my pain pass"

"I should have died when Akbar was killed

I should've been beheaded, that is my will"

"Yet I remain, I live, after everyone has died

Alone I shed tears with no one by my side

Enduring the loss of my sons in this war

In my old age to bury them, to struggle and cry

"No son by me when I succumb to death

No support if I stumble, no place whereon to rest"

He glanced at Akbar's body on the desert sand

He clutched His chest and cried out in pain

"Oh Akbar you rest, your hair on the dust strewn

Come help me, I am falling, rise from Death's daze"

"In Death's slumber you forget your father my son

Say your Namaz (Salat) alongside under the blazing sun"

"From the banks of the Furat, Abbas come to me

My wounds burn with the heat, I'm thirsty, come see

Sprinkle on my body, water if you can find

I'm dying, say goodbye, come to me, come to me"

"In death you sleep soundly, what can Shabeer say?

May no one be as wretched as me I pray'

"Since you've left, every bone inside me hurts

My brow, neck, eyes, my joints, and head hurts

My heart, back, chest, every muscle is full of pain

Distraught I am my son, every vein within me hurts"

"I've battled a thousand soldiers, I'm soaked in blood

Young ones I've buried, with pain my heart floods"

Impatiently Saad's son addressed the army thus

"Come on brave soldiers, surround Husain we must"

They turned toward Husain, attacked and besieged

Thousands bearing arrows, armed with swords the rest

midst archers, stone throwers, Husain stood alone

Spears flashed in the sun, thousands against one

Surrounded by the massive army, all alone

Spears and swords charged, He stood all alone

Arrows inflicted fatal blows, Husain was all alone

Target of a thousand blows, Husain was all alone

in the gloom of Shaam's army, like the moon His Being

glowed

The world had turned against Him, toward Him its fury

flowed

Alas the wretched army knew not a Sayyid's worth

They pierced His noble body with arrows and spears

Aiming at Him their swords, they sought to massacre Him

They circled, surrounded Him, each seeking to kill him first

These were the Prophet's followers, they attacked His own

Grandson

Your Imam was unaided under the scorching sun

Husain fell from His horse, no friend to aid His descent

No one to pull the arrows from His riddled chest

His friends and loved ones dead, Husain now all alone

Weak with thirst and hunger, nowhere to go, no rest

Facing a treacherous army, drowning in their flood

in every face around Him, a hunger to spill His blood

It felt as though the heavens fell to the earth that day

Wounded the son of Fatima, on His horse swayed

The in‑um of the universe, the Prophet's dear Grandson

Precariously He swayed and fell to the earth that day

Oh the thousand bruises on His body as He fell!

Imagine the pain and hurt when to the sands He fell!

Fizza took the news to the ladies within

"The Imam is surrounded Oh what a sin"

Hearing this Abid stood up from his bed and fell

in panic the ladies ran out into the din

With Zainab's cries heaven and earth quaked

Stumbling she ran into the field, her eyes seeking Husain

" Where is my brother? " She cried, running every way

"All's wealth is lost, plundered here today

Show me the way to the river, take me to the battlefield

Show me where my Brother lies, wounded, show me pray'

"The heavens are no help, let me pass Oh blessed earth

I've come searching for Husain, wounded, alone, He hurts"

"I'm Syeda have mercy, help me find the way to Him

I'm Ali's daughter help me, save yourself from sin

May you live happily, find peace after death

Show me where the Sayyid lies, pray take me to Him"

"We've lost everyone, we're ruined in this new land

We're residents of Medina, against thousands today we

stand"

Then she heard Husain's groans, sensed her Brother near

And Zainab ran to where a the sound came clear

She watched in disbelief as Shimer beheaded Husain

She covered her face, fell to the earth, in shock and fear

With grief her heart shattered, she silently prayed

The severed head of her Brother, she saw on a spear raised.
