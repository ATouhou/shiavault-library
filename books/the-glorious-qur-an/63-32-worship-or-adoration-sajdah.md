32: Worship Or Adoration (sajdah)
=================================

This chapter was revealed after Believers 23 and before The Mount 52.
The act of kneeling in worship or prostration is mentioned in II,
15:III, and 41:V. However I do not care for the term prostration \`that
has often been given as a translation for the title since it has
neurotic overtones in contemporary English. Islamic worship requires
more reverence.

This is the last chapter initialed with the letters A. L. M. " (these
have already appeared in Chapters 2 , 3 , 29 , 30 , & 31). It consists
of 30 Meccan verses arranged in three sections, except for vv. 16-20 in
section ii which date from Madina. Creation and man are the initial
themes heard in section i.
