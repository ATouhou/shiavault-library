=========================================

Zainab was the daughter of Imam Ali bin Abi Talib. She was a sister of
Imam Hassan and Imam Hussein She was present at the battle of Karbala.
When her brother Imam Hussein was killed, she was taken prisoner. She
was the spokesman for all the prisoners. She gave an excellent speech.
Her speech is very famous upto now. So is Zainab famous, for her divine
virtues which are a beacon of light for all muslim women.

Once when Zainab was a very young girl she went to her father Ali and
said: “'Oh father, do you love me?”

“Certainly, my darling, I do love you”, replied the father.

Again Zainab asked: “Do you also love Allah?”

“Of course, I do love Allah, my child”, replied the father.

Zainab was puzzled with the reply. She asked again:

“Oh father, how it is possible to have two loves in one heart?”

Ali was pleased with the question. He smiled and replied:

“Dear child, I love you because it is Allah's command to love one's
children. In loving you I love God.”

Moral:
------

Love others for the sake of the command of God.
