description: |
  As'ad Wahid al-Qasim is a seeker of the truth who tried hard to reach it
  very bitterly till Allah guided him to the Straight Path. He was born in
  the Dayr al-Ghusun village on the West Bank [of the Jordan River] in
  Occupied Palestine. Having finished his high school, he made the trip to
  Jordan where he earned a diploma in engineering vocations. Then he
  traveled to the Phillippines where he earned his B.A. in Civil
  Engineering then his Masters in Construction Management. He is about to
  earn his Ph.D. in Governmental Administration as soon as he finishes his
  research about Islamic Public Administration.
