38. The preterite tense is a verb that indicates a state or action that
happened in the past. For example: **أخَذَ**(he took)

39. The last syllable of a preterite tense verb is indeclinable on:

• A *fathah*, for example **ضَرَبَ** (he hit)

• A *Dummah*, if it is connected to the *wāw* plural pronoun, for
example **ضَرَبُوا** (they hit)

• A *sakūn*, if a nominative pronoun with a vowel sign is connected to
the verb, for example **ضَرَبتُ** (I hit)

40. The glottal stop that is added to the beginning of the perterite
tense verbs can be:

• A *qat‛* glottal stop which takes a *fathah* in four-letter verbs. For
example: **أکرَمَ**(he honored)

• A *wasl* glottal stop which takes a *kasrah* in five and six-letter
verbs. For example: **اِنطَلَقَ** (he was set free)

41. All of the vowel signs of the perterite tense verb, except the
second root letter are *fathahs*. For example **أکرَمَ** (he honored).

42. The second root letter of single triliteral verbs can either have a
*fathah*, *dummah* or *kasrah*. For example: **ضَرَبَ** (he hit)
**کَرُمَ** (he honored) and **عَلِمَ** (he knew)
