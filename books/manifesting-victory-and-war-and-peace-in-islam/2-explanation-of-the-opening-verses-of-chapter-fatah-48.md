Explanation of the opening verses of Chapter Fatah 48
=====================================================

Surely We have granted you an open victory,(1) so that Allah may forgive
you of your previous and subsequent faults, accomplish His bounty upon
you, and may guide you to a straight path,(2)  and so that Allah may
support you with a mighty support.(3)

Literal meaning: In Arabic the literal meaning of Fatah is “to open
something”. An Arabic dictionary “Moajim Maqayees Allugha” describes:
“the word fatah is opposite of locking”. For example when we say “open
the door” its opposite is “ to lock the door”. Another dictionary
“Mofradaat” of a scholar Raghib al Isphhani, also gives the same meaning
that is of a close object. Sometimes it applies for the opening of
visible things and when it comes to knowledge Fatah means problem
solving. A similar word of it is miftah which is used for “keys”.
Another one is Muftooh, which refers to a conquered area. It means that
it is open and not banned for any movement.
