Seeking What Is Best
====================

**Seeking What is Best الاستخارة**

1. Seek what is best and do not chose what you want, for how many a
person who has chosen what he wanted and found his own destruction in
it!

> 1ـ اِسْتَخِرْ ولا تَتَخَيَّرْ، فَكَمْ مَنْ تَخَيَّرَ أمْراً كانَ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
هَلاكُهُ فيهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

2. When you embark on something, seek what is best from it.

> 2ـ إذا أمْضَيْتَ فَاسْتَخِرْ.

3. He who seeks what is best [in his actions] does not regret.

> 3ـ ما نَدِمَ مَنِ اسْتَخارَ.
