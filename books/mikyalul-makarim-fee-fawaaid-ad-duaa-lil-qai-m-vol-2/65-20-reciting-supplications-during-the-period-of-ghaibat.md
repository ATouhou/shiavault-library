20: Reciting Supplications During The Period Of Ghaibat
=======================================================

A Dua is mentioned by Sayyid Ibne Tawoos in Muhajjud Dawaat and it is to
be recited during the occultation of Imam Mahdi (aj). The narrator asked
Imam (as) what the Shias are supposed to do in the Ghaibat of Imam (as)?
Imam (as) replied, “In addition to reciting duas you must await for the
reappearance.” “What should we pray?” asked the narrator. Imam (as)
replied:

[^1]In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. O Allah! You
have bestowed Your recognition (Marefat) to me and bestowed the
recognition of Your Messenger, and the angels and made me recognize Your
Prophet and made me recognize the guardians of Your affair. O Allah! I
will not take anything except that You bestow. And except for You I have
no protector. O Allah! Do not distance me from the grades of Your
friends and do not neglect me from the grades of Your friends and do not
neglect my heart after having guided it. O Allah. Guide me towards the
Wilayat of one whose obedience is made incumbent on me.
