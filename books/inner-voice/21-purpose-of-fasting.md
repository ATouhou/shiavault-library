Purpose of Fasting
==================

“(The month of Ramadhan) is the month of repentance, month of
forgiveness, month of reward”. (Holy Prophet)

The month of Ramadhan is called the “month of God” It strengthens the
relation between a man and his Creator. Think of a person abstaining
from necessities of life, like food and water (to say nothing of other
pleasures) 16 hours a day, for one month at a stretch; think again that
he does so not because of any external pressure, but by his own free
will; and remember that he expects no worldly reward and that his only
wish in fasting is to be nearer to Allah – and then you may appreciate
how strong is the relation between a Muslim and his Lord.

By fasting, a Muslim subjugates his worldly desires and strengthens his
spiritual powers. He learns a lesson most relevant to his spiritual
well-being; he comes to realize that nothing (not even his body and
soul) is his own. After this realization, he can appreciate the freedom
given to him by God in almost all walks of life during the past eleven
months.

He will know that he can never claim of that freedom of action as a
matter of right. It is just a grace of God for which he should ever
remain thankful to Him.

That appreciation will lead to gratitude, and that gratitude will show
itself in his behavior and deeds all his life, making him a trustworthy
friend and a lovable companion.

As the month of Ramadhan prepares a Muslim to become a perfect man, it
is called “the shield against the Hell”. Also, the Holy Prophet said:
“God says that fast is for me only and I Myself will give its reward”.
