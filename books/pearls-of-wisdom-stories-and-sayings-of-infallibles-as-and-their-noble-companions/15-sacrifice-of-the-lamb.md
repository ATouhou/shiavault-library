Just as the Prophet (S), and his companions landed from their rides, and
laid the loads down, it was decided that they would sacrifice a lamb for
dinner.

One of the companions volunteered: “I will sacrifice the lamb.”

Another: “I will skin it.”

Third: “I will cook it.”

Fourth: “ I will....”

The Prophet (S): “I will gather the wood from the desert.”

The group: “O Messenger of Allah, it is not becoming of you to
discomfort yourself as such. You rest. We will be honored to do all this
on our own.”

The Prophet (S): “I know that you are eager to do it all, but Allah
isn't pleased with the slave who disguinshes between himself and his
companions, and considers himself better than others.”

Then he went to the desert, and gathered some wood, and brought it to
the group.[^1]
