Wearing Ihram from Mecca
========================

Article 254
-----------

It has been mentioned before that the Miqat of Ihram for “Hajj
al-Tamattu’” is “Mecca”, and there is no difference between places in
Mecca. It is enough to be performed from Masjid al-Haraam, other
mosques, streets and avenues or houses and there is also no difference
between old and new Mecca, even places which have been advanced today to
Mena and Arafat, it is possible to wear Ihram from all of these places.
But it is obligatory precaution not to wear Ihram from places of Mecca
which are farther than “Masjid al-Tan’eem” (Masjid al-Tan'eem is the
closest boundary of Haram) and the best place is Masjid al-Haraam.

Article 255
-----------

The best time for wearing Ihram is the eighth day of Dhu’l-Hijjah, but
it is possible to do this three days before and go to Mena from there in
order to go to Arafat from that place; Old and ill persons can move to
that place sooner than this time if they are afraid or congestion of
crowd.

Article 256
-----------

The latest time of Ihram of Hajj is the time when delaying causes
impossibility of reaching Wuquf to Arafat which is from the noon of the
ninth day until the sunset; therefore, the pilgrim can become Muhrim in
the morning of the ninth day and go to Arafat on time (if it is possible
to reach on time in that conditions).
