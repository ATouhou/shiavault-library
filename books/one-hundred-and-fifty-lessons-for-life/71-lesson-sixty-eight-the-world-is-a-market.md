=========================================

الدُّنْيا سُوْقٌ رَبِحَ فِيها قَوْمٌ وَ خَسِرَ آخَرُونَ

Translation

The world is a market in which some gain and some lose. [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

This world is neither man’s main home, nor his permanent residence .
Rather it is a great house of commerce to which man is sent . He is
given a capital in the form of his life span , physical and mental
powers , guidance and intelligence , so that he may use these to
accumulate valuable provisions to take back for his eternal prosperity
and everlasting life.

Those who are active, diligent, vigilant, hard-working and far sighted
know the tricks of this great commerce. They do not relent for a moment
, always on the look out for opportunities to trade their temporary
worldly goods to earn precious heavenly goods, merchandise with an
eternal shelf life, and a bright destiny for themselves as well as their
society. Unlike the losers, they do not spend their capital on futile ,
transitory and destructive worldly pursuits which result in leaving the
world empty handed.
