yaqiniyat
---------

Certain or self evident data or premisses, i.e. propositions the truth
of which is open to direct inspection and requires no appeal to other
evidence, like the statement that "two contradictories cannot be
predicated of the same object at the same time" or that "a part is less
than the whole of which it is the part". See also al-ma‘qulat al-ula and
al-muqaddamat al-uwal.

yanfa‘il
--------

Lit. "to be acted on"; technically the category of "passion" as one of
the ten Aristotelian categories (al-maqulat al-‘ashr, q.v.) opposed to
the category of "action" (fi‘l, q.v.). See also ‘infi‘al.
