3. The Breathing of the Spirit (into man) (Nafkhu 'l-Arwah)
===========================================================

Abu Ja‘far says, concerning the Spirit in the Speech of Allah, the
Exalted:

***And I breathed into it of My Spirit [15:29],***

that it is, in this context, a created Spirit (ruh). He attributes it to
Himself in the same way as He attributes the House (Ka‘bah) to Himself,
although it is created by Him. Ash-Shaykh al-Mufid says: The reason for
attributing the Spirit or the House to Himself is not merely that they
were created by Him; but, also, that they have been distinguished by His
greatness and glory, and endued with His awfulness.

This indicates that this Spirit and this House are favored with His
sublimity and glory, which have not been granted to any other spirit or
house save them, thus to draw the attention of creation by this means –
to believe in and exalt them.
