46. The Defacto Case of the Noun and Adjective
==============================================

The Defacto Case of the Noun and Adjective in Arabic is**Nominative.** A
noun case is changed to**accusative** if it becomes an object of a verb
(There are other cases where a noun should carry the accusative case
marker. Check Kaana & Inna points). A noun is said to be in
the**genitive** case if it follows a preposition

or it is a second term of Idaafa. No matter what is the case of the
noun, the adjective will follow, marked by the same case.

The Egyptian man is in his house.           **الرجُلُ المِصريُّ في
بَيِتِهِ.**

I saw the Egyptian man.                         **شاهدتُ الرجُلَ
المصريَّ.**

I said hello to the Egyptian man.  **سلـَّمتُ علی الرجُل ِ المصريِّ.**
