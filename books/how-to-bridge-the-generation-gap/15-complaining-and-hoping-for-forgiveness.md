Complaining and Hoping for Forgiveness
======================================

The Father
----------

My child! Following our discussions in the past, I do not believe you
would ever mistreat, hurt or disobey us in any manner, shape or form.
Nor would you turn away from us in disgust. Whatever we tell you does
not come from mere carnal desires, but it is inspired by our love to you
and is in your interest. So, listen to us and do as we suggest so you
will find success and happiness.

The Child
---------

When I was a child, I was ignorant. Now that I am a young man, I am
suffering from pride. These two elements have prevented me from
fulfilling my obligations towards you and from pleasing you. If my
immature behaviour has caused you any hardship, or if I have ignored
you, I sincerely apologize. And I hope that you will forgive me, as the
great people do forgive. If parents do not forgive their children, then
who would? And if they do not excuse them, who would?
