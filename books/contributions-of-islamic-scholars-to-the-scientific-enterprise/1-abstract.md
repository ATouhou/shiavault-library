Abstract
========

*This paper presents a discussion regarding the role that Muslim
scholars played in the development of scientific thinking in the Middle
Ages. It argues that the Muslims were not just the preservers of the
ancient and Greek knowledge, but that they contributed original works to
the different fields of science. They were inspired by the Islamic view
of nature that is, mankind had a duty to ‘study nature in order to
discover God and to use nature for the benefit of mankind’. This
knowledge was transferred to Western Europe and subsequently played an
important role in revitalising a climate of learning and exploration in
Europe, leading to the Renaissance in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.*
