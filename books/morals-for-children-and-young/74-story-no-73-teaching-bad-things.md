Story no. 73: Teaching bad things.
==================================

The mother had an ill child.  
 She went to the doctor and got medicine from him.  
 But whenever she wanted to make him eat medicine,he used to shout and
cry.  
 With great difficulty and promises of buying toys, she managed to get
the medicine down his throat, but afterwards she did not fulfill her
promises.  
 Her two year old daughter, Zeenat said “Mother, it is not right that
you make promises to your son and not fulfill them. This is dangerous
for the future of the child because when he grows up, he is going to
learn bad things from you”.  
 The mother was pleased with her daughter’s guidance and encouraged her.

Yes O Parents! If you want your children to possess the morals of Islam,
then fulfill the promises made by you to your children, for this is an
order from the Holy Prophet (saw).
