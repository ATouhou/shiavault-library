***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

 Surah Al-Anfal contains seventy five verses. This Surah has been
revealed in Medina, (except its six verses). Its revelation occurred
after the revelation of Surah Al-Baqarah.

 There are some lessons in this Surah concerning the history of Divine
prophets and their followers, and also the manner of the Prophet of
Islam (S) in relation with Muslims.

 There are several subjects referred to in this Surah, such as: Treasury
of the Muslims, things taken as spoils of war, the Battle of Badr, the
ordinances of Holy Struggle, the night when the Prophet (S) was decided
to be snabed in his bed and Ali (as) laid in the couch of him
(Laylat-ul-Mabit), and the qualities of the true believers.

 Most of the verses of this Surah are about the Battle of Badr. It was
the first war of Muslims against the disbelievers. This war happened
after thirteen years of Muslims’ patience. In this war they enjoyed the
Divine helps and victory. That is why this Surah has also been entitled
‘Surah Badr’.

 Besides stating the affairs of the Battle of Badr, some specialties of
the virtuous soldiers against the enemies of Truth are stated in this
holy Surah.

The Virtue of Recitation of the Surah
-------------------------------------

Imam Sadiq (as) has said:

*“The one who recites Surah Al-’Anfal and Surah Al- Barā’at (with
attention to their meanings and their warnings) every month, will he not
be involved with hypocrisy at all and will be among the true followers
of Amir-ul-Mu’mineen (as)…”*
