Preface
=======

**In the Name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful.**

All Praise is due to He Who Created, without Himself having been
created.

I consider myself very fortunate at having been presented with the
opportunity of typesetting and the re-organisation of this book which
was first published by the P.E.T. publications of Pakistan.

The reason why this has been carried out is because the original
publication which was translated by Muhammad Ibrahim or Narowal in 1966,
was found to contain too many errors, so as to call for republication.

I have tried to use the original translation as far as possible, and
avoid the translator's explanation as much as possible in order to
present the translated version of the tradition, as I believe it should
have been.

I have been informed that P.E.T. has consented to have this book
republished, and I am very much thankful to them for that. May Allah
(swt) increase their heavenly rewards.

I would like to assure all parties that there is no financial motivation
behind this publication, and that it has been done solely for seeking
the pleasure of the Almighty.

I would also like to thank brother Amirali Lakha and brother Ibrahim
Rashid who allocated to me this task, for publication.
