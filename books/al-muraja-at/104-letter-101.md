Why didn't the Imam Cite the Ahadith of Caliphate and Wisayat on the Saqifa Day?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Rabiâ€™ al-Thani 10, 1330**

Truth has manifested itself; praise to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. There
remains only one last issue the nature of which seems to be disguised,
wrapped in obscurity. Please mention it to uncover its veil and make its
secret known. It is the fact that the Imam, during the incident of the
saqifa, did not cite any of the texts regarding the caliphate and
wisyat, to which you give so much attention, to al-Siddiq and the
allegiance to him; so, are you more familiar with such texts than he is?
Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*S*
