Hokm in the Holy Quran
======================

We begin first and foremost by stating clearly that, everyone should
understand and recognize that:

**Allah has a Judgment in every case, matter, dispute, question, and
every problem or conflict.**

The following Quranic verses testify to this truth:

***"Say: O Allah! Originator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the
unseen and the seen! Thou (only) judgest between Thy servants as to that
wherein they differ". [39:46]***

***"But Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection
concerning that over which they used to differ". [2:113]***

***"And if there is a party of you who believe in that with which am
sent, and another party who do not believe, then wait patiently until
Allah judges between us; and He is the best of the Judges". [7:87]***

***"And Allah decides; there is no adjuster of His decision. And He is
swift in account". [13:41]***

***"That is Allah's judgment; He judges between you, and Allah Knows,
Wise". [60:10]***

***"And that you should judge between them by what Allah has revealed,
and do not follow their low desires" [5:49]***

***"The judgment is only Allah's; He relates the truth and He is the
best of deciders". [6:57]***

***"Surely your Lord will judge between them by his judgment, and He is
the Mighty, the knowing". [27:78]***
