Part Three :islamic Ethics and Etiquettes
=========================================

Islam emphasises exceedingly on human ethics, and attaches significant
importance to social etiquettes, to the extent that Allah’s messenger,
peace be upon him and his pure family, identified the aim of his mission
as the completion, perfection and globalisation of noble morality
saying, “Indeed I have been sent to complete the noble morals”234.

And when Allah Almighty wants to praise His beloved Prophet, peace be
upon him and his pure family, He praises him by pointing to his noble
morals saying, .and surely you are of a mighty morality.235.

And when He wishes to remind the Muslim Ommah of the great mercy that
have been gifted to them, He reminds them of the most significant
attributes of this mercy, which is the Prophet’s lenient manners and
morals saying, [addressing the Prophet Muhammad] .it is by Allah’ mercy
that you are gentle to them.236.

These, and many other texts in this respect, point to the importance of
ethics and etiquettes – akhlaq & adab – in Islam, and the extent of
their requirement in a Muslim individual, such that when the Wise Qur’an
mentions some of the rulings of punishment, the sacred book follows them
with the mention of forgiveness, and accompanies them with moral/ethical
rulings, and considers forgiveness in them as being “closer to
piety”237.

234 Mostadrak al-Wasa\>’el, vol.11, p187
235 The Qur’an, The Pen, (68):4
236 The Qur’an, The House of Emran (3):159
237 In reference to such verses as 2:237.

**The Pillars of Morals and Etiquettes**

Islam made religion and piety the axis of ethics and etiquettes, and
identified four pillars for ethics and two for etiquettes, and invited
the Muslims to them and instructed them to adorn themselves with them.

**Ethics and their four Pillars**

The four pillars of ethics are:

1. Purity of the heart and the honesty of intention; On the
significance and vitality of the purity of the heart and its wellbeing,
and the honesty of intention and its sincerity Allah Almighty declares;
.the day when neither wealth nor sons shall profit, except for him who
comes to Allah with a sound heart.238 that is pure from polytheism,
disbelief, and from the unethical manners.

2. Beaming and smiling face;

In the hadith it is reported, “The believer has his happiness and
contentment upon his face and his sorrow in his heart”239. “The one who
is beaming and smiling gains [Allah’s] love and enters Paradise, and the
frown-faced is distanced from Allah and enters the Fire”.240

3. Beautiful and nice speech;

238 The Qur’an, The Poets (26): 88-89

239 Nahj al-Bala\>ghah, p533, hadith \#333; al-Ka\>fi, vol.2, p226,
Mostadrak al- Wasa’el, vol.8, p452

240 al-Ka\>fi, vol.2, p103, Wasa’el al-Shi‘ah, vol.12, p160, Mostadrak
al-Wasa\>’el, vol.8, p453

Almighty Allah says, .and ye speak kindly to people.241, and Amir
al-Mo’mineen peace be upon him said, “I dislike it for ye to utter
profanities”242.

4. Good dealing and beautiful living with the people; Almighty Allah
says; .keep to forgiveness, bid to what is honourable, turn away from
the ignorant.243, and the Almighty says; .and when the ignorant address
them they say ‘Peace’.244.

**The Two Pillars of Etiquettes**

As to the two pillars of etiquettes, they are: 1. Personal etiquettes,
which are related to one’s personal life such as the etiquettes of
eating, drinking, while asleep and awake, of wearing and housing, while
travelling and at home, of sickness and health, and suchlike that Islam
has taught the best of. Adhering to these etiquettes brings one closer
to every good and health, and distances one from every evil and
undesirable, rendering one happy and praiseworthy.

2. Social etiquettes, which are related to one’s social life such as
the etiquettes of living with the parents, the spouse and the offspring,
relative, friends and neighbours, the student and the teacher, and with
all the people – but rather with all beings, of which Islam has brought
the best teachings in these respects, the implementing of which
guarantees safety and peace, security and stability, harmony and
understanding, affection and kindness between all people, and all
mankind.

241 The Qur’an, The Heifer (2): 83
242 Nahj al-Bala\>ghah, p323, hadith \#206, Bih}a\>r al-Anwa\>r,
vol.32, p561
243 The Qur’an, The Heights (7): 199
244 The Qur’an, The Criterion (25): 63

**Distinctions of the Islamic Society**

The Islamic society is the society that adheres to the human ethics and
social etiquettes that Islam has brought forward, and so it is
distinguished from other societies by the following issues:

1. The Islamic society has a characteristic other than that of the
society we see today. For it enjoys – after the faith in Allah and the
Day of Resurrection – from the Islamic ethics and etiquettes, which
regulate the behaviour [of the individual] to the extent that no other
earthly system can.

And thus the very lofty and sublime human values will become widespread
throughout the society, whereas today’s world speaks of mankind in terms
of a mechanical tool, robbing him of all values of good and goodness.
Furthermore, in an Islamic society psychological complexities and many
of current problems will be extinct, while on the other hand confidence
and sociability will prevail, and love and affection will reign in both
individual and social terms.

2. Life, in all its aspects and dimensions, will blossom and prosper
under the just Islamic system, and thus the country will be revitalised,
houses built, the land farmed, the industries developed, trades expand,
the wealth grows, and the people will be enriched in an environment
wherein there is no wronging or oppression, no terror or violence, no
restrictions or conditions, no prison or torture, no suffering or
poverty.

It was for this reason that development, progress, love, and confidence
were commonplace when Islam was practically implemented, something that
the world today cannot find despite the substantial increase in the
means and facilities.

3. Every member of the Islamic society is a manifestation of Islam and
its teachings through his words and actions, caring for every member of
his community and his nation and being responsible for them, promotes
virtue and prohibits vice, invites to Islam and calls for a single
universal Islamic government .with wisdom and good advice, and reason.
for that .in the best manner.245.

**Islam and Ethics are Twins**

The essence of Islam and the reality of the Islamic religion is the
essence of the human moral ethics, and the reality of the lofty and
sublime social etiquettes. They are twins that may not separate, rather
they are one truth for one reality, since there is nothing that morality
encourages that Islam does not enjoin to, and nothing that the
etiquettes promote that Islam does not encourage and invite to.

So all laws and tenets of Islam and its lofty teachings, ranging from
acts of worship to transactions and suchlike are founded on lofty
ethical bases, and firm pillars of etiquettes, and as an outline we
shall mention briefly some of those that Islam has commanded as
obligatory, prohibited as forbidden, or warned as ethically undesirable,
or encouraged and called for amongst the etiquettes and morally ethical.
We will see that all of them are in harmony with the human nature,
concords with his soul and his spiritual values, but even with his body
and materialism . . . while being in the loftiest moral level, and
highest peak of human etiquettes.

**The Obligatory**

Almighty Allah states, .Surely Allah bids to justice and good doing and
giving to kinsmen.246, therefore it is mandatory for the Muslim

**The Prohibited Conducts**

Almighty Allah states, .Say: “Come, I will recite to ye what your Lord
has forbidden to ye”.258

Just as it is compulsory for the Muslim individual to learn his or her
obligatory duties and act upon them, it is also mandatory to learn the
prohibited matters and refrain from them, and henceforth we list here
most of the prohibited matters that are of common cause for concern:

**Beliefs**

• Not to believe in Allah.

262 It is haram for a man to look at a Muslim woman who does not wear

263 mah}ram relatives, in the case of the male, are those such as his
mother, sisters, nieces, and aunts. [In the case of the female, the
mah}ram relatives are her father, brothers, nephews, and uncles.]
Marriage is not allowed between mah}ram relatives and therefore a woman
does not wear h}ija\>b from her mah}ram relatives. Non-mah}ram relatives
are those such as cousins, brothers- or sisters-in-law, etc.
