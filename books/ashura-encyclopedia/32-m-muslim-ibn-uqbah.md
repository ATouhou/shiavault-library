M - Muslim Ibn Uqbah
====================

When the people of Madinah rejected the Ummayyads and fought them after
the tragedy of Karbala, Muâ€™awiyyah set up an army lead by Muslim Ibn
Uqbah to go and terrify the people of Madinah. Muslim went to Madinah
and killed thousands of the Prophet's (pbuh&hf) companions. He was later
known in history as Musrif because his name was contradicted his
actions.
