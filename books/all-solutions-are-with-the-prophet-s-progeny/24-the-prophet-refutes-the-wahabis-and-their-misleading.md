The Prophet refutes the Wahabis and their misleading
====================================================

There is no doubt that the Holy Qur'an has acknowledged intercession and
*tawassul* between Allah and His people, and not prohibited that nor
prevented His messenger from it. Rather, the Qur'an has made it
permissible and recommended it.

The Qur'an has made the Prophet’s deeds, sayings, and approving of
others’ deeds an example for us to follow in our lives, when saying:

***Certainly you have in the Messenger of Allah (S) an excellent
exemplar***. ***Qur'an, 33:21***

On this basis, we will take the Prophet’s doings and sayings as our
evidence. We shall not derive our evidence from the books of the Shia
nor from any of the books of the Sunni, for that shall be uncountable.
We shall be satisfied with what al-Bukhari has mentioned in his Sahih
alone, so that the answer to the Wahabis shall be by the knockout that
they may not argue with it, if they are fair. Otherwise, their obstinacy
and blind fanaticism shall expose them to all Muslims.

After we have proved the permissibility of *tawassul* from the Qur'an
and the Prophetic Sunna, we discuss what to the Wahabis is more defamed
and more deniable than *tawassul*; it is the asking the blessing of and
wiping one’s body against holy shrines and sacred places.

The Wahabis have reached an extent that they beat the hajjis for doing
so and accuse them of polytheism.
