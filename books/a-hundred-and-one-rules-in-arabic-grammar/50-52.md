52.  أيَّـةُ / أيُّ
===================

أيَّـةُ / أيُّ both mean “which” (as a question word). The first is used
for masculine while the second is used for feminine. The noun which
follows either one of them has to be in the genitive case. The
implication is that the two nouns create Idaafa. Please notice
that**أيَّـة ُ / أيُّ** carry the vowel of the original case of the noun
you ask about.
