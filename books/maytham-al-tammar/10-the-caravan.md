The Caravan
===========

Mu'awiyah bin Abu Sufyan died. His son Yazeed succeeded him. Yazeed was
a young man aged 30. He drank alcohol. He amused himself with the dogs
and the monkeys.

So, Imam Husayn [a] refused to pay Yazeed homage. Meanwhile, the Kufians
were tired of Mu'awiyah's persecution. Thus, they sent Imam Husayn [a]
many letters. In their letters, they asked the Imam to come to save them
from the Umayyad persecution.

The spies told Yazeed about the situation in Kufa. Yazeed had a spiteful
Christian doctor called Sergon. He asked the advice of the doctor.
Sergon advised him to appoint Ubaidullah bin Ziyad a ruler over Kufa.
