Abstract
========

This paper argues that traditional notions of the relationship between
religion and spirituality have actually resulted in the
compartmentalization of spirituality within the secondary religious
education curriculum. This has, too often, provoked disinterest from
students who have failed to find meaning, purpose and value in a subject
geared to cognitive learning.  An alternative integratral approach is
offered which  will reflect new ideas about consciousness and recognize
inner knowing, and will be grounded in the entirety of human experience
which extends beyond the positivistic, reductionistic, scientific
worldview of twentieth century education.
