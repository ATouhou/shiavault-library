11. The Ethos Of Prophet Joseph
===============================

Introduction
------------

Prophet Joseph is the son of Prophet Jacob who was born of a mother by
the name of Raheel (Rachel) 3556 years after the Fall of Adam. Joseph
metaphorically means an increase in blessings. Raheel died in Bethlehem
and Joseph was brought up by his aunt. After the death of his aunt,
Joseph came to live with his father, Jacob who was more kind to him than
the rest of his brothers. This was painful for the brothers. Joseph was
at the age of 12 when, one Friday night, saw in his vision that the sun,
the moon and eleven stars had come down to prostrate before him. When he
woke up, he told his father about the dream.

***"When Yusuf said to his father: O my father! Surely I saw eleven
stars and the son and the moon — I saw them making obeisance to me."
(12:4)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِذْ قَالَ يُوسُفُ لِأَبِيهِ يَا أَبَتِ إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ أَحَدَ عَشَرَ
كَوْكَبًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ رَأَيْتُهُمْ لِي سَاجِدِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Jacob said: Do not relate your vision to your brothers. However his
brothers came to know about it later and said: Yusuf and his brother,
Benjamin are dearer to our father than we. So they asked their father to
let them take Joseph out. They took him out, beated him and threw him
into a well. When Joseph came to at the bottom of the well, Gabriel came
to him saying: Don’t worry, you will reach a high position.

Three days later, a caravan heading for Egypt from Madyan arrived in
Jordan and halted near the well. The water drawer let down his bucket in
the well and on the order of Gabriel, Joseph sat in the bucket and came
out of the well, the water-drawer said:

***" O good news! This is a youth." (12:19)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا بُشْرَىٰ هَٰذَا غُلَامٌ ۚ
  </p>
</blockquote>

The head of the caravan rejoiced over the incident but Joseph’s brothers
came to know about it hence they hurried to Jordan saying: This is our
slave who has escaped. They forced Joseph to admit or he would be
killed. Joseph too admitted.

***“And they sold him for a small price." (12:19)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَشَرَوْهُ بِثَمَنٍ بَخْسٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

The caravan arrived in Egypt and after three days of rest, they took
Joseph to market, put him on a stool in the middle of the market and
began calling: Who is going to buy this lovely slave? Finally the king
of Egypt bought him and told his wife, Zoleikha to take care of him.

But one day, he was involved in a difficulty because of Zoleikha’s love
for him. She took him to a room and closed all the doors on him. Joseph
escaped from Zoleikha towards the closed doors which opened to him. At
this moment, the king arrived. Zoleikha went foreword saying: What is
the punishment for one who betrays you? A young child in cradle
witnessed to Joseph’s innocence saying: Joseph’s shirt is a proof of his
innocence, for it has been torn from behind showing that he had intended
to escape from Zoleikha and that she had tried to catch hold of his
shirt.

Women in Egypt started reproaching Zoleikha. So she sent for them, gave
each of them a knife and said to Yusuf to come forth. Seeing Yusuf, the
women cut their hands in amazement saying: This is not a mortal but a
noble angel. Zoleikha said: This is he for whose love you reproached me.
The women gave the right to Zoleikha for they themselves had the same
desire toward him. Joseph said:

***"My Lord! the prison house is dearer to me than that to which they
invite me." (12:33)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ رَبِّ السِّجْنُ أَحَبُّ إِلَيَّ مِمَّا يَدْعُونَنِي إِلَيْهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"There upon his Lord accepted his prayer." (12:34)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَاسْتَجَابَ لَهُ رَبُّهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Zoleikha started speaking ill of Joseph and called on the king to put
him in jail. And Joseph was imprisoned for seven years.

One night the king of Egypt had a terrible dream. In the morning, he
called all interpreters of dreams telling them about his dream. The
interpreters said:

***"Confused dreams, and we do not know the interpretation of dreams."
(12:44)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَضْغَاثُ أَحْلَامٍ ۖ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَأْوِيلِ الْأَحْلَامِ
بِعَالِمِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Eventually they referred to Joseph in prison to come to the king. Joseph
said: I will not leave prison unless my innocence is proved. Ask the
women who cut their hands about the story. When they took the women to
the king, they all witnessed to Joseph’s innocence Zoleikha too
confessed to her plan and she was divorced. Joseph was released from
prison and went to the king’s palace.

Joseph interpreted the king’s dream which indicated an imminent famine.
He offered a solution and was so favored that he became ruler of Egypt.
Rayyan who embraced Islam through Joseph asked the hand of Essent the
daughter of Fozifarah in marriage for Joseph. Mensi and Efraim are the
names of Joseph’s children. After the passing away of Rayyan, Joseph
remembered Zuleikha’s distress hence he married her and thanks to
Joseph’s favor, she became young again. Because of Famine, the children
of Jacob came to Egypt to seek help from Joseph. Joseph recognized them
and after a long story which can not be included in this short space,
they took Joseph’s shirt for Jacob who said:

***"Most surely I perceive the scent of Yusuf" (12:94)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنِّي لَأَجِدُ رِيحَ يُوسُفَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

To sum up, Judas cast it on Jacob’s face, he regained his sight.

One day, Jacob arrived in Egypt in full ceremonies and was warmly
welcomed by Joseph. They embraced each other and wept till they became
unconscious. They about 3666 years after the fall of Adam, at the age of
120.

His Modesty
-----------

One day Zoleikha said to Joseph: Raise your head, open your eyes and
have a look at me. Joseph said: I am afraid of going blind. She said:
How beautiful your eyes are! He said: These two are the first things
decaying in my grave. She said: What a good scent you have! He said: You
will escape from me if you smell my scent three days after my death. She
said: Why don’t you come near me? He said: I hope to be near my Lord.
She said: My carpet is silk. Then rise up and fulfill my desire. He
said: I am afraid that I lose my share of Paradise. She said: I will
have you Jailed and tortured. He said: My Lord will suffice me.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَتْ يَوْمًا: ارْفَعْ طَرْفُكَ وَانْظُرْ إِلَيَّ قَالَ: أَخْشَى
الْعَمى في بَصَري، قَالَتْ مَا أَحسَن عَيْنَيْكَ! قَالَ: هُمَا أَوَّلُ
سَاقِطٍ عَلى خَدّي في قَبْرِي، قَالَتْ: مَا أَطْيَبُ رِيحَكَ، قَالَ:

يَكْفِيني رَبّي.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Pardoning His Brothers
----------------------

When Joseph’s brothers said to him: By God! He has chosen you over us,
and we are in error, Joseph said: Don’t be ashamed today, for I forgave
you and God too has forgiven you and He is the Most Merciful.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ يُوسُفَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ لَمَّا قَالُوا لَهُ:( تَاللَّهِ لَقَدْ
آثَرَكَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا وَإِنْ كُنّا لَخَاطِئينَ) قَالَ: لا تَثْريبَ
عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ يَغْفِرُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَهُوَ أَرْحَمُ
الرّاحِمينَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

His Generosity
--------------

The holy Prophet said: Truly the generous son of generous son of
generous, is Joseph, son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham
(Greetings of Allah be upon them all)

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ: إِنَّ الْكَرِيمَ
ابْنَ الْكَرِيمِ ابنِ الْكَرِيمِ ابنِ الْكَرِيمِ يُوسُفُ بْنِ إِسْحقُ
بْنِ إِبْراهيمَ صَلَواتُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِمْ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

His Nomenclature
----------------

In Tha’alabi’s hagiology, it has been written that a wise man was asked:
What is the meaning of Joseph? He said: Assaf means grief and Assif
means servant. They were put together to mean Yusuf.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَقَالَ: الأَسَفُ في اللُّغَةِ الْحُزْنِ وَالأَسِيفُ الْعَبْدُ،
وَاجْتَمَعا فِيهِ فَلِذَلِكَ سُمِّيَ يُوسُفَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

His Mottos Written On Prison Walls
----------------------------------

When Joseph was being released from prison, he wrote the following on
prison wall: Here is the gravestone of the living ones, the house of
grieves, a place for testing the truthful ones and reproach of the
enemies.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَلَمّا خَرَجَ يُوسُفُ مِنَ السِّجْنِ كَتَبَ عَلى بَابِه: هَذا قَبْرُ
الأَحْياء وَبَيْتُ الأَحْزَانِ وَتَجْرِبَةُ الأَصْدِقَاءِ وَشَماتَةُ
الأَعْدَاءِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

When He Arrived In The King’s Palace
------------------------------------

When Joseph arrived in the king’s palace he said: My Lord will suffice
me of the world. My Lord will suffice me of the people. His praise is
great and there is no god save Him.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَلَمّا وَقَفَ بِبَابِ الْمَلِكِ قَالَ: حَسْبِي رَبّي مِنْ دُنْيَاي،
حَسْبي رَبّي مِنْ خَلْقِهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ ثَنَاؤهُ وَلا إِلَهَ
غَيْرَهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

When Joseph Came To The King Of Egypt
-------------------------------------

Just before coming to the king of Egypt, Joseph said: O God! I ask You
what is good to you from his good and seek refuge to You from his evil
and evil of others.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَلَمّا دَخَلَ عَلى الْمَلِكِ قَالَ: اللّهُمَّ إِنّي أَسْأَلُكَ
بِخَيْرِكَ مِنْ خَيْرِه وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّهِ وَشَرِّ غَيْرِهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

He Did Not Eat Fill During His Reign
------------------------------------

It has been reported that Joseph did not eat fill during his reign. It
was said to him: Will you remain hungry while the treasure of the earth
is in your hand? He said: I am afraid that I forget the hungry ones if I
eat fill.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَرُوِيَ أَنَّ يُوسُفَ كَانَ لا يَشْبَعُ مِنَ الطَّعَامِ في تِلْكَ
الأَيّامِ فَقِيلَ لَهُ أَتَجُوعَ وَبِيَدِكَ خَزَائِنُ الأَرْضِ،
فَقَالَ: إِنّي أَخَافُ إِنْ شَبِعْتُ أَنْ أَنْسى الْجَائِعَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Prison Or Sin?
--------------

When Zoleikha came to know about what the women said of Joseph and her,
she sent for them and prepared for them cushions to lean against, gave
each of them an orange and a knife to peel the orange with. Zoleikha
asked Joseph who was sitting in another place to come forth. So when
they saw him, they deemed him great, they cut their hands in amazement
and said: Refuge with Allah! This is not a mortal; this is but a noble
angel.

When that happened, they came to realize that they were in error.
Zoleikha said: This is he with respect to whom you blamed me, and
certainly I sought his yielding himself to me, but he abstained, and if
he does not do what I bid him, he shall certainly be imprisoned, and he
shall certainly be of those who are in a state of ignominy. Therefore,
Joseph preferred prison to sin saying! My Lord! the prison house is
dearer to me than that to which they invite me.

His Invocation In Well
----------------------

When Joseph was thrown into well, it was said to him: Take off your
shirt. While weeping, Joseph said: O my brothers, do you make me bare?
One of the brothers drew a knife, attacked him and said: If you do not
take off your shirt, I will kill you. He took off his shirt and the
brothers threw him into the well and went away. Turing to God, Joseph
said: O God of Ibrahim, Ishaq, and Yaqub, have pity on my weakness, for
I am helpless and underage.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

</blockquote>

Marrying Zoleikha
-----------------

When the king of Egypt passed away during the years of famine, Zoleikha
became poor and needy. People said to her: You should sit on the way of
king of Egypt (Joseph). Zoleikha said: I am ashamed of him, but people
insisted so much that she sat on the way of Joseph. At this time, Joseph
came to pass with all his glory. She rose up and said: Thanks God who
made king servants because of sin and made slaves kings due to their
piety. Joseph said to Zoleikha who was then an old woman: Aren’t you who
did such and such to me? Zoleikha said: O Prophet of God! Do not blame
me, for I was afflicted with three things no one was afflicted with:

1- There was no equal to you.
2- There was no equal to me in beauty and wealth in Egypt and
3- My husband was impotent.

Joseph said: Now, tell me what can I do for you? She said: I want you to
pray to God to give me back my youth. Joseph invoked the same. Hence
Zoleikha became young. Joseph married her while she was a virgin.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

  </p>
</blockquote>

In the book, Kamel by Ibn -Atheer, it is written that God gave two sons
by the name of Efraim and Mensha to Joseph and Zoleikha.

We can infer from this story that one of the praiseworthy acts of human
beings is to help the needy and fulfill their desire in the same way
that Joseph forgot all the wrong doings of Zoleikha and fulfilled her
desire.

Joseph’s Meal In Prison
-----------------------

It has been reported on the authority of Imam Sadeq that Joseph was in
prison, he had only bread as a meal. Hence, he complained to God asking
for a stew. This request was made while there were pieces of dried bread
with him. God told him to put the bread in a pot, add water and salt to
make a pleasant food. He did so hence water and salt became his stew.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

One Who Is Not Stranger (Lonely)
--------------------------------

When Joseph came out of the well and was sold, someone said: I advise
you to treat this stranger kindly. Joseph One who is with God is no
stranger (Lonely).

The Result Of His Patience And Piety
------------------------------------

When Joseph became the treasurer of the earth, the wife of the king of
Egypt said to him O Yusuf! Greed and lust make the kings slaves whereas
patience and piety make the slaves kings.

Joseph Feeds The Poor And Is Kind To Orphans
--------------------------------------------

It was said to Prophet Jacob said: In Egypt, there is a man who feeds
the poor and is kind to orphans. He said: He should be a member of our
household. When they made an inquiry, they found out that it was his son
Joseph.
