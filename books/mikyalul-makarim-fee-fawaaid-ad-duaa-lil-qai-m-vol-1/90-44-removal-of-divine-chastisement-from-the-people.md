44. Removal Of Divine Chastisement From The People
==================================================

Through the *Barakat* of the supplicant for our master, the Master of
the Time (aj), divine punishment will be removed from the people of the
earth. This matter is having two aspects:

First: At the end of *Hadith Qudsi* that we quoted previously from
*Oddatud Dai* He says:

“…they are such that when I want to destroy the world as punishment I
keep away chastisement from the people of the earth due to them.”

Second: In *Kamaluddin* through his own chain of narrators, it is
narrated from His Eminence, Abu Ja’far Baqir (as) that he said:

“A time will come upon the people when their Imam shall disappear from
their view. Blessed be those who remain firm upon our guardianship
during such times. The least divine reward that shall reach them would
be that the Almighty Allah shall call them and say: O My servants and
maidservants, you brought faith in My secret and believed in My unseen.
Then good news to you for My goodness and rewards as you are truly My
servants and maidservants. I shall accept your deeds, disregard your
faults and forgive your sins. And due to you I shall send rain to My
creatures and ward off calamities from them. If you hadn’t been there I
would have sent My chastisement upon them.”[^1]

The important point concluded from this quotation is that: Preparation
for and being regular in *Dua* for His Eminence, the Master of the Time
(aj) is cause of being steadfast on the practice of the Imams (as) and
in this way it is a means of getting this precious honor.
