Outside Ziyarat
===============

If you have not joined any group and you are on your own, then you can
hire a taxi to take you to all the outside Ziyarat and it will cost you
approximately SR50/SR70 for four passengers.

Masjid al-Shams
---------------

It is narrated that the Prophet (SAW) fell asleep on the laps of Imam
Ali A.S. just before Dhohar time till nearly Maghrib.

Imam Ali A.S. said his Dhohar and Asar Salaat sitting down. Near the
time of Maghrib, the Prophet woke up and pointed his finger at the
setting sun, which came up and the Prophet (SAW) prayed his Dhohar and
Asr Salaat.

In Iraq there is another Masjid called **Masjid-Radus-Shams** which has
got its name on a similar kind of story.

Masjid al-Zul Qibltayn
----------------------

Our previous Qibla was Bait-ul-Muqaddas. The Jews used to taunt the Holy
Prophet (SAW) that his followers did not have their own direction for
Salaat.

One day when the Prophet of Allah (SWT) was leading the Salaat
al-Dhohar, a revelation came to him after the second Rakaat to change
his direction of Salaat, from Bait-ul-Muqaddas to the Ka’aba.

Masjid al-Quba
--------------

This was the first Masjid that the Prophet of Allah (SAW) built on his
arrival from Makkah. It is narrated that the Prophet of Allah was heard
saying that if you say two Rakaats Salaat in this Masjid you will get
the Thawab of one Umra.

The Saba Saba Masjids
---------------------

This was the place where the battlefield of Khandaq was fought and these
Masjids were erected thereafter. There are 5 Masjid near each other. The
name Khandaq was given because Salman al-Farsee dug a very big trench
during this battle so that the army of the non-believers could not jump
over the trench. This was the battle strategy used in Iran where Salaman
al-Farsee’s native country.

Masjid al-Fatah
---------------

This Masjid is situated on the hilltop. It is narrated that the Prophet
of Islam stayed (in this tent) for three days in his tent and prayed for
the success of the Muslims.

Masjid Salman al-Farsi
----------------------

This Masjid is just at the bottom of Masjid al-Fatah. It is said that at
this Masjid the tent of Salaman al-Farsee was erected.

Masjid al-Ali A.S.
------------------

This Masjid is on the hill opposite to Masjid al-Fatah where

Masjid al-Bidi Fatimah Zehra A.S.
---------------------------------

This Masjid is at the bottom of Masjid al-Ali A.S. that was used by Bibi
Fatimah Zehra A.S. Unfortunately this Masjid is now closed – (when we
visited in December 1997).

Ohud – Hazrat Hamza A.S.
------------------------

The lion of Allah, Hazrat Hamza A.S. the uncle of the Prophet of Islam
is buried with many Shohada of Ohud here.

The Prophet (SAW) was heard saying that whoever does his Ziyarat and
does not do the Ziyarat of his uncle Hamza has been unfaithful to the
Prophet.

This is the place where the second Islamic war took place. At the
beginning of this war the Muslims were winning, but a group of archers
who were stationed at the entrance of the mountain to block the army of
unbelievers, left their position to go and loot the belongings of the
running away soldiers of the unbelievers, inspite of strict instructions
not to leave their position, thus the battle was almost lost.

It is also narrated during this battle Jibra’el brought the sword
‘**Zulfiqar’** from heaven because Hazrat Ali A.S. had broken many
swords.

During your stay in Medina, you should spend as much time as possible at
Masjid al-Nabawee and Jannat-ul-Baquee.

Medina/Makkah
-------------

**Our experience tells us that it is advisable to depart Medina after
Dhohar so (you arrive in Makkah) between Maghrib and Isha you arrive in
Makkah.**

If you have not joined a group and you are on your own then you will
have to hire a taxi which will cost you approximately SR500/SR600 to
take you to Makkah via Masjid al-Shajarah, our Meeqat, to do the Niyyat
of Ihram.

You must also make sure that the limo has a permit to take Hujjaj from
Medina to Makkah or else you will be turned back to Medina from the
checkpoint.

You are recommended to do Sunnat Ghusl of Ihram sometime in the morning.

**Niyyat: “I am doing Ghusl for the following, Sunnat**  
**Qurbatan Ilallah”. You cannot use scented soap when doing this Ghusl**

1. for wearing Ihram for Umra al-Mufradah

2. for entering into the Haram (Sanctified boundaries around Makkah)

3. for entering into the city of Makkah

4. for entering into the Masjid-ul-Haram

5. for doing Tawaaf of Khan al-Ka’aba
