The General Banquet
===================

This refers to the Divine banquet that every human being enjoys.  Rather
every created entity seeks advantage from its provisions.  Every entity,
both in its existence, as well as subsistence needs the All-Sufficient. 
Therefore, he always enjoys from the provisions of the All-Merciful.  
 The Holy Prophet (s) is reported to have said:  
  

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
...إِنَّ مَنْ فِي الدُّنْـيَا ضَيْفٌ، وَمَا فِي أَيْدِيهِمْ
عَارِيَةٌ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“…Surely the inhabitants of the earth are guests and whatever they have
at their disposal are loans…[^1]”

Similarly, Imām ‘Alī (‘a) says in one of his sermons:

 

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عِبَادَ اللٌّهِ إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَأْمُلُونَ- مِنْ هٌذِهِ الدُّنْـيَا
أَثْوِيَاءُ مُؤَجَّلُونَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“O servants of Allāh, surely your beings and what you aspire from this
world are guests (*athwiyā’*)[^2] for whom a time for departure has been
specified…[^3]”

Therefore the human beings, rather every dependent entity, is a guest of
Allāh (SwT).  Appreciating this, al-Bayātī in his *Adab al-Diyāfah*
says:  
  

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ألضيافة في الدين خُلق من أخلاق الله سبحانه وتعالى الذي استضاف مخلوقاته
في عالم الوجود بالمعنى الواسع للكلمة.  وهو يستضيف عباده كل يوم في
مملكته.  ويدعوهم إلى طيب أرزاقه...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Inviting a guest in religion is a trait among the traits of Allāh, the
Immaculate and Exalted, Who entertains His creatures in the world of
existence in the broad sense of the word.  He caters for His servants
every day in His Dominion, and invites them to His pleasant
sustenance…[^4]”

This kind of invitation is in reality a manifestation of Allāh’s
All-comprehensive Mercy (*al-Rahmah al-Rahmāniyyah*), about which the
Holy Qur’ān says:  
  

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَرَحْمَتِي وَسِعَتْ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“***…but My mercy embraces all things…***”[^5]
