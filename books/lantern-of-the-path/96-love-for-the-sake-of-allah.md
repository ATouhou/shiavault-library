Love for the Sake of Allah
==========================

   
 He who loves for the sake of Allah is beloved of Allah, and he who is
loved for the sake of Allah is also beloved of Allah, since each loves
the other for the sake of Allah. The Messenger of Allah said, 'Man is
with whom he loves. Whoever loves a bondsman in Allah, loves Allah. No
one loves Allah except he whom Allah loves.' And again, 'The best of
people after the prophets in this world and the next are those who love
each other for Allah.' Every love based on some cause other than Allah
brings about enmity except for these two, for they come from the same
source. Theirs always increases and never decreases. As Allah said,  
  

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الْأَخِلَّاء يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلَّا
الْمُتَّقِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***The friends shall on that day be enemies to one another except for
those who guard against evil,*** (43:67)

   
 because the root of love is being free of everything except the
Beloved.  
    
 The Commander of the Faithful said, 'The best thing in the Garden and
the sweetest is love of Allah, love in Allah, and praise for Allah.' And
Allah has said,  
  

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَآخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ لِلّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***The last of their supplication shall be "Praise be to Allah, Lord of
the worlds",*** (10:10)

   
    
 because when they see the blessings that exist in the Garden, love is
aroused in their hearts and then they call out, 'Praise be to Allah,
Lord of the worlds.'
