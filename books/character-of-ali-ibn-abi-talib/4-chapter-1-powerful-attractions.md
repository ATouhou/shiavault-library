Chapter 1 :powerful Attractions
===============================

In the introduction to the first volume of The Seal of the Prophets
(Khatim-a Payambaran), it is written concerning the topic of calls to
mankind:

"The \`calls' that have occurred among humanity have not all been the
same, and the rays of their effects have not been of (only) one kind.

"Some calls and systems of thought are one-dimensional, and proceed in
one direction; when they appear, they embrace a broad spectrum of
people, millions of people become adherents, but then after their time
comes to an end they close shop and are entrusted to oblivion.

"Some are two-dimensional, their rays spread out in two directions.
While they embrace a broad spectrum of people, and also progress for
some time, their range is not confined to the spatial dimension and also
extend into the temporal dimension.

"And some others progress in a multitude of dimensions. Not only do we
see them attract a broad range of people from human societies and
influence them and notice the effect of their influence on every
continent, but we also see that they embrace the temporal dimension,
that is to say, they are not confined to one time or era. They rule in
all their might century after century. Also, they take root in the
depths of the human spirit, and the very core of people's hearts is
under their authoritative control; they rule in the profundity of the
soul and take the reins of the emotions into their hands. This kind of
three-dimensional call is the exclusivity of the chain of the
prophets.

"What intellectual or philosophical schools of thought can be found
which, like the world's great religions, exert their authority over
hundreds of millions of people for thirty centuries, or twenty
centuries, or, at the minimum, fourteen centuries, and sink deep into
their innermost core."

Forces of attraction are also like this: sometimes one, sometimes two,
and sometimes three-dimensional.

'Ali's power of attraction was of the last kind. Not only did it
attract a broad range of human society, but it was also not limited to
one or two centuries; rather, it has continued and extended throughout
time. It is a fact that it lights up the pages of the centuries and
ages, it has reached the depth and profundity of hearts and souls, in
such a way that, after hundreds of years, when he is remembered and his
moral virtues are heard of, tears of longing are shed, and the memory of
his misfortunes is awakened to the extent that even his enemies are
affected and their tears flow. This is the most powerful of attractive
forces.

From here it can be understood that the link between man and religion
is not a material one, but rather of another kind, the like of which
link connects no other thing to the spirit of mankind.

If \`Ali had had no divine colouring and had not been a man of God, he
would have been forgotten. The history of man bears traces of many
champions, champions of speech, champions of knowledge or philosophy,
champions of power and authority and champions in the battle-field, but
all are forgotten by people, or else completely unknown.

But not only did 'Ali not die with his being killed, he became more
alive. He spoke well when he said:

Those who amass wealth are dead even when they are alive, but those
with knowledge will remain as long as the world remains. Their bodies
may have disappeared, but their images continue to exist in the hearts.
(Nahju' l-balaghah: Saying no. 47 )

He said about his own character:

Tomorrow, you will see these days of mine and unknown characteristics
of mine will be revealed to you, and after my place has been vacated and
someone else has occupied it you will know me." (Nahju 'l-balaghah,
Sermon no. 149 )

**Iqbal wrote**

My own age does not understand my deep meanings,My Joseph is not for
this market. I despair of my old champions,My Sinai burns for the sake
of the Moses who is coming.

Their sea is silent, like dew,But my dew is storm-ridden, like the
ocean.My song is of another world than theirs:This bell calls other
travellers to take the road.Many a poet was born after his death,He
opened our eyes when his own were closed,And journeyed forth again from
nothingness Like roses blossoming over the earth of his grave.

No river will contain my Oman My ,flood requires whole seas to hold
it.Lightenings slumber within my soul,I sweep over mountain and
plain.The Fountain of Life hath been given Me to drink,I have been made
an adapt of the mystery of Life.No one hath told the secret which I will
tell Or threaded a pearl of thought like mine Heaven taught me this
lore,I cannot hide it from my comrades. [^1]

In fact, 'Ali is like the laws of nature which remain unchanged by
time. He is a well-spring of munificence which is never dry, but which
rather increases day by day. In the words of Kahlil Gibran (Jubran
Khalil Jubran [1300/ 1883 - 1349/1931]), he was one of those
personalities who was born before his time.
