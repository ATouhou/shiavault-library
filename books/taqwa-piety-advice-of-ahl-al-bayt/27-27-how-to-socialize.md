27) How To Socialize
====================

If one wishes to treat people in the best way in society, he should, in
the words of Imam Ali (AS), behave in a way that if he dies, people will
weep for him and will miss him as if they have lost a brother or sister.
This is not possible without observing Taqwa in society. That is to say,
he should accept what God, His Messenger and the Imams have said for the
guidance of human beings. He should observe what should be and what
should not be to realize the teachings of God and His Messenger.
