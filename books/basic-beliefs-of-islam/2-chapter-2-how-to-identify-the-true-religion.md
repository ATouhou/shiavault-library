Chapter 2 :how To Identify the True Religion
============================================

**Is it not rational to test your faith?**

There are thousands of religions in the world.The major religions which
have a large number of followers are Judaism, Christianity,
Confucianism, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism,
Shintoism, and Sikhism.

How can we identify the true religion when the adherents of all
religions claim that their 's is the true one?

This is not difficult. One can search the true religion from the bulk
of religions if he is sincere in his research and investigation.

For instance, If you study all the major religions of the world, the
outcome of your unprejudiced research would be as follows:

A. Islam is the only religion which agrees with the human nature.

Allah's handiwork according to the pattern on which He has made
mankind: (30:30).

For example, The engineers always try to foresee student's concerns in
such areas as safety and the environment when they plan to design school
buildings. Similarly the laws of Islam are made by Allah Subhanahu taala
according to the pattern on which He has created the human beings and
the environment in which they were planed to live.

B. Islam is the only religion which never collides with any of the
cosmic laws.

He Who created the seven heavens one above another: Do you see any
fault in the work of Merciful? Turn up your eyes: Can you detect any
rift? Then look once more and yet again: your eyes will in the end grow
dim and weary. (67:3-4)

The perfect order and harmony in the vast space, visible and invisible
to us, following precise laws of motion, proves absolute unity and
supreme authority of a single creator.

The multiple laws of nature are closely connected with each other in
the continuous working of the universe. There is no gap, no overlapping
nor discontinuity. This phenomenon is one of the signs of the unity of
the creator. Thus, the laws of religion and laws of cosmos have the same
origin and therefore the question of collision does not arise.

C. Islam is the only religion which gives strong emphasis on pondering,
reasoning and rational thinking. Islam demands its followers to
understand the Holy Quran and then show its applications in practical
life. Quran has repeatedly advised the Muslims to ponder, to reflect and
to understand its message. Quran has made it very clear that it is
addressing to only those people who are intellectuals.

"Thus do We explain the signs in detail for those who understand
(7:32)
Thus do We detail our message for people who have knowledge (7:32)
Here are signs for people who are wise ( 30:28)
Verily there are signs for people who reflect (39:42)
Verily in this are signs for people endued with intelligence. (13:3)

Quran was revealed in Arabic which was the language of Arabs.
We have revealed (Quran) in Arabic so that you may understand (12:2)

Soon after the introduction of Islam in non-Arab countries, the people
of that countries translated it into their own language. Many people
learned Arabic just to understand Quran.

Christians and Jews who live in English speaking countries also needed
a translation of the Bible. But the first English translation of the
Bible appeared in the 1380's. Mar tin Luther translated Bible into
German language in 1534.

Why the Bible was translated so late into the language of the people?
Because the evangelists never allowed to arrange translations and
discouraged people to read it in their own language.

Similarly in Hindus, a special group of people known as Brahmans were
allowed to read the religious books.

D. Islam is the only religion which totally rejects blind following and
irrational arguments. This is a clear sign of a true religion. Quran has
condemned those people who follow the footsteps of their forefathers
without understanding.

E. Islam is the only religion which never imposes its beliefs on
someone to accept it whether or not it appeals to him. Islam demands
full understanding of the core concepts before one accepts it "there be
no compulsion in religion" (2:256)

There is no need of applying any kind of force or pressure on some one
to accept Islam. The logical teachings of Islam attracts people exactly
as magnet attracts iron by its innate nature .

"soon will We show them our signs in the Regions (of the earth and
heavens) and in their own souls, untill it become manifest to them that
this is the truth."(41:53) Thus, we know many people in the world who
have discovered the true religion by their sincere efforts. One such
great man was Salman Farsi.

Salman el-Farsi was born in Iran. All his family members and fellow
citizens were either Christians or Zoroastrians. Salman was also taught
by his parents the basic beliefs and principles of Zoroastrianism. But
Salman was not satisfied with Zoroastrism. Histor y tells us that Salman
accepted and rejected one religion after the other but remained
displeased until he met the Holy Prophet and embraced Islam. Salman was
extremely happy and satisfied after meeting the Holy Prophet and
discovering the true religion.

Similarly many Hindus, Christians, Jews and adherents of other
religions have accepted Islam after their sincere research. We have a
long list of such converts. Let me give you one example of our time.

Dr. Maurice Bucaille, a famous French surgeon of our times, is one of
them who has accepted Islam after his deep research in the Holy Quran.
Dr. Bucaille was a Christian by bir th. He wrote a book The Bible, The
Quran and Science in which he has scientifically proved that Islam is
the only true religion in the world.

Many other learned people have rejected their false religion but could
not procure the absolute truth. One such genius was Bertrand Russell. He
is ranked by the historians among the greatest philosophers and
mathematicians of the 1900's. He has also been called the most important
logician (expert in logic) since the ancient Greek philosopher
Aristotle.

Russell was a born Christian but rejected his faith in Christianity. He
wrote a book, Why I Am Not a Christian (1927), in which he has exposed
the irrationality of his former faith. Russell is an example of spoiled
genius. He had detected the falsehood but could not discover the truth.
The Basic rules of the Judgment.

Inability to live in harmony with nature
Perfect harmony with nature
False Religion
True Religion
Incompatibility with laws of nature
Unanimity with laws of nature

It is not difficult to ascertain the identity of the true religion and
to distinguish it from the false religion.

If we fairly examine the basic concepts and teachings of different
religions then we can choose the true religion and reject the untrue
religion. Following are the three basic rules of scrutinizing the
religion in order to identify the true and false nature of the
religions.

1- Compatibility with the Natural laws.
2- Unanimity with biological laws.
3- Comprehensive in contents.
Compatibility with the Natural laws.

The true religion will never clash with the laws of nature.

It is quite obvious. Because if the religion is from God, Who is the
sole creator of the universe, then there should not be any conflict
between the cosmic laws and the teachings of that religion, as both have
the same origin. A conflict will certainly arise between the principles
of religion and the natural laws working in the universe, if the
religion is not from The Master of the Universe, Who has made the laws
of universe.

Today, the basic structure of all religions, except Islam, has been
shattered by the bombardment of scientific researchers. The truth of the
Nature discovered by the scientists have nakedly exposed the falsehood
of fictitious religions.

The polytheistic religions preaching the worshipping of sun, moon,
stars, animals and thousands of other such gods can not survive now. The
edifice of polytheism has totally collapsed after the discoveries of
scientific truths. In 1969, the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 astronauts
landed on the head of the god (moon) of the polytheists. That was the
most shameful day for all the worshippers of moon, when one of their
gods was under the feet of man.

Science has dishonored almost all the gods of the polytheists by
disclosing their reality. The pioneer of modern scientific adventures is
Prophet Muhammad (sws), who cleared the space for moon landing 1400
years ago. History tells us how the Holy Prophet (sws) smashed the whole
structure of symbolic gods, which were being worshipped by people. A
sincere study can prove that all religions, except Islam, have a direct
collision with the established facts of science.

Dr. Maurice Bucaille has identified several scientific blunders in the
Bible. He has also certified that there is not a single scientific error
in the Holy Quran. Thus, scientific analysis of the religion is an
unbiased and reliable approach of identifying the genuine and false
religion.

Unanimity with the biological laws. Another important distinctive
characteristic of the true religion is that its basic principles shows a
complete unanimity with the biological laws of life. If the religion is
truly from God, Who is the creator of man, then the religious precept
must comply with the natural demands of human body. This rule also
invalidates all religions except Islam.

Islam is the only religion which not only allows but educates its
followers to take the maximum benefits from the Nature. The Halal and
Haram of Islam do not stop us to enjoy anything but regulate our natural
instincts to take the full advantage of the uncountable blessings of
Allah Subhanu taala. The Holy Quran has made it very clear in the
following verse. "Say: Who has forbidden the beautiful (gifts) of Allah,
which He has produced for His servants, and the things, clean and pure,
(which He has provided) for sustenance? Say:

They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and)
purely for them on the Day of Judgment"(7:32) In fact, Quran has
condemned those people who unnecessarily avoid halal things and make
their life miserable. However, Islam certainly demands from its
adherants to exercise self- discipline and avoid what is forbidden even
if it attracts them.

Eat clean and halal food that Allah has given you Avoid food that Allah
has forbidden for you

Adultery
Pork
Alcohol
Fruits
Meat
Marriage
Kills millions of people
Keeps Healthy & Fresh

Other religions either totally suppress the genuine demands of the body
and society or leave them totally free to exhaust their precious energy
in the abundance of vast Nature. A few examples of this kind are being
cited here to show a marked difference between the Divine religion and
man-made laws.

**Celibacy**

Celibacy means to refrain from lawful sexual relations for religious
reasons, i.e., not to mar ry for the sake of God's pleasure.

Christian and Buddhist monks and nuns view celibacy as a religious
ideal. By law, all Roman Catholic priests must remain celibate i.e. they
must remain unmarried throughout their lives. In Eastern Churches,
married men can become priests, but bishops must practice celibacy. One
can ask a valid question: why the pope, bishops, nuns, who also have the
natural sexual desires like other human beings, are not allowed by the
religion to marry ?

If marriage displeases God, then why has He created the whole system of
sexual reproduction? Why all living creatures including humans have been
created by God with special sex organs to perform the sexual act?

If God does not approve of sexual relations for men and women, then why
the basic process by which God has created more and more humans entirely
depends on sexual relationship. The reproductive systems of males and
females in humans and in other kinds of living species have been
specially designed by God to produce, nourish, and develop their
respective offspring.

If the ideology of celibacy were to be an ideal example to be followed
by mankind as a manifestation of their devotion towards God, then it
would seriously repress the Divine Scheme of creation.

If all the adherents of Christianity follow the lifestyle of Pope, who
must be regarded by his followers as the most ideal person, then the
whole Christian world would be wiped out within one generation. Also,
all Christians recognize Hazrat Ibrahim (as), Hazrat Musa (as) and many
other prophets as messengers of God. All these prophets had wives and
children. Thus, this religious practice of Christianity and Buddhism
brings a direct collision with God's plan and His mechanism of
pro-creation. This is an antithesis of Divine Religion. Islam not only
allows the marriage institution but puts special emphasis on it.

The Holy Quran says;

"Marry women of your choice". (4:3) The Holy Prophet (sws) has shown
disapproval of remaining unmarried or delaying marriage unnecessarily.
The Prophet has said :

"Marriage is my sunnat whosoever diver ts from my sunnat is not of me."
There are many other hadith of the Holy Prophet (sws) and Imams to this
effect.

**Slaughtering of animals**

Similarly, Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists do not eat meat and consider
slaughtering of animals for their meat as cruel and inhuman. We can
analyze it rationally whether slaughtering of animals is cruelty or
not.

We know that there are many animals that eat chiefly meat (Carnivos).
Such animals have an inborn tendency and biological make-up to prey on
plant-eating animals (herbivores). God has given these animals extremely
sharp bladelike shearing teeth, strong jaw muscles and other necessary
facilities of hunting. If hunting, slaughtering and eating of meat is a
cr uel and barbarous act then why the Most Kind and Merciful God has
created carnivores which can not eat anything except meat.

Millions of goats, sheep and cows are being slaughtered every day for
eating purposes. But there has never been any shortage of these halal
animals.Thus, eating meat can not be regarded as a barbaric act.
However, Islam stresses on moderate eating of animals meat and strictly
maintains regulation regarding the welfare of all living species.

**Comprehensiveness of the religion**

Lastly, the true Divine religion can easily be recognised by its
ability to guide the mankind in each and every sphere of his life.

The war between Islam and the adherents of all other religion is on the
issue of comprehensiveness of Islamic teachings.

They argue that religion is a private thing and it should not come out
to inter fere with the social and official works. Several times a
practicing Muslim encounters such provoking remarks; Don't bring your
religion in office, please keep it in the mosque or in your house. These
people do not know one basic thing about Islam and that is the
comprehensive nature of Islam. Unlike other religion, Islam covers each
and every aspect of human life and therefore demands its followers to
observe its teaching in every sphere of their life.

Thus, a careful analysis of religions can help every person of rational
thinking to differentiate between the true and untrue religion

**CORE CONCEPT**

The aim of this lesson is to enable you to identify your faith in a
rational way. Blind following and inheriting the father's religion
without real understanding of the faith has no value in Islam. The
primary criterion of Emaan laid down by the Holy Quran is: to testify
and intellectually recognize the basic contents of the faith. The
fulfillment of this basic condition demands sincere efforts to acquire
useful knowledge and to do some research. This is why, acquisition of
knowledge is compulsory for every male and female Muslim.
