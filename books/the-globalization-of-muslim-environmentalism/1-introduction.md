[Introduction]
==============

Islam is a religion that was born in the desert, and as such the first
Muslims seem to have had a keen sense of the fragile balance that
existed in the harsh ecosystem that made their lives possible. This
awareness is abundantly reflected in the Qur’an, which contains many
references to water and other vital natural resources and lays down
clear guidelines for their conservation and equitable distribution.

The Islamic legal tradition, devised from the eighth to tenth centuries
on the basis of the Qur’an and hadiths (reports about the words and
deeds of the Prophet Muhammad), spells out in detail the
divinely-prescribed parameters for the use of natural resources,
including water, soil, air, plants and animals. As in the Qur’an,
conservation and fair distribution are emphasized. Moreover, like
everything in Creation, resources are seen foremost as belonging not to
humans but to Allah, for whom humans are to hold nature in trust
(*amāna* ).
