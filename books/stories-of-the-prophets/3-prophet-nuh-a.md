Prophet Nuh (a)
===============

After many years Adam

had grandchildren and even

great grandchildren.

There were now lots of

people on earth.

Many of them obeyed Allah

but some were not so good

and did just what they

wanted to do all the time.

This made Allah very unhappy.

Allah chose Nuh,

a good man, to tell the

people that what they

were doing was wrong.

But they wouldn't listen

to him and carried on

doing bad things.

Allah decided that

all the naughty people

should be punished.

He told Nuh to build

a big ark near

his house.

Nuh quickly got busy

choosing good wood and

building it up into a

fine ark.

A lot of people laughed

at him but he did not

take any notice of them,

because Allah had told

him what to do.

When he had finished,

he put lots of food

into the ark and collected

the good people together.

They also took lots of

animals with them

into the ark, two

of every kind.

One day, all of a sudden,

the sky went very dark

and it started to rain.

Lightly at first, then

more and more heavily. Soon

there was water everywhere.

The bad people were not

laughing any more. They

were frightened because

they had no shelter

from the water.

Only the good people

in the ark were

safe and dry.
