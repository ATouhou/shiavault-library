108: Plenty (kawthar)
=====================

This is the shortest chapter in the Qur'an consisting of only three
verses, like [Divine! Support 110; however in this case the message is
expressed in fewer words. These 3 Meccan verses were revealed after The
Chargers 100 and before Competition 102.

The title is the name of a legendary river which flows through Paradise;
its water is reserved exclusively for !0d!fearing Muslims. It is sweeter
than honey, whiter than milk and smoother than cream. This lyric chapter
gives added consolation to the Prophet during his early Persecution.
