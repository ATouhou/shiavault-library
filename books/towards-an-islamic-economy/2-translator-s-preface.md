Translator's Preface
====================

***"... and it is not (lawful) for us to associate aught (anything/
anyone) with God; This is by God's grace upon us and on mankind, but
most people give not thanks." (The Qur'an, 12:38)***

Great thanks and mercy to Allah, that with His help and the leadership
of Naeb-el-Imarn Khomeini, the Muslims of Iran could rid themselves of
the oppressive regime of the Shah, and replace it with a dynamic Islamic
Republic.

Peace be upon Ayatullah Sayyid Muhammad Baqir As-Sadr and his brave
sister, who became Martyrs under the Iraqi Bathist Regime's torture.

Praise be to God that in the salutary conditions of the Islamic Republic
I have succeeded in translating "An Introduction to the Principles of
Islamic Banking" by Ayatullah Baqir As-Sadr earlier, and I have now
endeavoured to translate this book by the same author into English.
Thus, in a small way I have taken a step in introducing Islam to our
English speaking Muslim brothers and sisters.

With every hope for victory of Muslims against all oppressors.
