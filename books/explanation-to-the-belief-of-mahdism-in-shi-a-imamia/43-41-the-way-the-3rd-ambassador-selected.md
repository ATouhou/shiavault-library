41. The Way the 3rd Ambassador selected
=======================================

It might be felt that the appointment of one ambassador depends upon the
recommendation of his predecessor to the Imam or with a consensus of the
Shia scholars or clergy. As the previous one appoints the new one. Such
an air of conception hangs around the third ambassador Husayn Bin Rooh.
But, the reality is something else. It is the direct choice of the Imam
himself; an immediate selection by himself alone.

It was not a contract or agreement between the persons or parties. Since
the man was appointed by the person of Imam Mahdi himself, the appointed
one was highly respected and revered among the people - commons and
dignitaries. It was a commonly known fact that the ambassador was the
Imamâ€™s choice and in contact with him. Had it been otherwise, such men
of repute such as Abu Suhail Nou Bakhti, Ibn Mateel, Hasan Bin Jana
Nasibi would have disputed and never obeyed the ambassador.
