The Dress of Ihram
==================

**Question:** Why it is necessary that the cloth of the Ihram should be
such that is not worn usually and should be unstitched?

**Answer:** Hajj is a social worship, which should be performed with
complete independence. To keep this purpose in mind during Hajj wearing
of a two piece of cloths is enough, and prohibition of wearing casuals
and formal dresses is there because they are distinguishing and create
differences and sometimes are signs of pride and show-off and thus this
desire of the human beings has come out practically, that one day the
human beings will have to remove all the factors of pride and show off.

In other words, Hajj in the eyes of Allah is the best way of showing
that human beings are equal and thus it is necessary to remain aloof
from all the formal and casual clothes, due to which differences arise
and they should wear two pieces of clothes and all people should look
alike in this grand ritual.
