***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

The holy Prophet (S) in a tradition said:

*“The one who recites Surah Al-Qasas will be given ten rewards as many
as the number of all those who assented Moses and those who rejected
him, and there is no angel in the heavens and the earth but he will
attest to his rightfulness in Hereafter.”*[^1]

Imam Sadiq (as) in another tradition says:

*“The one who recites suras Al-Qasas, An-Naml, and Ash-Shu‘ara by the
night before Friday, he will be of the friends of Allah, will be nigh to
Him, and will be supported by Him; and in this world he will not
encounter a sever poverty, insecurity and disquiet, and in Hereafter
Allah will bestow on him so much merits that he will be pleased and even
more than being pleased.”*[^2]

It is evident that all of these rewards will be given to the one who, by
reciting this Surah, tries to be in the row of Moses (as), the true
believers, and those who struggle against the wrongdoers such as Pharaoh
and Korah.

When confronting the difficulties, he must not knee before the enemies
and accept the disgrace of submission, for all these many rewards are
not given to anyone cheaply. They are specified to those who usually
recite the Surah, contemplate its content, and fulfil them accordingly.
