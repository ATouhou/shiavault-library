Does This Verse Point Towards the Artificial Means of the Present World?
========================================================================

**Question:** In Surah Nahl the Almighty Allah, while pointing towards
the creation of quadrupeds whom humans are using for transport and
riding, states in this way:

And (He made) horses and mules and asses that you might ride upon them
and as an ornament; and He creates what you do not know. [Surah Nahl
16:8]

***He creates what you do not know*** are the means of transport and
commutation of the present day?

**Answer:** Our writers of Quranic exegesis in giving tafseer of this
verse have expressed possibilities about two things. One is the things,
which we do not know by creation of these it is meant to be the vehicles
of travel of the present world and those other artificial means about
which the people of those days had no knowledge. The corroboration of
this possibility is also done by ***that you might ride upon them***.

The second possibility is that this verse means those living and
existing creatures, which are created in jungles and in the deep seas
and other far-flung areas, they were hidden from the sights of men in
those days.

On the basis of each of the two possibilities this verse is having
miraculous aspect because it informs about those existing things, which
were hidden from the eyes of man of that period. With the progress of
science they came to be known afterwards.
