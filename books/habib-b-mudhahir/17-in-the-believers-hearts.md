In the Believers' Hearts
========================

Today Muslims all over the world go to Karbala to visit Imam Husayn [a].
In the distance, they can see a high gold dome and high minarets.

When a Muslim enters the holy shrine full of perfume, he will find a
tomb near Imam Husayn's tomb. That tomb belongs to Habib bin Mudhahir,
Bani Asad's leader, and the master of the loyal.

The visitor to Imam Husayn [a] must greet his companion and say:

*Peace be upon Habib bin Mudhahir al-Asady.*
