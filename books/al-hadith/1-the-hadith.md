The Hadith
==========

The Hadith is the record of the sayings of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). The
sayings and conduct of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) constitute the Sunnah.

The Hadith has come to supplement the Holy Quran as a source of the
Islamic religious law. The Hadith is the second pillar after the Quran
upon which every Muslim rests his faith. Hadith consists of Mat'n and
Isnad. Mat'n means the text of the Hadith, while Isnad means the chain
of transmitters to that Hadith.
The scholars of the Hadith literature divided the Traditions into
categories according to the degree of authenticity and reliability, each
category had to meet certain criteria.

The categories are as follows:

1. Sahih: The genuine Traditions, the authentic ones.
2. Moothaq: Almost like the Sahih but the narra tion is not as strong
as those of the Sahih.
3. Hasan: The fair Traditions although inferior in matter of
authenticity.
4. Dha'eef: The weak Traditions which are not so reliable.


In Shari'ah (Islamic Constitution) deeds and actions are divided into
five classes:

1. Fardh or Wajib: An obligatory duty the omission of which is
Islamically punishable.
2. Mus'tahab: An action which is rewarded, but whose omission is not
punishable.
3. Mu'baah: An action which is permitted but legally is indifferent.
4. Mak'rooh: An action which is disapproved by the Shari'ah but is not
under any penalty.
5. Haram: An action which is forbidden, and Islamically punishable1.

**THE FORGED (FABRICATED) HADITHS**

1. History of Fabrication:

a. During Benu Umayya's Rule.
b. During Benu Abbas' Rule, in particular with the advent of the
schools of thought in Islam.

2. By the year 200 H.: Total of 600,000 Hadiths were in existence, out
of which 408,324 Hadith were fabricated Hadiths by 620 forgerers2.

3. Most Notorious Forgerers: Ibn Jundub, Abu Bukhtari, Ibn Basheer,
Abdullah Al-Ansaari, Al-Sindi. Ibn Au'jaa professed before he was hanged
that he alone had forged 4,000 Hadiths3.

4. Reason to Fabricate:

a. Financial incentive by the Khalifas, for example Mu'awiya awarded
Ibn Jundub and others hundreds of thousands of dinars for coming forth
with Hadiths that suited him4.

b. As a means of self-promotion in the government.

c. In a drive to enhance a particular school of thought.

d. Fanaticism for a school of thought at the expense of others5.

5. Al-Qassassoon (The story-tellers): Their operation and major role in
the public.
