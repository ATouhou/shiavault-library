The Honour and Sanctity of the Believers
========================================

No one respects the honour of the believers except the person who
respects the honour and sacred claim of Allah over the believers. The
person who best fulfils this sacred claim with respect to Allah and His
Messenger is he who is the most particular in his respect for the
believers' claim to honour. Whoever thinks little of the believers'
honour has rent apart the raiment of his belief.

The Holy Prophet said, 'Part of esteem for Allah is to respect those
who are near to Allah in belief.' And again, 'Whoever is not merciful to
a young person nor respectful to an old person is not one of us. Do not
call a Muslim an unbeliever when repentance can make up for it, unless
he is someone that Allah has mentioned in His Book.'

Allah said,


<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ فِي الدَّرْكِ الأَسْفَلِ مِنَ النَّارِ وَلَن
تَجِدَ لَهُمْ نَصِيرًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

Occupy yourself with your business about which you will be
questioned.
