Fatima’s Seeking for Justice:
=============================

Fatima (peace be upon her) was just, because she loved the right, and
was firm in her way. She shared the chores of the house with Fezeh and
regarded equality with her maid servant. She was also just in speech,
because she knew justice as the real basis of the stability in the
social system.

Throughout her life, she attacked the leaders of oppression and
discrimination. She invited the people towards the government of
justice.

Fatima (peace be upon her) was just and seeking for justice. She
attacked the bandits of thought and reason, those who had prevented the
people from thinking, had destroyed the thought and rationalism, had
blocked the people’s real way of thinking, and divested the people of
their real rights….

On the way of seeking justice, she had got a special kind of rationality
and reasoning in which there was no smell of sensation and prejudice,
and under its protection, she revealed the real nature of the Caliphs.
She was sacrificed for the sake of justice and right seeking. She
upraised for her husband, not because that Ali (peace be upon him) was
her husband, but due to the fact that he was right, and appointed by
Allah, the Almighty. It is believed that even if Ali (peace be upon him)
were not Fatima’s husband, Fatima (peace be upon her) would upraise for
him.
