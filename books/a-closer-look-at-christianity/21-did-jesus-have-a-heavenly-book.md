Did Jesus have a heavenly book?
===============================

Yes. God sent down to Jesus the In-jeel (the gospel). The book is
non-existent today, and the Bible that we have today is authored by
people who came after Jesus (P.B.U.H.). The proof is simple: none of the
books in the Bible is named after Jesus (the book of Luke, John, and so
forth). All the books were written by people other than Jesus the
prophet of God. It is a known fact amongst scholars that not a single
word in the Bible was instructed to be written or written by Jesus
himself during his time on earth. The Bible was written after Jesus was
risen.
