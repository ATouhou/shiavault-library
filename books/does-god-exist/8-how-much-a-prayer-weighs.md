How Much a Prayer Weighs?
=========================

A poorly dressed lady with a look of defeat on her face, walked into a
grocery store.

She approached the owner of the store in a most humble manner and asked
if he would let her charge a few groceries. She softly explained that
her husband was very ill and unable to work, they had seven children and
they needed food. The grocer scoffed at her and requested that she leave
his store.

Visualizing the family needs, she said: "Please, sir! I will bring you
the money just as soon as I can." He told her he could not give her
credit, as she did not have a charge account at his store.

Standing beside the counter was a customer who overheard the
conversation between the two. The customer walked forward and told the
grocer that he would stand good for whatever she needed for her
family.

The grocer said in a very reluctant voice, "Do you have a grocery
list?"

She replied, "Yes sir" "OK" he said, "put your grocery list on the
scales and whatever your grocery list weighs, I will give you that
amount in groceries." She hesitated a moment with a bowed head, then she
reached into her purse and took out a piece of paper and scribbled
something on it.

She then laid the piece of paper on the scale carefully with her head
still bowed.

The eyes of the grocer and the customer showed amazement when the
scales went down and stayed down. The grocer, staring at the scales,
turned slowly to the customer and said grudgingly, "I can't believe
it."

The customer smiled and the grocer started putting the groceries on the
other side of the scales. The scale did not balance so he continued to
put more and more groceries on them until the scales would hold no
more.

The grocer stood there in utter disgust. Finally, he grabbed the piece
of paper from the scales and looked at it with greater amazement. It was
not a grocery list; it was a prayer, which said: "O' God! You know my
needs and I am leaving this in Your hands."

The grocer gave her the groceries that he had gathered and stood in
stunned silence. The lady thanked him and left the store. The customer
handed a fifty-dollar ($50) bill to the grocer and said, "It was worth
every penny of it." Only God knows how much a prayer weighs.


**Pray to Almighty God**

The holy Qur'an says:

"And when affliction touches a man, he calls on Us, whether lying on
his side or sitting or standing; but when We remove his affliction from
him, he passes on as though he had never called on Us on account of an
affliction that touched him". (10:12 )

Almighty brings problems so that we may establish contact with Him, but
some people even don't do this, even if they are faced by problems as we
can from the following story. Why So Much Pain and Suffering in the
World?

A man went to a barbershop to have his hair cut as always. He started
to have a good conversation with the barber who attended him. They
talked about so many things on various subjects.

Suddenly, they touched the subject of God. The barber said: "Look man,
I don't believe that God exists as you say so." "Why do you say that?"
asked the client.

Well, it's so easy; you just have to go out in the street to realize
that God does not exist. Oh, tell me, if God existed, would there be so
many sick people? Would there be abandoned children? If God existed,
there would be neither suffering nor pain. "I can't think of a God who
permits all of these things."

The client stopped for a moment thinking but he didn't want to respond
so as to prevent an argument.

The barber finished his job and the client went out of the shop. Just
after he left the barbershop, he saw a man in the street with a long
hair and beard (it seems that it had been a long time since he had his
cut and he looked so untidy). Then the client again entered the
barbershop and he said to the barber: know what? "Barbers do not
exist."

"How come they don't exist?" asked the barber. "Well I am here and I am
a barber." "No!" The client exclaimed! "They don't exist because if they
did there would be no people with long hair and beard like that man who
walks in the street."

"Ah, barbers do exist, what happens is that people do not go to them."
"Exactly!" Affirmed the client. "That's the point. God does exist, what
happens is people don't go to Him and do not look for Him that's why
there's so much pain and suffering in the world."

(D) Dua with Congregation (Jama' ah):

Dua of a congregation is better than an individual's Dua. The people
should get used to praying together.

Imam Ja'far Sadiq (p.b.u.h.) says: "If 40 people gather together and
pray, Almighty shall certainly accept at least one man's Dua". Some
people in the congregation may be good and sincere, and because of them,
Dua of all the rest shall be accepted.

The Ship: Our blessings Are the Fruits of Other prayer A voyaging ship
was wrecked during a storm at sea and only two of the men on it were
able to swim to a small, desert like island. The two survivors, not
knowing what else to do, agreed that they had no other recourse but to
pray to God. However, to find out whose prayer was more powerful, they
agreed to divide the territory between them and stay on opposite sides
of the island.

The first thing they prayed for was food. The next morning, the first
man saw a fruit- bearing tree on his side of the land, and he was able
to eat its fruit. The other man's parcel of land remained barren.

After a week, the first man was lonely and he decided to pray for a
wife. The next day, another ship was wrecked, and the only survivor was
a woman who swam to his side of the land. On the other side of the
island, there was nothing.

Soon the first man prayed for a house, clothes, and more food. The next
day, like magic, all of these were given to him. However, the second man
still had nothing.

Finally, the first man prayed for a ship, so that he and his wife could
leave the island. In the morning, he found a ship docked at his side of
the island. The first man boarded the ship with his wife and decided to
leave the second man on the island. He considered the other man unworthy
to receive God's blessings, since none of his prayers had been
answered.

As the ship was about to leave, the first man heard a voice from heaven
booming, "Why are you leaving your companion on the island?" "My
blessings are mine alone, since I was the one who prayed for them," the
first man answered. "His prayers were all unanswered and so he does not
deserve anything."

"You are mistaken!" the voice rebuked him. "He had only one prayer,
which I answered. If not for that, you would not have received any of my
blessings."

"Tell me," the first man asked the voice, "What did he pray for that I
should owe him anything?"

"He prayed that all your prayers be answered." Hence, for all we know,
our blessings are not the fruits of our prayers alone, but those of
another praying for us. Beg not from the Beggars: It is Allah (SWT) who
is the Emperor of all emperors on this earth.

Once Akbar, the Emperor of India was riding his horse in the
countryside of Agra, he felt hungry and asked a peasant for some food.
The peasant believing him to be an ordinary traveler brought some food
and cold water and did his best to make his stay in the house
comfortable.

When the mighty Emperor was refreshed and was ready to leave, he told
the peasant: My good man, I am the Emperor of India. If you are ever in
need of any assistance, please come to my palace in Agra without any
hesitation.

I am pleased by your hospitality and will be glad to be of help to you
in every way I can?

After some time, the peasant fell on hard times. Famine had set in his
village and food was hard to find. There was no work for the farmers.
The peasant remembered the words of the Emperor; he decided to go to
Agra and asked for an interview with Akbar, the Emperor of India.

Peasant was immediately ushered into the Emperor's private chambers,
where he found to his astonishment that the Emperor of India who had
just finished his prayers was supplicating to Allah (SWT), and with
raised hands was begging Allah (SWT) numerous favors for himself, his
family and his subjects. Soon, the Emperor fi

nished his prayers and his eyes fell on the peasant who was waiting to
meet him. Emperor recognized him immediately as the same man who had
attended to his needs during his journey to the countryside.

The Emperor greeted him warmly and had him seated by his side, and
humbly asked him if there was anything that he could do for him? O
mighty Emperor, said the peasant. Will you please tell me what were you
doing just now?

Why not certainly? Akbar, the Emperor of India said, I was asking from
Allah (SWT) help in solving many difficulties that I face while ruling
my great empire, and for His aid in keeping my kingdom in peace.

Peasant said: Thank you very much, O mighty Emperor. Now, I seek your
permission to travel back to my village. The Emperor was astonished at
the reply of the peasant. He said, why? What's the matter? He exclaimed.
Did you not come here to ask for my help?

The Peasant answered him politely, but in a determined manner: O mighty
Emperor of India, I have learnt a great lesson today! I will beg at the
same door as the One before which you were begging.

For my Lord, though you are the greatest among all the kings of India,
I find that you are a poor beggar. And, for me to beg favors from a
beggar would bring me disgrace from the Almighty who is the Emperor of
all emperors on this earth.

Moral of the Story: If you ask in Prayer, ask only from Allah (SWT),
and if you seek help, seek it only from Allah (SWT).


**Conclusion**

In the end, it has to be said that the so called ups and downs are a
necessary part of our lives, which are blessings in disguise; for they
can help us earn greater rewards in the Hereafter. Man on the contrary
puts up a shameful performance:

"And as for man, when his Lord tries him, then treats him with honor
and makes him lead an easy life, he says: My Lord honors me. But when He
tries him (differently), then straitens to him his means of subsistence,
he says: My Lord has disgraced me." (The holy Qur'an, 89: 15-16 )

We do not have to think as to what we should do in times of difficulty
(or in times of joy for that matter). The holy Qur'an has already done
the job of identifying a path for us; we merely have to realize what it
is and then tread that path:

"Truly man was created very impatient. Fretful when evil touches him.
And niggardly when good reaches him. Not so those devoted to Prayer.
Those who remain steadfast on their prayer." (The holy Qur'an, 70 :
19-23 ) Also:

"O you who believe! Seek help with patient perseverance and prayer; for
God is with those who patiently persevere." (The holy Qur'an 2: 153 )

Finally, imaging our Solar system and comparing different planets of it
make us understand how small and insignificant we really are in the
overall scheme of things. Certainly puts the Creator on a different
level!
