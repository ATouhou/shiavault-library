Q60: What About Silent Movies?
==============================

I have come to understand that it is because of the music accompanying
them that films are forbidden in our Sheriat. Is it true? If so why is
it haram to see silent movies? A. As explained above, it is not only
because of Music. There are other factors involved. If there is a
"silent" film which is free from obscenity, dance and "crime-training"
then it is not 'Haram'.

By the way, I have been told that even in educational films, there is
always music in the background.

**Q61: THE FILM "PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA"**

Are we (i.e. Ithnasheris) allowed to see the film Pilgrimage to Mecca'?
A. The films in general have some features, anyone of which is enough to
make it a 'Gunah-e-Kabira'. (See for detail. Question No. 59).

Then there is a principle of sheriat that a man should not go to a
place which is generally used for Haram deeds even if he goes there for
a perfectly Halal purpose. Because, first, the passer-by would not know
his real intention and would think that he is going there for committing
that sin.

Secondly, he will become used to go to such places which is dangerous
in itself. Thirdly, others by seeing him going there will be encouraged
to follow his example.

Now, even if a perfectly safe film is being shown in a cinema, it is
not good to go there. Apart from the above-mentioned three reasons, your
children will think that there is nothing wrong in going to cinema; and
thus you will be responsible to create in them a sinful habit.

**Q62: CAN WE WATCH TELEVISION?**

Can we watch the television? A. The instrument, i.e. television is not
haram, if you use it to see or hear things which shariat has allowed;
but if you use it to hear music, songs, dances and obscene films, then
it is haram.

**Q63: WASTING OF TIME**

Is wasting of time forbidden (Haram)? If not, then why many people say
that we are not allowed to play those games; such as cards (without
money), draughts etc. The reason, they say, is wasting of time?

A. Only such games and plays are allowed in Islam which builds or
increases the strength of your body - like outdoor games.

So far as playing of cards is concerned, if a game is generally played
for gambling purpose, then that game is 'Haram' even if you play it
without gambling; because it will create a familiarity with such games
and may even lead to the gambling stage.

**Q64: IS ISLAM A BARBARIC RELIGION?**

There is another question which arouses doubt in me, and I hope that
you will clarify it. The question is: "Why is playing cards and chess
Haram (forbidden)?" I have also heard that playing game in which one
side is the victor and the other side the vanquished is also haram.

Is this true? I don't know why our Sheriat forbids those things which
we know are necessities in this modem World. Without observing these
things, we would be considered barbarians.

A. I am sending you two books 'Alcohol' and 'Gambling' which will
provide the answer to your questions. So far as being considered
barbarian is concerned, why are you so overcome by inferiority
complex?

Who is barbarian? Do you think those people are advanced and civilized
who swap their wives, whose church marries two males, who kill hundreds
of thousands of people on the pretext of establishing peace, whose women
became naked in the packed halls in the name of art?

**Q65: INTEREST?**

I lend a sum, say Rs. 100/-, to a man and he, out of his own free will,
promises to give me a gift of Rs. 101- in addition to the amount due. Is
this haram?

A. It is haram, if it was spoken or understood before you gave him the
loan. On the other hand, if nothing like this was spoken at that time,
and at the time of repayment he gave you more of his own free will
without your asking him in any way to do so, then it is allowed.

**Q 66: LIFE INSURANCE?**

Is Life Insurance allowed? A. Yes.

**Q67: TAKING PHOTO OF GHAIRMAHRAM**

My hobby is photography and I undertake part-time work in photography,
at wedding functions. Taking on a wedding photographic job means that I
do have to take photographs of the ceremonies performed by the ladies
which means that many times I, as a photographer, am the only male,
person apart from a few others, amongst so many ladies. Now I would like
the following clarifications:

1. Is it allowed to take such photographs in the above circumstances?

2. Is it allowed if there are both males and females gathered together
at a function and my prime purpose is just to take photographs?

3. Is it allowed to involve in such photography when one earns his
living from it? And in case one does involve himself in this only for
the purpose of earning his living, is his earning Halal?

A. You may know the answers to all your questions from the following
"Mas'ala of Ayatullah Al-Khui, printed in Tawdihul-Masail':

"Mas'ala 2448: "Man should not take photo of a 'Na-Mahram' woman, (i.e.
a woman not within prohibited degree)."And if he recognizes a
'Na-Mahram' woman, then, according to 'Ihtiyat' he should not even look
at her photograph".

There are hundreds of lawful ways of earning livelihood. Why should
anyone select an unlawful way?

**Q68: AMPUTATION OF A THIEF'S HAND**

What are the conditions necessary for amputation of hand for theft in
Islamic Sheriat? If cutting off the hand (wrist) is the punishment, why
most of the countries (Egypt, Pakistan) relaxed that law? Is it
correct?

The thief must be adult, sane, and a free man;
he should not have taken it thinking that it is his own thing;
the alleged thief is not a joint owner of that thing;
the stolen thing was kept in a safe place (for example, under lock) and
the thief did break into it either alone or with the help of others (if
someone else broke the lock, and afterwards the thief entered into the
place and took something from there, his hand will not be amputated);

5. the thing stolen is not the property of his son (if the father has
stolen from his son, he will not be given that punishment of cutting the
hand);

6. he takes it stealthily, not openly;

7. the value of the stolen thing reaches one-fourth Dinar of gold.
According to the Qur'an, the hand must be cut off. (In Shia Shariat,
'hand' here means 4 fingers of right hand).

It is really shameful and tragic for the Muslims not to follow the
legal code of Islam. The harm of this negligence of Islamic law comes
upon the Muslim. Allah and His Prophet are not harmed by our rebellion.
Allah has said: "And whosoever rejects faith then Allah is independent
of the Universe." (Qur'an 3: 97).

**Q69: POLITICAL PRISONERS**

Is there any such thing as political prisoner' in Islamic State? What I
mean is, are we, under Islamic Law, allowed to put people into prison
because of different political views? A. No; though we Shias have a long
history of spending our lives in prisons and torture- chambers because
of our belief.
