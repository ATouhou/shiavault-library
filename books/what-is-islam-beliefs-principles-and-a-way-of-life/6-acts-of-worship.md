Acts of Worship

**6-ISLAMIC ACTS OF WORSHIP**

Question:

What is the meaning of worship?

Answer:

Worship are those things that Islam has made obligatory and must be
performed with the intention of seeking nearness or closeness to God
Almighty.

Question:

What is meant by the intention of seeking nearness to God?

Answer:

It means that the action should be performed only for the sake of God
and this intention distinguishes acts of worship and the other
obligatory acts, because worship requires the intention of seeking
nearness to God whereas acts which are not worship, but which are
considered a means of gaining access to God’s mercy, may be performed
without that specific intention.

Question:

Give an example of both:

Answer:

For example, offering prayers is an act of worship and they are not
valid without the intention of seeking nearness to God but washing an
item of clothing to make it pure is not worship and therefore can be
done without that intention.

Question:

Why is worship conditional upon the intention of drawing near to God?

Answer:

Firstly, because worship is obedience to God Almighty and complete
obedience cannot be expressed unless the act of worship is performed
solely for the sake of God. Secondly, worship elevates the soul and so
if man continually remembers God and realizes that he is in the presence
of his Lord who is the Great, the Powerful, the All-Seeing and
All-Hearing, undoubtedly he will be granted an excellence of character
which will lead him towards the highest spirituality and noblest conduct
and will distance him from bad things, whether they be attitudes of mind
or actual deeds.

**PRAYING**

Question:

What are the Islamic acts of worship?

Answer:

The most important Islamic acts of worship are prayers, fasting, khums,
zakat, jihad and hajj. Since this book has been written in order to
provide a brief introduction to Islam, we will forgo an explanation of
the wisdom and reasons behind these acts of worship and so anyone who
wishes to know about these aspects should refer to our book entitled
“Islamic Acts of Worship”1.

Question:

What are prayers? How many units do they have and what else is
involved?

Answer:

Prayers are of two kinds: obligatory prayers and recommended prayers.

Question:

Which are the obligatory prayers?

Answer:

Obligatory prayers are performed in the following sequence:

1. Dawn prayer (called fajr or subh). This has two units2, and its time
is from dawn to sunrise.

1 ‘Ibadat al-Islam, 3rd printing, Beirut, 1994.

2 Each unit (or raka‘) consists (briefly) of standing, bowing and then
two prostrations. 2. Noon or Midday prayer (called dhuhr): four units,
and its time is from the passing of the sun from the middle of the sky
of the country where you happen to be until shortly before the sun sets
beneath the horizon.1

3. Afternoon prayer (called ‘asr): four units, and its time is from
after the noon prayer until the setting of the sun beneath the
horizon.

4. Sunset prayer (called maghrib): three units, and its time is from
sunset, which means in this case when the redness in the sky has passed
from above one’s head (that is about a quarter of an hour after the
actual sunset), until shortly before the middle of the night2.

5. Evening prayer (called ‘isha’): four units, and its time is from
after the sunset prayer until the middle of the night.

Question:

Do prayers while travelling differ from prayers in the place of
residence?

Answer:

Yes. Prayers while travelling are “qasr - shortened” that is the midday
(dhuhr), afternoon (‘asr) and evening (‘isha’) prayers should each be
performed in two units like the dawn (fajr) prayer3.

Question:

How is the prayer divided up?

Answer:

It is divided up as follows:

1. Saying Allahu akbar4, after first having made the intention.
1 to the extent that there is still time for the afternoon prayer.
2 so that there is time to prayer the evening prayer. Night here is
defined as being the time from sunset (in the prayer sense) until the
beginning of dawn.
3 Note that the sunset prayer is not shortened.
4 God is great.

2. The reading of the first chapter (sura) of the Qur’an (al- Fatiha),
and any one other chapter, while standing.

3. Bowing with its specific invocation1.

4. Standing upright again after bowing.

5. Two prostrations with their specific invocation2, respectively, and
sitting up between the two prostrations.

6. Standing up straight again, then the recitation of al- Fatiha and
any other sura (just like 2 above) followed by the Qunut prayers3 which
are recommended but not obligatory.

7. Then bowing and standing up straight, after bowing; two prostrations
(just like 5 above) and sitting back; then the saying of the tashahhud4
and the salam5.

That is the way to pray two units. As for prayers of three or four
units, however, in the third and fourth unit instead of reciting al-
Fatiha and any other sura, special praises to God are recited6.

Question:

What are the conditions of prayers?

Answer:

The conditions of prayers are as follows:

1. To stand facing the Qibla7.

2. Cleanliness of dress, the body and the place of prostration.

1 Subhana rabbiyal-‘adhim wa-bi-hamdih.

2 Subhana rabbiyal-a‘la wa-bi-hamdih.

3 As, for instance, Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammadin wa-Aali Muhammad;
Rabbana atina fi ’d-dunya hasanatan wa-fi ’l-akhirati hasanatan wa-qina
‘adhab an-nar [2: 201]; Rabbana amanna bi-ma anzalta
wa-ttaba‘n-ar-rasula fa-ktubna ma‘-ash-shahidin [3: 53].

4 Which includes ( among other invocations) testifying (hence
tashahhud) to the Divine Unity and the Prophethood of Muhammad and
invoking the peace and blessings of God upon him and his progeny.

5 As-salam ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullahi wa-barakatuh.

6 Subhanallah; wa-’l –hamdulillah; wa-la ilaha illa -’llah; wa-’llahu
akbar (thrice).

7 i.e. in the direction of Makka.

3. Being in the state of purification by means of ablutions (wudu’)1 or
ghusl2 or tayammum3.

4. The clothes of the person praying and the place of prayer must have
been lawfully acquired.

5. Not doing anything which nullifies the prayers while they are being
performed as, for example, flatulence and so on, laughing, or turning
away from the Qibla.

Question:

Are there other prayers besides the daily prayers which Islam has made
obligatory?

Answer:

Yes.

1. The prayer over the deceased.

2. The prayer at the time of wondrous or fearful happenings (salat
al-ayat)4.

3. The prayer after the circumambulation (tawaf)5.

4. Prayers performed on behalf of a dead person, if an individual is
obliged to do them.

5. Prayers said after a vow.

There is a particular way to pray each of these other obligatory
prayers and books on jurisprudence should be consulted for details.

Question:

Which are the prayers which are particularly recommended?

Answer:

There are many recommended prayers, for instance:-

1 Washing the face and arms, and wiping the head and wiping the feet.

2 Pouring water over the whole body.

3 Using clean earth when no water is available.

4 For instance at the time of a solar or lunar eclipse (whether full or
partial), earthquakes, hurricanes and so on.

5 i.e. the tawaf around the Holy Ka‘ba in Makka at the time of Hajj or
‘Umra.

1. Daily supererogatory prayers (nawafil)1.

2. The special prayers for the month of Ramadan.

3. Recommended prayers on sacred days like religious festivals.

4. Prayers which have been narrated by the Prophet and the pure Imams,
which they themselves used to perform and which are known by their names
as, for instance, the Prayer of the Prophet (God’s blessings and peace
be upon him and his progeny) and the Prayer of ‘Ali (peace be upon
him).

5. Prayers which are recommended in various circumstances such as
prayers when visiting holy shrines (either physically or at a distance),
the special prayer to beseech Almighty God for rain (istisqa’), and the
prayer of one who is in a state of fear.

**FASTING**

Question:

A part of the khums should be paid to the Muslim jurist so that he may
expend it according to Islamic activities as seems fit to him. The
remainder is expended by the person concerned for helping orphans, poor
people and needy travellers, from among the descendants of the Prophet
(God’s blessings and peace be upon him and his progeny).

Question:

What is zakat?

Answer:

Zakat consists of the payment of a portion of certain assets for the
cause of God.

Question:

From what things should zakat be paid?

Answer:

From three categories:-

1. The three groups of grazing livestock: cows, sheep and goats and
camels.

2. The four types of grains: dates, raisins, wheat and barley.

3. Two types of coinage: gold and silver.

Thus zakat has to be paid obligatorily from nine things. It is
recommended that zakat should also be paid from other things like
properties and business assets.

Question:

To whom should zakat be given?

Answer:

Zakat should be expended in eight categories:-

1. The poor.

2. The penurious: one whose condition is more severe than that of a
poor person.

3. Officials who are appointed to collect the zakat.

4. Matters that may be considered to be for the cause of God, that is
anything which is for the benefit of the Muslims be it related to his
religious or worldly affairs.

5. Debtors who are unable to pay their debts.

6. Wayfarers who cannot travel any further and cannot afford to return
to their own homeland.

7. Those who receive from the zakat in order either to strengthen the
faith already present in their hearts1 or to discourage them from
harming the Muslims.

8. Slaves: bondspersons who live under difficult conditions should be
purchased with zakat money or freed.

**JIHAD**

Question:

What is jihad?

1 Such as recent converts to Islam.

Answer:

Jihad consists of fighting for the cause of God.

Question:

What is the object and aim of jihad?

Answer:

The purpose of jihad is two-fold:

1. Delivering people from superstitions in their beliefs and in what
they do.

2. Freeing the oppressed from the claws of the oppressors. Question:

Does Islam ever justify starting a fight or a war with non- Muslims
without provocation?

Answer:

No, never. On the contrary Islam fights in self-defence against:

1. People of the Scriptures (Ahl al-Kitab), that is those who are
possessors of a heavenly book, after they have been given an option
between embracing Islam, or paying a tax (jizya), or fighting.

2. People other than the People of the Scriptures when it has given
them a choice between embracing Islam or fighting.

Question:

Who are the people of the Scriptures?

Answer:

People of the Scriptures consist of Jews, Christians and Zorastrians,
all of whom possess heavenly books.

Question:

Who are those people not considered to be among the People of the
Scriptures?

Answer:

They are other non-Muslims such as idol-worshippers and the like.

Question:

What is the meaning of jizya?

Answer:

Jizya is an amount of money taken from the People of the Scriptures in
return for the protection of the Muslims. They are then free to practise
their religious rites and they are excused from paying the zakat and the
khums, which are taken from the Muslims.

Question:

Why make this difference? Wouldn’t it be more just for the People of
the Scriptures to be treated in the same way as Muslims?

Answer:

On the contrary, because the rights of the People of the Scriptures are
fully safe-guarded under Islamic government whereas under other legal
systems their rights have not been protected to such an extent, as is
clear from the following principles:-

1. In an Islamic country People of the Scriptures enjoy the same rights
as their fellow Muslim citizens.

2. Their life, property and honour is protected, just like that of the
Muslims.

3. The people of the Scripture are free to organize for themselves
their own religious ceremonies just as Muslims are.

4. With regard to legal problems, the People of the Scriptures can, if
they wish, seek justice through the Muslim courts but if they prefer
they can go to their own judges.

5. The People of the Scriptures pay the jizya to the Muslim ruler while
Muslims pay khums and zakat. So can it justifiably be said that the
People of the Scriptures are oppressed under Islamic rule?

Question:

So why did Muslims ever fight the People of the Scriptures? Answer:

The conflict was always with their governments who were characterized
by the ugliest forms of oppression and persecution. We can see with what
eagerness the inhabitants of those countries would welcome the Muslims,
since they considered them to be their deliverers from the hands of
their tyrannical rulers. History is the best witness to that.

The same was the case with those non- Muslims who were not People of
the Scriptures because the reason why the Muslims fought others was
simply to exalt God’s law and to deliver other nations from exploiters
and despots who were ruling their people through violence and terror.

**HAJJ**

Question:

What is the Hajj?

Answer:

The Hajj consists of journeying to Makka in the Arabian Peninsula with

1 ‘Umra can also be performed by itself at most other times throughout
the entire year.

2 Miqat: Any one of the several places specified by the Holy Prophet
(God’s blessings and peace be upon him and his progeny) at which people
put on the Ihram when on their way to Makka to perform Hajj or ‘Umra.

if the pilgrim had stayed at Mina on the eve of the 13th.

Question:

When should a Muslim go on the Hajj?

Answer:

In the months of Hajj, namely Shawwal, Dhu ’l-Qa‘da and Dhu ’l-Hijja1.
Of course, the Hajj itself can only be performed in the month of Dhu
’l-Hijja.

1 The 10th, 11th and 12th months of the Muslim calendar,
respectively.

Question:

What is ‘Umra by itself (that is without Hajj)?

Answer:

The ‘Umra is exactly the same as we have mentioned above1 plus the
tawaf around the Ka‘ba, called the tawaf of al-nisa’, and the two units
of prayer that follow it (as 11 and 12, above). This ‘Umra can be
performed at any time during the whole year.

Question:

What are the benefits of Hajj?

Answer:

Hajj has many benefits, some of which we will point out here:
1-Political Benefits:

Hajj brings about unity among the Muslims and gives them strength,
making their enemies fear their might.

2-Economic Benefits:

Hajj makes money circulate and move from one end of the Islamic World
to the other and so causes trade to flourish.

3-Psychological Benefits:

It gives comfort to the soul and bestows the calm and piece of mind
that travelling brings and which dispel anxiety and worry regarding the
homeland for as the poet says:

Go abroad to seek high things and travel, for in travel there are five
benefits, The dispelling of anxiety, gaining a livelihood, a sound mind,
a good code of conduct and admirable company.

1 Page 56.

4-Social benefits:

The Hajj causes the Muslims to get to know each other and helps them
speak with one voice.

5-Spiritual benefits:

Circumambulating the Ka‘ba, the walk between Safa and Marwa, the prayer
of circumambulation, the ritual prayers, the standing on ‘Arafat are all
worship. There are many other benefits of making the Hajj which are
mentioned elsewhere in more detail.1
