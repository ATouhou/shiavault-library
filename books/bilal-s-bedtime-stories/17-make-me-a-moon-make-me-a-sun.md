Make Me A Moon Make Me A Sun
============================

Mother give me two rings

I will make two things

Moon I will from one

From another sun

Give me a glass

In it I will grow grass

Basin small I will take

To make a little lake

With much joy

Said little boy

He thought, but

I must be nut

How can I make

Sun, moon, lake

I must be mad

The boy said

Some water he got to drink

And sat aside to think

Who makes sunlight

The moon so bright

Who can dig

Lakes so big

In thought So seriously he sat

Blank looking at

Asked worried mother

What is the matter

Replied little boy

I am thinking of my Creator.
