114: Mankind (nas)
==================

These 6 Meccan verses were revealed after the previous chapter on Dawn
113 and before its preceding one,Sincerity (or [God's] Oneness) 112.
This chapter likewise forms a prayer for times of anxiety, bringing
God's presence to us in our trials.

*NOTE* the haunting rhyme in the Arabic, contrasted with the assonance
in -a- in the previous chapter; the gossiping sound of the
recurring -as,' rhyme here is not easily reproduced in English.
