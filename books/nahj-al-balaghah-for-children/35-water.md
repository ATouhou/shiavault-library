Water
=====

You should know

that every action is the fruit of a tree.

A tree cannot go without **water**,

and water is of various kinds.

A tree that receives good **water**,

is healthy

and its fruit is sweet.

A tree that grows on bad **water**

is vicious, and its fruit bitter.

(Sermon 154)
