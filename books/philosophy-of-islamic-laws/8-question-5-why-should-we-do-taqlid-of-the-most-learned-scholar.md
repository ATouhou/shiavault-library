Question 5: Why Should We Do Taqlid of The Most Learned Scholar?
================================================================

**Question:** It is written in *Tauzihul Masael* that it is compulsory
to do the Taqlid of an Aalam. What is the source of this command?

**Answer:** The Taqlid of Aalam, which is famous among the Mujtahids, is
concluded from different proofs, from which we present one clear proof:

The following of a learned by an ignorant person is based on logic and
in that sense, and in all the tribes and communities of the world it is
the tradition that those who are not expert in any field, when they
require the help of experts, contact those who are experts. For example
those who are not acquainted with medicine when they fall ill they go to
the doctor, and those who do not know how to build, to an architect or a
mason.

It is also clear that when the views of experts differs; for example a
doctor treats his patient in one special way and thinks it to be
correct, and the other doctor treats in another way and believes that he
is right. So in that case the patient will follow that doctor whose
medicinal knowledge is more and expansive, one who has more experience
and expertise. In short that one should be more knowledgeable (Aalam)
than the other.

There will always be a difference of opinion among the experts of a
particular field; it is logical. But people follow only that expert who
in their view is the best. Different tribes and communities follow this.

Whatever is said above is one of the proofs for the Taqlid of an Aalam.
Mujtahids have given some proofs on this topic, whose explanation is not
possible over here.
