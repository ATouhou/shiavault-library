Section 1 : Introduction
========================

The sources of ijtihad according to Shi'ah and the Ahl al-Sunnah, put
together, are: the Book, the Sunnah, ijma\` (consensus), \`aql (reason),
qiyas (analogy), istihsan, masalih mursalah, istislah, sadd
al-dhara'i\`, fath al-dhara'i; madhhab al-sahabi, shari\`at al-salaf,
\`urf, istidlal, and so on. In this series of articles we shall try to
discuss and study these topics in detail from the Shi\`i and the Sunni
points of view.

We expect writers and scholars who have specialty in this field to
contribute to the soundness and validity of these studies through
con­structive criticism relevant to the subject studied here. Any
constructive criticism is very useful for correcting errors and removing
shortcomings, and effective in eliminating ambiguities and omissions.
Besides rendering vital service to scholarship, it is beneficial to the
author, who is forced to be more careful in his statements and precise
in his research. The intellectual history of Islam is indicative of the
debt that the development and expansion of legal and other scientific
studies owe to diverse viewpoints and competent criticism.

This commendable and beneficial tradition has been in vogue in its most
desirable form throughout the seven epochs of ijtihad among all the
scholars and mujtahidun, and especially in the sixth and the seventh
periods, whose fore-runners were Wahid Behbahani and the great al­
Shaykh al-'Ansari respectively, this tradition reached its zenith.

Also, the very force of ijtihad, from the era of tashri\` (legislation)
to the present (as discussed in detail in the article on the epochs of
ijtihad), as a legitimate activity is derived from criticism and debate.
Be­cause, in Islamic fiqh, ijtihad has had the meaning of a free and
indepen­dent effort of the mujtahidun, undertaken for the purpose of
advance­ment and expansion of the Islamic sciences. This development was
not possible except through freedom of scholarly research, free
expression of different views and clash between views of the mujtahidun,
scholars and thinkers.

By practising ijtihad, a mujtahid deduces the ahkam (laws) of the
Shari'ah for issues and problems regarding which there is no specific
express text (nass), by relying on legal sources and principles and by
benefiting from the ideas of other mujtahidun. On account of this, it
may be said that ijtihad plays the role of an evolutionary and dynamic
force in legal studies which provides solutions to contingent issues of
life and fulfils the needs of changing times and the requirements of new
phenomena of human civilization. Therefore, Islamic fiqh does not
suf­fer with inertia, stagnation and passivity vis-a-vis the demands of
the times, of life and its manifestations; it also advances along with
them. It is for this reason that it has been said that ijtihad has been
through­out Islamic history the force which has been constantly
developing and expanding the boundaries of fiqh with respect to its
applications, while maintaining the stability of legislation. Thus,
ijtihad is essential for Islamic fiqh, without which it cannot be
dynamic and progressive.

On the basis of this, closing of the gates of ijtihad is contrary to
the perennial mission of Islam in all ages, and, most certainly, alien
elements have played an active role in promoting this ominous venture.
For the enemies of Islam, it has been, and still is, the best weapon to
strike Islamic law with, and the most effective instrument for
eliminat­ing it from scientific, cultural, economic, social and
political arenas. Be­cause, closing of the gates of ijtihad renders fiqh
ineffective and incapa­ble of providing answers to emergent and
contingent issues of life

The present deficiencies in the world of Islam, the failure to
con­front the contingent issues in a proper way, the issuing of baseless
and ir­rational fatawa, the improper attitude towards new ideas - all
these are consequencies of the closing of the gates of ijtihad by the
Ahl al-­Sunnah. It has been instrumental in allowing dubious hands, with
the aid of taghuti governments, to instil unhealthy ideas into the
people's minds and to insinuate the feeling that Islamic fiqh cannot
fulfil the demands of the present age and the modern civilization.

These insinuations have left undesirable effects on the minds of
short-sighted and self-alienated persons unaware of the spirit of Islam,
to the extent that they servilely follow the aliens and prefer Western
laws to the laws of Islam (we shall have more to say about this matter
in the article "The Era of the Decline of Sunni Ijtihad").

The most outstanding achievement of Shi'i fiqh has been to keep open
the gates of ijtihad throughout the course of history. Its superiori­ty
over other schools of fiqh, whose doors were closed after the death of
their founders (namely, Abu Hanifah al-Nu'man ibn Thabit, the founder of
Hanafi School; Malik ibn Anas al-'Asbahi, the founder of the Maliki
School; Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi'i,the founder of the Shafi'i School;
and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the founder of the Hanbali School), lies here. (An
exposition of this issue from various aspects and a critique of the
speech of the editor of the Kuwaiti journal al-Mujtama\`, Isma'il
al-Shatti, delivered at the U.A.E. university on Nov. 1, 1982, wherein
he denounced the claim about the continuity of ijtihad as a \`conspiracy
against the faith,' will come in our article on the epochs of
ijtihad.)

**The Term Ijtihad**

\`Ijtihad', according to the lexicographers, is derived from \`juhd',
which means employment of effort or endeavour in performing a cer­tain
activity. Here we shall quote some of them:

Ibn al-'Athir defines \`ijtihad' as the effort and endeavour
under­taken for attaining some objective. [^1] He further remarks that
the word () occurs in many ahdith. ’Juhd’ means employing ones complete
strength, and \`jahd' means hardship and difficulty.\` [^2]

Ibn Manzur al-Misri says: Jahd and juhd mean power and strength. He
adds that it is said that whereas jahd means hardship and difficulty,
juhd gives the sense of power and strength. [^3] Later on he quotes
al-Farra' to the effect that in the verse of the Quran [^4] jahd is used
in the sense of power and strength. [^5] In the same work, he states that
ijtihad and tajahud mean exertion of power and strength. [^6] In the
hadith narrated from Mu'adh the phrase used in the sense of effort and
endeavour to achieve some purpose. Said al-Khuri says: Ijtihad means
undertaking effort and endeav­our in performing some task. For instance
it is \`He exerted himself to carry the stone', but nobody says:
(Khardalah=mustard seed). [^7] He further adds that jahd (verbal of
jahada) is used in the sense of strength - as in (he did all in his
power) as well as in the sense of trying hard, as in is used in the
sense of strength. [^8]

Al-Munjid states:

Ahmad al-Qayyumi wiites: Juhd in the usage of the people of the Hijaz
and jahd in the non-Hijazi usage means exerting one's strength and
power, and it has been said that juhd means strength and jahd means toil
and strain. [^9] He further adds: (Ijtihada means: he spent his strength
and capacity to attain his goal and his ultimate objective'). [^10]

Al-\`Allamah al Turayhi states: It occurs in a hadith that: (‘the best
of charities is that which is given by one in indigence’). [^11] He also
says: means: (ijtihada bi yamanih means: He tried hard and did his
utmost in order to fulfil his promise'). [^12] He explains that ijtihad
involves doing one's utmost while striving and making effort. [^13] Ibn
Abi Dhar\`ah, quoting al-Mawardi, states that the literal mean­ing of
ijtihad is to undertake effort and endeavour in accomplishing something
that requires strain and difficulty, and to this is related jihad
al-nafs (the struggle against the carnal self) which involves labour and
toil for winning the desired objective and goal.

Isma'il al-Jawharil [^14] and other lexicographers have also defined the
word ijtihad in similar terms. Thus we come to the conclusion that in
the light of the definitions given by the lexicographers ijtihad means
employment of effort and endeavour to one's utmost capacity, and it does
not make any difference whether it is derived from juhd or jahd, as
effort and endeavour are not without strain and toil and accompany each
other. On the basis of this definition, the statements of the two Usuli
scholars, Shaykh Hasan al-Amali al-Jiba\`I [^15] and Akhund
al-­Khurasani, [^16] and others about this term, that the literal meaning
of ijtihad is undergoing difficulty and hardship for accomplishing
some­thing, appear to be incomplete and controvertible.
