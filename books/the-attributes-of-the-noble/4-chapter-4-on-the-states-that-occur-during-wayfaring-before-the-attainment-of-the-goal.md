Chapter 4 : On the States That Occur During Wayfaring Before the Attainment of the Goal
=======================================================================================

This chapter consists of six sections:

Section one: on aspiration (iradah)
Section two: on longing (shawq)
Section three: on love (mahabbah)
Section four: on knowledge (ma'rifah)
Section five: on certainty (yaqin)
Section six: on rest (sukun).

**Section One: On Aspiration**

God, the Glorious and the Exalted, says:

And be patient thyself with those who call upon their Lord at morning
and evening, aspiring for His Face ... (18:28). Iradat' in Persian means
desiring' (khwastan), and it entails three things:

i) awareness of the object sought,
ii) awareness of the perfection that it possesses,
iii) absence of access to the object of desire.

Hence if the desired goal is something that is attainable by the seeker
and the aspiration is accompanied with the power [to realize it], these
two would lead to the attainment of the goal of aspiration.

And if it be something that is realized and existent but not present,
these two would lead to the realization of the goal. Hence if there is a
delay in realization (wusul), seeking leads to a state called longing'
(shawq) in the aspirer. Longing precedes realization.

And if realization be gradual, the effect it produces is called love'
(mahabbah), which has several degrees, the ultimate degree of it being
al the time of complete realization and the end of wayfaring.

As to the aspiration associated with wayfaring, it is entailed, in a
sense, by the wayfaring itself, for the desire for perfection is a kind
of aspiration, and when aspiration ceases, either as a result of
attainment or due to the knowledge of impossibility of realization,
wayfaring also terminates. This aspiration associated with wayfaring is
particular to the deficient; and as to the perfect, their aspiration is
identical with perfection itself and the goal sought.

It is mentioned in traditions that there is a tree in paradise called
Tuba, and whoever has a desire and aspiration for something it is
immediately delivered to him from that tree without any delay or
waiting. 20

And it has been said that some people are rewarded for their acts of
obedience in the Hereafter, 21 whereas for some their deeds themselves
are their own reward. 22

This also affirms that aspiration and the goal of aspiration are
identical for some people, for aspiration ceases for one who attains to
the station of rids in wayfaring. One of the adept who sought this
station said:

If I were asked, "What do you aspire to?" I would say: "My aspiration
is to have no aspiration."

**Section Two: On Longing**

God, the Glorious and the Exalted, said:

... and so that they who have been given knowledge may know that it is
the truth from-thy Lord and believe in it, and so their hearts be humble
unto Him ... . (22:54)

Longing (shawq) is finding the pleasure of love, mixed with the pain of
separation, that accompanies intense desire. In the state of wayfaring,
longing is necessary after the intensification of desire. At times
longing is attained before wayfaring when consciousness of the ultimate
goal is attained without the power to make the journey and with loss of
patience over separation.

As much as the wayfarer progresses in this journey, his longing
increases and patience diminishes, until he reaches the goal, whereafter
the pleasure of attaining perfection becomes pure and free from the
traces of pain and longing.

There are people of the Path who call the vision of the Beloved as
longing,' and this is in the sense that (the wayfarer] seeks union
(ittiharl) and has not yet reached shat station.

**Section Three: On Love**

God, the Glorious and the Exalted, has said:

And amongst men there are those who take to themselves compeers apart
from God, loving them as God is loved; but those that believe love God
more ardently. (2:765)

Love (mahabbah) is an ecstatic feeling occasioned by some perfection,
or imagination of some perfection, real or supposed, in the object of
consciousness.

From another aspect, love is the inclining of the soul towards
something consciousness of which is accompanied by some pleasure or
perfection. And since the pleasure of perception is associated with
realization of perfection, love is not devoid of actual or imagined
pleasure.

Love is subject to strength and weakness. Its first stage is
aspiration, for aspiration cannot be without love, and thereafter it is
proportionate to the longing. With complete realization, whereas
aspiration and longing cease, love becomes predominant.

As long as there remains a trace of otherness between the seeker and
the Sought, love remains fixed, ishq being extreme love.

And it may be that the seeker and the Sought are united while being
distinct in some aspect. And as this aspect (of distinction) disappears,
love ceases. Hence the ultimate stage of love and 'ishq is union.

The philosophers say that love is either innate (fitri) or acquired
(kasbi). Innate love is present in all existents, for the heaven (falak)
possesses a lave that impels it to its motion. Every element that seeks
a natural location possesses a love of that location. The same applies
to love in other natural states pertaining to position, quantity, action
and reaction.

It is also present in compounds, such as in the magnet which attracts
iron, and to a greater degree in plants, wherewith they make movements
leading to growth, nourishment, production of seeds and procreation. In
animals it is greater than in plants, as is displayed in their affection
and friendly feeling for those of their own kind, the affinity for the
opposite sex, and affection for offspring and other members of the
species.

However, acquired love is predominant in the human species and its
cause pertains to three things:

First, pleasure, physical or non-physical, imaginary or real.

Second, benefit, which is also either illusory-as in mundane love,
whose benefit is accidental-or real, whose benefit is essential.

Third, the similarity of substance, which is either commonplace-such as
between two persons of similar dispositions and temperaments, who are
delighted by each other's dispositions, characteristics, and conduct-or
special, as between the men of God (ahl-a haqq) and the love of the
seeker of perfection for the absolutely perfect One.

The causes of love may at times be composed of two or three of these
causes.

Love may also derive from gnosis (ma'rifah), and since the gnostic
receives all pleasure, benefit, and good from the Absolutely Perfect, he
attains to the love of the Absolutely Perfect, which surpasses all other
loves, and herewith is disclosed the meaning of:

... those that believe love God more ardently. (2:165)

The mystics (ahl-e dhawq) say that hope and fear, longing and intimacy,
expansion (inbisat), trust (tawakkul), resignation (rida'), and
submission (taslim) are all essential elements of love, for love at the
aspect of the Beloved's compassion inspires hope, fear at the aspect of
His awe, longing at non-attainment ('adam-e wusul), intimacy (uns) with
the achievement of realization, expansion with exceeding intimacy, and
trust with confidence in His care, resignation with relishing everything
that He makes to occur, and submission at the aspect of one's inadequacy
and inability and His perfection and omnipotence.

Real love is coextensive with submission (taslim) when [the wayfarer]
knows the Beloved to be the absolute sovereign and himself as the
absolute subject [of His sovereignty]. Real 'ishq is coextensive with
fana' when he sees the Beloved as everything and himself as nothing. For
those who possess this station, everything other than God is a veil, and
the ultimate goal of the journey is to turn away from all to attend to
Him:

To Him the whole matter shall be returned .... (11:123)

**Section Four: On Gnosis**

God, the Glorious and the Exalted, has said:

God hears witness that there is no god but He-and the angels, and men
possessed of knowledge-upholding justice; there is no god but lie, the
All- mighty, the All-wise. (3:18) Ma'rifah means knowledge, and here
that which is meant is the highest degree of the gnosis of God, for the
gnosis of God has many levels.

The degrees of gnosis have an analogy in fire, which may be known to
some people through hearsay as an existent that reduces to nothing
anything that comes into contact with it and affects everything shat is
near it, as something that is not diminished by anything that may be
taken away from it, and whose nature is opposed to that which is
distinct from it, and that such an existent is called fire:

In respect of the knowledge of God, the Exalted, those who arc such are
called imitators (muqallid), such as those who affirm the statements of
authorities in this regard without considering any proof.

And some are at a level higher than this group and their analogy is
that of those who on confronting the smoke arising from fire know that
this smoke arises from something. Thereupon they infer that there is an
existent whose effect is the smoke. In gnosis, those whose analogy is
such are the speculative thinkers (ahl-e nazar) who know through
conclusive proofs that there is a Creator, the effects of Whose power
bear evidence of His existence.

Above this level are those who have felt the heat of fire by being near
it and having benefited from it. In gnosis, those of this rank are the
believers in the Unseen, who know the Creator from behind a veil.

Above this level are those who see the fire and their eyes behold other
existents in its light. This group, in respect of gnosis, consists of
the seers who are called gnostics ('urafa'), and it is they who possess
true knowledge (ma'rifah).

Others who have higher ranks above this level arc also reckoned as
gnostics, and they are called the people of certainty' (ahl al-yaqin).
We shall discuss certainty and those who possess it hereafter,

And of them is a group whose knowledge is of the category of direct
vision, and they are called the people of presence' (ahl al-hudur) and
to them belong special intimacy (uns) and ecstasy (inbisat).

The ultimate degree of gnosis is where the gnostic ceases to exist,
like something burnt away in fire and reduced to nothing.

**Section Five: On Certainty**

God, the Glorious and the Exalted says:

... and they are certain of the Hereafter. (2:4)

It is stated in a hadith:

One who is given certainty, and the one who partakes of it, does not
worry about the deficiency of his prayer and fasting. 23

Yaqin in common usage means an indestructible resolute belief
corresponding to fact. In reality it comprises of the knowledge of the
known object and the knowledge of the impossibility of that which
contradicts the former knowledge.

There are various planes of certainty and the Qur'anic revelation
mentions knowledge of certainty' ('ilm al-yaqin), 'eye of certainty'
('ayn al yaqin), and 'truth of certainty' (haqq al-yaqin) as in the
following verses:

(No indeed;) did you know with the knowledge of certainty you shall
surely see Hell. Again, you shall surely see it with the eye of
certainty. (102:5-7)

But if he be of them that cried lies, and went astray, there shall be a
hospitality of boiling water) and the roasting in Hell. Surely this is
the truth of certainly. (56:94-95)

In the analogy of fire mentioned in the section on gnosis, whatever is
seen by the means of the light of the fire is like the knowledge of
certainly' ('ilm al-yaqin). The immediate vision of the substance of
fire, which is the source of light that shines on everything capable of
being illuminated, is like the eye of certainly' (ayn al-yaqin), and
that which is enveloped by the fire, its identity so consumed by it that
what remains is the fire itself, is the truth of certainty' (haqq
al-yaqin).

Although fire stands for punishment, but since ultimate union with it
results in the annihilation of the essence of the one who unites with
it, its sight from far, from near, and entry into it-the latter
resulting in the annihilation of everything that is other than the
fire-correspond to these three stations. And God knows best the
realities of things.

**Section Six: On Rest**

God, the Exalted, has said:

Those who believe, their hearts are at rest in God's remembrance.
Indeed. God's remembrance gives tranquility to the hearts. (13:28) Rest
is of two kinds, one which is characteristic of the deficient, prior to
wayfaring, when its subject is unaware of perfection and the goal. That
is called negligence (ghaflah). The other is the one attained after
wayfaring and is characteristic of the perfect on reaching the goal, and
is called tranquillity (itminan).

The state between these two states of rest is called movement, journey,
and wayfaring. Movement is necessarily associated with love prior to
realization, and rest is associated with gnosis, which is coextensive
with realization (wusul). For this reason it has been said that i.e. The
gnostic would perish were he to cease moving. Some have even gone beyond
this state to state that i.e The gnostic would perish if he were to
speak and the lover if he were to cease speaking.

These are the states of the wayfarer until he attains realization. And
God knows best.
