67. The Favorite Deed
=====================

This *Dua* is a deed liked best by Almighty Allah. Because it is a cause
of pleasure of the Imam and the leader of believers and the most
superior of them and in *Usool Kafi* it is narrated from His Eminence,
Abu Ja’far Baqir (as) that he said:

“The Almighty Allah was not worshipped by anything that should be the
most beloved deed to Him except through causing happiness to the
believer.”[^1]

In the same book it is mentioned from His Eminence, Abu Abdillah Sadiq
(as) from his father from Ali bin al-Husain (as) that the Messenger of
Allah (S) said:

“Indeed, the best deed in the view of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime is
making believers happy.”[^2]
