The End
=======

After Deer al-Jamajum Battle, Kumayl bin Ziyad was far away from spies.

The police were looking for Kumayl everywhere.

Al-Hajjaj used a new way to arrest Kumayl. He ordered the police to
annoy Kumayl followers. He deprived them of money. So, their economic
condition was bad. Kumayl heard about that. Thus, he decided to
surrender. The police took him to al-Hajjaj.
