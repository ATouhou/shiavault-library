Dedication
==========

This book is dedicated to my honorable father and mother. My father who
taught me the ways of Islam, in its humbleness and reasoning, and
nurtured me in the love for Allah, *Glorified and Exalted is He*, the
Prophet, and his immaculate Household. Moreover, for my mother, for her
unconditional love and patience in raising me into the person that I am
today. To them both I am eternally grateful.

It is customary in Islam that when the name of Allah, Prophet Muhammad,
the other prophets, or imams (descendants and successors of Prophet
Muhammad) is enunciated, the following phrases are mentioned:

Allah - *“Glorified and Exalted is He” (Subhannah wa-tallah).*

Prophet Muhammad- *“Peace be upon him and his family.”*

After the names of prophets, imams from the family of Prophet Muhammad
and his daughter - *“Peace be upon him/her.”*

With great respect, admiration, recognition, and praise, I have omitted
the mentioned phrases for the sake of continuity.
