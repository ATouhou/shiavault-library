Nominative Cases of a Noun: The Actor
=====================================

26. What is an actor?  
 An actor is a noun that is mentioned after an active verb and indicates
the doer of the verb. For example: **لَعِبَ** **الصَّغیرُ** (the child
played.)

27. How many kinds of actors are there?  
 An actor can be:  
 • A clear noun, for example: **طَلَعَتِ** **الشّمسُ** (The sun rose.)

• A mentioned pronoun, for example: **نَجَحتُ** **في** **الامتحانِ** (I
passed the exam.)

• An implied pronoun, for example: **التِّلمیذُ** **المجتهد** **یَنجحُ**
(A hardworking student will succeed.)

• An verb that is changed into the infinitive form because of the *an*
preposition, for example:

**بَلَغني** **أنَّکَ** **نَجَحتَ** (It has reached me that you have been
saved.)

28. Does the verb remain the same if the actor is feminine?  
 If the actor is feminine the verb is made feminine:  
 • in the preterite tense by adding a vowel-less *tā'* to the end of the
verb. For example: **سافَرَت** **مَریمُ** (Maryam travelled.)

• in the aorist tense by adding the feminine letter to the beginning of
the verb. For example:

**تُسافرُ** **مریمُ** (Maryam is travelling.)

29. Does the verb change if the actor is a noun in the dual form?  
 The dual letters are not added to the verb if the actor is a clear noun
in the dual form, rather it remains single. For example: **قام**

 • If the actor is feminine and is separated from the verb, for example:
**سافرت** **أو** **سافر** **الیومَ** **مریمُ** (Maryam traveled today.)

• If the actor is an unnatural feminine, for example: **أثمَرَت** **أو**
**أثمَرَ** **الشَّجَرَةُ** (The tree produced fruit.)

• If the actor is a broken plural, for example: **جاءَت** **أو**
**جاءَ** **الجواري** (The female servants came.)
