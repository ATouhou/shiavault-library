Concluding Remark
=================

I conclude with the remark of Montgomery Watt who says:

“…it is clear that the influence of Islam on western Christendom is
greater than is usually realized. Not merely did Islam share with
Western Europe many material products and technological discoveries; not
merely did it stimulate Europe intellectually in the fields of science
and philosophy; but it provoked Europe into forming a new image of
itself. Because Europe was reacting against Islam it belittled the
influence of Saracens and exaggerated its dependence on its Greek and
Roman heritage. So, today an important task for us western Europeans, as
we move into the era of the one world, is to correct this false emphasis
and to acknowledge fully our debt to the Arab and Islamic world.”
