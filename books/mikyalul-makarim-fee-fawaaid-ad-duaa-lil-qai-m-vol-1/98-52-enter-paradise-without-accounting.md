52. Enter Paradise without accounting
=====================================

That which proves this point is a tradition mentioned in *Tohafful
Uqool,* in the last advice of Imam Ja’far Sadiq (as) to Abdullah bin
Jundab, in which he said:

“Then there will not remain a single person who helped a believer from
our friends with a single word but that the Almighty Allah would make
him enter Paradise without taking his account.”[^1]

The explanation is that: We have repeatedly said that *Dua* is a kind of
helping with the tongue (in words), On the basis of this, those who pray
for an early reappearance of our master, the Master of the Time (aj) are
ones fitting this description most perfectly.
