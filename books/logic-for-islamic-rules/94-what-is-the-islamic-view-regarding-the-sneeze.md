What Is the Islamic View Regarding the Sneeze?
==============================================

**Question:** Has Islam commended that while beginning a particular work
if someone sneezes the work has to be postponed?

**Answer:** There is no such command in Islam and basically the spirit
of Islam does not agree with such superstitions. Rather it commands that
if you are going to begin some work and someone is doing divination
against it, you must not pay attention to that person, you must rely on
Allah and begin your work. Islam has even considered divination a sign
of polytheism.

Although it is commanded with regard to the sneeze that if one of you
sneezed one should utter Alhamdo lillaah (Praise be to Allah) and the
others should say Yarahamokumllaah (May Allah have mercy on you). The
person will then respond with the prayer: Yaghfirullaaha lakum (Allah
shall forgive you).

However, to refrain from doing something or to delay for even a little,
or to discriminate between one or two sneezes are all baseless things.
Therefore a true Muslim should avoid such useless superstitions.
