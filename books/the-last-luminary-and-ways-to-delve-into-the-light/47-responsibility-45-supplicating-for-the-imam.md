Responsibility 45: Supplicating for the Imam
============================================

Another responsibility of the believers is to recite Du’a al-Nudbah[^1]
which has been taught to us by Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad as-Sadiq (as).
This supplication can be recited at any time, however we are told that
it is highly recommended to be recited on the four days of ‘Eid, namely:
the day of Jumu’ah (Friday); ‘Eid al-Fitr; ‘Eid al-Qurban and ‘Eid
al-Ghadir.

According to the opinion of some of our ‘Ulama[^2], it should also be
recited on Thursday night which is another very blessed time. After
reciting this supplication, one should also perform a two Rak’at Salat
of Ziyarat to the Imam.
