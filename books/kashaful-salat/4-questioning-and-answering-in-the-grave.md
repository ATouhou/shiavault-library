Questioning and Answering in the Grave
======================================

When a person dies, we bury him in the grave. Two angels come to him
and put his soul back in his body by the orders of Allah. These angels
will then ask him some questions. If he gives the right answers, the
angels give him the good news of jannah and return back from whence they
came. The blessings of jannah will start for him. If he answers wrongly,
then the angels give him the news of jahannum. The sufferings of
jahunnum will start for him. The angels who come to the kafirs (enemies
of Ahlul Bayt as) are named Munkir and Nunkir.

The angels who come to momin are named Mobashir and Bashir. Ameerul
Momineen (as) comes in the graves to help His Shia with the answering of
the questions. Moula Ali (as) does not pay attention to thos e who were
His enemies. Here are the questions which will be asked in the grave and
their correct replies.

1. Who is your Lord?

Allah is my Lord.
2. What is your religion? Islam is my religion.
3. Who is your prophet? Muhammad (as) is my prophet.
4. Who is your Imam & wali? Ali (as) ibn Abi Talib (as) is my imam and
wali.
5. What is your book?
Quran is my book.
6. What is your Qibla?
Kaaba Khana is my Qibla.

**Punishment in the grave**

The punishment of the grave is when both corners of the grave come
together and crush the body of the deceased. There is no punishment of
the grave for momin.

**Barzakh**

The period from the time of death until the Day of Judgment is called
Barzakh. The human lives there with such a body that is extremely light
and cannot be seen.

**Scale and Bridge**

Mizan is scale. According to some narrations a scale will be fixed on
the day of judgment. The actions of the people will be measured upon
that scale. If one s good deeds is heavier than he will go to jannah. If
one s bad deeds are heavier than he will go to jahannum (hell).

Regarding bridge there are some narrations which say it is such a
bridge that will be sharper than the sword and thinner than the hair.
The momin will easily cross this bridge, but the kafirs (enemies of
Ahlul Bayt as) will be unable to cross it and will fall into the
jahannum (hell). These are traditions, but Masoomeen (as) have told us
what is the truth regarding the scale and bridge.

Moula Ali (as) says, "I am the scale." RasoolAllah (saw) said, "O Ali
(as)! You are Siratul Mustaqeem." So you must remember the scale and
bridge both are our Moula (as), Ameerul Momineen Ali (as) ibn Abi Talib
(as). On the day of judgment, the acts of every person will be measured
against the love and marifat of Moula Ali (as).

**Intercession**

The meaning of shifaat (intercession) is to take one s right of
ownership. So on the day of judgment, Masoomeen (as) will send all of
Their lovers into the jannah (paradise). Shaitan will also take all of
his followers into jahannum (hell) with him.

**Orders**

Allah has ordered us to perform certain acts. These acts are called
awamer (lawful acts). He ordered us to refrain from doing certain acts.
These acts are called nawahi (forbidden acts). Within the acts which are
compulsory and which are forbidden, there are two different kinds
each.

Kinds of Awamer (lawful acts)

1. Wajib: These acts are wajib (compulsory). If we do these, we get
rewarded. If we abandon them, we become sinful. For example, namaz
(prayer), fasting, obedience of one s parents, etc.

2. Mustahab: These acts are those which if you do them you will be
rewarded, but if you do not do them, then you will not become sinful.
For example, mustahab prayers, fasting during the days other than
Ramadan, etc.

**Kinds of Nawahi (forbidden acts)**

1. Haram: This is the opposite of wajib. If you refrain from doing
these acts, you will be rewarded. If you do these acts, you will become
sinful. For example, drinking alcohol and eating pork.

2. Makrooh: This is the opposite of mustahab. If you refrain from doing
these acts, you will be rewarded, but if you commit these acts, you will
not be punished. For example, doing wudhu with such water that is hot
from the sunshine.

There is another thing which is between awamer and nawahi. It is called
mubah. Another name of this is halal.

This is only a permission. It has nothing to do with reward or sin. For
example, eating the meat of cow etc. You have understood the difference
between awamer and nawahi. You should know these are only applicable
upon those who have reached the age of adulthood.

The conditions of adulthood are different for men and women. A boy
becomes an adult (baligh) when one of these three signs appears; when he
is 15 yrs old, he has wet dreams, or when the hair grows under his
belly. A girl becomes an adult (baligh) when one of these two signs
appears; when she reaches 9 yrs old or sees the blood of menses
(children should consult their parents for the details of these
signs).

**Rules of Purity**

Tahirat (purity) is the process of cleaning to remove those filths as
determined by Islamic laws. It is necessary to know what those
impurities and filths are.

Filth is such a thing which is impure itself and makes whatever it
touches also becomes impure.

It can never become pure. Some things are pure by their own nature, but
after touching some filth, they become impure themselves. These things
can become pure again.

T hese things are filths:

1. Nasibi (one who hates the lovers of Ahlul Bayt as)
2. Mushrik (polytheist)
3. Kafir (disbeliever)
4. Urine
5. Feces
6. Semen
7. Deceased
8. Blood which squirts from the animal
9. Dogs
10. Pigs
11. Alcohol and all intoxicants
12. Perspiration of that animal which eats filth

In or der to make those things pure again which have become impure from
touching these filths, one must follow one of sever al methods, but
these methods cannot be explained here. It is the duty of the parents to
inform their children regarding matters of tahirat (purity). If they
need any help in explaining, they should read our book "Kashaful
Ahkam".

**Rules of wudhu**

Before we can explain the rules of namaz (prayer), we must first
explain those things which are compulsory to do before the prayer can be
performed. The first thing is tahirat (cleanliness). When you go for
prayer, your body, dress, and the place where you will perform your
prayers must be clean. After tahirat, the second most important thing is
wudhu (ablution).

The following are compulsory for performing wudhu:

1. Niyyat (intention): There is a niyyat (intention) for wudhu the same
way there is a niyyat for all other aspects of religion. Niyyat
(intention) is related to one s heart. It is not compulsory to say the
words out loud. It is enough to make one s intention in one s heart. You
should make this intention before performing wudhu: " I am doing wudhu
for removing any impurity and to make my pr ayer mubah. W ajib qurbatan
illallah".

2. Water for wudhu must be tahir (pure). It should not be mixed with
anything which will change its color or taste. However, if the color and
the taste of water changes on its own, then you can do wudhu with this
type of water. If pure water is available, then you cannot do wudhu with
water whose color has changed on its own.

3. You should be the owner of the water. It should not be usurped from
another. If you are not the owner, then you must obtain the permission
of the owner before using it.

4 . You should be the owner of the place in which you are performing
wudhu. It should not be usurped from another. If you are not the owner,
then you must obtain the permission of the owner before using it.

5. Before performing wudhu, your body, dress, and the place where you
are going to pray must be pak (clean).

6. The pot which you are using for wudhu should not be made from silver
or gold. It should not be usurped from any other. No picture should be
printed upon the pot.

7. You should perform the wudhu yourself without the help of any other.
However, if there is a reason you are unable to perform wudhu by
yourself, then you can obtain the help of another.

8. The water must completely cover all of those parts which are
included in wudhu. If there is an obstacle, i.e. ring etc., then it
should be removed befor e performing wudhu.

9. You should not talk during wudhu.

**Method of wudhu**

1. Before performing wudhu, it is mustahab (recommended) to wash the
wrists twice, to rinse your mouth three times, and rinse your nose three
times. If you do not do this, it has no effect on your wudhu.

2. After this make your niyyat (intention) for wudhu.

3. Take the water in your right hand and wash your face. The boundaries
of the face are above one s forehead from the hair line until under one
s chin and the part which is covered by your thumb and middle finger as
you are wiping your face. Start washing at your forehead and stop at
your chin. Make sure none of the parts of your face which are included
in the wudhu should remain dry. In order to ensure your whole face is
wet, you can wipe your face more than once, but you must be careful not
to go beyond the boundaries of what is included in wudhu such as your
neck or side of the head.

4. Wash your right arm from the elbow to your fingertips. Only use one
handful of water.

5. Wash your left arm from your elbow to your fingertips. Use one
handful of water. When a male washes his arms, the inside of the arm
(palm face down) being washed should be down towards the floor. When a
female washes, the inside of her arm (palm face up) should be facing
up.

6. After this use three fingers of your right hand to wash your head
from the crown until the point where the hair touches one s forehead.
Using two fingers is not enough.

7. Use your right hand to wipe the top of your right foot.

8. Use your left hand to wipe the top of your left foot.

The method for wiping one s feet is to place your palm on your toes and
drag it towards your ankle. You c annot wipe your feet with your
fingers. While wiping one s head and feet, you should remember to only
move your hands. Do not move your head and feet.

You must remember a male will do wudhu without covering his head, but a
female must cover her head for doing wudhu. When a female wipes her
head, she should put her hand under the scarf so it touches her head.
However, when a female does wudhu for fajr and maghrib, she should
remove her scarf.

**Things which invalidate wudhu**

There are seven things which invalidate one s wudhu.

1. Urine
2. Feces
3. Semen
4. Passing gas
5. Unconsciousness caused by sleep, however if one is aware enough to
recognize voices around him, then it will not invalidate his wudhu
6. Intoxication
7. Unconsciousness caused by other than sleep

You should remember vomiting, nose bleeds, nail cutting, hair cutting,
and loud laughing do not invalidate wudhu. If a bone is broken and
covered by a plaster cast which cannot be made wet, then you do not have
to make the broken area wet. In this condition, the wudhu remains
valid.

**Tayyamum**

When no water is available for you to do wudhu, then you must do
Tayyamum. There are a few conditions one must meet before being able to
perform tayyumam.

1. After searching but being unable to find water
2. If you have only enough water for drinking purposes, then you can do
tayyumam. If you do not have enough water for both removing your thirst
and performing wudhu, then you may keep the water for drinking and
instead perform tayyamum.
3. When water is unclean and can harm your health
4. When the time for prayer will finish before you can complete your
wudhu, then you can perform tayyamum.

**Method of Tayyamum**

The method of tayyamum is first you make this intention: "I am
performing tayyamum instead of wudhu wajib qurbatan illallah".

Then immediately strike both of your hands on clean soil or clay. Then
wipe both of your palms. Wipe your whole forehead fr om where the hair
touches the forehead. After this again strike both hands in the soil. W
ipe your hands together from the wrists until the tips of your fingers.
First the right hand, then the left hand. Keep these points in your
mind. First tayyumam can only be performed with pak (clean), dry soil or
clay.

If it is not available, then you cannot substitute any other kind of
soil or clay in its place. If clean soil or clay is unavailable, then
you can perform tayyumam on a pak piece of cloth which contains dust
that is pak (clean). Apart from this, you can also perform tayyumam on
wet clay, but not on ashes. Secondly, you can perfor m many prayers
after making tayyumam once the same way you can with wudhu because
tayyumam is a substitute for wudhu.

**Rules of Namaz (prayer)**

Of all the acts which were made wajib (compulsory) upon us, the
greatest is namaz (prayer). Prayer reminds man that he is a slave of
someone, he was created by someone, and he is dependent on someone. In
upcoming topics, we will tell you about the true reality and purpose of
prayer. Here we are writing those rules and method of prayer which were
told to us by Masoomeen (as). You should keep in your mind that in Quran
Allah has placed three types of obedience upon us. As it is stated in
Quran, "Obey Allah, RasoolAllah (saw),

and Olil Amr (Imam as)". Obeying any other than these three is haram
(forbidden) and shirk fil ibadaat (shirk in worship). It does not matter
whether your actions are good or bad. It only matters whose obedience
you are in. Even if you are doing good deeds, but you are doing them
without obeying Allah, RasoolAllah (saw), or Imam (as), then you are
worshiping shaitan. If this same act is being performed under the
obedience of Allah, RasoolAllah (saw), and Imam (as), then it is the
worship of Allah. Whenever you have any problems, always look for its
solution in the sayings of Allah. If you follow the fatwa of non masoom,
then you will be opposing Allah and placing yourself in destruction.

There are a few aspects of prayer which are wajib (compulsory) to be
performed. If you do not perform these acts, then your prayer is
invalid. Apart from these acts, all other acts are mustahab
(recommended) and do not invalidate one s prayer if they are not
performed. It does not mean you should intentionally not perform them.
These are the wajib acts of prayer.

1. Timing of prayer
2. Tahirat (wudhu)
3. Facing towards Qibla
4. Absolute attention. Your attention should not be diverted during
prayer.
5. Rukoo
6. Sajda (prostration)
7. Recitation of Hamd and another sura

**Timing of prayer**

In Quran, Allah has mentioned three timings for prayer; morning,
afternoon, and night. There are five prayers which we perform during
these three time periods; fajr (dawn), zuhr (noon), asr (afternoon),
maghrib (evening), and isha (night). We will explain the timing of each
individual prayer. You must remember if the time has passed you can
still perform the prayer.

However, you cannot perform any pr ayer before its time. If someone
performs prayer befor e the time has come, their prayer will be invalid,
and he must repeat his prayer. You must be aware of the timings for
prayer. Remember this always and make sure you never perform a prayer
before its correct time. Timing for fajr (morning prayer)

The time for fajr starts when the brightness of morning spreads across
the sky and light starts to appear. This prayer can be performed before
the sunrise. Time for zuhr (noon prayer)

The time for zuhr (noon prayer) begins when the sun reaches at the
point where a shadow becomes equal to one s hand Time for asr (afternoon
prayer)

The time for asr (afternoon prayer) begins with the zuhr prayer. Zuhr
must be performed before the asr prayers. If anyone performs asr prayers
before performing zuhr prayers, then he must repeat his asr prayers.
Both prayers can be performed before sunset.

Time for maghrib (evening prayer) The time of maghrib begins as soon as
the sun has set and the redness has disappeared from the sky. Time for
isha (night prayer)

The time of isha prayer starts at the time of maghrib prayer. The
maghrib prayer must be performed before the isha prayer. If anyone
performs isha before maghrib, then he must perform his isha prayer
again. Isha pr ayer can be performed until midnight. If someone
mistakenly performs asr before zuhr or isha before maghrib, but realizes
his mistake before he finishes the whole prayer, he can change his
niyyat and his prayer will remain valid.

We have previously explained the rules of tahirat and wudhu. There fore
we will not repeat them here.

**Facing towards Qibla**

It is wajib (compulsory) to face the Khana Kaaba when one is performing
prayer. If a person deliberately does not face towards the Kaaba, not
only does it invalidate his prayers, but he becomes a jahannumi (one
destined to hellfire).

If someone mistakenly or unintentionally does not face Kaaba and
performs his prayer and later comes to know the correct direction of
Qibla, then he should repeat his prayer if time is remaining. If the
time has finished, his prayer is valid and does not need to repeat it.

If a person believes he is facing Qibla, but after performing his
prayer he realizes he was slightly turned in the wrong direction, his
prayer is valid.

If a person is unable to know the true direction of Qibla, then he may
perform his prayer while facing any direction.

Adhan and Iqama (calls to prayer)

It is mustahab to perform adhan and iqama before performing one s
prayer regardless if one is in a gathering or alone. However there is no
adhan or iqama for females.

Method of Adhan Recite the following:

Allahu Akbar (God is the greatest) four times Ashhadu al la ilaha illa
"llah ( I testify there is no god other than Allah ) two times Ashhadu
anna Muhammadar rasoolullah (I testify that Muhammad (saw) is the
messenger of Allah ) two times Ashhadu anna Ameerul Momineen wa Imam ul
Muttaqeen Aliyun waliullah wasi rasoolullah wa khalifatul bil fasaal ( I
testify that Ali (as) is the master of all believers, leader of all the
pious, and the wali of Allah, successor of RasoolAllah (saw) and nothing
shall come between Them ) two times Hayya ala salah (Hasten to prayer )
two times Hayya ala falah ( Hasten to salvation) two times

Hayya ala kharyi "l "amal (Hasten to the best of actions) two times
Allahu Akbar (God is the greatest) two times La ilaha illa "llah (There
is no god except Allah) two times
