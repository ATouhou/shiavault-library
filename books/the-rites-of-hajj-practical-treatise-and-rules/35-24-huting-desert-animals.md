24. Huting desert animals
=========================

Article 164
-----------

Hunting desert animals or slaughtering them is Haraam in the state of
Ihram, also hunting of birds is Haraam in this state and there is no
difference that a Muhrim hunts alone or with the help of the others.
Also pointing and referring the animal to the hunter, or tying and
keeping the animal or eating the meat of a hunted animal (although
another person has hunted or the Muhrim has hunted that animal before
Ihram) are Haraam.

Article 165
-----------

Killing grasshoppers is not permitted for a Muhrim, therefore if he/she
is passing a way in which there are grasshoppers, then he/she should
change his/her way if it is possible, and if it is not he/she should be
aware not to trample them. But it has no problem in inevitable case or
if it causes strong hardness and discomfort, also the killing of harmful
animals like snakes, scorpions and ferocious animals is permitted when
they cause danger.

Article 166
-----------

Zebh of livestock and farm animals like cow, sheep and camel has no
problem in the state of Ihram.

Article 167
-----------

Hunting sea animals is permitted for Muhrim.

**Article 168**

A specific atonement had been defined for killing any desert animals.
But because today this act is not common, we abstain from mentioning
that matter in order not to lengthen the discussion.
