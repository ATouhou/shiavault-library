The Ahl'ul Sunnah Wa' Al Jamaah Fatwa On the Nasibis
====================================================

**Imam of the Ahl'ul Sunnah Shah Abdul Aziz's fatwa that Nasibis are
equal to dogs and pigs
The high-ranking Sunni scholar Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlavi writes:**

"The Ulema of Ahl'ul Sunnah regard the enemies of Ali, the Nasibis as
the worst party, that recites the Shahada. We regard them as equivalent
to dogs and pigs". "Taufa Ithna Ashari" page 6 Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlavi
(Sohail Academy publishers)

Interestingly the Nasibi Ulema declare that you cannot drink from the
bowl that the Shi'a have drunk from, but if a dog drinks from that same
vessel you can. The rationale behind this fatwa is quite poignant in
light of Shah's comments, after all 'birds of a feather flock together'.
Those compared to dogs (Nasibis) will no doubt share water with their
brethren. Dehlavi was of course pointing to the fact that Nasibis are
Nijis (impure) in the same way that dogs and pigs are.

**Imam of Ahl'ul Sunnah Shah Abdul Aziz's fatwa
that the Nasibi ideology is Kufr
Shah Abdul Aziz further writes:**

"To suggest that there were no objections raised against Hadhrath Ali -
by the Nasibis and Khawariji's is incorrect, because the Khawarij and
Nasibi like their black cursed faces have likewise blacked many pages.
To make references to their kufr here would be disrespectful; it is only
permissible [to repeat such comments] under duress".

"Taufa Ithna Ashari" page 227 Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlavi (Sohail Academy
publishers) It is sufficient hear to say that one group has turned its
back on the Family of the Prophet (s) and that group are the Nasibis. A
peculiar trait of Nasibis is that they portray sympathies towards the
Sahaba so as to gain acceptance from the Ahl'ul Sunnah.

They will praise the Sahaba whilst at the same time disrespecting the
Prophet (s) and his family. They will begin by attacking the companions
and will then attribute what they have just said to the Shi'a - so as to
pass kufr fatwas on them. It is so simple to declare Takfir on someone
nowadays, that no one evades the Nasibi net, and they even have the
audacity to declare that the esteemed parents of Prophet (s) were
Kaafir.

**The Nasibis slander against Allah (swt)**

The Salafee/Nasibi belief that Allah (swt) is the root source
of acts of polytheism, fornication and homosexuality
In the recognised Ahl'ul Sunnah work "Fiqa-e-Akbar" we read:

"To become Muslim it is obligatory that one believes that all good and
evil, pious and bad deeds all come from Allah (swt)".

"Fiqa-e-Akbar" page 13 by Imam 'Abu Hanifa

May Allah (swt) forgive us! This means that Man is helpless and has no
control over his actions, all acts are from Allah (swt) man is just a
tool like a pen, sword or bike. It is left to Allah (swt) to use these
tools and man has absolutely no discretion. Taking this to its logical
conclusion, this Fatwa means that Allah (swt) murdered Hadhrath
Uthman;

Allah (swt) issued Hadhrath Hafsa with the utterance of 'first'
divorce. Furthermore, it means that every brothel in the world is run by
Allah (swt), and that acts of kufr, polytheism, fornication,
homosexuality, child abuse, robbery, theft, drinking etc are all
arranged by Allah (swt). This likewise also means that Allah (swt) also
wills chants raised against the Sahaba. This is the faith of the
Nasibis.

The Nasibis Fatwa that Allah (swt) is in hell (God forbid) We read the
following in Sahih al-Bukhari:

The Prophet (saws) said, "The people will be thrown into the (Hell)
Fire and it will say: 'Are there any more (to come)?(50:30) till Allah
puts his foot over it and it will say 'Qat! Qat!" (Enough! Enough!)"

"Sahih al Bukhari" Arabic-English Volume 6 hadith number 371 translated
by Dr Muhsin Khan Is there anything more disgraceful than to believe
that Allah (swt) will be in hell on the Day of Judgement? If one part of
Allah (swt) then he is in hell.

Not only is Allah (swt) given physical attributes the Nasibis even give
Allah (swt) human characteristics, with the Indian Imam of the Nasibis
Shah Ismail Shaheed writing that "one cannot rule out the possibility
that Allah (swt) can forget" (1) (Allah forbid) when Allah (swt)
declares in Surah Tauba verse 28 that he is Allah is "All-Knowing
All-Wise". Even more outrageous is the Nasibi Rashid Ahmad Gangohi's
fatwa; namely that "Allah can tell a lie".

1. "Yak Rowza" (Farsi), by Shah Ismail Shaheed page 217
2. "Fataawa Rasheediyah" Vol 1, page 19

This is the belief of the Nasibis who proudly declare that they have
been blessed with the correct belief and love for their Creator - and
what a fine belief it is to one in which every bad thing even
homosexuality and fornication is being caused by Allah (swt), He (swt)
can forget and will be in Hell on the Day of Judgement. Rather than
concealing this, they pride themselves with this disgraceful concept of
Tauheed. Their sermons are littered with reference to tauheed and how
simply man can stoop in to shirk, and yet at the same time they believe
that Allah (swt) has a physical body and that he will be in hell on the
Day of Judgement.

**Do these beliefs constitute a correct belief in tauheed?**

They say that seeking the help of anybody via an intermediary is Shirk
and scorn the Shi'a for saying "Ya 'Ali Madad" (Ali help me). If asking
'Ali (as) for help is kufr then we are only following the ways of the
Salaf, Hadhrath Umar constantly sought the help of 'Ali, was he
committing Shirk by doing so? Moreover, the hypocrisy of the Salafees is
clear, when Saddam Husayn invaded Kuwait, rather than cling to Tauheed
and seek Allah (swt) for protection the Saudi Nasibis had the audacity
to call upon the Americans (not Allah swt) for help, in doing so they
had no shame in bringing Kafirs onto the holy land. Saying "Ya Ali
Madad" is Kufr saying "Ya America Madad" is permissible!

Despite these disgraceful beliefs they pass kufr fatwas on Shia's!

**The Nasibis slander of the Qur'an**

**Nasibis fatwa declaring it permissible
to write the Qur'an with urine

A reputed scholar from this camp Qazi Khan unashamedly writes that:**

"There is no sin if you write the Qur'an with urine, blood or on the
skin of a dead animal". Fatawi Qazi Khan page 780 "Chapter al Khathur"

These Nasibis proudly proclaim themselves to be defenders of the
Qur'an. Is this 'respect' for Allah (swt)'s Holy Book? May Allah (swt)
disgrace these people for stating such blasphemy! One wonders how they
arrived at this conclusion.Since they have an obsession with adhering to
the practices of the Sahaba can they furnace any evidence that any of
them wrote the Qur'an with urine? Then again these are the descendants
of Mu'awiya who showed his respect for Allah (swt)'s Book by raising it
on a lance during the battle of Sifeen!

**Nasibis absurd assertion that to
kiss the Holy Qur'an is wrong
Curiously in the recognised "Al Dhur al Mukhthar" their scholars
proclaim:**

"To kiss the Qur'an is wrong".

"Al Dhur al Mukhthar" page 55, Volume 4

This is the belief of the Nasibis of the self-proclaimed protectors of
the Qur'an. In the same way the illegitimate child tries to hide his
lineage these Nasibis try to hide the Fatwas of their Mufti's. Their
respect for the Qur'an is less than the respect they afford their wives.
On the one hand they assert that kissing one's wife is permissible and
yet they assert that kissing the Qur'an is wrong. Writing the Qur'an
with urine is permissible,

whilst kissing the Qur'an is not, what a fine belief! Would any Muslim
have the audacity to 'think' such filth let alone put pen to paper and
declare it a fatwa? Certainly not, in Muslim homes the world over Allah
(swt)'s book is given the respect it deserves, not touched until Wudhu
is made, placed at a high place, kissed when touched, and yet these so
called defenders of the Qur'an allege that it is permissible to write
the Qur'an - Allah (swt)'s words with urine! What would a Kaffir think
if he came across such a fatwa? Would he not ask himself 'is this the
respect that the Muslims give to a Book they deem to be God's word?' May
Allah's curse be upon these so-called scholars whose disrespect of the
Qur'an, exceeds no bounds.

**Nasibi slander that Shi'a ascribe tahreef to the Holy Qur'an**

Generation after generation of Nasibi has spewed the same vomit to his
followers as "proof" that Shi'as are kafirs. The proof lies in the fact
that traditions of tahreef can be located in Shi'a texts. Not only have
the Shi'a Ulema rejected these traditions the Nasibis should no that
there is a difference between tahreef traditions and basing one's
aqeedah on those traditions. It should be stated that the ultimate
standard to determine the authenticity of hadith is the Qur'an, if it
conflicts with Allah (swt)'s Book it must be disguarded (1).

Allah takes the responsibility of protection himself when He (swt)
states: This is also confirmed by al-Kulayni, compiler of al-Kafi from
where the Nasibis cite the tahreef traditions to the illiterate
faithful. In the introduction to al-Kafi he states: "Brother, may God
lead you to the right road. You ought to know that it is impossible for
anyone to distinguish the truth from the untruth when Muslim scholars
disagree upon statements attributed to the Imams. There is only one way
to separate the true from the untrue reports, through the standard which
was declared by the Imam:"Test the various reports by the Book of God;
whatever agrees with it take it, whatever disagrees with it reject it"


"Certainly We revealed the Reminder and certainly We shall preserve
it." (The Holy Qur'an 15: 9)

When Allah (swt) provides a guarantee that it is protected any hadith
of tahreef automatically has to be rejected. Despite this quite logical
fact the pathetic Nasibis have insisted on declaring Shi'as on account
of tahreef traditions they are in effect forcing us to accept that these
traditions are a part of aqeedah. Well Nasibis if Shi'as are kaffir on
this ground then so are Ahl'ul Sunnah lead by those beloved Sahaba you
seek to defend to the hilt!

**Hadhrath Umar's saying that the current Qur'an is incomplete**

In Sahih Al-Bukhari Volume 8, pages 209-210, we read this sermon
delivered by Hadhrath Umar during his last Hajj as Khalifa: "Certainly
Allah sent Muhammad with the truth, and revealed to him the Book. One of
the revelations which came to him was the verse of stoning. We read it
and understood it. "The Messenger of God stoned and we stoned after him.
I am concerned that if time goes on, someone may say, 'By God, we do not
find the verse of stoning in the Book of God;' thus, the Muslims will
deviate by neglecting a commandment the Almighty revealed.

"Stoning is in the Book of God. It is the right punishment for a person
who commits adultery if the required witnesses are available, or there
was pregnancy without marriage or adultery is admitted."

Again, we used to read in what we found in the Book of God:

"Do not deny the fatherhood of your fathers in contempt because it is
disbelief on your part to be ashamed of the fatherhood of your fathers."
So Nasibis, tell us where has this verse on stoning gone? Al-Muttaqi
'Ali bin Husam al-Din in his book "Mukhtasar Kanz al-'Ummal" printed on
the margin of Imam Ahmad's Musnad, Volume 2, page 2, in his hadith about
chapter 33, said that Ibn Mardawayh reported that Hudhayfah said:

'Umar said to me 'How many verses are contained in the chapter of
al-Ahzab?' I said, '72 or 73 verses.' He said it was almost as long as
the chapter of the Cow, which contains 287 verses, and in it there was
the verse of stoning.

The revered Sunni scholar al Hafidh Jalaladeen as Suyuti writes:

"Hadhrath Umar said at the Saqifa that the Qur'an has 1,027,000
letters". "Tafsir al Itqan" by as Suyuti, page 88

The present Qur'an has 267,033 letters. According to Hadhrath Umar's
research the Qur'an should have approximately 90 parts. We should
console the Nasibis at their heavy loss - having lost 60 parts of the
Qur'an! They themselves advocate that anyone that says the Qur'an has
verses missing is a Kaffir thus a verdict on Hadhrath Umar in the light
of the above narration will suffice as the final nail in the coffin for
them. Perhaps the Nasibis should stop passing fatwas on the Shi'a and
focus on Hadhrath Umar! As the saying goes "Those living in glass houses
should not throw stones".

Abdullah ibne Umar's similar Fatwa that the Qur'an is incomplete Suyuti
also records the following:

"No one can proclaim that I have found the Qur'an complete because most
of the Qur'an has been lost".

"Tafsir Duure Manthur" as-Suyuti Volume 1 page 104

Nasibis swiftly pass kufr on the Shi'a claiming that we believe that
the Qur'an is incomplete, whilst they have traditions that suggest that
the belief of Hadhrath Umar and his son. If anyone states that to
declare tahreef in the Qur'an makes you a Kaffir then there exist many
personalities who are accredited by them as Imams who believed in
tahreef.

The Nasibi Scholar Maulana Anwar Shah's Fatwa,
that there is Tahreef in the Qur'an
The famous Hadith scholar of the Deobandis Syed Anwar Shah Kashmiri in
his recognised Ahl'ul Sunnah work "Fayz ul Bari" writes:

"It is my analysis based on Sahih al-Bukhari that the Qur'an has
tahreef with regards to words and this was an accredited to Hadhrath
Uthman's party as an unintentional or intentional mistake".

"Fayz ul Bari" Anwar Shah page 395 Volume 3 under the Chapter "As
Shah'adhat" Maulana Shah has cut the nose of the Deobandi Nasibis
without even using a knife! There is no limit to the Nasibis lack of
respect. If those who believe in Tahreef are Kaffir then this is aqeedah
of the companions and their learned Ulema.

**The Nasibis belief in Iman**

The Nasibi ruling that having sex with one's mother and murdering one's
father does not lessens one's faithIn the ancient authoritative text of
the Ahl'ul Sunnah "Tarikh al Baghdad", the author Khatib al-Baghdadi
records the following:

"Imam 'Abu Hanifa was asked about the Iman of a man who fornicates with
his mother, murders his father, and drinks alcohol over his skull. The
Imam replied 'He is a Momin".

"Tareekh e Baghdad" page 374 Volume 13, Chapter "Dhikr Numan"

Now ponder over the reply from the Imam of the Deobandi's! If someone
has sex with his mother his faith remains unaffected! There are
different levels of one being a Muslim - based on one's actions. A fasiq
is a transgressor, a fajir is one who commits debauchery - both are
Muslim in that they proclaim the Shahada but so disgraceful are their
actions that they fall in to these categories. A true sincere believer
is a momin. If copulating with one's mother and killing ones father is
the act of a momin (a sincere believer) what does one need to do to
become a fasiq or fajir? Are these examples a momin? Notice the Nasibi
contradiction here, those who disrespect the Sahaba are kafir whereas
those who sleep with their mothers, kill their fathers making trophies
out of their skulls are Momin - the top rank of believer.

**The Nasibis attack on the Prophet [saww]**

The Nasibis Fatwa that the Prophet
(s) was a Kaafir (God forbid!)
The famous Sunni scholar Fakhradin al Razi writes:

"Some Nasibis believe that in the beginning the Prophet (saws) was a
Kaafir. Then Allah (swt) guided him and made him a Prophet. Allamah
Qalbee says, "This verse that you were saved means that he was
misguided, the Kaafir people had made him a Kaafir. Then Allah (swt)
guided him to the path of Tauheed. Allamah Sudi states that the Prophet
(saws) followed the faith of his Kaafir people for forty years".

Tafsir al Kabir by Fakhradin al Razi, page 424 Volume 8 paragraph 30

It is about this same Sudi, that Shah Abdul Aziz comments that:

"Sudi Kabeer who wrote "Mothabeen wa saqaat" was an Ahl'ul Sunnah
scholar who was a trustworthy pious predecessor".

"Taufa Ithna Ashari" by Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlavi, page 30

Trustworthy pious predecessor means he was amongst those that the
Nasibis would call the Salaf who they venerate. Its widely known fact
that the obvious if from Allah (swt) /the hidden is from Shaythan and
this applies to the Nasibi Ulema. Do not be fooled by their long beards
nor fear their kaffir Fatwas on the Shi'as because they are the
illiterate fools who have disrespected the Prophet through their absurd
research. Their DNA is made up of Kufr; they are so quick at passing
kufr Fatwas they even pass them on the Prophet (s). These Nasibis that
have no shame at attacking the Prophet, will naturally have no qualms
about attacking the Shi'a. In the same way these verdicts don't harm the
Prophet their verdicts don't harm the Shi'a either.

The main accusation is we curse the Sahaba hence we are kaffir we say
that these Nawasib curse the Prophet and hence are kaffir. If the world
makes these Fatwas the foundation of Islam then no Muslim will remain on
the earth, because no sect / religion / scholar / leader not even the
Prophet (s) evades their Takfir Fatwas.
