Question 66: Does The Prophet Also Seek Counsel?
================================================

**Question:** When the Holy Prophet (S) was in contact with the Almighty
Allah, why did he need to seek counsel from his companions in martial
and social affairs? The Almighty Allah has commanded to him in the 38th
ayat of Surah Shura that in this matter it is necessary for him to seek
advice and counsel. When he was the most wise and knowledgeable of all.
Why did the almighty command him to seek counsel?

**Answer:** These types of questions are replied to in the Holy Qur’an.
Then it is said that:

“***Certainly you have in the Apostle of Allah an excellent
exemplar.***”[^1]

Thus the aim of Counsel was education and training and the Holy Prophet
(S) sought the advice of his companions thus giving them practical
lesson so that after him they would sit together to discuss difficult
matters and after consultation may search for the solution of difficult
matters.

Also when the most intelligent and accomplished person did not refrain
from consulting his companions and family from the experience and advice
of other the followers of his religion must take him as an exemplar and
act in the same way for solving difficulties. And they must not decide
according to their personal whims and fancies. (It is obvious that
consultation can only be in the matters regarding whom no absolute
command is issued from the Almighty).
