The main point of discussion:
=============================

The discussion is not only about a woman, but a mother as well as a
wife. Naturally in such a book, weâ€™d better allocate the main course of
our discussion to the character of women and analyze their status more,
and if any criticism is posed, it does not mean that such grounds do not
exist in men.

According to the model that we have; i.e. Fatima (peace be upon her),
and other Islamic models, it must be stated that our women have a long
way to go. On the other hand, they have to make great changes in their
minds and policies, specify their aims, present a complete program to
set themselves free from being a means, and extinguish the burning blaze
of passion towards them. Their views and ideologies must be generally
reformed towards the worldly life; grand attributes must be emerged and
confirmed in them; the elevation of soul must be fortified in them; and
they must attain futurology, stout hearts, courage and high opinions. In
this case, their insights, functions, and social responsibilities based
on the Islamic rules are fairly regarded.

Unfortunately, Some of the women have not attained the above-mentioned
factors yet, and if they have, it is insufficient. They have not known
their duties well, their ways and methods are not specified, and in
general, their situations are not desirable as it should be.
