Conclusion
==========

The beginning of Islam is not separate from the beginning of Shí'ism; it
started with the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad al-Mustafa (s.a.w.), and has
been preserved in its origin form by the Imams of Ahlul Bayt (a.s.).

The Prophet presented the message of Islam in the *da'wat dhu
'l-'ashíra* and also introduced 'Ali as "my brother, my successor, and
my caliph." And then just a few months before his death, in the biggest
gathering of his life, at Ghadír Khumm, the Prophet clearly appointed
'Ali as the *mawla* (the master, the leader) of the *ummah.* In between
the *da'wat* and Ghadír Khumm, the Prophet introduced 'Ali to the people
in various occasions. The appointment of 'Ali for imamat and khilafat
was explicit and clear.

'Ali and the Imams from among his descendants are *the* Ahlul Bayt in
the Qur'anic term. Loving and honouring them is an Islamic duty of all
Muslims. The Ahlul Bayt have been vested by Allah with the *wilayat* in
the broadest sense of the word, and that also includes the *'ilmu
'l-ghayb.*
