They are very strict especially Zuwars holding Tanzanian, Kenyan,
Ugandan, Indian, Pakistani and Shri Lankan passports.

You must obtain your Visa from the country of your residence before you
proceed to Syria. If you are going to go to Baitul-Muqaddas and or Iraq
then please make sure that you have multiple visas for Jordan otherwise

responsible for obtaining your visa.
