  What is feminism? What does it have in common with Islam? What is the
  position of the Islamic law regarding the feminist issues? What is
  considered oppression from Islamic point of view? The present book will
  answer all the above mentioned questions and at the same time it will
  clarify the role of the women in Islam. This book is also a good source
  of information and logical explanation for all the people out there who
  keep insisting that women are oppressed and that the Islamic rules
  should be changed.
