Truthfulness
============

***“Speak truthfully so that Allah may reform your deeds”*** (Surah
al-Ahzab, 33:70)

Truthfulness is one of the most basic things for the establishment of
mutual social relations. Islam has, therefore, attached much importance
to truthfulness as a moral value and the Holy Qur'an has mentioned it on
various occasions.

People trust a man who speaks rightly and truthfully. They hold him in
esteem and accept every word of his to be correct.

On the other hand, if a man tells lies and talks foolishly and
extravagantly, he loses credit in the eyes of the people and Almighty
Allah is also displeased with him.

If we always talk wisely and are truthful, Allah helps us in doing good
and useful things, and in leading a prosperous life. We should always
remember that truthfulness is the basis of one's dignity and honour.
