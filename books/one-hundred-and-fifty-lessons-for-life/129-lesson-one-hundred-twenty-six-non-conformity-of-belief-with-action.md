Lesson One Hundred Twenty Six: Non Conformity Of Belief With Action
===================================================================

Imam ‘Ali Ibn Husayn (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلا وَ إِنَّ أَبْغَضُ النّاسِ اِلَى اللّهِ مَنْ يَقْتَدىِ بِسُنَّةِ
اِمام وَ لايَقْتَدىِ بِاَعْمالِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The most hated people before God are those who have accepted leadership
of an Imam but do not follow his actions.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

One of the major faults of man is non conformity of his belief and
actions. He says he believes in something, but no trace of that belief
is observed in his actions.

He believes in God, but he does not practice the discipline required in
his daily life to make his deeds consistent with that belief. He
believes in the great court of God, but has not prepared himself to face
it.

He believes in Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him and his progeny) as
the greatest Prophet and Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) as the highest leader, but he
does not demonstrate any similarity with them by his actions. In short,
his belief points in one direction, and his action in another.
