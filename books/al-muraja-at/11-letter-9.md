**Thul Qi’da 1329**

Do not curb your pen, and do not worry about boring me. I am all ears
listening to you; my chest is wide, and in learning from you, my heart
is at ease and soul in peace and tranquility. All the proofs and
arguments which you have stated made me even more enthusiastic, thus
removing the obstacle of boredom. Send me, therefore, more of your
captivating speech and manifestations of wise genius. I find in your
speech the quest of the wise, and it is thus more saturating to my heart
than crystal­clear cool water; so, let me have more, may Allah bless
your father, and peace be with you.

Sincerely,

Sh
