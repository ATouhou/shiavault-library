given a *kasrah*, for example: **دِرهَم** becomes **دُرَیهِم,** unless
it is connected to a feminine *tā'*, for example: **مهرة** becomes
**مُهَیرَة** or if it is a proper noun or an adjective that ends in an
added *alif* and *nūn*, for example: **سَلمان** becomes **سُلَیمان.**

170. If the second letter of the word is weak and has been changed it
will be changed back to its original form, for example: **باب** becomes
**بُوَیب.**

171. If the weak letter is an *alif* or a *wāw* it will be changed into
a doubled *yā'* in the diminutive form, for example: **عَصا** becomes
**عُصَيٌّ.** If it is a *yā'* it is doubled in the diminutive form, for
example: **جمیل** becomes **جُمَیِّل.**

diminutive form they will be changed into a *yā'*, for example:
