Responsibility 28: Praying for the Protection of the Imam Part 1
================================================================

Another responsibility which a true believer has is to pray for the
protection of Imam al-’Asr (ajtf) from all types of trials and
tribulations which can appear from the Earth or Heavens, and from evil
of the devils among mankind and the Jinn.

The lover of the Imam must supplicate, whenever he is able to, for the
Imam. As we are told, the best time to pray to Allah  is when the
supplications are most readily accepted and these specific times will be
mentioned in the next responsibility.

One of the best supplications which can be read for his protection is
the following short Du’a (which we will mention in detail in the next
responsibility):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَللّٰـهُمَّ كُنْ لِوَلِيِّكَ الْـحُجَّةِ بْنِ الْحَسَنِ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“O’ Allah, be for your deputy (Wali), al-Hujjat b. al-Hasan...”[^1]

[^1]: The entire text of this supplication will be mentioned in the next
responsibility.
