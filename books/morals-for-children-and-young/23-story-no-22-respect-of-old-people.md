Story no. 22: Respect of old people
===================================

Qasim and Abdullah, on seeing their grandfather, went to ask him about
his health (etc). Their grandfather said “You are really good children,
who come to ask about my health . When you will be old, god willing you
will reach high status”. Abdullah said “grandpa, one night we went with
our father to the mosque .There we saw a preacher sitting on the pulpit.
I listened to him. One of his statements was “An old person in his
household, is, like a prophet, a respectful man of his time”.  
 So the lesson is that the way that the prophets were respected in their
times, old people should be respected too.
