Account N. 8 : Nasr B. Muzahim
==============================

Nasr b. Muzahim's monograph is reported in a very limited fashion by
Abu al-Faraj in Maqatil al-Talibiyyin[^43].

He seems to have had two main sources: Abu Mikhnaf, whom he reports on
the authority of his mentor \`Umar b. Sa'd, and Jabir b. Yazid al-Ju'fi,
whom he reports through \`Amr b. Shamir. Nasr b. Muzahim uses both of
these sources in his monograph on the Battle of Siffin. If his full work
had survived, we would have had a much fuller Shi’i version of the
account, as Nasr was himself a Shi’i, and tended to favour the Shi’i
tradition.
