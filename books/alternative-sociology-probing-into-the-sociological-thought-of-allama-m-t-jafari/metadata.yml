description: |
  When one speaks of sociology, places such as the US, UK, Germany, and
  France come to mind. To western or even eastern students of social
  sciences, the very idea that outside Europe and America one could come
  across sociological debates or theoretical debates on socio-cultural
  issues comes as a surprise, to say the least. In this work, the author
  presents the work of Allama M.T. Jafari, an Iranian, contemporary social
  thinker who worked within the parameters of Primordial School of Social
  Theory. This work is an attempt to enrich the existing literature on
  comparative sociology and social philosophy.
