What Is the Meaning of the Words: Everything Will Be Destroyed Except His Face?
===============================================================================

**Question:** Is the human soul annihilated? If you say that it is
incorporeal the verse says that except for Allah everything can be
annihilated. How can you explain this?

**Answer:** We should remember that the word destroy in the verse is not
in the meaning of getting completely annihilated because not only the
human soul, the human body is also not destroyed completely. And after
breaking up it remains in the earth in other substances. On the day of
judgment he would be raised from there.

Thus whether we consider soul incorporeal or not it is not absolutely
destroyable and annihilated. And neither is the human body totally
destroyed. Rather the word Halaak in the verse denotes the
disintegration of the organs and the destruction of the face. Thus this
destruction is that the connection between the body and soul is severed.
And the previous physical parts are disintegrated. Though soul and body
remain separate and exist in some other forms.

Many verses that are revered in connection with the destruction of the
past communities prove the above statement. For example the Almighty
Allah destroyed the People of Aad and Thamud and did not spare anyone
and in the same way He destroyed the People of Nuh.

Obviously in those verses, Aad, Thamud and People of Nuh were destroyed
in the sense that they died and the connection

Â between their bodies and their souls was severed. Therefore they verse:
Everything will be destroyed except His face means that all the living
and non-living things disintegrate and their style undergoes a change
and it is only the Purified Being of Allah which is beyond every type of
change and transformation.
