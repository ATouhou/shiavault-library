‘Allāmah and the Qur’ān
=======================

 

Story n. 1
----------

   
 ‘Allāmah Tabātabā’ī was a live, moving manifestation of Sūra Al-‘Asr
from the Qur’ān. The reality of Sūra Al-‘Asr had settled in him, and he
had a special connection with this blessed chapter of the Qu’rān
(*sūra*). In Tafsīr Al-Mīzan, he says about this sūra: “God Almighty has
elucidated all the learnings of the Qur’ān and all the divine truths and
truths about mankind in the small sūra.”  
    
*Ayatullah Hasanzādeh Āmulī*  
  

Story n. 2
----------

   
 ‘Allāmah Tabātabā’ī was extremely humble and modest in relation to the
Qur’ān. He would usually recite verses of the Qur’ān from memory and
would tell us in which chapters (*sūwar*) those verses were located, and
would also recite verses that were related to that particular verse. The
sessions of Qur’ānic discussion of that late Sayyid [‘Allāmah] were
extremely interesting and informative.  
    
*‘Allāmah Tehrānī*  
  

Story n. 3
----------

   
 I remember once I had the Holy Qur’ān in my hand and a tafsīr in front
of me. I wanted to open another book and at the same time I did not want
the pages of the Qur’ān to close. As a result I placed the Qur’ān behind
me on the ground. ‘Allāmah immediately picked up the Qur’ān and kissed
it and then said to me, *“next time don’t repeat this action”*.  
    
*Hujjatul Islam Mūsawī Hamadānī*  
  

Story n. 4
----------

‘Allāmah would keep awake all the nights of the blessed month of
Ramadhān, and he used to have a great desire to recite the Qur’ān and
would try to recite it out loud.
