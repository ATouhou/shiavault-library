The Division of The Verb Into Passive and Active
================================================

47. What is an active verb?

48. What is a passive verb?

49. How is the form of the verb changed when it becomes passive?

47. An active verb is a verb whose actor is mentioned with it. For
example: **قَطَفَ الوَلَدُ تُفّاحَةً** (the boy picked an apple)

48. A passive verb is a verb whose actor is erased while its objective
compliment takes the actors place. For example: **قُطِفَت تُفّاحَةٌ**
(an apple was picked)

49. A. If the passive verb is in the preterite tense - the letter before
the last letter should be given a *kasrah* and all of the letters before
it that had a vowel should be given a *dummah*. So, **حَفِظَ** would
become **حُفِظَ** (he protected, was protected) and **اِستَعلَمَ** would
become **اُستُعلِمَ** (he inquired, was inquired)

B. If the passive verb is in the aorist tense - the first letter should
be given a *dummah* and the letter before the last should be given a
*fathah*. So, **یَحفَظُ** would become **یُحفَظُ** and **یَستَعلِمُ**
would become **یُستَعلَمُ**
