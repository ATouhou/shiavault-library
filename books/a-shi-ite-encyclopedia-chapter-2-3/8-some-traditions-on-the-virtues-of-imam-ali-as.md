It is also narrated that:

The Prophet (PBUH&HF) said: "There is amongst you a person who will
fight for the interpretation of the Quran just as I fought for its
revelation." The people around him raised their heads and cast
inquisitive glances at the Prophet (PBUH&HF) and at one another. Abu
Bakr and Umar were there. Abu Bakr inquired if he was that person and
the Prophet (PBUH&HF) replied in the negative. Then Umar inquired if he
was that person and the Prophet (PBUH&HF), replied "No. He is the one
who is repairing my shoes (i.e., Ali)."

Abu Said Khudri said: Then we went to Ali and conveyed the good news to
him. He did not even raise his head and remained as busy as he was, as
if he had already heard it from the Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HF)."

are considered to be authentic as stipulated by Bukhari and Muslim]

**The first Muslim**

It is an undisputed fact that Imam Ali was the first man to embrace
Islam after the Holy Prophet (PBUH&HF). Below are some of the references
Ibn Abi Shaybah and Ibn Asakir recorded on the authority of Salim Ibn
Abi Jaad that he said: I asked of Muhammad Ibn Hanifah, "was Abu Bakr
the first of the people to adopt Islam?" He replied: "No".

And Ibn Asakir on a reliable ascription from Muhammad Ibn Sa'd Ibn Abi
Waqqas, that he said to his father Sa'd: "was Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq the
first of you in embracing the faith?" He said: "No, for there were more
than five people in faith before him"

Ibn Kathir says: "it is clear that Muhammad's family believed before
every other - his wife Khadija, his freedman Zaid and the Wife of Zaid
Umm Ayman and Ali and Warakah."

Ali, the son of Abu Talib."
