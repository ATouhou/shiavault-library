In the Prophet's House
======================

After a while, Jibreel came down holding Allah's Order:

*And warn your nearest relations, and be kind to him who follows you of
the believers.*

Allah's Messenger ordered Ali aged ten to invite his tribe, namely Bani
Hashim. Abu Talib, Abu Lahab and others came to the Prophet's house.

When they all had the food, our Master Muhammad [s] said:

*No Arab young man had brought his people like what I've brought you.
I've brought you the good of here and of the hereafter.*

Then, he asked them to believe in Islam. Abu Lahab stood up and said
with spite:

*Muhammad's put a spell on you.*

Abu Talib said angrily:

*Shut up! It's none of your business!*

Abu Talib turned to our Master Muhammad [s] and said:

*Get up and say whatever you like. Spread Your Lord's Mission, for
you're the Truthful, the Trusted one.*

So, our Master Muhammad [s] got up and said:

*My Lord has ordered me to ask you to believe in Him. So, who will
support me in this matter? Who wants to be my brother; my regent, and my
successor after me?*

They kept silent.

So, Ali said eagerly:

*Allah's Apostle, I.*

The Prophet rejoiced and embraced his young cousin while he was weeping.

Bani Hashim stood up. Abu Lahab was laughing and saying sarcastically to
Abu Talib:

*Muhammad's ordered you to hear and obey your son.*

But Abu Talib did not pay attention to him. Rather, he looked angrily at
him.

Abu Talib kindly said to his nephew:

*Go on what Allah's ordered you. By Allah, I'll support and protect
you.*

Our Master Muhammad [s] looked at his uncle respectfully. He felt strong
as long as the Master of Makkah was with him.
