10. In The Last Part Of Every Day
=================================

It is to be noted that a day can be divided into twelve equal parts, and
each part is called an ‘hour’. Every hour is particularly specialized
for praying to one of the Twelve Imams (as) with a particular
supplication. Our righteous scholars have mentioned these supplications
in books of daily worship rituals. They have mentioned that the last
hour of the day is reserved for the Imam of the Age, the hidden leader,
may Allah hasten his reappearance. The following supplication is
recommended for that hour:[^1]

 يا من توحد بنفسه عن خلقه يا من غني عن خلقه بصنعه، يا من عرف نفسه خلقه
بلطفه، يا من سلك بأهل طاعته مرضاته، يا من أعان أهل محبته على شكره، يا
من من عليهم بدينه، ولطف لهم بنائله، أسألك بحق وليك الخلف الصالح بقيتك
في أرضك المنتقم لك من أعدائك وأعداء رسولك، وبقية آبائه الصالحين " محمد
بن الحسن " واتضرع إليك به واقدمه بين يدى حوائجي ورغبتي إليك أن تصلي
على محمد وآل محمد، وأن تفعل بي كذا وكذا وأن تدركني، وتنجيني مما أخاف
واحذر، وألبسني به عافيتك وعفوك، في الدنيا والآخرة، وكن له وليا وحافظا
وناصرا، وقائدا، وكالئا، وساترا، حتى تسكنه أرضك طوعا، وتمتعه فيها طويلا
يا أرحم الراحمين، ولا حول ولا قوة الا بالله العلي العظيم فسيكفيكهم
الله وهو السميع العليم. اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد، أولي الأمر الذين
أمرت بطاعتهم وأولي الارحام الذين أمرت بصلتهم، وذوي القربى الذين أمرت
بمودتهم، والموالي الذين أمرت بعرفان حقهم، وأهل البيت الذين أذهبت عنهم
الرجس، وطهرتهم تطهيرا، أن تصلي على محمد وآل محمد، وأن تفعل بي كذا وكذا

O One Who is unique in Himself from His creatures. O One Who is needless
of His creatures by His being. O One Who has introduced His kindness to
His creatures. O one Who has taken the people of guidance to His
pleasure.

O One Who has helped the people of love to thank Him. O One Whom when
someone prayed to repay his debts, was kind to him. I ask You, by the
right of Your Wali, the righteous successor, Your survivor in Your
earth, Your revenger from Your enemies, enemies of Your prophets and his
righteous forefathers – Muhammad bin al-Hasan – and to make You
satisfied by it and present to You as a request that You bless Muhammad
and the progeny of Muhammad.

And do ‘such and such’ for me.[^2] And grant me respite from that which
I fear. And dress me up in Your relief and forgive me in this world and
the hereafter. And be for him the Wali, and protector, and leader, and
supporter and the veiler till he lives in Your earth for a long time. O
the most merciful of the merciful ones. And there is no strength and
power except by Allah, the High and Mighty. And soon Allah will suffice
for you. And He is the Hearer, the knower.

O Allah, bless Muhammad and the progeny of Muhammad, the Ulil Amr whose
obedience You have commanded. And the foremost in relations tying up
with whose relations You have ordered. And the near kindred whose love
You have ordered. And the masters whose rights You have ordered to be
acknowledged. And the Ahle Bayt, from whom You have removed impurities,
and purified them a thorough purification. And bless Muhammad and the
progeny of Muhammad and do such and such for me.[^3]
