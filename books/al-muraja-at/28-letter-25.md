**Thul-Hijjah 16, 1329**

I His Belief in the Text
------------------------

1) I have believed in the One Who has caused you to dissipate the
darkness [of ignorance], clarify what is ambiguous, and made you one of
His signs and a facet of His own manifestations.

II Requesting More Texts
------------------------

2) May Allah bless your father, provide me with more such texts, and
peace be with you.

Sincerely,

*S*
