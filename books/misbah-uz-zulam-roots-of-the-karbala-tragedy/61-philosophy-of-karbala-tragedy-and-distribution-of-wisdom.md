=========================================================

It is well known that wisdom is of two kinds: religious and practical.
Practical wisdom is of three types:

1. Good manners

2. Determination

3. Diplomacy.

The first of these is the personal trait of every person. The second is
applicable to his relationship with his family members and the third is
concerned with the affairs of the nation. All three of them are
discussed with relation to the tragedy of Karbala’.
