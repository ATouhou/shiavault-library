Lessons from the Tragedy of Karbala
===================================

Karbala is the cruelest tragedy humanity has ever seen. Yet, the
startling (though appalling) events in Karbala proved like a powerful
volcano that shook the very foundation of Muslims, it stirred their
consciousness, ignorant or learned alike. For sincere Muslims, Karbala
turned into a triumph. The tragic event became the very beacon of light
to always remind Muslims to practice Islam honestly and sincerely, to do
what is right irrespective of consequences, and fear no one except Allah
(swt).

On the other hand,**Yazid** never achieved what he and his father had
planned to achieve, for within three years, Allah's wrath fell upon him,
causing him to die at the age of 33 years. And within a few decades the
rule of Bani Umayya crumbled and came to an end.

The tragedy of Karbala taught humanity a lesson that standing for the
truth and fighting unto death for it is more honorable and valuable than
submitting to the wrongful, especially when the survival of Islam is at
stake.
