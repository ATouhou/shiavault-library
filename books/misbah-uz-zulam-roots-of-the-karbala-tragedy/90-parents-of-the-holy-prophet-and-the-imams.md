Parents Of The Holy Prophet And The Imams
=========================================

Ahlul Sunnat say that according Shia belief, the parents of the Prophet
and the Imams (a.s.) must be Muslim, so what can be said of the mother
of Imam Zainul Aabideen (a.s.)?

The reply to this is according to a report of Allamah Majlisi in Jilaul
Uyoon, is that Lady Fatima Zahra (s.a.) had taught Islam to Shaharbano
in a dream. This made her long for the Prophetâ€™s family. She was also
told the name of Imam Husayn (a.s.) and was given the good news that she
was to marry him. Her marriage (Nikah) was performed to Imam Husayn
(a.s.) according to perfect Islamic rites and she had become a Muslim
before her marriage. Those who call her infidel are themselves the worst
of infidels. She was a believer and remained a believer till the end of
her life.
