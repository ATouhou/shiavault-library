Umar Ibn Khatab Embraces Islam
==============================

The acceptance of Islam by everyone of the early Muslims was the effect
of one cause or another and at times a very small incident became the
means of the conversion of an individual or a group. The stimulant for
the adoption of Islam by the second caliph is interesting. Although from
the point of view of the chronological order of the events it would have
been appropriate to record this incident after describing the migration
of Muslims to Ethiopia but we have considered it expedient to describe
it here as we have here mentioned some of the companions of the Holy
Prophet.

Ibn Hisham [^18] says Out of the family of Khattab (father of Umar) only
his daughter Fatimah and her husband Sa'id bin Zayd had embraced Islam.
As in the early days of Islam Umar's relations with the Muslims were
very inimical and he was considered to be one of the most obstinate
enemies of the Prophet, therefore, his sister and her husband always
kept their faith concealed from him. In spite of this Khubab bin Art
used to come to their house at appointed hours and taught them the Holy
Qur'an.

The confused condition of the people of Makkah had made Umar very
sentimental, for he saw that dissension and disorder prevailed amongst
them and the bright day of Quraysh had been changed into a dark
evening.

Umar, therefore, decided to go and cut off the root of dissension by
killing the Holy Prophet. To achieve this purpose he was looking for the
place where the Prophet could be found. He was informed that he was in a
house situated by the side of the bazaar of Safa, and forty persons like
Hamzah, Abu Bakr, Ali etc. had undertaken to protect and defend him.

Na'im bin Abdullah who was one of the close friends of Umar says: I saw
Umar carrying his sword. I enquired about the purpose for which he was
going. He replied thus: "I am going in search of Muhammad who has
created dissension amongst Quraysh. He laughs at their wisdom and
intellect declares their religion to be worthless and belittles their
gods. I am going to kill him".

Na'im says: "I said to him: You are deceived. Do you think the
descendants of Abd Munaf will spare your life? If you are a peaceable
person you should first reform your own house. Your sister Fatimah and
her husband have become Muslims and follow the religion of Muhammad".

Na'im's words created a storm of wrath in the mind of Umar.
Consequently he abandoned his previous plan and went to the house of his
brother-in-law. When he reached near the house he heard the humming of
someone who was reciting the Holy Qur'an with an impressive voice. The
manner of Umar's arrival in his sister's house was such that she and her
husband also became aware that he was about to enter. They therefore
concealed the teacher of the Holy Qur'an in the back part of the house
so that he might remain hidden from Umar's eyes. Fatimah also concealed
a leaf on which verses of the Holy Qur'an were written.

Umar said without any salutation or greeting: "What was this humming
that I have heard?" They replied 'We have heard nothing". Umar said: "I
have been informed that you have become Muslims and follow the religion
of Muhammad". He uttered this sentence with great fury and attacked his
brother-in-law. His sister then stood up to protect her husband. Umar
attacked her also and seriously injured her head with the point of his
sword. While blood was flowing from her head the helpless woman said
with great fervour of faith: "Yes. We have become Muslims and believe in
Allah and His Holy Prophet. Do whatever you like".

The tragic plight of the sister who was standing by the side of her
brother with her face and eyes besmeared with blood and was speaking to
him made Umar tremble and he was sorry for what he had done. He
therefore insisted that they should show him the relevant leaf so that
he might ponder over the words of Muhammad. His sister fearing lest he
should tear it up put him on oath that he would not do so and he also
made a promise and confirmed it on oath that he would return the leaf
after having gone through it. Then he took the sheet in his hand. A few
verses were written on it. Their translation is given below:

Taha. It was not to distress you that We revealed the Qur'an. It is to
admonish those who fear Allah. It is a revelation from Him who has
created the earth and the lofty heavens. The Merciful who is firm in
power. His is what the heavens and earth contain. He has knowledge of
all that is secret and all that is yet more hidden. (Surah Taha
20:1-6)

These eloquent verses and the clear and firm words impressed Umar very
much. The man who was the most ruthless enemy of the Qur'an and Islam a
few minutes earlier decided to change his mind. He went to the house
about which he had already learnt that the Holy Prophet could be found
there and knocked at the door. One of the companions of the Prophet
peeped through a hole and saw Umar standing with a sword in hand and
waiting for the door to be opened. He returned at once and informed the
Prophet about the matter. Hamzah son of Abdul Muttalib said: "Let him
come in. If he has come with good intentions we shall welcome him but if
his intentions are not good we shall kill him". Umar's attitude towards
the Prophet reassured them and his open countenance and expression of
sorrow and shame proved his real intentions. Eventually he embraced
Islam at the hands of the Prophet in the presence of his companions and
thus joined the ranks of the Muslims.[^19]
