Lecture 1: Islam, Religion of Peace
===================================

   
  

*A lecture delivered at the University of California Merrill College,
Santa Cruz on 28th October, 1987.*

   
 The name Islam and the Arabic word for peace, *salam*, both come from
the same root, *salima* which indicates peace. So we may say that Islam
and peace are twins. This peace and tranquility pervades the whole
structure of Islam.  
    
    
 The Muslims greet each other by saying *salamun 'alaykum* peace be on
you). It is a much better way of the old *an'im sabahan* or the modern
*'l-kahyr* (Good morning). The ritual prayer of on Islam ends on peace,
when the Muslims say: *as-salamu 'alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh*
(Peace be on you, and mercy and blessings of Allah). In Islam one of the
names of God is *Salam*; many Muslims address Him in these words after
every prayer:  
    
***Allahumma anta*** ***'s-salam wa minka 's-salam wa ilayka ya'udu
's-salam (O Allah! You are Peace; from You originates peace and to You
it returns.)***

That is why the final abode which Allah has provided for the believers,
and to which He invites them, is called *daru 's-salam* (the abode of
peace). The Qur'an says:

***They shall have the abode of peace with their Lord. (6:127)***

***And Allah invites to the abode of peace. (10:25).***

***And when they shall reach that final destination, they shall be
greeted by the angels in these words: Peace be on you, because you were
patient; how excellent is then the issue of the abode. (13:24).***
