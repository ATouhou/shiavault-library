Foreword
========

This book discusses the importance of The Five Daily Prayer and it’s
status with Allah (SWT). The work also discusses strategies you can
employ to develop and maintain a high level of attention and
concentration whilst communicating with Allah (SWT), Who demands that
His servants be most attentive in their Prayer, more than any other
worship. He, The Creator and Designer of The Universe, remarks to that
individual, who says his Prayer with least attention, alertness of mind
and concentration:

O’ Liar! Do you want to deceive Me? I swear by My Splendor and Majesty
that I will deprive you the pleasure of your invocations and enjoyment
of personal communications with Me.  
 (Hadith al-Qudsi)

Jameel Kermalli has done painstaking research and has shared his
findings with us in a lucid, readable manner.
