Lesson One Hundred Thirty One: Piety Opens All Doors
====================================================

Imam Muhammad At-Taqi (al-Jawad) (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَوْ كانَتِ السَّماواتُ وَ الاَرْضُ رَتْقاً عَلَى عَبْد ثُمَّ اتَّقى
اللّهَ تَعالَى جَعَلَ اللّهُ لَهُ مِنْها مَخْرَجاً
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

If the doors of heavens and Earth are closed to someone, and he then
adopts piety, God shall provide relief to him.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Sometimes in life all doors are closed to man and wherever he turns, he
finds himself surrounded by problems and difficulties.

Such events in fact present an opportunity . They are a wake-up call,
reminding him of realities of life and coaxing him to change direction ,
take corrective actions and return to the right path prescribed by God.
At this time, if he reverts to God with sincerity and full concentration
and seeks assistance from His pure essence, divine assistance shall be
given to him, breezes of God’s mercy would embrace him and the closed
doors would be opened in wonderful ways.
