13- Ghadir in Literature
========================

The literature of every nation is like a mirror that shows the culture
and ideas of that nation. The remained classical literature of every
nation indicates the ideas and believes of them.

The after Islam Arab literature has had a long history. However, an
investigation over the main subjects provides some clear lines.

One of the main lines of Arab literature during the last 15th
centuries, has been the subject of Ghadir -e- khum. The Arab poets, who
have been the most educated people in every stage, have registered the
event of Ghadir-e khum as a definite historical fact, and have discussed
its effects and results.

The researcher scholar, Ayatollah Allameh, Abdolhossein Amini (1940 -
1980) in his valuable work - Al Ghadir has had a review over the Arab
literature, with a concenteration on the Ghadir subject, and has
gathered his findings in that 20 volume book. In this short essay we
page through this book to see the position of Ghadir in Arab literature.
The literature of other nations should be studied in another time. For
further information of the readers, we can add that till now only 11
volumes of the book "AI Ghadir" have been published, and we have taken
in to account only these 11 volumes.

In different parts of the book, the author repeats that in many classic
and historical books, he had found many poems on the occasion of
Ghadir - khum. However, since the poets were not famous, and he could
not find any biography from them, he did not quote their poems. This
implies that the poets of the Ghadir event have been more than those
narrated in this book.

The AI-Ghadir collection, reviews the literature from the first to lih
century, and studies the biographies and the works of 105 poets, who
have paid attention to Ghadir event, and composed poems on this subject.
Some of them are:

1- !mam Ali Ibn Abi Taleb (p.b.u.h.), who in his poem affirms his
decisive mastership (Imamat and velayat), and says that it was the duty
of the Muslims to accept his mastership. (AI Ghadir, vol2, p.25)20

2- Hassan bin Sabet, the famous companion of the prophet (p.b.u.h) who

As you see, among the poets of Ghadir Khum, there are educated people
and scientists of different sciences, from different believes and sects,
and different places (countries) of residence. We can assume that the
event of Ghadir Khum has been so popular, that the above mentioned
gentlemen, the owners of frequent fields of knowledge and wisdom, have
mentioned it in their writings. They have been, more or less, of the so
level of deliberation and speculation in their researches, that they did
not consider any point as true, just when it was publicly and generally
accepted. However, they have shown, and mentioned in their books that
they have had enough research and study about the case. In addition to
the superior virtues and preferences of Amir-ol- Momenin Ali Ibn Abi
Taleb (p.b.u.h.), which have been narrated in the traditions of the holy
prophet, or have been popular and well known in the historical books?

The great scholar Allameh Amini has brought all the above poems, along
with their references in his valuable book of "AI Ghadir If those who
are interested to have a look over them, would have to page through this
book. We hope that this short essay would have opened a new window to
this precious book, for the respected researchers.
