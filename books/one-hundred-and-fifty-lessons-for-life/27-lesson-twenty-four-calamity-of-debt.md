Lesson Twenty Four: Calamity of Debt
====================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إيّاكُمْ وَ الْدَّيْنَ فَإنَّهُ هَمٌّ بِاللَيْلِ، وَ ذُلٌ
بِالنَّهارِ!”
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Avoid borrowing as far as you can, because it causes grief during the
night and contempt during the day.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The lure of the material life and competition to acquire luxuries in the
present times has caused people to borrow more and more . Many are
trapped in the vicious circle of higher debts and increasing repayments
leading to more borrowings to finance repayments.

Since a person in debt is not a free man, we are instructed not to
undertake debt other than for a dire necessity. Debt is even more
dangerous at the country level. Highly indebted countries expose their
citizens and future generations to severe economic hardships and to
erosion of their freedom and spiritual independence.
