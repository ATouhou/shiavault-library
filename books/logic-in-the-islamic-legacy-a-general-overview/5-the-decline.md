The Decline
===========

They is as yet so little explored of the logical activity in the post
1400s to the invasions of the Western powers. The first and most
dangerous pitfall facing the historian is the assumption that there was
a decline in logical studies in the realms under Muslim control that
corresponds with the sixteenth century decline of the subject in early
modern Europe. It is tempting to make this assumption but it needs to be
examined and relevant texts must be edited and studied.
