Raising Doubts About the Status Hadith
--------------------------------------

**Thul-Hijjah 18, 1329**

The "status hadith" is authentic and well-known, but al-Amidi, who
verified and ascertained hadith, and who is considered the master of the
science of *usul*, has doubted its sources and suspected its narrators.
Your debater may uphold al-Amidi's view; so, how can you prove him
wrong? And peace be with you.

Sincerely,

*S*
