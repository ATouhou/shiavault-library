Section 14: Pharaoh and His Magicians Defeated
==============================================

Surah al-‘Araf – Verses 108-109
-------------------------------

**108*****. “Then he drew out his hand, and behold! It was white to the
beholders.”***

**109*****. “The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said: ‘Verily this indeed is
a knowing sorcerer’.”***

Besides warnings and changing the Rod as a serpent, Moses showed white
hand, too. But the opponents of the prophets used to spoil the rank of
the prophets. The verse says:

***“Then he drew out his hand, and behold! it was white to the
beholders.”***

Therefore, the adherents and the chiefs of wrong-doers around false
deities are also shared with them in their crimes. The verse says:

***“The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said: ‘Verily this indeed is a
knowing sorcerer’.”***

Surah al-‘Araf – Verse 110
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يُرِيدُ أَنْ يُخْرِجَكُمْ مِنْ أَرْضِكُمْ فَمَاذَا تَأْمُرُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**110*****. “‘He (Moses) intends to expel you from your land. Then what
do you advise?’”***

In order to pervert the common opinions, Pharaoh tried to denigrate
Moses **(as)**. From the point of belief, he called Moses (as) a
sorcerer, and from the social and political points of view, he
introduced him as a seditious and quarrelsome person. One of the weapons
of the opponents is to denigrate the men of the Truth. The verse, from
the tongue of Pharaoh, says:

***“‘He (Moses) intends to expel you from your land…”***

False deities are often tyrannical, but sometimes they become helpless
to consult in difficulties with some others around them.

***“…Then what do you advise?’”***

Surah al-‘Araf – Verses 111-112
-------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالُوا أَرْجِهِ وَأَخَاهُ وَأَرْسِلْ فِي الْمَدَآئِنِ حَاشِرِينَ

**111*****. “They said (unto Pharaoh): ‘Keep him and his brother in
suspense (for a while); and send men to the cities to collect
(sorcerers),”***  
**112*****. “To bring you every knowing (expert) sorcerer’.”***

In their consultation, however, the attitude of all of them was that
they told him to keep Moses and Aaron (as) in suspense in order to
collect sorcerers. The verse says as follows:

***“They said (unto Pharaoh): ‘Keep him and his brother in suspense (for
a while); and send men to the cities to collect (sorcerers),”***

This device was for the reason that they would call all knowledgeable
skillful experts of the time in sorcery to be gathered and to be brought
to the presence of Pharaoh. The verse says:

***“To bring you every knowing (expert) sorcerer’.”***

Since haste in slaying Moses and Aaron, regarding Moses’ two surprising
miracles, would cause the attraction of the attention of many people to
him, and the feature of his ‘prophethood’ might be strengthened with the
feature of ‘martyrdom and being oppressed’, at first they thought that
they would frustrate his deeds by means of some extraordinary actions of
their sorcerers, and defame him.

After that, they should slay him so that the story of Moses and Aaron
could disappear from the minds of people forever.

Surah al-‘Araf – Verses 113-114
-------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَجَآءَ الْسَّحَرَةُ فِرْعَوْنَ قَالُوا إِنَّ لَنا لاَجْراً إِنْ كُنّا
نَحْنُ الْغَالِبِينَ
  </p>

**113*****. “And the sorcerers came to Pharaoh, they said: ‘Verily there
will be a reward for us if we are victors’.”***

**114*****. “He said: ‘Yes! and you will surely be of the near-stationed
(to me)’.”***

From this verse on, the words are upon the entanglement of Moses with
the sorcerers and the end of his struggle therein.

The verse implies that, by the invitation of Pharaoh, sorcerers went to
him, and the first thing that they told him was that whether they would
have a large reward if they could overcome the enemy. Here is the verse:

***“And the sorcerers came to Pharaoh, they said: ‘verily there will be
a reward for us if we are victors’.”***

Immediately after that, Pharaoh also gave them a favorable promise, and
said that not only he would give them a good financial reward but also
they would be of the near-stationed to him. The verse says:

***“He said: ‘Yes! and you will surely be of the near-stationed (to
me)’.”***

Thus, Pharaoh promised them both the reward of wealth and the reward of
high rank.

Surah al-‘Araf – Verses 115-116
-------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالُوا يَامُوسَى إِمَّآ أَنْ تُلْقِيَ وَإِمَّآ أَنْ نَكُونَ نَحْنُ
الْمُلْقِينَ

  </p>
</blockquote>

**115*****. “They (the sorcerers) said: ‘O’ Moses! Will you throw, or
shall we be the (first) throwers?’”***  
**116*****. “He (Moses) said: ‘Throw (yours) !’ So when they threw, they
bewitched the people’s eyes and terrified them and produced a great
magic.”***

Finally, a proper time was appointed for the meeting of Moses (as) and
the sorcerers to have their attempts. So all people were invited to come
and see the event.

When the appointed day came, the sorcerers were completely ready with
all their tools for the action. They had supplied some ropes and staffs
which, it seemed, they had been filled with some special chemical
materials. These materials could be changed into the form of some light
gases before sunshine which could move those ropes and hollow staffs.

It was a wonderful scene. Moses, standing before people and the
sorcerers, was alone. Only his brother, Aaron, was with him. The
sorcerers told Moses either he would begin the action and cast his means
first, or they might start and cast their own means. The verse in this
regard says:

***“They (the sorcerers) said: ‘O’ Moses! Will you throw, or shall we be
the (first) throwers?’”***

Moses, with a particular coolness, answered them that they could begin
first. The verse says:

***“He (Moses) said: ‘Throw (yours)!…’***

When the sorcerers threw down their ropes and other means on the ground,
they fascinated people and, by their deceitful deeds and exaggerative
statements, they cast a sudden fear and terror upon people, and caused a
great sorcery to be produced before them. The verse says:

***“…So when they threw, they bewitched the people’s eyes and terrified
them and produced a great magic.”***

The Arabic term /sihr/ means: ‘deceit, imposture, dexterity, and
jugglery’. Sometimes it also means: ‘whatever the cause and motive of
which is invisible’. The verse says:

***“…and produced a great magic.”***

Surah al-‘Araf – Verse 117
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَى مُوسَى أَنْ أَلْقِ عَصَاكَ فإِذَا هِيَ تَلْقَفُ
مَا يَأْفِكُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**117*****. “And We revealed to Moses: ‘Throw down your rod!’ And
behold, it swallowed (all) that they falsely had invented.”***

 At the moment when all people were excited, and happy shouts were heard
from every side, Pharaoh and his by-standers were watching the scene of
activities of sorcerers, while they were smiling contently and their
eyes were glittering with joy.

 Then suddenly the Divine revelation came unto Moses (as), biding him to
throw down the staff. It caused the scene to be changed wholly. The
faces of audience lost their colour, and instability overtook Pharaoh
and his adherents.

 In this verse, the Qur’ān refers to the very fact. It implies that
Allah revealed to Moses (as) to throw down his Rod. It became as a huge
serpent which quickly and precisely gathered all false snakes and
artificial means of the sorcerers. The holy verse says:

***“And We revealed to Moses: ‘Throw down your rod!’ And behold, it
swallowed (all) that they falsely had invented.”***

Surah al-‘Araf – Verses 118-120

**118*****. “So the truth was established and what they were doing was
made vain.”***

**119*****. “Thus were they there defeated and brought low.”***

**120*****.”And the sorcerers fell down in prostration.”***

It was thus that the truth was manifested and the acts of sorcerers,
which were baseless and improper, were nollified. The verse says:

***“So the truth was established and what they were doing was made
vain.”***

The reason of this incident was that the deed of Moses (as) was a
reality while the sorcerers’ deeds were some deceits, trickeries,
dissimulations, juggleries and delusions.

This was the first stroke which was struck upon the foundation of the
power of Pharaoh, the arrogant.

In verse 119, the Qur’ān implies that, thereafter, the signs of failure
were seen in them, and all of them became low and helpless.

The verse says:

***“Thus were they there defeated and brought low.”***

The more important stroke happened when the scene of struggle of
sorcerers against Moses (as) was totally changed, and suddenly all the
sorcerers fell down prostrating for the greatness of Allah. The verse
says:

***“And the sorcerers fell down in prostration.”***

Surah al-‘Araf – Verses 121-122

**121*****. “They said: ‘We have believed in the Lord of the worlds.”***

**122*****. “The Lord of Moses and Aaron’.”***

The sorcerers shouted that they believed in the Lord of the worlds, Who
was the Lord of Moses and Aaron. The verses say:

***“They said: ‘We have believed in the Lord of the worlds.”***

***“The Lord of Moses and Aaron’.”***

This happening was something which could never be foresighted by Pharaoh
and his men.

Surah al-‘Araf – Verse 123
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ ءَامَنْتُمْ بِهِ قَبْلَ أَنْ ءَاذَنَ لَكُمْ إِنَّ

</blockquote>

**123*****. “Pharaoh said: ‘Did you believe in him before I should give
you permission? Surely this is a plot you have plotted in the city that
you may expel its people from it, but soon you shall know (the
consequences)!”***

When a new stroke was struck upon the bases and pillars of the power and
authority of Pharaoh because of the victory of Moses (as) over the
sorcerers and that they believed in Moses (as), Pharaoh was frightened
and got excited. That was why he applied two plots as follows:

The first was his accusation against the sorcerers which perhaps was
admired by common people. The verse says:

***“Pharaoh said: ‘Did you believe in him before I should give you
permission?…”***

This is the worst form of colonialism that a nation be taken as slaves
and captives so that they may not have even the right of thinking,
contemplating, and heartily believing in a person or a religion.

This is the very plan which, in the present age, is pursued under the
title of ‘New colonialism’, too.

Then, Pharaoh added:

***“…Surely this is a plot you have plotted in the city that you may
expel its people from it…”***

This accusation was so unfounded and infamous that none could accept,
except some perfectly unaware persons among common people.

After that, Pharaoh threatened them ambiguously, but it was said
intensively and firmly. He said:

***“…but soon you shall know (the consequences)!”***

Surah al-‘Araf – Verses 124-125
-------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لاَُقَطِّعَنَّ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ مِنْ خِلاَفٍ ثُمَّ
لاَُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالُوا إِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا مُنْقَلِبُونَ

</blockquote>

**124*****. “Surely I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite
sides, then I will certainly crucify you all’.”***

**125*****. “They said: ‘Verily unto our Lord we return’.”***

The ambiguous threat of Pharaoh, which was referred to in the previous
verse, is clearly stated in the verse under discussion. Here, Pharaoh
takes an oath that he cuts off their hands and feet on opposite sides,
i.e. the right hand and the left foot, or the left hand and the right
foot. The verse says:

***“Surely I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides,
then I will certainly crucify you all’.”***

What Pharaoh undertook here against the sorcerers, who had believed in
Moses (as), was a general behaviour that usually the tyrannical rulers
have in their cowardly oppositions against the adherents of the Truth.

 On one side, they use the weapon of accusation against the demandant of
the Truth to weaken them and their position both in the view of common
people. And, on the other side, they rely on force, power, and threat to
slaughter and destruction in order to break down their authority and
will.

None of the two weapons of Pharaoh could defeat the decision of the
sorcerers. In their answer, they heartily and decidedly refused him, as
follows:

***“They said: ‘Verily unto our Lord we return’.”***

They said this statement with the meaning that if the Pharaoh’s threat
could be done, they finally would become martyrs. In that case, not only
the event might not harm them or decrease anything from them, but also
it could be considered as an honour and a happiness for them.

Surah al-‘Araf – Verse 126
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَا تَنْقِمُ مِنَّآ إِلآَّ أَنْ ءَامَنَّا بِاَيَاتِ رَبِّنَا لَمَّا
جَآءَتْنَا رَبَّنَآ أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْراً وَتَوَفَّنَا
مُسْلِمِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**126*****. “And you do not take revenge upon us except because we have
believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us.’ ‘Our Lord! Pour
out upon us patience, and cause us to die in submission’.”***

Then, in order to respond the accusation of Pharaoh, and to make the
truth clear for the audience of the concerning scene, and, also, to
prove their own sinlessness, the sorcerers said:

***“And you do not take revenge upon us except because we have believed
in the signs of our Lord when they came to us.’…”***

At that time, they turned their faces from Pharaoh and, being attentive
to Allah, they invoked Him to bestow upon them the highest degree of
patience and perseverance. They knew that they could not tolerate those
terrible threats without His help and His support. So, they said:

***“…‘Our Lord! Pour out upon us patience, and cause us to die in
submission’.”***

As it has been recorded in the Islamic traditions, as well as the
history, finally the sorcerers resisted on their idea so much so that
Pharaoh fulfilled what he had threatened, and he hung their mutilated
bodies on some tall palm trees by the bank of Nile River.

Yes, if belief and full awareness combine with together, the income of
such a spiritual love will be some perseverance and devotion which will
not be surprising in that way.
