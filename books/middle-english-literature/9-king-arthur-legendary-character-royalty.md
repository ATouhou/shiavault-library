King Arthur - Legendary Character / Royalty
===========================================

King Arthur is one of the great mythic figures of English literature.
Dozens of legends and romantic images have grown up around him: the
knights of the Round Table, Merlin the wizard, and the Holy Grail, to
name a few. According to the main Athurian legends, the king wielded a
magical sword, Excalibur; lived in a glorious kingdom called Camelot;
was helped by the wizard Mordred; and was married to the beautiful Queen
Guinevere (who in many legends falls for Arthur's knight Sir Lancelot).
Many of our modern-day stories of Arthur are based on*Le Morte d'Arthur*
("The Death of Arthur"), the collection of Arthurian tales published by
Sir Thomas Malory in 1485. Historians can't decide whether anyone like
Arthur ever existed, though most now accept that the legend is*very*
loosely based on a real historical figure; he may have been a 5th or 6th
century ruler name Arturus or Riothamus.
