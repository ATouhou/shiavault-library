Kufa
====

The people of Kufa were waiting for Imam Husayn's coming. They were
tired of the Umayyad's persecution. Meanwhile, they longed for Imam
Husayn's justice.

Muslim bin Aqeel arrived in Kufa and stayed with Mukhtar . The people of
Kufa heard about his arrival.

The people crowded around Mukhtar 's house to see Imam Husayn's envoy.
They wanted to pay homage to establish Allah's government.

Muslim bin Aqeel read the Kufians Imam Husayn's message:

*In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.*

*From al-Husayn bin Ali,*

*To the believing Muslim people,*

*Hany and Saeed brought me your letters. They were your last two
messengers. I have understood all that you have written. The majority of
your letters have showed that there is no Imam other than me.*

*You have said:*

*Come. May Allah bring us together with you to follow guidance and
truthfulness. So, I have sent you my cousin Muslim bin Aqeel. I have
ordered him to write me about your attitude. If he writes me that your
good people are all in agreement, I'll come, Allah willing.*

*By my life! The Imam must conform to the Book and Justice.*

The Muslims were full of hope when they heard Imam Husayn's message.
Mukhtar paid homage to al-Husayn's envoy. He promised to establish the
Muslim government. He also promised to revolt against the unjust.
Besides he promised to support the persecuted.

Mukhtar was the first to pay homage to al-Husayn. Then thousands of
people paid homage. Their number was eighteen thousand people.
