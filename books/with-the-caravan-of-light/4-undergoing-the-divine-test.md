Undergoing the Divine Test
==========================

The army of Imam Husayn(a) undergoing a very severe test, unprecedented
in human history, defeated the enemy. Arif Samadani, the learned gnostic
says:

You are but a slave of your sensual desires and neglectful of too many
other far more subtle pleasures in the domain of your existence. The
soul is purified through divine tests, just as gold is melted in the
crucible ofperfection. Those who worship their Lord in distress are
superior to those who worship him in affluence.

It has been said that a life of hardship is a token of God's mercy and
favour upon upright people. In this respect see how dear Imam Husayn(a)
and his companions were to God.

**Nafi ibn- Hilal**

Nafi was of noble birth, a reader of the Qur'an, narrator of the Sunna
of Muhammad(s) and a companion of Amir al-Mu'minin \`Ali(a). Before
Muslim ibn-Aqil was martyred, he left Kufa to join Imam Husayn(a).

Ibn-Shahr Ashub said when Hurr ibn Yazid barred the Imam(a) and his
companions from going to Mecca or Medina, the Imam addressed his men and
told them that death was God's gift for the believers and that living
under the yoke of despotic rulers would be a painful torture. When Nafi
heard this, he eloquently answered:

O you, descendant of God's Messenger(s), You know well that your
forefather did not live long enough to show the affection he had towards
these people to its fullest capacity. Indeed among his people were
hypocrites that promised to help him in time of need but did not abide
by their promise when the need came. This also held true in the case of
your father. Many promised to help, but in factrefrained from helping
him. Now you are in the same predicament as regards to the hypocrites h,
those who broke theirpromise, acted to the detriment of themselves and
God has made it so that we do not find ourselves reliant upon them. Now
lead your men to their fate. We love your friends and hate your
enemies.

Nafi fought bravely in the battle. He killed as many men of Omar Sa'ad
as he could and then was crowned with martyrdom.

**Nafi ibn- Hilal's Very Strange Story**

Shaykh Mufid, the outstanding theologian, narrated that for most of the
time in Karbala, Nafi ibn-Hilal had closely accompanied Imam Husayn(a),
especially when there was the danger of enemy ambush.

One night Husayn(a) left his camp for a reconnaissance tour of the
site. Seeing this, Nafi shadowed the Imam(a) with his sword unsheathed.
Suddenly the Imam(a) looked back and saw him. Nafi told him that he was
very afraid for the Imam(a) to see him alone out there so near the enemy
camp. The Imam(a) said he came to explore if there might be a hidden
position from which the enemy could attack. After they both returned to
camp, the Imam(a) entered his sister's tent while Nafi stood nearby.

All of a sudden Hadrat Zeynab, Husayn's(a) sister, broke into tears at
the thought of the impending death facing her brother and his companions
and expressed fears about the constancy of his men. The Imam(a) in
response had tried to assure his sister of their loyalty and devotion.
On hearing this, Nafi headed for the tent of Habib ibn-Mazahir, another
brave, loyal companion of Imam Husayn(a) and told him what he had
heard.

Then they both went up to the tents of the women-folk in the camp to
assure them of the loyalty of the Imam's troops. The Imam(a) told the
women to come out of their tents and thank those loyal men outside for
their willingness to sacrifice their lives, standing by the Household of
the Prophet(s). In their response it seemed as if the companions of
Husayn(a) were saying:

If we failed to stay at Mina (a place in Mecca where the pilgrims to
the Ka'aba stay overnight) we would make our tryst in Karbala,
anotherMina; Ifwesaidfarewell to Zamzam and Safa (respectively a well
and a high cliff in Mecca), we should make ofKarbala, a pillar ofloyalty
and sincerity (Safa) In order for human beings to know their Maker, we
would make ourselves a mirror to show the image of God; To treat the
abyss ofpeople 's ignorance,

we would make ofKarbala a place where people are curedoftheirillnesses;
Toliberate mankind from bondage, we would hoist the banner of freedom;
We would overthrow oppressors and liberate the oppressed; We would tear
down the palace of despotism and in its place build the palace of
justice. If religious revolution was about to occur in the world, we
would make it ring with the call for truth.

**Yazid ibn- Thabit' Abqassi**

Ibn Thabit was a shi'ite of a pure disposition and was lauded by Hadrat
Mahdi(a) himself. When the enemy came to know that Imam Husayn(a)
intended to leave for Iraq and unite with some people there, Ibn Ziad
ordered his agent in Basra to be on the alert and make note of all those
who were coming and going from Iraq.

Ibn Thabit, in company with Adham ibn-Umayya and other notables, left
Basra for Mecca. On arriving there, they found that the Imam(a) was not
in Mecca, so they went searching far and wide in the surrounding
wilderness for him. At the same time, the Imam(a) was also searching for
Ibn Thabit and eventually came upon his camp and went to his tent. When
Tbn Thabit saw the Imam(a) in his tent he mentioned the Qur'anic
verse: \*O mankind There has come unto you an exhortation from your
Lord, a balm for that which is in the breasts\* (10/58)

Then he told Imam Husayn(a) that he had come to fight for the divine
cause. The Imam(a) prayed for him and eventually Ibn Thabit and two of
his sons were killed in the battle.

Never do men with religious zeal bow to vile people. Well done those
who pledge allegiance to the prophet's son and would give both their
arms for his cause. Well done those who, disdaining of danger rush upon
the enemy. Gallant men who pierce their way through enemy hoards to
slake the thirst of others. Martyrdom was a wine in the cup of death.
Well done those drunken men who kissed it and drank the wine.

**Abis ibn- Shabib Shakeri**

He was a pious shi'ite notable orator and man of Truth. When Muslim
ibn-Aqil came to Kufa, the notables among the Shi' a came to visit him.
After Muslim had read the letter of Imam Husayn(a), \`Abis addressed him
saying: O you messenger of Husayn(a)!, I speak neitherfor thepeople
ofKufa nor dolwish to make a baseless promise on their behalf to deceive
you. I swear by God that I have chosen to fight the enemy side by side
with you, to the bitter end.

His fiery words kindled the fire of sacrifice for the cause of Allah.
Here \`Abis committed himself to uphold nothing but the Truth. He
encouraged the people to pledge allegiance to Muslim. Muslim wrote a
letter to the Imam(a) and handed it to Abis. In the thick of the battle
\`Abis Shakeri, in company with Shudhab rode out to defend Islam. \`Abis
then addressed the Imam and said:

I know of no one dearest to me, but you.

He rushed the enemy with his sword unsheathed. No one dared to fight
him, so Ibn Sa'ad ordered his men to rain stones on him in order to
crush his attack. \`Abis , in a righteous rage, removed his coat of mail
and helmet and launched a furious attack upon the soldiers of the enemy,
cutting down many in his path. Finally, tired, outnumbered and
surrounded on all sides, \`Abis was cut down and martyred.

**Hafhaf ibn- Mahnah Basrawi**

He was a committed shi'ite and abrave companion of Hadrat \`Ali(a), he
had fought side by side with the latter in three battles (Jamal, Siffin
and Nahrawan) that \`Ali(a) had fought against the wrongdoers.

After Hadrat \`Ali(a) was martyred, he pledged allegiance to Imam
Hasan(a) and then to Imam Husayn(a). In Basra, he found out that Imam
Husayn(a) had left Mecca for Iraq. He hastened across the wide deserts
between Basra and his destination with utmost speed and reached Karbala
on the day of Ashura when the battle had ended. He asked the men in the
army of Omar Sa'ad about Husayn(a). They answered: Don 't you see
plunderers are now busy in Husayn 's(a) camp, robbing the womenfolk of
their clothing.

In a battle when a soldier sees his commander lying among the fallen,
he could become quite confused, but Hafhaf, like a fierce lion, attacked
the enemy troops by himself putting them to the sword one by one until
he was exhausted and killed.

**Suwid Hadrami**

He put up a good fight but suffered fatal wounds all over his body and
fell unconscious to the ground. The enemy gave him up for dead and left
him alone. All of a sudden when he heard the shout that Husayn(a) was
killed, he sprang to his feet. Not finding his sword, he seized a dagger
and attacked the enemy and was killed.

These were the companions of Imam Husayn(a), companions whose valour
defies description. As to the members of the Bani Hashim themselves such
as The Moon of the Bani Hashim, Hadrat Abbas - Husayn's(a) brother - and
Ali \`Akbar - son of Husayn - , no one can ever be able to do justice to
them, for they represented the acme of heroism and chivalry.

**The Moon of the Bani Hashim**

Since no one is able to adequately describe the sublime personality of
Qamar (The Moon) of the Bani Hashim, let us quote the words of some of
the sinless Imams themselves in describing him:

God's blessings and the praises of His favourite angels, prophets,
pious people, martyrs, saints and pure souls be unto you, Oson ofAmir
al-Mu 'minin. Iswear by God that you were he who was wholeheartedly
resigned to His will and unquestionably loyal to the Leader of the
Martyrs. The best and highest of rewards be yours in acknowledgement of
your endurance, devotion and in the support of your oppressed brother.

You were submissive to your Lord, to His Messenger(s), to your father
Amir al-Mu'minin(a) and your brothers Hasan(a) and Husayn(a). You strove
with all your being to uphold your religion and you led a life of
complete righteousness, contemplation and obedience towards God and all
His messengers. As a true worshipper of the Truth you were
unparalleled.

Imam Sajjad(a) said his uncle, The Moon of the Bani Hashim, held an
esteemed position on the Day of Judgment near the seat of the Author of
the Universe which all the martyrs will desire. Riazi, the famous poet
says:

You are our sacred Qiblah of need. Your memory is the object of praise
and communion; You are the credit to all martyrs. You are the hands
ofAli, Oyou the Moon of Bani Hashim. You were the companion of the
leader of the Caravan of Love. Youwere Cup-BearerfortheLovers
ofHusayn(a) and Standard Bearer in their gathering. You
lostyourheadandhandfor the cause of Husayn(a). You were the son, the
brother and the uncle of Imams(a). Peace be upon you, O Hadrat Abbas.

You are the Teacher of honesty and loyalty in the school of divine
love. The soul of the reverent was melted down and consumed like a
candle in the crucible of selfess veneration. The Euphrates flowed,
astonished at the fealty you had towards your brother. You kept alive
the memory of the parched lips of Husayn(a) and his children, standing
thirsty on the banks of theriver. Youputupwith allthese hardships and
still shielded others from the enemy's attack.

You lost your hands and you lost your head. Your hands witnessed your
sacrifice for the cause of Allah and those who followed you were
favoured by God. The four Imams who saw you, kissed your hand that would
bear the standard. Lo! my life for your homage. With you to join your
brother. And with you bid him farewell and depart towards death. At
birth you brought happiness, love and laughter. In martyrdom you brought
bitter grief and lamentation. Sufficient unto you is the praise of the
Imam of the Age(a), the Proof of the Truth and the Lord of the worlds.
Your brother himself praised you. Who am I to praise you as he?!

**Husayn (a)**

To get a glimpse of the magnitude of the personality of the imam(a) it
could suffice to quote some excerpts from the prayers for Imam
Husayn(a): Peace be upon you, O Treasure and Custodian of the knowledge
and mysteries of the Scriptures; of the Torah, the Gospel and the Book
of Psalms Peace be upon you, O Trustee of the Beneficent, Intimate
Companion of the Qur'an, the Guardian of religion and the Gateway to
Divine wisdom; Peace be upon you, O the House ofmodesty and worship and
devotion, a place of security for all;

Peace be upon you, O Treasure of Divine knowledge of the mysteries.

O Aba Abdullah!The tents of the Empyrean, in the heavens and in the
earth, in Paradise, and in the seas and deserts, all trembled and
lamented the shedding of your sacred blood.

I testify to the purity of your soul; You called the people to uphold
justice and truth;

Peace be upon you who are pleased when your Lord is pleased and angered
when your Lord is angered.

Peace be upon you, O Trustee of God, Proof of the Truth, Gateway to
Divine knowledge, and Guide to Allah, the one who called people to know
Allah and know as lawful and unlawful what yourLord had shown as such,
who established worship and paid the poor-rate, and who enjoined the
right and forbade the wrong

Peace be upon you, the Proof of Allah in the earth and the Witness of
the Truth for mankind.

God's blessings be unto the martyred Imam, murdered by the tyranny
ofenemies, leader of the devout.

God's blessings be unto the virtuous Imam(a), beset upon by the evil of
others and resigned to God's will.

God's blessings be unto the Guide, who guided to the straight path.
