Lesson Sixty: Neither Flattery, Nor Envy
========================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الثَناءُ بِأَكْثَرَ مِنَ الاسْتِحْقاقِ مَلَقٌ و التَّقْصِيرُ مِنَ
الأسْتِحْقاقِ عَىٌّ أَوْ حَسَدٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

When praise and commendation is more than merited and deserved it is
flattery and when less than merited it is either debility in expression
or envy. [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Undoubtedly, the worthy individuals and their good attributes and deeds
should be praised and appreciated, and in this way we shall encourage
and support them to carry on with their good work.

But praise should be proportionate to the merit . Otherwise, it would
have negative and harmful consequences. If it is more than merit, it
becomes flattery which hurts the dignity of the speaker and also causes
self-conceit and self-admiration in the one who is flattered. And if it
is less than merit, it discourages the good doers and shows that the
speaker is either envious or weak in his power of expression.
