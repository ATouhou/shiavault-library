A. K. Esmail : the Conqueror of Kerbala
=======================================

The tremendous surge from mid-deserts
Had just reached the brink
On its victorious onwards march
And, there for a while it stopped.
For a while it was touch and go
For a while it seemed
Desert born desert contained.
That was not to be
It was not so decreed
Muhammad's own blood
Was there to answer the call.
At Kerbala the faith was reborn
And Husain's martyred blood
Blossomed forth and
Lo, there was universal Islam.
To the last day-last minute
Shall shine the immortal deeds
Of Husain and his co-horts
The Faithful Few
Yes the Great one himself was on trial
The Last Prophet's own blood
His darling and his heir
Husain himself had to fall
Before the grand message spread.
The mouths that had fed


66

Bit the hands that held The ungrateful serpent's bite That was a
Prophet's reward.

Bereft of gold, bereft of home Bereft of food and water itself But full
of Muhammad's blood Full of pluck full of faith The Courageous led on.

Led on the last seventy-two Seventy and two of the grand host Spiritual
ancestors of the like Who from ages keep the faith alive Those that do
not quit.

Thrones are usurped, gold stolen But not the thorny Crown That always
rests on the brows of a rare Jesus.

That was Husain's heritage That went back of Christ A heritage to stand
like rock To suffer to strive and to die To die and cease to be So that
Truth for ever be.

They don't die The heroes of Kerbala They who go through fiery furnaces
and walk in the valley of shades For the end they emerge In shining
armours radiating Light of truth for ever.

In vain, in vain did Yazid foam

67

In vain, did his armies storm For the field was theirs Who had their
precious lives lain The conqueror of Kerbala was Husain.

Here the unmatchable became invincible Here the price for the perfect
was paid What father had conceived The brave son had fulfilled.

Ye, fields of Kerbala Stand us in need Muslims arte again on trial
There is no Husain to lead.

Ya, Muhammad Mustapha Grant us thy son's spirit Let Kerbala be our
beacon For we have only to repeat The original deed is done Can we not
just repeat?

Yazids are yet all about Within us and also without His tribe does not
die Ye, waters of old lady Furat Tell us how Husain fought

Tell us how he won
For again have we to win
And leave an example behind
That the message of Muhammad
The sacrifice of Husain
Shall not be in vain
Islam, Allah's noblest gift


68

Has to be earned again and again.\*

L. 19. ?The Faithful Few? refers to Imam al-Husain's companions who
were relatively much less than the number of the enemy's army, which
reportedly exceeded 30,000.

L. 21. ?The Last Prophet? refers to the Prophet Muhammad.

L. 53. Yaz?d b. Mu\`?w?yyah symolizes a very notorious and detestable
figure. He was the cruel monarch of the Umayyad dynasty. Soon after his
gaining power, he ordered his agent in Medina to gain Imam Husain's
alliance by force.

As this was all in contradiction to the contents of the peace treaty
signed by Mu??w?yyah and Imam Hassan, Imam al-Husain rightly refused to
recognize Yaz?d as a Muslim ruler. Hence, the Imam left Medina for Mecca
in defiance to the unjust force exerted.

As the people of al-Kufa had invited Imam al-Husain, he intended to go
there. En route to and near Kufa, it was at Karbala where Yaz?d's agents
and henchmen made Imam al- Husain stop. In fact, Yaz?d ordered his
forces to surrender, fight, and slay Imam al-Husain and his companions
therein.

L. 66. ?Ya, Muhammad Mustapha?. ?Ya? is an Arabic vocative or
attention-getter, corresponding roughly to English O, Oh, or Lo.

Mustapha, or Mustafa, ?lit. Chosen, selected, preferred, favorite, is
another laqab (designation or appellation) of the Prophet Muhammad.

69

L. 72. ?Yazids? signifies those who are like Yazid in character.
Although proper names are regarded as inherently definite, and
non-count, in such secondary uses they quality as a set-, or
category-denoting noun, hence they may take a plural marker.

L. 75. Furat, or Fur?t, [English Euphrates] is one of the two major
rivers of Iraq where the city of Karbala is located on. It symbolizes
the thirst Imam al-Husain and his companions endured as well as the
battle occurred thereby at Karbala.

According to numerous Islamic hadiths, it is regarded as a Paradise
river imbued with virtues for whoever gets consecrated with it. Also
recommended is to perform ghusl [i.e., washing the whole body in a
prescribed way for religious or ritual purposes] with its water prior to
performing ziarat, viz. pilgrimage, to Imam al-Husain's sacred
sanctuary.
