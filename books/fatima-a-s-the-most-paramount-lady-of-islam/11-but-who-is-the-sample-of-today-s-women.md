But who is the sample of todayâ€™s women ?
========================================

The answer of this question is clear and that is: see their situation
and ask about their mood. See what they say, what they do and what they
act? To whom their speech and action resemble? Do they act as Zeineb or
as others? Are their lifestyles like that of Fatima (peace be upon her)
or another persons?

There exist some people, following western samples. Their thoughts, way
of life, and luxury adoration take root from the developed and
illuminated women in appearance but western in thought. That half naked
lady, fond of luxury and pleasure, cannot have any sample except a
western one and even dancers and singers. The one always thinking about
color and change, luxury and ornament, royal life and pleasure has
assumed the actresses and aristocrat as the samples, although she seems
Islamic in clothes and appearance.
