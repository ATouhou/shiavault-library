Lesson One Hundred Thirty Six: Fulfilment of Obligations
========================================================

Imam Al-Sajjad (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ عَمِلَ بِمَا افْتَرَضَ اللّهِ عَلَيْهِ فَهُوَ مِنْ أَعْبَدِ
النّاسِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Whoever fulfill ls his obligations, will be among the most devout
worshippers.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Worship is neither restricted to serving the people, nor to praying and
fasting. Rather, the greatest worship is that one should fulfill his
obligatory duties in all areas of life. Which worship is higher and more
manifest than the one which could change a society into a flower garden
where goodness and prosperity abound. fulfillment of obligations has a
wide scope that includes obligations related to worship as well as to
society, humanity, economic and other necessities of life. Those who are
neglectful of their necessary obligations and yet consider themselves as
highly devoted to Islam are under a serious delusion.
