Truthful and Honest
===================

Muhammad (S), right from his childhood was known for his virtue and
lofty conduct and was far removed from the prevalent vices of the day
like idolatry, dishonesty, drinking, gambling, cowardice etc., which
were the hallmarks of the Makkan society. His noble character stood him
out as the most impeccable one ever, to the point that his people called
him 'as-Sadiq' (the Truthful) and 'al-Amin' (the Honest). They put their
complete trust in him and always turned to him as an impartial judge in
their frequent disputes.

He was a born believer whose heart was free from the filth of disbelief
and polytheism. Never had the boy been near idols let alone worship
them. The All-Knowing Allah, Who had singled out the child for the
greatest task and blessings that lay ahead, had inspired Muhammad's (S)
young heart with His Greatness, Power and Majesty.

His pristine purity was indicative of his future greatness, for how
could people believe in him and put their trust in him if they see him
prostrating before manmade objects and indulging in vices like any
ordinary Arab of the day.

Surely, none would have responded to his call to Islam, towards virtue
and towards deliverance from oppression, and none would have believed
him if they were not sure of vouchsafing his truthfulness and honesty.

Thus Divine providence was at work, right from the beginning in his
case, grooming, inspiring and educating the young Muhammad (S) and
finally introducing him as a model of emulation and messenger for all of
mankind.
