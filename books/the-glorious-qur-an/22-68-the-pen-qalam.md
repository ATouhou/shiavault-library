68: the Pen (qalam)
===================

This chapter contains 52 very early Meccan verses, all except for VV.
17-23, which form a graphic parable of The Arrogant Orchardmen", (or The
Blighted Garden" as it is sometimes called). These farmers committed the
sin of arrogation and ended up by losing their crops (I). Another later
story in VV. 48-50 concerns the prophet Jonah (II). Both of these tales
date from Madina. The main body however was revealed after The Clot 96
(with which it should be compared), and before Bundled Up 73.

This chapter brought comfort to the Prophet, and it is sometimes called
the Second Revelation " Its initial statement shows his growing
preoccupation concerning literacy.
