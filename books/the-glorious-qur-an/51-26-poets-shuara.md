26: Poets (shuara)
==================

This chapter of eleven sections and 227 mostly Meccan verses was
revealed after The Inevitable 56 and before the next chapter on The Ants
27. Verse 197 however and VV. 224-226 at the end of the final section
(XI) date from the Madinese period.

The next four chapters display a different style, being rather long but
using short verses; thus they form a special unit. One notices how each
prophetic parallel and refrain mentioned brings home the fact that while
prophets may use poetic utterances, this illustrates the patterns they
need, so as to show mankind how history and man's fate should be
understood. Moses (II), then Abraham's attitude toward idols, plus his
prayer (V), are first presented: Noah (VI), then the early Arabian
messengers Hud (VII), Salih or Methusaleh (VIII), Lot (IX), and shu\`ayb
(X) follow.

This motif in fact sounds like that of a symphony as it moves along and
is gradually worked out, or like the kharja or refrain in an Andalusian
choral lyric.

The concern is directed toward God as the Lord of the Universe. The
chapter ends with a dramatic description of how early Arabian poets went
"staggering around in every river valley"
