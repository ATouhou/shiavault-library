The Love of Ahlul Bayt
======================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Train your children in three things: the
love of your Prophet, the love of his progeny, i.e. Ahlul Bayt, and
recitation of the Qur'an."

Al-Jami'-ul-Saghir, vol. 1, p. 14

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "He who is not able to do any good unto us
(Ahlul Bayt) then be may do good to our pious adherents; and he who is
not able to visit us, he may visit our righteous followers by which the
reward of visiting us (pilgrimage) will be recorded for him."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 74, p. 354

Imam al-Baqir (‘a) said: "The best means by which servants can obtain
nearness to Allah, Mighty and Glorious, is the obedience to Allah, the
obedience to His Messenger, and the obedience to those charged with
(spiritual) authority."

Then, he (‘a) added: "The love of us (Ahlul Bayt) is Faith and the
hatred of us is infidelity."

Al-Kafi, vol. 1, p. 187

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "Verily, there are various degrees of serving
Allah, but affection (and cordial inclination) for us, Ahlul Bayt, is
the highest one."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 27, p. 91
