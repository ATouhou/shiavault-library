Lesson Sixty Six: Mutual Rights
===============================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَلْزَمُ الْوالِدَيْنِ مِنَ الْحُقُوقِ لِوَلَدِهِما مَا يَلْزَمُ
الْوَلَدَ لَهُما مِنْ حُقُوقِهِما
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

In the same way as the children are to be held to account for
disregarding parents’ rights, parents are also accountable for not
observing the children’s rights.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Rights and duties always go hand in hand. And greater rights call for
greater duty and responsibility.

The Holy Qur’an places heavy emphasis on duty to one’s parents. While
parents enjoy great rights vis-à-vis their children , they also bear a
heavy responsibility to them. They shall at no time neglect to train
their children, to help them improve bodily as well as spiritually and
to keep them away from mental and moral taints. The tumult of their life
shall not hinder them from this great duty.
