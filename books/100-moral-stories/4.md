THE FARMER AND THE STORK
Finding that cranes were destroying his newly sown corn, a farmer

one evening set a net in his field to catch the destructive birds.

When he went to examine the net next morning he found

a number of cranes and also a stork.

“Release me, I beseech you,” cried the stork, “for I have eaten none of

your corn, nor have I done you any harm. I am a poor innocent stork,

as you may see - a most dutiful bird, I honor my father and mother.

But the farmer cut him short. “All this may be true enough, I dare say,

but I have caught you with those were destroying my crops, and you

must suffer with the company in which you are found.”

People are judged by the company they keep.
