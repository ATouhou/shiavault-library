 When a Mujtahid gives a general ruling along with a recommended option
related to that ruling. His recommendation is basically a precautionary
measure. The Muqallid (follower) can act either way i.e. act according
to the general ruling or the recommendation. The follower must follow at
the least the general ruling. The follower cannot follow any other
Mujtahid on this issue.
