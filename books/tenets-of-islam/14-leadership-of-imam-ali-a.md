Leadership of Imam Ali [a]
==========================

Ali ibn Abi Talib is the Imam after our Prophet (May Allah's blessing
and peace be on him and his descendants). The Holy Prophet addressing
Imam Ali said: “Ali, you are my brother, the heir of my knowledge, my
successor after me and payer of my debt. You are to me as Aaron was to
Moses, but there shall be no prophet after me.” The Holy Prophet also
said: “Greet Ali as the Commander of the Faithful, listen to him and
obey him. Get knowledge from him but do not teach him.” On another
occasion the Holy Prophet said: “This Ali is the master of him whose
master I am. May Allah be friendly to him who is friendly to Ali and be
hostile to him who is hostile to Ali.”
