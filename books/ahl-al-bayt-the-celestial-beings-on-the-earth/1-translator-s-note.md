Translatorâ€™s Note
=================

**In the Name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful**

All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. May the peace and
blessings of Allah be upon Muhammad and his pure progeny.

I would like to thank the honorable manager of Ansariyan Publication,
Mr. Tajj Muhammad Taqi Ansariyan, who commissioned me to translate this
book into English - a book that gave me a better understanding of the
purified household of the Holy Prophet.

I have intentionally chosen a simple style and diction for the
translation of this book so that it can be communicated easily to the
dear readers.

The translation of this book is dedicated to two honorable ladies who
were gracious to me in my life: the late Hajiah Massoomeh Hazrati
Ashtiani, may her soul rest in peace and Parvin Dokhat Nooraee Ashtiani,
as well as my dear son, Arya and my dear daughter, Aida, who have been
intimately connected to the Holy Quran.

I beg to Allah Almighty to help me to be a true follower of Ahl al-Bayt
(a.s).

I would also like to thank my dear friend, Mr. Badr Shahin for editing
this book. I owe him a lot.

Ali Akbar Aghili Ashtiani
