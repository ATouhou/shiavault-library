Foreword
========

Nowadays, people are getting more and more involved in Music and for
them, it has become a part of their daily life. Their mind has become so
saddled with tension, and the tempo of life is so fast that they seem to
accept high blood pressure and nervous breakdown as the unavoidable side
effects of modern civilization.

It is a pity that they do not pause to think about the adverse effects
of music on their physical and mental health.

I have endeavoured to present in this booklet the scientific and
spiritual points of view on music and dance etc. These observations have
been quoted from various books of Persian, Urdu and English languages.

I am very grateful to Maulana Sayyid Saâ€™eed Akhtar Rizvi, the Chief
Missionary of the Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania for editing and
scrutinizing this effort of mine.  
 I hope this booklet will help the readers in understanding the
philosophy of the rule of Islam which forbids music.
