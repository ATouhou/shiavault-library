50: Humility And Soft-Heartedness While Remembering Imam (aj)
=============================================================

It is very important to soften ones heart while remembering Imam (aj).
We should be particular in attending the assemblies of his Shias so that
our heart is further softened and to remember the rights and the
calamities of Hazrat (aj). We must also keep away from all such acts
which cause hardening of the heart and to distance ourselves from
everything that cause regret and wistfulness, as mentioned by Almighty
Allah:

***Has not the time yet come for those who believe that their hearts
should be humble for the remembrance of Allah and what has come down of
the truth? And (that) they should not be like those who were given the
Book before, but the time became prolonged to them, so their hearts
hardened, and most of them are transgressors.***

According to traditions, the above verse was revealed with regard to
Imam az-Zaman (aj) and its interpretation points towards Ghaibat. Here
the phrase, “But the time became prolonged to them,” refers to the
period of Ghaibat.
