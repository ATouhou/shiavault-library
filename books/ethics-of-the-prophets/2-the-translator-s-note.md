The Translator’s Note
=====================

All Praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, may the peace and
blessings of Allah be upon Muhammad and his pure progeny.

This is the second book of its kind that I have translated into English
for Ansarian Publications. The first book that I translated into English
was Allameh Helli’s Odatto-Daee.

The Translation of the present book is dedicated to my devoted wife,
Maryam whose patience with my translation job has made this work
possible and her piety and self-sacrifice has made the worldly life
bearable to me.

The translator of this book welcomes comments so as to be considered in
the future editions.
