Lesson One Hundred Five: Respect Of Freedom Of Thought
======================================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بِئْسَ الْقَوْمُ قَوْمٌ يَمْشِى الْمُؤْمِنُ فيهِمْ بِالتَّقِيَّةِ وَ
الْكِتْمانِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

When a believer is forced to hide his beliefs , he is living among bad
people! [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Dissimulation and concealment of one’s ideas and beliefs usually arises
when a selfish majority of the society prevent the righteous minority
from expressing their thoughts freely. Surely, such a society will not
be prosperous.

In an Islamic and humanitarian society, the righteous people should have
the freedom to disclose their viewpoints for public comments and
discourse.

No one should hinder them. Instead, there should be respect for freedom
of thought and reformative thinking and facilities should be provided
for imparting training and bringing good ideas to fruition.
