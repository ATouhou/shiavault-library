The Battle of al-Khazir
=======================

Ibraheem al-Ashtar's Army reached al-Khazar River. There he met
Ubaidullah bin Ziyad's Army.

Violent fights took place between the two sides. The Kufian Army fought
bravely. Some commandos made a brave attack against the Umayyad's
headquarters. They killed senior leaders such as Ubaidullah bin Ziyad
and al-Husayn bin Numair. Anyhow, Ibraheem al-Ashtar's Army could defeat
Ubaidullah bin Ziyad's.

Mukhtar 's victory spread all over the Muslim cities. The Muslims became
very happy when they heard about Ubaidullah bin Ziyad's killing. The
Battle of al-Khazar suited Allah's words:

*How often has a small party vanquished a numerous host by Allah's
permission.*

Ibraheem al-Ashtar's small army defeated Ubaidullah bin Ziyad's big one.
