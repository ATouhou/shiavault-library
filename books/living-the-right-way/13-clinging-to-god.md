Clinging to God
===============

This means to hold fast by God for protection from all kinds of evil.
Islam, while enjoining us to endeavour in pursuing our affairs,
recommends clinging to Allah.

Allah the Most High said: ***“O people, surely there has come to you
manifest proof from your Lord and We have sent to you a clear light.
Then as for those who believe in Allah and hold fast by Him, He will
cause them to enter into His mercy and grace and guide them to Himself
on a right path.”***

He also said: ***‘Therefore keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and
hold fast by Allah; He is your Guardian; how excellent the Guardian and
how excellent the Helper!”***

He also said: ***“And whoever holds fast to Allah, he indeed is guided
to the right path.”***

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) the Commander of the Faithful said: *“He who holds fast
to Allah, He will save him.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“He who holds fast to Allah, no devil can harm
him.”*

Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (a.s.) said: *“Any servant of Allah who is
attentive to what Allah requires of him to do, Allah will be attentive
to his demands; and he who holds fast to Allah, He will give him
shelter; and he who has chosen Allah for his helper and shelter will not
care about anything, even if the sky falls on the earth, or an epidemic
disaster comes to the people. Thus he will be under Allah’s protection
against all afflictions for his piety;* ***‘Surely those who guard
(against evil) are in a secure place.’***[^1]*”*
