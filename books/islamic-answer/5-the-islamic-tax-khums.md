The Islamic Tax ( Khums )
=========================

in the name of allah, the merciful, the compassionate

" and know that of whatever you acquire, one-fifth of it belongs to
god, his messenger, the near of kin, the orphans, the needy and the
wayfarer." the qur'an, 8:41

" khums ", literally means in arabic, one fifth is an islamic tax
revenue for certain income in order to fulfil the needs of islamic
community. prophet muhammad (p.) placed khums in the third place of
islamic beliefs. bukhari reports that prophet muhammad (p.) said, " i
command you four things- first to belief in god, bear witness that there
is no god but allah; second to perform prayers; third to pay zakat; and
fourth to pay khums of whatever you gain. ( bukhari, v. 4. p.99.
cairo)

ahl-ul-bayt hadith says : khums is an obligation on whoever benefits-in
small or large amounts. the reason for the emphasis of qur'an and hadith
on khums obviously lies behind the need of the community for an assured
tax revenue. basically, all muslims jurists agree that khums is an
obligatory islamic tax, but they differ in conditions of this tax.

the different views are based on the meaning of "ghanama" in the
mentioned qur'anic verse. the arabic lexicons gave the meaning of the
word " ghanama" as to gain booty of the war, to obtain something, to
gain something, to bestow, to grant, and to seize. the word "ghanama"
was used in all these meanings. it is even used in abstract meaning,
such as proverbs, e.g.,ightunimu al -furas (take opportunities, do not
loose them)

on these basis , ahl-ul-bayt school of thoughts believes that "
ghanama" means whatever an individual gains, whether as booty of war or
as source of income, it applies to this islamic tax.

therefore khums applies to any of the following categories: booty of
war, mineral, khol, oil, treasure hidden in earth or net income, these
all would be considered as " gained profit".


**Net Income**

among these categories the most common is the net income gained by the
lawful means, such as trade, professional incomes, or any other work
related incomes. after deducting expenses, the net income is subject to
khums. all of the expenses are tax-exempted from khums tax. the khums
applies only if the net income remained one year without any use. thus
if it is used within a year after the date if profit or income, the
khums does not apply.

also if the khums of the particular object has been paid, the object
would be tax exempted as long as it remains. but if it is used in
business and some profits are made in it, then the khums tax applies
only on the profit. one can pay the khums tax immediately after gaining
the profit. it does not become obligatory before passing one year
without use. one the basis, one is always on safe side to record the
daily income and expenses.

this could be managed by an annual schedule showing the capital, the
expenses, the net income, the khums paid and the khums due, etc.


**Distribution for Khums**

the khums is divided as follows: the first 10 percent of khums is
called ( sahm-al- imam ) used to serve the needs of islamic faith which
fulfills the need of the islamic community worldwide. since imam
recognizes this need more than any one else, it should be given to him
or his representative, the highest authority-mujtahid or ask his view in
this regard.

the second 10 percent should be given to a poor sayyid who can not earn
his living for a year, but he should not use it in any unlawful ways.

**Funeral Regulations**

in the name of god, most gracious, most merciful

" every soul shall taste death ". the qur'an, 3:184 islam as a way of
life, has legislated many rules in order to honor humans from birth to
death. among these rules are funeral regulations. the holy qur'an
reads:

" every soul shall taste death, at the end, to us shall be you be
returned back. but those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, to
them shall we give chambers of paradise underneath which, rivers flow,
therein dwelling forever. an excellent is the wage of those who ( do
goods deeds)". the qur'an 29:57&58.

these regulations start from death bed until burial. the three main
obligatory (wajib) regulations are as follows:

1. washing ( ghusl). to wash the body of the deceased.

2. shrouded ( kafan). the deceased should be wrapped in three simple
sheets of cloth.

3. special prayer (salat-al-mayyit). this prayer is part of funeral
service. then the deceased is buried in a grave which is dug parallel to
face kaa'ba, mecca. in addition, there are many recommendations
(mustahab), which are recommended but are not obligatory. this, in
brief, presents the main obligatory ( wajib) rules of islamic funeral
regulations.

at death bed: when it becomes obvious to whomever is present at the
death bed of a muslim, it is obligatory to turn him/her towards qiblah
(mecca).this can be done by being laid down on back while the feet
stretched towards qiblah. it is recommend to recite the holy qur'an at
his/her presence, especially chapter 2, verse 254; chapter 33,36 and 37.
the recitation should not be done in a loud voice in order to avoid
disturbance to person on the death bed. however , he/she should not be
left unattended. after death: it is recommended to bury the deceased
person as soon as possible. prophet muhammad (p.) said, "honor the
deceased person by hurrying the burial procedure".

it is forbidden to embalm the body. note: there is no legal requirement
to embalm if the body is buried within 24 hours.

**i. washing ( ghusl-al-mayyit)**

it is obligatory to wash the deceased after the cloth have been
removed. the private parts of the body of the deceased shall never be
viewed. before washing ( ghusl), the body should be clean from impure
objects, such as blood etc. the washing ( ghusl-al-mayyit) begins with
intention (niyat), then you may begin washing. first, wash the head and
neck. second, wash the right side of body ( shoulder to toes ). third,
wash the left side of the body ( shoulder to toes ). this
ghusl-al-mayyit should be performed on the deceased three times.

first, with water mixed some powder of lotus leaves.

second, with water mixed with some camphor.

third, with pure clean water only. if lotus leaves or camphor are not
available, then pure water can be used as substitution, and in addition
it is also necessary to perform tayammum on the deceased.

**note:**

1. anyone who washes the deceased must do ghusl-al-mass for himself;
that is to take shower for touching the corpse. this ghusl-al-mass is
obligatory for touching the dead body after the body becoming cold and
before being washed.

2. if the deceased is less than three years old, either man or woman
can wash the body.

3. hunut is obligatory, that is, to rub with camphor seven parts of the
body which are placed on the ground during daily prayers. (1-forehead,
2-3 palms, 4-5 knees, and 6-7 toes.)

ii. the shroud ( kafan )

after washing ( ghusl) has been completed it is obligatory to shroud
the deceased in three separate sheets.

the first sheet should, atleast, cover the area navel to the knees.

the second sheet should cover, atleast, part of upper body from
shoulder to the upper body, from shoulders to the upper half of legs.
the third sheet should cover the whole body. the deceased should be
completely wrapped in it.

please note, it is forbidden to use unclean sheets or anything made of
silk. it is recommended that, (1) the garment be made of cotton and be
white; (2) to have turban for men and hair cover for a women; (3)
covering the private parts areas with cotton; and (4) to write some
especial prayer ( du'a ) on the shroud.

**iii. the prayer**

the prayer of funeral service differs from the regular daily prayers.
this prayer should be offered for any deceased muslim who is six years
of age and older. during the time of prayer, the deceased must be laid
on his/her back, and the head should be to the right of the person(s)
who is offering the prayers. the person(s) offering this prayer must
face qibla ( mecca).

how to pray? this prayer should be offered in a standing position close
enough t the deceased body. the person(s) who is offering this prayer
must face qibla (mecca), raises his hands to ears saying "allah-u-akber"
( god is great) and recite the following prayers in between:

(allah-u-akber. ashhad-un-la ilaha illallah wahdhu la shrika lah. wa
ashhaddu anna muhammadan abdduhu wa rasuluh. arsallahu bil haqqi bashir
an wa nadiran bayn-a-yaday assa'a.)

1. translation: god is great - i bear witness that there is no god but
god. he has no associate, and that muhammad is his servant and
messenger. he sent him with true warning and good news until the day of
judgement.

( allah-u-akber. allahummal! salle ala' muhammad. warham muhammadan wa
ale muhammad. ka afdale ma salliyta wa barkata wa tarahhamta ala ibrahim
wa ale ibrahim. innaka hamidun majid. wa salle ala jamie ibadallah al
salehin ).

2. translation : god is great.- oh lord, bless muhammad and the house
of m muhammad and grant your blessings for muhammad and the house of
muhammad, just as you granted you blessing for abraham and the house of
abraham. you are the praised, the glorious bless all prophets,
messengers, martyrs, righteous and all good servants of you.

( allah-u-akber. allahumma! ighfirlil mumineena wal muminat, wal
muslamina wal muslimat, al ahyae. munhum wal amwat. tabi allahumma
baynana wa bayanahum bil khayrat. innaka mujib ul daawat. innaka ala
kulle shain qadir).

3. translation: god is great - oh lord! forgive all believers, male and
female, all muslems male and female. those who are among us and those
who passed away. oh lord ! continue your blessings on them and us.
surely, you respond to prayers and you have power over everything.

( allah-u-akber. allahumma! ina hada al mussajja qudamna abduka wa ibnu
abdika wabna amatik. nazala bik wa anta khairu manzulen beh. allahumma
inna laa naalamu minhu illa khaira, wa anta aalamu behi minna. allahumma
! in kana muhsinan fazid fi-ihsanih, wa in kana maseyan fa tajawaz an
saiyatih. wa aghfirlah allahumma ! ijalhu indaka fi aala 'illyyin wa
akhlaf ala ahlihi fi alghabirin wa arhamhu bermateka ya arham ar
rahim).

4. translation: god is great- oh lord! this deceased in front of us is
your servant and son of your servant and your maid. he comes to you and
you are the best host. oh lord! we dont know about him but good, and you
know him better than us. oh lord! if he was a good doer increase his
deeds and if was a bad doer forgive him. oh lord! place him among the
good doers and bless his soul and grant patience to his family. you are
the most beneficient, the merciful.

5. allah-u-akber. translation : god is great.

( this is the end of the prayer. note: one who offers this prayer
however, should change the pronouns for female deceased.)

one can recite ' fateha' for the deceased or any part of the qur'an if
he/she wishes.

**iv. burial procedure**

the deceased must be buried in an islamic graveyard arranged for
muslims only. in the grave, the deceased must be placed laying on his
right side of the body facing qibla (mecca).

it is recommended for those who participates in the burial procession
to pour some sand on the grave and say : " we are from god and to him
shall return."

note: since the local law does not permit to bury deceased without a
case or cement liner ( infant is an exception), the same procedure must
be used. that is to pour some sand inside the cement case. sand must be
poured inside the case as well as on the dead body itself; making sure
the body is laid on its right side facing mecca.

**v. final call ( talqin )**

it is reported that after deceased is buried, he/she is visited by two
angels, who ask certain questions about faith. therefore, it is
recommended to pronounce talqin at the last moment of the burial. the
text of talqin address the soul of the deceased and reads in part :

oh servant of almighty god ! when the two angels come to you and ask
questions regarding your faith, say in reply, that. i have accepted god
as my lord, and islam as my religion, and prophet muhammad as my prophet
and the qur'an as my book of guidance, and ka'aba as the direction of my
worship, and the following imams as my leaders :

1. ali, the imam (leader of the faithfuls);

2. hasan ( son of imam ali, whose nickname is mujtaba );

3. husayn ( the martyr of karbala, iraq );

4. ali, son of hussain ( al-sajjad, zainul abidin, the worshipper);

5. mohammad, son of ali ( al- baqir, who splits knowledge);

6. ja'far, son of mohammad (al-sadiq, the truthful);

7. musa, son of ja'far (al-kadim, who keeps silence);

8. ali, son of musa (al-ridha, on whom all islamic communities agreed
upon );

9. muhammad, son of ali ( al-jawad, the generous and al-taqi, the
pious);

10. ali, son of mohammad ( al-hadi, the guide and al-naqi, the pure);

11. hassan, son of ali (al-askari, who was forced to lived in the
military camp );

12. muhammad, son of hassan ( al-medhi, the rightly guided, the hope of
unjustly treated people).

i believe in paradise as verity, that hell is a verity, the question in
grave is a verity, that the day of judgment is a verity, and no doubt
that god will resurrect people from their graves.

may almighty god : keep you firm in these trails. the holy qur'an says
: " god confirms those who believe by a firm saying in the life of this
world and in the hereafter." the qur'an 14:27. also almighty god says :
" oh soul at peace ! return to you lord, pleasing, pleased; so, enter
among my servant and enter my paradise"; the qur'an 89:28-31; oh god !
make his/her affairs light and render what he/she is going to face.
bless him/her with your vision. " fateha.
