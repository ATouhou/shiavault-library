Obedience to the Shari\`ah
--------------------------

> يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تُقَدِّمُوا بَيْنَ يَدَيِ اللَّهِ
> وَرَسُولِهِ ۖ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ {1}

1 O you who believe! *In the matters of the shari\`ah* do not go ahead
of *or take precedence* before Allah and His Messenger *and the Imams;*
and fear *the punishment of* Allah for such actions, and be careful of
what you say or write *about the shari\`ah* *because* Allah surely is
All-Hearing and All-Knowing. *(During the Occultation of the Present
Imam, the same discipline should be observed by following the most
learned mujtahid – expert of Islamic laws – of our time.)*

> يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَرْفَعُوا أَصْوَاتَكُمْ فَوْقَ
> صَوْتِ النَّبِيِّ وَلَا تَجْهَرُوا لَهُ بِالْقَوْلِ كَجَهْرِ
> بَعْضِكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ أَنْ تَحْبَطَ أَعْمَالُكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ لَا
> تَشْعُرُونَ {2}

2 O you who believe! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the
Prophet. *After the death of the Prophet the believers can follow this
command of Allah by not voicing their objections against the laws
brought by the Prophet.* And do not talk loudly to him as you talk to
one another. *Heed to these two commands,* lest *all* your deeds become
forfeited *in such a way that* you won’t even realize it.

> إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَغُضُّونَ أَصْوَاتَهُمْ عِنْدَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ
> أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ امْتَحَنَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ ۚ
> لَهُمْ مَغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ {3}

3 Surely those who lower their voices in the presence of the Messenger
of Allah are the people whose souls have been tested by Allah for their
piety (tawqa); for them, *and for all those who heed to the above
command,* is the forgiveness of Allah and a great reward.

> إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُنَادُونَكَ مِنْ وَرَاءِ الْحُجُرَاتِ أَكْثَرُهُمْ
> لَا يَعْقِلُونَ {4}

> وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ صَبَرُوا حَتَّىٰ تَخْرُجَ إِلَيْهِمْ لَكَانَ خَيْرًا
> لَهُمْ ۚ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ {5}

*During the last years of the Prophet’s life, many in­dividuals and
groups came to Madinah to visit the Prophet. Among these visitors, the
Bedouins behaved in such a way that even Allah did not like it. Whenever
they entered the ci­ty of Madinah, they would all go to the Prophet’s
house at the same time and call him out to see him; they did not realize
that the Prophet was entitled to some privacy and rest.* 4 Surely most
of the people who call you, *O Muhammad,* from outside[^2] the rooms, do
not understand. 5 If they waited patiently until you come out to them,
this would be bet­ter for them. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

Criterion of Truth & Falshood in News
-------------------------------------

*Walid* *bin \`Uqbah bin Abi Mu\`it of the tribe of Bani Umayyah* *was
sent by the Prophet to the people of Bani Mustalaq to collect zakat. In
pre-Islamic days, Walid and Bani Mustalaq were enemies of each other.
When the people of Bani Mustalaq came to know that Walid is coming as a
represen­tative of the Prophet, they came forward to welcome him. When
Walid saw them from far, he thought that they have come to fight against
him because of their past enmity. Thus he returned to Madinah before
even meeting the Bani Mustalaq people. In Madinah, he reported to the
Prophet that, “The tribe of Bani Mustalaq had given up Islam and refused
to pay zakat.”*

*When the representatives of Bani Mustalaq came to Madinah to inquire
about the strange attitude of Walid, they found the Prophet very upset
with them.*

*It was in relation to this false report of Walid* *bin \`Uqbah that
Allah revealed the following verse*[^3]*:*

> يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنْ جَاءَكُمْ فَاسِقٌ بِنَبَإٍ
> فَتَبَيَّنُوا أَنْ تُصِيبُوا قَوْمًا بِجَهَالَةٍ فَتُصْبِحُوا عَلَىٰ
> مَا فَعَلْتُمْ نَادِمِينَ {6}

6 O you who believe! If a sinful person comes to you with news *or a
report about a person or people;* then ascertain *the truth of his
report* lest you harm a people because *of your* ignorance and then
regret what you have done. *(Therefore think twice before you criticize
any Muslim nation or people when some news concerning it comes from a
source which is unreliable or opposed to Islam.)*

Obedience to the Prophet
------------------------

> وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ فِيكُمْ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ۚ لَوْ يُطِيعُكُمْ فِي
> كَثِيرٍ مِنَ الْأَمْرِ لَعَنِتُّمْ وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ حَبَّبَ
> إِلَيْكُمُ الْإِيمَانَ وَزَيَّنَهُ فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ وَكَرَّهَ
> إِلَيْكُمُ الْكُفْرَ وَالْفُسُوقَ وَالْعِصْيَانَ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ
> الرَّاشِدُونَ {7}

> فَضْلًا مِنَ اللَّهِ وَنِعْمَةً ۚ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ {8}

7 And O *you the believers,* know that the Messenger of Allah is among
you; if he were to obey you in most things, *for example, in the case of
Walid's false report,* then surely you would fall into trouble. But
Allah *has saved you from trouble* by endearing the faith to you, by
adorning it for your hearts and by arousing dislike in you to disbelief,
transgression and disobedience. These *people who follow the commands of
the Prophet and his rightful successors* are the rightly guided people.
8 *This right guidance is* a grace from Allah and a favour and Allah is
indeed *All-Knowing and Wise*.

Islamic Solidarity
------------------

> وَإِنْ طَائِفَتَانِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ اقْتَتَلُوا فَأَصْلِحُوا
> بَيْنَهُمَا ۖ فَإِنْ بَغَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا عَلَى الْأُخْرَىٰ فَقَاتِلُوا
> الَّتِي تَبْغِي حَتَّىٰ تَفِيءَ إِلَىٰ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِنْ فَاءَتْ
> فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَهُمَا بِالْعَدْلِ وَأَقْسِطُوا ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ
> يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ {9}

> إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَ أَخَوَيْكُمْ ۚ
> وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ {10}

9 If two parties of believers, *or two people,* fight *with each other,*
then *don't just stand as on-lookers, but go forward to* make peace
between them.

But if one of them *refuses to make peace and continues to* oppress the
other, then you should fight the oppressor until he agrees to return
*and heed* to the command to Allah. When the oppressor heeds *to the
commandments of Allah,* then make peace between them on basis of justice
and act with equity. Surely Allah loves those who act with equity.
*(Therefore to be "non-aligned" in regards to affairs of the Muslims is
an un-Islamic attitude.)*

*Why should a Muslim brother (or people) bother himself to make peace
between two Muslims? What right does he have to do so?* 10 Surely the
believers are but brothers, therefore, *if two believers fight each
other then you, as brothers, should* make peace between your brothers.
And *while making peace act justly* and fear *the punishment of* Allah,
so that He may have mercy on you.

Some Moral Rights of Muslims
----------------------------

*As the Muslims have been declared brothers of each other, they must
respect the rights of one another. These rights are of reciprocal
nature:*

> يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا يَسْخَرْ قَوْمٌ مِنْ قَوْمٍ عَسَىٰ
> أَنْ يَكُونُوا خَيْرًا مِنْهُمْ وَلَا نِسَاءٌ مِنْ نِسَاءٍ عَسَىٰ أَنْ
> يَكُنَّ خَيْرًا مِنْهُنَّ ۖ وَلَا تَلْمِزُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَلَا
> تَنَابَزُوا بِالْأَلْقَابِ ۖ بِئْسَ الِاسْمُ الْفُسُوقُ بَعْدَ
> الْإِيمَانِ ۚ وَمَنْ لَمْ يَتُبْ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ {11}

A. 11 O you who believe! People should not laugh at, *or make fun of,*
another people, *because* possibly those *who are being laughed at* may
be better, *in the view of Allah* than those *who laugh*. Nor should
women *laugh* at other women *because* possibly those *who are being
laughed at* may be better, *in the view of Allah*, than those *who
laugh*.

B. Do not find fault with your own Muslim brothers, *rather pay more
attention to self-criticism and to your own perfection.*

C. Do not call one another by *bad and insulting* nicknames, *because
calling someone by* bad names after *his declaration of* the faith is
*itself* a transgression. And those who *indulge in these wrongful acts*
and do not ask forgiveness *for their sins*; they are the unjust people.

> يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اجْتَنِبُوا كَثِيرًا مِنَ الظَّنِّ
> إِنَّ بَعْضَ الظَّنِّ إِثْمٌ ۖ وَلَا تَجَسَّسُوا وَلَا يَغْتَبْ
> بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضًا ۚ أَيُحِبُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَنْ يَأْكُلَ لَحْمَ أَخِيهِ
> مَيْتًا فَكَرِهْتُمُوهُ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ تَوَّابٌ
> رَحِيمٌ {12}

D. 12 O you who believe! Avoid most of the suspicious *thoughts about
other Muslims;* for surely suspi­cion in some cases is a sin.

E. And do not spy *on each other.*

F. Nor should some of you back-bite others. Does any one of you like to
eat the flesh of his dead brother?! *Surely* you abhor it. *Suspicion
leads to spying and spying in turn leads to backbiting. Avoidance of
suspicion helps in refraining from spying on others and thus backbiting.
So fear the punishment of Allah in violating these rights of a Muslim
brother.* Surely Allah is Most-Forgiving and Merciful.

Racism Rejected
---------------

*One of the most abhorring social features of our present age is racial
discrimination. Almost every country and community suffers from this
social disease in varying degrees. Address­ing the human society, Allah
says:­*

> يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ مِنْ ذَكَرٍ وَأُنْثَىٰ
> وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا ۚ إِنَّ
> أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ
> خَبِيرٌ {13}

13 O you men! We have created you from a male and a female *(i.e., Adam*
*and Hawwa)*, and then We made you *into different* races and tribes so
that you may know *and recognise* each other.

*According to Islam, each and every human being is from Adam* *and
Hawwa. Allah divided them into different tribes and races so that it
would be easy to recognise one another. Thus the difference in race,
tribe, colour and language are to facilitate the recognition of each
other.*

*These physical and material dif­ferences cannot be a standard for
preference or superiority of one group over others. Besides knowledge
and jihad (in its every sense), the only mark of distinction in Islam is
taqwa i.e., piety and God fearing.* Surely the most honourable of you in
Allah’s sight is the one who is most pious among you; surely Allah is
All-Knowing and Aware.

Difference Between Islam and Iman: Submission & Conviction
----------------------------------------------------------

*The Bedouin people of Bani Asad* *were overcome by famine. They came to
Madinah and declared themselves Muslims. Then they asked the Prophet to
give them some of the zakat. They talked to the Prophet in such a way
that it seemed that they had done him a favour by becoming Muslims, and
that he was obliged to help them. It was about them that Allah says:*

> قَالَتِ الْأَعْرَابُ آمَنَّا ۖ قُلْ لَمْ تُؤْمِنُوا وَلَٰكِنْ قُولُوا
> أَسْلَمْنَا وَلَمَّا يَدْخُلِ الْإِيمَانُ فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ
> تُطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ لَا يَلِتْكُمْ مِنْ أَعْمَالِكُمْ
> شَيْئًا ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ {14}

14 The Arabs of the desert say, *“O Muhammad!* We believe *in you and
your God.”* Tell *them*: “You do not believe *in me or my Lord, however*
you should say, ‘We submit (aslamna) *ourselves to your Lord,*’ because
the faith (iman) has not yet entered into your hearts. But if you
*sincerely* obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not diminish anything
from your deeds. Surely Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.”

*Therefore, Islam (submission) and Iman (faith, conviction) are two
different stages of belief. “Islam” is verbal confession, whereas “Iman”
is spiritual conviction; Islam is believing in Allah and His Messenger
by just following others (like parents and society, etc.), whereas Iman
is believing in Allah and His Messenger after achieving conviction about
the truth of Allah and His Messenger.*

> إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ثُمَّ
> لَمْ يَرْتَابُوا وَجَاهَدُوا بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ فِي
> سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الصَّادِقُونَ {15}

*The next verse defines the mu’minin (those who believe with conviction)
vis-a-vis the muslimin (those who verbally submit themselves to Allah).*

15 The mu’minin (believers) are only those who:

• believe in Allah and His Messenger, *verbally as well as spiritually;*

• and then they never doubt *in their faith because it originates from
conviction not blind following;*

• and they struggle hard with their wealth and their lives in the way of
Allah.

These are the truthful *believers*.

> قُلْ أَتُعَلِّمُونَ اللَّهَ بِدِينِكُمْ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي
> السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ
> {16}

16 O Muhammad, tell *those Arabs* that: Are you appraising Allah about
your religion by saying that, *“We Believe?”* Allah knows what is in the
Heavens and what is in the Earth. Allah knows all things.

> يَمُنُّونَ عَلَيْكَ أَنْ أَسْلَمُوا ۖ قُلْ لَا تَمُنُّوا عَلَيَّ
> إِسْلَامَكُمْ ۖ بَلِ اللَّهُ يَمُنُّ عَلَيْكُمْ أَنْ هَدَاكُمْ
> لِلْإِيمَانِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ {17}

17 By becoming Muslims, they seem to do you a favour! Tell *them that,*
“By becoming Muslims you do not do me a favour, rather Allah has done
you a favour by guiding you to the faith. *This is a fact which you can
easily understand* if you are truthful.

> إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ
> بَصِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ {18}

18 Surely Allah knows the unseen things of the heavens and the earth,
and Allah sees what you do.
