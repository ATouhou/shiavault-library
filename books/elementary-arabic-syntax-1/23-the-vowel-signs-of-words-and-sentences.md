The Vowel Signs of Words and Sentences
======================================

61. Does the end of an indeclinable word change if it is placed in
different parts of a sentence?  
 Every indeclinable word that is placed in a certain part of a sentence
is given the declinable state that it would have had if it was a
declinable word, but this state does not change the word at all.  
 For example: **أنا** **ذاهبٌ** (I am a leaver.)  
 Or: **إنّکَ** **صادقٌ** (Verily, you are truthful.)  
 Or: **إن** **صَدَقَ** **القَصدُ** **حَسُنَ** **العَمَلُ** (If the
intention is truthful the deed will be good.)
