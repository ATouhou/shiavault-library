Fatima’s Future Prediction:
===========================

Among all the ignorant, Fatima (peace be upon her) was awake and agile
and aware of the events. She also could predict the future and knew what
would happen. Her predictions and outlook were Divine, stable, moderate
and sensible. She knew that ignoring the Caliphate of Ali (peace be upon
him) and his real right would result in a bitter and dark consequences
for the society.

She predicted the future of Omma in a meeting with the wOmmen of
Mohajerin (the Emigrants) and Ansar (the Helpers) as so:

“What they have done is like a pregnant camel that we must wait to
deliver. Then, instead of milk, you will draw bowls full of blood and
fatal venom from it. Afterwards, the felons will sustain a loss and the
next generation will feel the effect of the sinister foundation of the
ancestors”.

Fatima’s prediction was later confirmed, and came true. The people
tasted bitter and tolerated so many pains under the load of the
government so-called Islamic. Of course, the Prophet (peace be upon him
and his descendants), Ali and Fatima (peace be upon them) and the real
companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his descendants) had
evinced their exaltation ,but there existed no ears, sense of
responsibility ,and undertaking.
