The Interior Life in Islam
==========================

Seyyed Hossein Nasr Vol. III, Nos. 2 & 3

"O thou soul which are at peace, return unto thy Lord, with gladness
that is thine in Him and His in thee. Enter thou among My slaves. Enter
thou My Paradise." (Quran - LXXXIX; 27-30 (trans. by M. Lings.)

The function of religion is to bestow order upon human life and to
establish an "outward" harmony upon whose basis man can return inwardly
to his Origin by means of the journey toward the "interior" direction.
This universal function is especially true of Islam, this last religion
of humanity, which is at once a Divine injunction to establish order in
human society and within the human soul and at the same time to make
possible the interior life, to prepare the soul to return unto its Lord
and enter the Paradise which is none other than the Divine Beatitude.
God is at once the First (al-awwal) and the Last (al-akhir), the Outward
(al-zahir) and the Inward (al-batin).

[^1] By function of His outwardness He creates a world of separation and
otherness and through His inwardness He brings men back to their Origin.
Religion is the means whereby this journey is made possible, and it
recapitulates in its structure the creation itself which issues from God
and returns unto Him. Religion consists of a dimension which is outward
and another which, upon the basis of this outwardness, leads to the
inward. These dimensions of the islamic revelation are called the
Shariah (the Sacred Law), the Tariqah (the Path) and the Haqiqah (the
Truth), [^2] or from another point of view they correspond to islam,
iman, and ihsan, or "surrender", "faith" and "virtue".[^3]

Although the whole of the Quranic revelation is called "islam", from
the perspective in question here it can be said that not all those who
follow the tradition on the level of islam are mu'mins, namely those who
possess iman, nor do all those who are mu'mins possess ihsan, which is
at once virtue and beauty and by function of which man is able to
penetrate into the inner meaning of religion. The Islamic revelation is
meant for all human beings destined to follow this tradition.

But not all men are meant to follow the interior path. It is enough for
a man to have lived according to the Shariah and in surrender (islam) to
the Divine Will to die in grace and to enter into Paradise. But there
are those who yearn for the Divine here and now and whose love for God
and propensity for the contemplation of the Divine Realities (al-haqaiq)
compel them to seek the path of inwardness. The revelation also provides
a path for such men, for men who through their iman and ihsan "return
unto their Lord with gladness" while still walking upon the earth.

While the concrete embodiment of the Divine Will, which is the Shariah,
is called the exoteric dimension in the sense of governing all of man's
outward life as well as his body and psyche, the spiritual path, which
leads beyond the usual understanding of the "soul" as a separated and
forgetful substance in the state which Christians call the "fallen
state", is called the esoteric dimension. In Sunni Islam, this dimension
is almost completely identified with Sufism (tasawwuf) while in Shi'ism,
in addition to Sufism, the esoteric and the exoteric are intermingled
within the general structure of the religious doctrines and practices
themselves.[^4] And even within Sunnism, there is an intermediate region
between the exoteric and the esoteric, a world of religious practice and
doctrines which while not strictly speaking esoteric are like the
reflection of the inner teachings of Sufism within the whole community
and a foretaste of its riches.

In fact, many of the prayer manuals which occupy such a position in the
Sunni world, such as the Dalail al- khayrat, were written by Sufi
masters, while in the Shi'ite world, the prayers almost all of which,
such as the al-Sahifah al-sajjadiyyah of the fourth Imam Zayn al-
Abidin, were written by esoteric authors, partake of both an esoteric
and an exoteric character.[^5] Occasionally, there has even been the
penetration of one domain upon another, such as the sayings of many of
the Imams which have appeared in Sufi writings and even of some Sufi
writings which have penetrated into certain Shi'ite prayers identified
with some of the Imams.[^6]

Prayers such as those of Khwajah 'Abdallah Ansari, the great saint of
Herat contained in his Supplications (Munajat) are at once the deepest
yearning of the heart for the Ineffable and the Infinite and common
devotional prayers chanted by many of the devout in the community and
thus belonging to the intermediate level alluded to above:

I live only to do Thy will,
My lips move only in praise of Thee
O Lord, whoever becometh aware of Thee
Casteth out all else other than Thee.
O Lord, give me a heart
That I may pour it out in Thanksgiving
Give me life
That I may spend it
In working for the salvation of the world.
O Lord, give me understanding
That I stray not from the path
Give me light
To avoid pitfalls.
O Lord, give me eyes
Which see nothing but Thy glory.
Give me a mind
That finds delight in Thy service.
Give me a soul
Drunk in the wine of Thy wisdom.[^7]

In the same way that the dimension of inwardness is inward in relation
to the outward and the outward is necessary as the basis and point of
departure for the journey toward the inward, so is the experience of the
Divinity as imminent dependent upon the awareness of the Divinity as
transcendent. No man has the right to approach the Imminent without
surrendering himself to the Transcendent, and it is only in possessing
faith in the Transcendent that man is able to experience the Imminent.
Or from another point of view, it is only in accepting the Shari'ah that
man is able to travel upon the Path (tariqah) and finally to reach the
Truth (haqiqah) which lies at the heart of all things and yet is beyond
all determination and limitation.

To interiorize life itself and to become aware of the inward dimension,
man must have recourse to rites whose very nature it is to cast a sacred
form upon the waves of the ocean of multiplicity in order to save man
and bring him back to the shores of Unity. The major rites or pillars
(arkan) of Islam, namely the daily prayers (salat), fasting (sawm), the
pilgrimage (hajj), the religious tax (zakat) and holy war (jihad), are
all means of sanctifying man's terrestrial life and enabling him to live
and to die as a central being destined for beatitude. But these rites
themselves are not limited to their outer forms. Rather they possess
inward dimensions and levels of meaning which man can reach in function
of the degree of his faith (iman) and the intensity and quality of his
virtue or inner beauty (ihsan).

The daily prayers (salat in Arabic, namaz in Persian, Turkish and Urdu)
are the most fundamental rites of Islam, preceded by the ablutions and
the call to prayers (adhan), both of which contain the profoundest
symbolic significance. The form of these prayers is derived directly
from the sunnah of the Holy Prophet and the daily prayers are considered
as the most important of religious deeds for as the Prophet has said,
"The first of his deeds for which a man will be taken into account on
the day of resurrection will be his prayer. If it is sound he will be
saved and successful, but if it is unsound he will be unfortunate and
miserable.

If any deficiency is found in his obligatory prayer the Lord who is
blessed and exalted will issue instructions to consider whether His
servant has said any voluntary prayers so that what is lacking in the
obligatory prayer may be made up by it. Then the rest of his actions
will be treated in the same fashion." [^8] The salat punctuates man's
daily existence, determines its rhythm, provides a refuge in the storm
of life and protects man from sin. Its performance is obligatory and its
imprint upon Islamic society and the soul of the individual Muslim
fundamental beyond description.

Yet, the meaning of the prayers are not to be understood solely through
the study of their external form or their impact upon Islamic society,
as fundamental as those may be. By virtue of the degree of man's ihsan,
and also by virtue of the grace (barakah) contained within the sacred
forms of the prayers, man is able to attain inwardness through the very
external forms of the prayers. He is able to return, thanks to the words
and movements which are themselves the echoes of the inner states of the
Holy Prophet, back to the state of perfect servitude (ubudiyyah) and
nearness to the Divine (qurb) which characterize the inner journey of
the Holy Prophet as the Universal Man (al-insan al-kamil) to the Divine
Presence on that nocturnal ascent (al-miraj), which is at once the inner
reality of the prayers and the prototype[^9] of spiritual realization in
Islam.[^10]

Not only do the canonical prayers possess an interior dimension, but
they also serve as the basis for other forms of prayer which become ever
more inward as man progresses upon the spiritual path leading finally to
the "prayer of the heart", the invocation (dhikr) in which the invoker,
invocation and the invoked become united, and through which man returns
to the Center, to the Origin which is pure Inwardness.[^11] The interior
life of Islam is based most of all upon the power of prayer and the
grace issuing from the sacred language of Arabic in which various
prayers are performed. Prayer itself is the holy barque which leads man
from the world of outwardness and separation to that of union and
interiority, becoming ultimately unified with the center of the heart
and the rhythm which determines human life itself.

The same process of interiorization takes place as far as the other
central rites or pillars of Islam are concerned. Fasting is incumbent
upon all Muslims who are capable of it during the holy month of Ramadan,
a month full of blessings when according to the well-known hadith "the
gates of heaven are opened".[^12] But the outward observation of its
rules, while necessary, is one thing and the full realization of its
meaning is another. Fasting means not only abstention from eating,
drinking and passions during daylight but above all the realization of
the ultimate independence of man's being from the external world and his
dependence upon the spiritual reality which resides within him. Fasting
is, therefore, at once a means of purification and interiorization
complementing the prayers. In fact, it is itself a form of prayer.

The same truth holds true of the other rites. The pilgrimage or hajj is
outwardly the journey towards the house of God in Mecca and inwardly
circumambulation around the Ka'bah of the heart which is also the house
of God. Moreover, the outward hajj is the means and support for that
inner journey to the Center which is at once nowhere and everywhere and
which is the goal of every wayfaring and journeying. The zakat or
religious tax is likewise not only the "purifying" of one's wealth
through the act of charity which helps the poor, but also the giving of
oneself and the realization of the truth that by virtue of the Divine
origin of all things, and not because of some form of sentimental
humanitarianism,[^13] the other or the neighbour is myself. Zakat,
therefore, is, in addition to a means of preserving social equilibrium,
a way of self-purification and interiorization, of creating awareness of
one's inner nature shown from artificial attachment to all that
externalizes and dissipates.

Finally, the holy war or jihad is not simply the defense or extension
of the Islamic borders which has taken place only during certain
episodes of Islamic history, but the constant inner war against all that
veils man from the Truth and destroys his inner equilibrium. The greater
holy war (al-jihad al-akbar) as this inner battle has been called, by
the Holy Prophet, is, like the "unseen warfare" of Orthodox
spirituality, the very means of opening the royal path to the center of
the heart.

It is the battle which must of necessity be carried out to open the
door to the way of inwardness. Without this greater jihad man's
externalizing and centrifugal tendencies cannot be reversed and the
precious jewels contained in the treasury of the heart cannot be
attained. The jihad, like the prayers, fasting, pilgrimage and religious
tax, while a pillar of Islam and a foundation of Islamic society, is
also a means toward the attainment of the inner chamber and an
indispensable means for the pursuit of the inner life in its Islamic
form.

An understanding of the interior life in Islam would be incomplete
without reference to the imprint of the Divine Beauty upon both art and
nature. Islamic art, although dealing with world of forms, is, like all
genuine sacred art, a gate towards the inner life. Islam is based
primarily on intelligence and considers beauty as the necessary
complement of any authentic manifestation of the Truth. In fact beauty
is the inward dimension of goodness and leads to that Reality which is
the origin of both beauty and goodness. It is not accidental that in
Arabic moral goodness or virtue and beauty are both called husn.

Islamic art, far from being an accidental aspect of Islam and its
spiritual life, is essential to all authentic expressions of Islamic
spirituality and the gate towards the inner world. From the chanting of
the Holy Quran, which is the most central expression of the Islamic
revelation and sacred art par excellence, to calligraphy and
architecture which are the "embodiments" in the worlds of form and space
of the Divine Word, the sacred art of Islam has always played and
continues to play a fundamental role in the interiorization of man's
life.[^14] The same could of course be said of traditional music (sama\`)
and poetry which have issued from Sufism and which are like nets cast
into the world of multiplicity to bring men back to the inner courtyard
of the Beloved. [^15]

Likewise, nature and its grand phenomena such as the shining of the Sun
and the Moon, the seasonal cycles, the mountains and the streams, are,
in the Islamic perspective, means for the contemplation of the spiritual
realities. They are signs (ayat) of God and although themselves forms in
the external world, mirrors of a reality which is at once inward and
transcendent. Nature is not separated from grace but is a participant in
the Quranic revelation. In fact in Islamic sources, it is called the
"macrocosmic revelation".

Virgin nature is the testament of God and gives the lie to all forms of
pretentious naturalism, rationalism, skepticism and agnosticism, these
maladies from which the modern world suffers so grievously. It is only
in the artificial ugliness of the modern urban setting, created by
modern man to forget God, that such ailments of the mind and the soul
appear as real and the Divine Truth as unreal. Modern skeptical
philosophies are the products of those living in urban centers and not
of men who have been born and who have lived in the bosom of nature and
in awareness of His macrocosmic revelation.[^16] In Islamic spirituality,
nature acts as an important and in some cases indispensable means for
recollection and as an aid towards the attainment of inwardness. Many
Muslim saints have echoed over the ages the words of the Egyptian Sufi
Dhu'l-nun who said:

"O God, I never hearken to the voices of the beasts or the rustle of
the trees, the splashing of waters or the song of birds, the whistling
of the wind or the rumble of thunder, but I sense in them a testimony to
Thy Unity and a proof of Thy Incomparableness that Thou art the
All-prevailing, the All-knowing, the All-wise, the All-just, the
All-true, and that in Thee is neither overthrow nor ignorance nor folly
nor injustice nor lying. O God, I acknowledge Thee in the proof of Thy
handiwork and the evidence of Thy acts: grant me, O God, to seek Thy
Satisfaction with my satisfaction and the Delight of a Father in His
child, remembering Thee in my love for Thee, with serene tranquility and
firm resolve." [^17]

St. Francis of Assisi would surely have joined this chorus in the
praise of the Lord through the reflection of His Beauty and Wisdom in
His Creation.

The goal of the inward life in Islam is to reach the Divine as both the
Transcendent and the Imminent. It is to gain a vision of God as the
Reality beyond all determination and at the same time of the world as
"plunged in God". It is to see God everywhere.[^18] The inward dimension
is the key for the understanding of metaphysics and traditional
cosmology as well as for the penetration into the essential meaning of
religion and of all religions, for at the heart of every authentic
religion lies the one Truth which resides also at the heart of all
things and most of all of man. There are of course differences of
perspective and of form. In Christianity, it is the person of Christ who
saves and who washes away the dross of separation and externalization.
In Islam, such a function is performed by the supreme expression of the
Truth Itself, by the Shahadah, La ilaha ill'llah. To take refuge in it
is to be saved from the debilitating effect of externalization and
"objectivization" and to be brought back to the Center, through the
inward dimension. [^19]

It is not for all men to follow the interior life. As already
mentioned, it is sufficient for a Muslim to live according to the
Shari'ah to enter paradise after death and to follow the interior path
after the end of his terrestrial journey. But for those who seek the
Divine Center while still walking on earth and who have already died and
become resurrected; in this life the interior path opens before them at
a point which is here and a time which is now.

"It is related that one night Shaykh Bayazid went outside the city and
found everything wrapped in deep silence, free from the clamour of men.
The moon was shedding her radiance upon the world and by her light made
night as brilliant as the day. Stars innumerable shone like jewels in
the heavens above, each pursuing its appointed task. For a long time the
Shaykh made his way across the open country and found no movement
therein, nor saw a single soul. Deeply moved by this he cried:

"O Lord, my heart is stirred within me by this Thy Court displayed in
all its splendour and sublimity, yet none are found here to give Thee
the adoring worship which is thy due. Why should this be, O Lord? Then
the hidden voice of God spoke to him: "O thou who art bewildered in the
Way, know that the King does not grant admission to every passer-by. So
exalted is the Majesty of His Court that not every beggar can be
admitted thereto. When the Splendour of My Glory sheds abroad its
radiance from this My sanctuary, the heedless and those who are wrapped
in the sleep of indolence are repelled thereby. Those who are worthy of
admittance to this Court wait for long years, until one in a thousand of
them wins entrance thereto." [^20]

No religion would be complete without providing the path for the "one
in a thousand". Islam as an integral tradition and the last plenary
message of Heaven to the present humanity has preserved to this day the
possibility of following the interior life, a life which, although
actualized fully only by the few, has cast its light and spread its
perfume over all authentic manifestations of the Islamic tradition.
