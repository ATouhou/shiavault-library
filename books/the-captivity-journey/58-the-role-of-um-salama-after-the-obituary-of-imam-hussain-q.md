The Role of Um Salama after the Obituary of Imam Hussain (Q)
============================================================

After the news of the demise of Imam Hussain (Q) had reached Um Salama,
she had many upfront and daring stands towards that terrible crime. Thus
when she learned of his death she said: "They did? May Allah fill their
graves and their houses with fire", then she fainted out.

Even though Um Salama was living in very bad conditions, but she did
make it clear that the people had committed a crime against the last one
left of the people of Garment, and he is the pure and a son of a pure
man, Al-Hussain Bin Ali (Q). This great woman did not stop at this limit
in expressing her stance, but she declared the mourning and wore the
black clothes (a sign of grief) openly, in front of the general public
and inside the Prophetâ€™s mosque.
