Requesting Narration of all Such Incidents
------------------------------------------

**Rabiâ€™ al-Awwal 30, 1330**

Narrate all the rest of such incidents, without leaving any one of them
out, so that we do not have to request you again, even if this means
that your letters will be lengthy, Wassalam.

Sincerely,
