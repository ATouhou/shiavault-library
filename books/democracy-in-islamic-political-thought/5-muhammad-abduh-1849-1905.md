[Muhammad Abduh (1849-1905)]
============================

Muhammad Abduh (1849-1905) believed that Islam's relationship with the
modern age was the most crucial issue that Islamic communities needed to
deal with. In an attempt to reconcile Islamic ideas with Western ones,
he suggested that maslaha (interest) in Islamic thought corresponded to
manfa'a (utility) in Western thought. Similarly, he equated shura with
democracy and ijma' with consensus. Addressing the question of
authority, Abduh denied the existence of a theocracy in Islam and
insisted that the authority of the hakim (governor) or that of the qadi
(judge) or that of the mufti was civil. He strongly believed that
Ijtihad should be revived because ' . emerging priorities and problems,
which are new to the Islamic thought, need to be addressed'.[^15] He was
a proponent of the parliamentary system and defended pluralism, refuting
claims that it would undermine the unity of the ummahh. He argued that
European nations were not divided by it. 'The reason', he concludes, 'is
that their objective is the same. What varies is the method they pursue
toward accomplishing it'.[^16]
