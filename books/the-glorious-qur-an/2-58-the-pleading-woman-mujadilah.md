58: the Pleading Woman (mujadilah)
==================================

This chapter of 22 verses arranged in three sections dates from Madina,
like the previous one. It was revealed after the one on Hypocrites 63
and before The [inner] Apartments 49. This thus makes it the second of
the two Madinese chapters which are placed here. as one can see with its
longer verses and more

involved paragraphs. Its theme condemning arrogant conduct likewise
gives it an affinity to the beginning of Chapter 24 Light (sections
I-III).

The woman referred to was Khawla bint-Tha'laba, and the incident refers
to her domestic problems. The mock divorce of the pagan Arabs which
bound the rejected wife to her household chores is condemned at the very
beginning of the chapter (I). The chapter also contains some lyrical
passages concerning God's awareness of everything. especially of
intrigue. Manners at meetings and parliamentary procedure are discussed
in section 11.
