Responsibility 90: Respecting Things Related to the Imam Part 5
===============================================================

Another responsibility of the true believers is to consider the Nights
of Qadr (in the month of Ramaďhan) as nights of reverence and respect
and to perform the specific actions for these nights.[^1]  
 The Nights of Qadr are directly related to the 12th Imam (ajtf) and
therefore, the best act which can be done on these nights is remembering
and focusing on him and seeking intercession from the Imam.

The Night of Qadr is that night which the entire year cannot reach in
greatness, and the actions which are performed on that night are better
than the actions performed during the span of one thousand months!

It is on this night that all of the commands for the next year are
decreed and the Angels and the Ruh who is the greatest of Angels descend
to the Earth by the permission of their Lord and arrive in the service
of Imam al-Zaman (ajtf). Whatever has been decreed for every person for
the entire year is then presented to the Imam.

Thus, we must perform those specific actions related to these nights and
seek closeness to Allah through the Imam. We must also hold firm to the
Imam, take him as our intercessor and ask our needs and wants through
him (and with the permission of Allah, these will be granted).

Blessed Month of Ramaďhan and the actions for the Nights of Qadr.’
