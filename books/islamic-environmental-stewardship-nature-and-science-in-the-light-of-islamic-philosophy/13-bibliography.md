Notes
-----

1-Regarding terms used in this essay, the term “sacred tradition” is
used here in reference to all paths of enlightenment and revelation
ranging from Christianity to Islam to Buddhism. Additionally, all
references in this essay to traditional and sacred sciences are meant to
address those sciences that study not only the physical domain of
reality, but the metaphysical as well, and are typically associated with
any of such sacred traditions. With that said, this essay also provides
a criticism of modern science for both its ignoring of the metaphysical
domain and for its dominant claim as the only science of nature. Its
dominating adoption of strictly empirical methodologies, such as that of
logical positivism, is addressed in this essay and regarded as an
instigator to the environmental crisis. Such criticism is not new and
has been voiced by many others before, including religious philosophers,
historians of science and scientists themselves. Examples of prominent
thinkers, from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, that have
criticized modern science for these or similar reasons are Émile
Meyerson, Alfred North Whitehead, F. Sherwood Taylor, Jacques Maritian,
G.D. Yarnold, Lord Northbourne, Titus Burckhardt, Frithjof Schuon,
Seyyed Hossein Nasr and William C. Chittick.

2-Perennialism is a philosophy that recognizes the universal recurrence
of philosophical insight existent throughout epochs, sacred traditions
and cultures, especially regarding dimensions of universal truth on the
nature of reality.
