Livelihood
==========

Every thing submits to Him,

and everything exists by Him.

He is the recourse of every poor,

the honour of the lowly,

the might of the weak,

and the comfort of the grieved.

He hears the speech of every speaker,

and knows the secret thoughts of

one who keeps silent.

He provides the **livelihood** of every living thing,

and to Him returns everything that dies.

(Sermon 109)
