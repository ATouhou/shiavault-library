Transpersonal psychology
========================

The transpersonal tradition of Jung, Hillman, Grof, Maslow and Wilber
pursued a vision embracive of the spiritual quite different to the
previous two strands. Its origins, ironically, are with Freud, one of
the 20th century’s most sceptical voices on religion. His immediate
disciple and successor, Carl Gustav Jung, took most of Freud’s
psychoanalytical insights, but shed the aversion to the language of
religion, finding instead important psychological insights in the
Gnostic, Hermetic, Neoplatonist and Alchemical traditions. True, this
was not mainstream Christianity, but this opening in the 20th century
for presecular spiritual insights has been a significant route for the
spiritual, enabling it to bypass the secular extremes of that age and
emerge into the 21st century with clear voice.
