YOU ARE PRICELESS TO THOSE WHO LOVE YOU
A well-known speaker started off his seminar by holding up a $20 bill.
In the room of

200, he asked, “Who would like this $20 bill?” Hands started going up.
He said,

“I am going to give this $20 to one of you but first, let me do this.”
He proceeded to

crumple up the $20 bill. He asked, “Who still wants it?” Still hands
were up in the air.

“Well, what if I do this?” He dropped it on the ground and started to
grind it into the

floor with his shoe. He picked it up, now crumpled and dirty and asked,
“Who still

wants it?” Still hands went up into the air.

My friends, we have all learned a very valuable lesson. No matter what
was done to

the money, it was still wanted because it did not decrease in value. It
was still worth

$20. Many times in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled and ground into
the dirt by the decisions

we make and the circumstances that come our way. We may feel as though
we are worthless.

But no matter what has happened or will happen, you will never lose your
value: dirty or clean,

crumpled or finely creased, you are still priceless to those who love
you.
