Concerning Reports Detailed And Summary
=======================================

Says the Shaykh: Our belief concerning the detailed reports is that they
take precedence over the summary ones, according to the saying of Imam
Jaâ€™far as-Sadiq, on whom be peace.[^1]

[^1]: These are canons of hadith criticism and hardly to be expected in
a creed.
