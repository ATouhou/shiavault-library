Principle One: Obedience belongs only to God
============================================

God is the only One that we have to obey. Independent from Him, nobody
can ask for obedience. He has created us free. Why should anyone obey
men like Nimrod or Abu Sufyan or the arrogant people of his time? God
has created us free so that nobody can ask us to obey him.
