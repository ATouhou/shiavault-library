Chapter 11: Degrees of Believers. Believers are of Various Degrees Distinguishing One from the Other With Regard to Their Limits
================================================================================================================================

   
 This chapter deals with the many different degrees of *iman* and each
*mu’min*’s share thereof. Al-Miqdad, may Allah be pleased with him,
occupies the eighth degree, while Abu Dharr [al-Ghifari], may Allah be
pleased with him, occupies the ninth. Salman, may Allah be pleased with
him, occupies the tenth, and so on.  
    
 In *Al-Kafi*, \`Abdul-Aziz al-Qaratasi is cited as having said,  
    
**‘Abu Abdullah (‘a) said to me, ‘O \`Abdul-Aziz!** ***Iman*** **falls
into ten degrees: it is like a ladder, one step is ascended after the
other. Nobody, therefore, who occupies the second should say to the one
who occupies the first: ‘You do not have anything!= till he ascends to
the tenth. So, do not look down upon one who is below you or else he who
is above you may cause you to slip and fall. When you see someone
occupying a degree less than yours, raise him kindly to you, and do not
over-burden him so you may cause him to break, for anyone who causes a
believer to break has to rejoin what he breaks.** (*Al-Kafi*, Vol. 2, p.
37).  
    
 Surely Allah blesses Muhammad (‘s) and the Progeny of Muhammad (‘s),
the righteous ones, the purified.  
    
 Destiny has hindered the completion of this work; so, I plead to Allah,
the King, the all-Knowing, to grant us those who will complete this
speech; surely none loses hope of His mercy except those who are mean.
