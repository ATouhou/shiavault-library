20: Ta-ha (ta Ha)
=================

This chapter of eight sections is made up of 135 Meccan verses, although
VV. 130 and 131 (in Section VIII) are Madinese. It was revealed after
the previous one on Mary 19 and before The Inevitable 56. The title
comes from its opening letters, which are now used as a man's name as in
the case of the similar title Ya-Sin 36 It begins with the story of
Moses (I-II), narrated in a conversational style, fill of vivid word
pictures. The initial rhyme and rhythm are quite soothing. Then we are
told how to read the Qur'an and about Adam's fall (VI); while the
chapter ends with a section on prayer (VIII) Its sections are long and
the message comes in a very narrative style, which provides relief for
the Prophet's troubles in his native city. Some have called it the best
of the Meccan chapters.
