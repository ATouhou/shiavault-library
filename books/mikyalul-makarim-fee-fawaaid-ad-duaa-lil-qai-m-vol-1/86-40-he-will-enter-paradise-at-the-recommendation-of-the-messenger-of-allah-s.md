40. He Will Enter Paradise At The Recommendation Of The Messenger Of Allah (S)
==============================================================================

The evidence of this is – in addition to what we have stated before that
this *Dua* makes one eligible for intercession – is a tradition that
Sadooq has mentioned in *Khisaal* through his own chain of narrators
that the Messenger of Allah (S) said:

“I guarantee Paradise for one who assures us of five things.” He was
asked: “O Messenger of Allah, what are those?” He replied: “Advice for
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, advice for His Messenger, advice for the
Book of Allah, advice for the religion of Allah and advice for the
Muslim society.”[^1]

I say: Advice is asking for goodness and there is no doubt that all the
five types of advices converge in praying for early reappearance of our
master, the Master of the Time (aj). Because through the reappearance of
His Eminence, grief and distress will be removed from the *Awliya* of
Allah and the Messenger of Allah (S) will become happy and the laws of
the Book of Allah would become clear, the religion of Allah will
dominate the world and the whole Muslim society will get deliverance.
