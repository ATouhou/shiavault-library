Note from Translator
====================

All Praise is to Allah, Lord of the worlds, Who destined me to translate
this sacred *du’a’* into English. Kumayl’s Supplication is one of the
most glorious Islamic *du’a’*s which is resorted to, by the believers,
for the forgiveness of sins, increase in sustenance, and protection
against enemies. It contains numerous rich meanings and heavenly themes
that requires to be explained in order to be understood thoroughly.

I sincerely dedicate this miniscule attempt of introducing Islamic
teachings throughout the world to the holy presence of Prophet Muhammad
(S), peace be upon him and his pure progeny, who endured numerous
hardships for the growth of Islam.

The challenges of translating texts in general and the demanding
translation of Islamic works in particular are quite obvious. It
requires a deep native-like knowledge of the English language combined
with a moderate understanding of Islamic themes. I hope my effort in
trying to convey the message has not been in vain. Thus, I greatly need
the sincere comments from the readers, both natives and non-natives of
English, on the quality of the work.

It will be very kind of you to send me messages either to Ansariyan
Publication’s mailing address or my own email address at
<haminia@gmail.com>.
