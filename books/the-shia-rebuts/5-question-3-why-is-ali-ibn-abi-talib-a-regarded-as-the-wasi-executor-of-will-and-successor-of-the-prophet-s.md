Question 3 : Why is ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (‘a) regarded as the wasi {executor of will} and successor of the Prophet (S)?
=====================================================================================================================

**Reply:** As we already stated, the Shi‘ah have a firm belief that the
position of caliphate is determined through revelation {*tansisi*} and
that after the Holy Prophet (S) the *Imamah* {leadership} is in some
respects like prophethood {*nubuwwah*}.

Just as the Prophet (S) has to be appointed through Divine decree, the
*wasi* {executor of will} of the Prophet (S) too must be designated by
Him, the Glorious and Sublime.

The biography of the Messenger of Allah (S) is a testimony to this
belief; for, in many occasions he designated ‘Ali (*‘a*) as his
successor {*khalifah*}. Here, we shall mention only three of these
occasions:

1. At the Commencement of the Prophetic Mission
-----------------------------------------------

When the Prophet (S) received from God the commission to invite his
relatives to the doctrine of monotheism as it is confirmed by the the
verse,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وأنذ عشيرتك الأقربين.
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Warn the nearest of your kinsfolk,”***[^1]

he addressed them by saying:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فأيكم يوازرني في هذا الأم على أن يكون أخي ووزيري وخليفتي ووصيّي فيكم؟
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Which of you will assist me in this affair so that he would my brother
{*akhi*}, minister {*waziri*}, successor {*khalifati*}, and the executor
of my will {*wasi*} among you?”

The only person who gave a positive response to this heavenly call was
‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (*‘a*). Then, facing his relatives, the Messenger of
Allah (S) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إن هذا أخي ووصيّي خليفتي فيكم فاسمعوا له وأطيعوه."
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Verily, he (‘Ali) is my brother, the executor of my will and my
successor among you. So, listen to him and obey him.”[^2]

2. During the Tabuk Expedition
------------------------------

The Prophet (S) said to ‘Ali (*‘a*):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أما ترضى أن تكون منّي بمنزلة هارون من موسى إلا أنه لا نبيّ بعدي؟
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Are you not satisfied that you are to me as Harun (Aaron) is to Musa
(Moses) except that there will be no prophet after me?”[^3]

That is to say, “Just as Harun (*‘a*) is the executor of will and the
immediate successor of Musa (*‘a*), you are my successor.”

3. In the 10th Year after Hijrah
--------------------------------

On his return from the Farewell Pilgrimage {*Hajjah al-Wida‘*}, at a
place called Ghadir Khumm the Messenger of Allah (S) introduced ‘Ali
(*‘a*) before a mammoth assembly (of pilgrims) as the *wali* {guardian}
of the believers, male or female, saying:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"من كُنت مولاه فهذا عليّ مولاه."
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Of whosoever I am master {*mawla*}, then ‘Ali is also his master
{*mawla*}.”

The important and noteworthy point is that at the beginning of his
speech, the Prophet (S) asked:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ألست أولى بكم من أنفسكم؟
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Have I more authority over you than you have over yourselves?”

And the Muslims unanimously replied in the affirmative. Therefore, it
must be noted here that in this *hadith* the Prophet (S) meant by the
word, “*mawla*” the absolute guardianship over the believers, and we can
conclude that the Prophet (S) had established ‘Ali (*‘a*) in the same
position which he had. And on that very day Hassan ibn Thabit versified
the historic event of Ghadir as follows:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يناديهم يوم الغدير نبيّهم بخمّ واسمع بالرّسول مناديا فقال: فمن مولاكم
ونبيّكم؟ فقالوا: ولم يدلوا أهناك التعاميا إلهك ومولانا أنت نبيّن ولم
تلق منا في الولاية عاصيا فقال له: قم يا عليّ فإنني رضيتك من بعدي
إماماً وهادياً فمن كنت مولاه فهذا ولّيه فكونوا له اتباع صدق مواليا
هناك دعا: اللهم وال وليّه وكن للذي عادى عليّا معاديا.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*Their Prophet calls on them on the day of Ghadir Khumm; now, listen to
the call of the Prophet:*  
*Then he said to the people: “Who is your Master {mawla} and your
guardian {wali}? Then, without showing inattention, they said:*

*“Your Lord is our Master {mawla} and you are our guardian {wali}, and
no one among us today disobeys you.”*

*Then he said: “Stand up O ‘Ali! For, I am indeed well pleased that you
are the Imam and guide after me.”*

*{Then he said:} “Therefore, of whomsoever I am master, ‘Ali is his
master also. May you be their true supporters!”*

*He then prayed, saying: “O Allah! Be Thou a Friend of those who are his
(‘Ali s) friends, and be Thou an Enemy of those who are his
enemies.”*[^4]

The *hadith* on Ghadir is among the *mutawatir*[^5] *hadith*s, which is
narrated not only by the Shi‘ah *‘ulama’* but also by approximately 360
Sunni scholars[^6] and the number of transmitters reaches 110
Companions. Twenty six prominent Muslim *‘ulama’* have written a
separate book about the chain of transmission and transmitters of this
*hadith*.

Abu Ja‘far Tabari, the renowned Muslim historian, has compiled the chain
of transmission and transmitters of this *hadith* in two bulky volumes.
For further information, one may refer to the book, *Al-Ghadir*.
