The Death of the Lady Al-ma'sooma “a.s”
=======================================

"7"

On the twenty-third of Rabieul-Awwal 201A.H., the caravan of the Lady
Fatima Al-Ma'sooma “a.s.” arrived Qom and the people received her with
great happiness, and were very glad that she entered their lands.

Musa bin Khazraj had much money and a wide house and so he accomodated
her at home and took up on himself to take care of the lady Ma'sooma
“a.s.” and her companions. He felt great happiness to serve the guests
of Imam Ar-Ridha “a.s.” who came from the Messenger’s Madeena. Thus he
prepared for them all what they need fastly.

Then Fatima Al-Ma'sooma took a temple for herself in the house of Musa
bin Khazraj in order to invocate Allah, worship him, communicate with
Him, to complain her pains to Him, and to intrust him with what was
effected her, while this temple still remained till this day, and is
called House of Light (Baytel Noor).

The disease of the daughter of Imam Al-Kaadhum “a.s.” worried her
companions and the people of Qom so much, although they left nothing
they could in order to treat her. Yet her state increased badly day
after day, since the disease had already struck root in her body.

Then on the tenth of Rabie ith-thaani of the year 201 A.H. the Lady
Ma'sooma “a.s.” died without seeing her pother, and the tears from her
eyes and her heart’s grief had never been calm for his deprivation.

The inhabitants of Qom were afflicted by this misfortune and they
performed the consolations with extreme sadness.
