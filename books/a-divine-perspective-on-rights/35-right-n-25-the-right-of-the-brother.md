**And the right of your brother is that you should know that he is your
hand that you extend, and your back to whom you seek refuge, and your
power upon whom you rely, and your might with which you compete. Take
him not as a weapon with which to disobey God, nor as a means with which
to violate God's rights.**

**And do not neglect to help him against his own self and support him
against his enemy, and intervene between him and his devils, and give
him good counsel, and associate with him for God's sake. Then if he
obeys his Lord and is responsible towards Him properly it is fine. Else
God should be more preferable and more honorable to you than he
is.**[^1]

Imam Sajjad has pointed out the following three points regarding one’s
brother:  
 1) A brother is one’s helping hand. He is our supporter and he makes us
stronger. We should not use this power in order to commit sins.

2) We should be his assistant and support him against his enemies.

3) We should release him from the captivity of Satan and direct his
attention towards God. If he does not accept, we should follow God’s
decrees and not obey our brother.

Forms of Brotherhood in Islam
-----------------------------

Brotherhood is one of the most important issues in Islam. There are two
forms of brotherhood. One is a blood relationship - that is being born
of the same parents. This is the closest kind of relationship that
results in either one inheriting from the other. This is considered the
second level of those who inherit from us according to Islamic
jurisprudence. There are certain decrees in this regard.

The second form of brotherhood is through common belief. It is the form
of brotherhood that has related all the Muslims together. It has become
the source of unity of all the Muslims in the world. The Arabic word for
brother is “Akh”. Its real meaning is brother, friend or companion. It
really refers to two people who have the same mother, father or both. It
is also used for someone who has been breast-fed by one’s mother. In a
more general sense, it is also used for one’s partner in industry or
trade, one who is from the same tribe or one having the same beliefs.
There are several instances in the Holy Qur’an when this word is used to
refer to real brothers or believing brothers like in Chapters Yusuf and
Nisaa.[^2]

The Importance of Islamic Brotherhood
-------------------------------------

The Holy Qur’an says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَ أَخَوَيْكُمْ
وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“The Believers are but a single Brotherhood: So make peace and
reconciliation between your two (contending) brothers; and fear God,
that ye may receive Mercy.” [The Holy Qur’an, al-Hujurat 49:10]***

This verse expresses one of the most important slogans of Islam. Islam
has put such a strong bond between the Muslims and has made them so
close that it has called them brothers. Thus, Islam considers all
Muslims to belong to one family. This is completely felt during the
religious and political ceremonies of the pilgrimage of the Ka’ba. All
the people who attend these ceremonies feel to be brothers to each other
even though some have come from the West, and others have come from the
East. Let us consider what the Prophet has said in this regard:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
المُسْلِمُ أخو المْسلِمِ لا يَظْلِمُهُ ولا يخْذِلُهُ ولا يُسَلِّمُهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“A Muslim is the brother of other Muslims. He never oppresses them. He
never abandons them. He never leaves them alone in the face of
calamities.”*[^3]

In another tradition, the Prophet said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَثَلُ الأخَوَينِ مَثَلُ اليَدَينِ تَغْسِلُ إحداهُما الأخْرى.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Two believing brothers are like two hands each washing the
other.”*[^4]

The Prophet’s representation of two Muslims as the hands of the same
body is a beautiful similitude showing that all Muslims belong to the
same nation, and each Muslim is one of the hands of that nation.

A Believer: Brother of Other Believers
--------------------------------------

Imam Sadiq said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
المُؤمِنُ أخُو المُؤمِنِ؛ عَينُهُ وَدَلِيلُهُ لا يخُونُهُ ولا
يَظْلِمُهُ وَلا يغُشُّهُ ولا يَعِدُه عِدَةً فَيُخْلِفُهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“A believer is the brother of other believers. He acts as their eyes
and as their guide. He will never cheat or oppress them. He will never
deceive them or act against his promises to them.”*[^5]  
 In another tradition we read: Abi Basir narrated that he heard Imam
Sadiq say:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
المُؤمِنُ أخُو المُؤمِنِ كَالجَسَدِ الواحِدِ إنْ اشْتَكى شَيْئاً مِنهُ
وُجِدَ ألَمَ ذلِكَ في سائِرِ جَسَدِهِ، وأرْواحُهُما مِن رُوحٍ واحِدَةٍ
وإنَّ رُوحَ المُؤمِنِ لأشَدُّ اتِّصالاً بِروحِ اللهِ مِن اتِّصالِ
شُعاعِ الشَّمْسِ بها.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“A believer is the brother of other believers. They are all parts of
the same body. If one part hurts, other parts will feel the pain. Their
souls are also derived from One Spirit. A believer’s soul is so strongly
attached to God’s Spirit that it is like the attachment of the sun’s
rays to the sun.”*[^6]

Brotherhood: the Greatest Blessing
----------------------------------

The importance of the blessing of brotherhood is stressed in the Holy
Qur’an as we read in the following verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَاعْتَصِمُواْ بِحَبْلِ اللّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلاَ تَفَرَّقُواْ
وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ اللّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنتُمْ أَعْدَاء
فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُم بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَانًا
وَكُنتُمْ عَلَىَ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ مِّنَ النَّارِ فَأَنقَذَكُم مِّنْهَا
كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And hold fast, all together, by the rope which God (stretches out
for you), and be not divided among yourselves; and remember with
gratitude God's favor on you; for ye were enemies and He joined your
hearts in love, so that by His Grace, ye became brethren; and ye were on
the brink of the pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus doth God
make His Signs clear to you: That ye may be guided.” [The Holy Qur’an,
Al-i-Imran 3:103]***

This verse was revealed about the two large tribes of Oas and Khazraj
that had deeply-rooted animosities with each other. Once the Prophet
entered Medina, he settled their affairs and made them brothers one to
another. However, at times they forgot this brotherhood and fighting
broke out between them. However, the Prophet would immediately resolve
their differences.

The Prophet instructed the Muslims to express their love and friendship
to each other since it has a very important influence on the
continuation of brotherhood. He said: “When one of you likes another one
he should let him know about it.” [^7]

The Reward of Visiting Believing Brothers
-----------------------------------------

There is a chapter on visiting believing brothers in *Usul al-Kafi* in
which there are many traditions pointing out the reward of visiting our
believing brothers. We shall only cite a few of them here. Imam Sadiq
said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَن زَارَ أخاهُ في اللهِ، قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: إيّايَ زُرتَ
وَثَوابُكَ عَلَيَّ وَلَسْتُ أرْضى لكَ ثَواباً دُونَ الجَنَّةِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“God the Exalted the High will say to whoever visits his brother for
the sake of God: O My servant! It was Me that You visited, and your
reward is incumbent on Me. I will not be pleased with a reward of
anything less than Heaven for you.”*[^8]

In another tradition we read that Abi Hamzeh quoted on the authority of
Imam Baqir :

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ العَبْدَ المُسلِمَ إذا خَرَجَ مِن بَيتِهِ زائراً أخَاهُ للهِ لا
لِغَيْرِهِ التِماسَ وَجْهِ اللهِ وَرَغْبَةً في ما عِنْدَهُ وَكَّلَ
اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ بهِ سَبْعينَ ألفِ مَلَكٍ يُنادونَهُ مِن خَلفِهِ
إلى أنْ يَرْجِعَ إلى مَنْزِلهِ: ألا طِبْتَ وَطَابَتْ لكَ الجَنَّةُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“When the Muslim leaves his house to visit his brother for the sake of
God alone, seeking God’s pleasure and hoping for his reward, God the
Exalted the High will appoint seventy thousand angels who will keep
calling out behind him until he returns home: Blessed you are, and may
Heaven be pleasant for you.”*[^9]

Thus, we see that with such beautiful instructions, Islam has guaranteed
the unity of Muslims and has prepared a lovely life for the believers.

Brotherhood as Viewed by Imam Ali
---------------------------------

Imam Ali said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الإخْوانِ صِنْفانِ: أخوانُ الثّقَةِ وأخْوانُ المُكاشَرَةِ. فأمّا
أخوانُ الثقةِ فهُمُ الكَفُّ والجَناحُ والأهْلُ وَالمالُ، فإذا كُنتَ
مِن أخيكَ عَلى حَدّ الثِّقَةِ فابْذِلْ لهُ مالَكَ وَبَدَنَكَ وصافِ مَن
صافاهُ وَعَادِ مَن عاداهُ واكْتُمْ سِرَّهُ وَعَيْبَهُ وأظْهِرْ مِنهُ
الحَسَنَ، واعْلَم أيّها السائِلُ أنَّهُم أقلُّ مِن الكِبريتِ
الأحْمَرِ. وأمّا أخوانُ المُكاشَرة فإنّكَ تُصيبُ لَذَّتَكَ مِنهُم فلا
تَقْطَعَنَّ ذلِكَ مِنهُم وَلا تَطلُبَنَّ ما وَراءَ ذلِكَ مِن ضَميرِهِم
وابْذِل لهُم ما بَذَلوا لكَ مِن طَلاقَة الوجْهِ وَحَلاوَةِ اللسانِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“There are two groups of brothers: real brothers and superficial
brothers. Real brothers are like your hands, wings, relatives or
property. Once you find such brothers, you can help them; give them from
what you own; be friendly with their friends and be the enemy of their
enemies; hide* *their secrets; cover up their faults, and reveal their
good points. Beware that they are very rare. However, use your
superficial brothers. Do not stop your friendship and your associations
with them. However do not expect any more than this from them. When they
treat you kindly and talk nicely with you, respond with gentle treatment
and nice words.”*[^10]

Here Imam Ali clearly outlines our duties to our real friends as well as
our superficial friends. He has set the limits of our encounters with
them, and the degree to which we must help them, and benefit from their
assistance.

Being Fair with Brothers
------------------------

Imam Ali said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَع الإنْصافِ تَدومُ الأخُوَّةُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Brotherhood lasts by being fair.”*[^11]

When Muhammad reached the age of seven he asked his wet-nurse Halimah:
“O Mother! Where are my brothers?” She said: “They have taken the sheep
that God has blessed us with to the fields.” He said: “O’ Mother! You
have not been fair with us.” His mother asked: “Why?” He said: “Is it
fair for me to sit in the shade of the tent and drink milk, while my
brothers are out there in the heat of the desert?”[^12] God’s Prophet
said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
سَيّدُ الأعْمالِ ثَلاثَةٌ: إنصافُ النّفْسِ مِن نَفْسِكَ وَمُواساةُ
الإخِ في اللهِ وَذِكْرُكَ اللهَ تعالى في كُلّ حالٍ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Three acts are the master of all deeds: being fair, helping our
brothers for the sake of God, and remembering God the High in all
circumstances.”*[^13]

Brotherhood as Viewed by Imam Sadiq
-----------------------------------

Imam Sadiq said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الإخْوانُ ثَلاثَةٌ: فَواحِدٌ كالغِذاءِ الّذي يُحتاجُ إليه في كُل
وَقتٍ، والثاني في مَعنى الدّاءِ وَهو الأحمَقُ والثّالِثُ في مَعنى
الدّواءِ وهو اللَّبيبُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Brothers are of three kinds. The first kind is like nourishment that
we always need; the second is like a disease, and they are the foolish
ones. The third kind is like the remedy, and they are the intelligent
ones.”*[^14]

At last, we shall present the thirty rights of brotherhood as expressed
by the Noble Prophet . This is perhaps one of the most complete
traditions on the rights of brotherhood.

The Prophet’s Views on Rights of Brotherhood
--------------------------------------------

God’s Prophet said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لِلمُسلِمِ عَلى أخِيهِ ثَلاثونَ حَقّاً لا بَراءَةَ لهُ مِنها إلاّ
بالأداءِ أوِ العَفْوِ: يَغفِرُ زَلَّتَه ويَرحَم عَبرَتَه ويَستُرُ
عَورَتَه ويُقِيلُ عَثرَتَه ويَقبَلُ مَعذِرَتَه ويَرُدُّ غِيبَتَه
ويُديم نَصيحَتَه ويحفَظُ خِلَّتَه ويَرعى ذِمَّتَه ويَعُود مَرَضَه
ويَشْهدُ مَيِّتَه ويجِيبُ دَعوَتَه ويَقْبلُ هدِيَّتَه ويُكافِئُ صِلتَه
ويَشْكُر نِعمَتَه ويحسِنُ نُصرَتَه ويحفَظُ خِليلَتَه ويَقْضي حاجَتَه
ويَشفَعُ مسألَتَه ويُسمّت عطْسَتَه ويُرشِدُ ضالَّتَه ويَرُدَّ سَلامَه
ويُطَيّب كَلامَه ويَبُرّ إنعامَه ويُصَدّق أقسامَه ويُوالي ولِيَّه ولا
يعادِيه وينصُرُه ظالِماً ومَظْلوماً: فأمّا نُصرتُهُ ظالماً فَيَرُدُّهُ
عن ظُلمِه وأمّا نُصرَتُه مَظلوماً فيُعِينُه عَلى أخْذِ حقِّهِ ولا
يُسَلِّمُه ولا يخذُلُهُ ويُحِبُّ له مِن الخِيرِ ما يحِبُّ لِنَفسِهِ
ويَكْرَهُ له مِن الشَّرّ ما يَكْرَهُ لِنفْسِه.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“There are thirty rights for each Muslim incumbent upon his believing
