17. Three Sacred Things
=======================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَنْ أَبِي عَبْدِ اللٌّهِ (ع) قَالَ: إِنَّ لِلٌّهِ عَزّ َوَ جَلَّ
حُرُمَاتٌ ثَلاَثٌ لَيْسَ مِثْلَهُنَّ شَي‏ْءٌ: كِتَابُهُ وَ هُوَ
حُكْمُهُ وَ نُورُهُ وَ بَيْتُهُ الَّذِي جَعَلَهُ قِبْلَةً لِلنَّاسِ
لاَ يَقْبَلُ مِنْ أَحَدٍ تَوَجُّهَا إِلـى غَيْرِهِ وَ عِتْرَةِ
نَبِيِّكُمْ.
  </p>

 It has been narrated from Abi ‘Abdillah [Imam Ja’far Ibn Muhammad
as-Sadiq] (peace be upon him) who said, “Surely Allah, the Noble and
Grand, has made three things sacred and there is nothing else equivalent
to them: His Book (the Qur’an) which is His Command and Divine Light;
His House (The Ka’bah) which He has made as the focal point (Qiblah) and
He will not accept from anyone facing any other direction; and the
family of your Prophet.”
