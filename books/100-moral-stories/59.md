REPENTANCE
A person once heard a pious Muslim say that “For the last thirty years

I am repenting for a sin and I don’t know how Allah will deal with me
regarding it?”

The listener asked: “What was your sin?”

The pious Muslim said: “I used to have a shop in the Bazaar. One day I
heard that the

whole Bazaar was burning so I rushed to see my shop. When I reached
there I saw that

except my shop all the shops were razed to the ground. I said ‘Al-Hamdo
lillah’ (All praise to Allah);

but immediately I realized my mistake. How can I call myself a Muslim
when I couldn’t feel the loss

of my neighbors? That is why I am repenting for that lapse on my part
for the last thirty years.”
