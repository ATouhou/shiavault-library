Chapter 14: Theory of transfer of Disease by Rays
=================================================

Imam Jafar al-Sadiq (A.S) has said that patients suffering from certain
diseases emit special types of rays. If these rays fall upon a healthy
person, they are apt to make him sick.

This theory was not acceptable to physicians and biologists. They were
of the opinion that microbes and viruses were the main cause of many
diseases, which were spread by insects, air, water, food and direct and
indirect contact with patients.

No one before the Imam, had ever said that diseases were also
transferred from one person to the other by means of rays, emitted from
patients suffering from certain diseases. This idea was rather ridiculed
by the learned people till it was proved to be correct by scientific
studies.
