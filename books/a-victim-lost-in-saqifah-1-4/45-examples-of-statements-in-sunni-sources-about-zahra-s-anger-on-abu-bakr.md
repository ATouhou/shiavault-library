In spite of the fact that it is against all historical proofs it is
claimed:

“In authentic documents we do not trace any sign of referring to Caliphs
by the term of enmity by Ali or Zahra or any of the Infallible Imams.
Therefore I conclude that they treated this as a difference between
companions of Prophet during the total period of Caliphs and even during
the period of Ali’s rule. And after that during the time of the Purified
Imams (a.s.).”!**[1]**
