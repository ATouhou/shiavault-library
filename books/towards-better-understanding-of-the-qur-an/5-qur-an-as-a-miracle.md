Qur’an as a Miracle
===================

To every Prophet, Allah gave some miracles, but gone are the Prophets
and their miracles. The Holy Prophet Muhammad (S) is the last prophet
and Allah gave him a timeless miracle, and that miracle is the Holy
Qur’an.

It has often been argued that the Qur'an is not only the first book, and
the highest linguistic achievement, of the Arabic language, but that it
is also Prophet Muhammad's strongest argument against those who doubted
his Message. The question that needs to be addressed here concerns the
reason why a holy book, a composition of language, should be hailed as
Islam's (and Prophet Muhammad's) strongest miracle and argument. The
point has sometimes been made that other prophets had more tangible
miracles. In the case of Muhammad, however, the miracle was not
comparable to Prophet Mussa’s staff or Prophet Issa’s healing powers,
but was more than that.

The Holy Qur’an is indeed a miracle in many aspects, some of which are
described here below:

A) The Exclusive eloquence of the Qur’an.  
 B) The Inimitable Quality of the Qur’an.  
 C) The Scientific Miracle of the Qur’an.  
 D) The Accuracy of the Historical Records in the Qur’an.  
 E) The Predictions in the Qur’an.  
 F) The Challenge of the Qur’an.

Since the above points also constitute evidences on the authenticity of
the Qur’an as the word of Allah (swt), they are discussed in detail in
the Qur’an Resource Paper no. 2, under the title of “Authenticity of the
Holy Qur’an”.
