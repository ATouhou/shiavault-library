=====================

best of which is earning a living lawfully."

reached by remaining idle and lazy."

These two are the keys to every vice."

When Sa'd Ansari responded to the Holy Prophet (S) that his hands were
calloused because he used to work with a rope and a shovel to earn money
to spend for his wife and children, he (S) kissed his hand (as an
honour) and said: "This is a hand which the Fire (of Hell) will never
touch."
