A Short History of Fadak After the Martyrdom of Fatima (as)
===========================================================

The motive which causes us to further pursue the history of Fadak and
to extract the continuation of events after it for a period of three
centuries from the texts of the historical books is to clarify three
questions

a. The rule of annulment of inheritance from prophets made by the Holy
Prophet (PBUH&HF), in other words, that the property of the Holy Prophet
(PBUH&HF) is a part of the public treasurey and belongs to all
Muslims.

This was claimed by the first Caliph Abu Bakr, and was rejected by his
successors, both by the next two caliphs (Umar and Uthman), and by the
Umayyads and the Abbasids.

We must consider that the lawfulness and rightfulness of their
caliphate depended upon the correctness and the lawfulness of the first
caliph and his actions.

b. Imam Ali (as) and the descendants of Fatimah never had any
hesitation regarding the rightfulness and justifiability of their claim.
They insisted and confirmed that Fatima (as) had always been right and
that Abu Bakr's claim had always been rejected, and they did not yield
to the false claim.

c. Whenever one of the Caliphs made a decision to put into effect
Allah's command, in regards to Fadak, to observe justice and equity, and
to restore the right to the entitled one in conformity with Islamic
rules, he used to return back the Fadak to the descendants of Fatima
(as) and to hand it over to them.

1. Umar was the most harsh person in keeping Fatima (as) from Fadak and
her inheritance as he himself confessed:

When the Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HF) died I came along with Abu Bakr
to Ali ibn Abu Talib, and said: ' What do you have to say about what has
been left by the Messenger of Allah? ', He replied: ' We have the most
rights with the Holy Prophet (PBUH&HF). ' I (Umar) said: ' Even those
properties of Khaibar? '

He said: ' Yes, even those of Khaybar. ' I said : ' Even those of
Fadak? ', He replied: ' Yes, even those of Fadak.' Then I said: 'By
Allah, we say no, even if you cut our necks with saws.'

As mentioned in the previous article, Umar took the document of Fadak
and tore it up. But when Umar became caliph (13/634-23/644) he gave back
the Fadak to the inheritors of the Holy Prophet (PBUH&HF). Yaqut al
Hamawi, the famous historian and geographer, following the event of
Fadak said:

Then, when Umar ibn al Khattab became the caliph and gained victories
and the Muslims had secured abundanr wealth (i.e the public treasury
satisifed the caliphate's needs), he made his judgement contrary to that
of his predecessor, and that was to give it (Fadak) back to the
Prophet's heirs. At that time Ali ibn Abi Talib and Abbas ibn Abd al
Muttalib disputed Fadak.

Ali said that the Holy Prophet (PBH&HF) had bestowed it on Fatima (as)
during his life time. Abbas denied and used to say, 'This was in the
possesion of the Holy Prophet (PBUH&HF), and I am sharing with his
heirs.'

They were disputing this with among each other and asked Umar to settle
the case: 'Both of you are more conscious and aware to your problem; but
I only give it to you.' [See note for this para]

[ Note: The last part of the historic event has been inserted after
wards to demonstrate the matter of inheritance by the brother of the
deceased or the paternal uncle of the deceased when he has no sons.

This problem is a matter of dispute between Islamic Sects. The judicial
and the jursipridencial discussion is seperate from our goal. We are
only discussing the matter historicaly.

Abbas had no claim in this case because he had not shown that he had a
share in this property, nor did his descendants consider it to be among
their assests even when they had become caliphs and were reigning. They
owed this estate either in their position as Caliphs, or they used to
return it to the descendants of Fatima (as) when they had decided to be
just governors. ]

2. When Uthman ibn Affan became the caliph after the death fo Umar he
granted Fadak to Marwan ibn al Hakam, his cousin, and this was one of
the causes of the vindictive feelings among the Muslims towards Uthman,
which ended in the revolt against him and his murder.

**Sunni references:**

- Wafa al Wafa, vol 3 p 1000

- al Iqd al Farid, vol 4 p 283, 485
- at Tarikh, Abul Fida, vol 1 p 168
- Ibn al Wardi, vol 1 p 204

In this way Fadak fell into the possesion of Marwan; he used to sell
crops and products for at least ten thousand dinars per year, and if in
some years its income decreased, this drop was not very pronounced. This
was its usual profit untill the time of the Caliphate of Umar ibn Abd al
Aziz (in 100.718).

3. When Muawiyah ibn Abu Sufyan became the Caliph, he became the
partner with Marwan and others in Fadak. He alloted one thrid to Marwan,
and one thrid to Amr ibn Uthman ibn Affan and one thrid to his son,
Yazid. This was after the death of Imam Hasan (as). In the words of the
Sunni historian, Yaqubi

To make angry the progeny of the Holy Prophet.

**Sunni reference:**

- at Tarikh, Yaqubi, vol 2 p 199

It was in the possesion of the three above mentioned persons untill
Marwan became Caliph and then he completely took over posession over it.
Then he donated to his two sons, Abd al Malik and Abd al Aziz. Then Abd
al Aziz donated his share to his son (Umar ibn Abd al Aziz).

4. When Umar ibn Abd al Aziz becmae the Caliph he delivered a lecture
and mentioned that: 'Verily, Fadak was among the things that Allah had
bestowed on His Messenger, and no horse, nor camel was pricked against
it.'

As he mentioned the case of Fadak during the past caliphates he said:

Then Marwan gave it to my father and to Abd al Malik. It became mine
and and al Walids and Sulaymans (two sons of Abd al Malik).

When al Walid became caliph I asked him for his share and he gave it to
me. Then I gathered the three parts and I possess no property more
preferable to me than this. Be witness that I returned it to its
original state.

He wrote this to his governer in Medina (Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad ibn Amr
ibn Hazm) and ordered him to carry out what he had declared in the
speech be delivered. Then Fadak came into the possession of the children
of Fatima (as).

This was the first removal of oppresion by returning Fadak to the
Children of Ali (as).

5. When Yazid ibn Abd al Malik became caliph (101/720-105/724) he
seized Fadak and they (the children of Imam Ali (as)) were dispossesed.
It fell into the possesion of the Banu Marwan as it had been previously.
They passed it from hand to hand untill their caliphate expired and
passed away to Banu al Abbas.

6. When Abul Abbas Abdullah as Saffah became the first caliph of the
Abbasid Dynasty (132/749-136/754) he gave back Fadak to the Children of
Fatima (as) and submitted it to Abdullah ibn al Hasan ibn al Hasan ibn
Ali ibn Abi Talib.

7. When Abu Jafar Abdullah al Mansur ad Dawaniqi (136/754-158/775)
became the calpih, he seized Fadak from the children of Fatima (as).

8. When Muhammad al Mahdi ibn al Mansur became caliph (158/775-169/785)
he returned Fadak to the children of Fatima (as).

9. The Musa al Hadi ibn al Mahdi (169/785-170/786) and his brother
Harun ar Rashid (170/786-193/809) seized it from the descendants of
Fatima (as) and it was in the possesion of Banu al Abbas untill the time
that al-Mamun became the Caliph (193/831-218/833)

10. al Mamun al Abbasi gave it back to the descendants of Fatima (as).
It is narrtaed through al Mahdi ibn Sabiq that:

al Mamun one day sat to hear the complaints of the people and to
judgein cases. The first utter complaint which he received caused him to
weep when he looked at it. He asked where the attorney of Fatima (as),
daughter of the Holy Prophet (PBUH&HF) was? An old man stood up and came
forth, arguing with him about Fadal and al Mamun also argued with him
untill he overcame al Mamun.

**Shia reference:**

- al Awail, p 209

al Mamun summoned the Islamic Jurisprudents and interrogated them about
the claim of Banu Fatima. They narrated to al Mamun that the Holy
Prophet (PBUH&HF) gifted Fadak to Fatima (as) and that after the death
of the Holy Prophet (PBUH&HF), Fatima (as) demanded Abu Bakr to return
Fadak to her. He asked her to bring witnesses to her claim reagrding the
gift. She brought, Ali, al Hasan, al Hussain and Umm Ayman, as her
witnesses. They witnessed the case in her favor.

Abu Bakr rejected their witness. Then al Mamun asked the scholars:
'What is your view about Umm Ayman?' They replied:'She is a woman to
whom the Holy Prophet (PBUH&HF) bore witness that she is an inhabitant
of Paradise.' al Mamun disputed at lenght with them and forced them to
accept the arguments put forth by proofs till they confessed that Ali,
al Hasan, al Hussain and Umm Ayman had witnessed only the truth. When
they unanimiously accepted this matter, he restored Fadak to the
descendants to Fatima (as).

**Sunni reference:**

- at Tarikh, al Yaqubi, vol 3 p 195-96

11. During the period of al Mamun's caliphate Fadak was in the
possesion of Fatimah's descendants, and this was confirmed during the
caliphate of al Mutasim (218/833-227/842) and al Wathiq (227/842 -
232/847).

12. When Jafar al Mutawakkil became the caliph (232/847-247/861), the
one among them who was marked as an arch enemy of the progeny of the
Holy Prophet (PBUH&HF), both of those alivce and of those dead, gave the
order to recapture Fadak from the descendants of Fatima (as).

**Shia references:**

- al Bihar, vol 8 p 108
- Safinah al Bihar, vol 2 p 351

13. When al Mutawwakil was killed and al Muntasir (his son) succeeded
him (247/861-248/862), he gave the order to restore Fadak to the
descendants of al Hasan and al Husayn and delivered the donations of Abu
Talib to them and this was in 248/862.

14. It seemed that Fadak was recaptured from the descendants of Fatima
(as) after the death of al Muntasir, because Abul Hasan Ali ibn Isa al
Iribili (died 692/1293) mentioned:

al Mutadid (279/892-289/902) retured Fadak to the descendants of
Fatima.

Then he mentioned that al Muqtafi (289/902-295/908) seized it from
them. It is said also that al Muqtadir (295/908-320/932) returned it to
them.

**Shia references:**

- Kash al Ghummah, vol 2 p 122
- al Bihar, vol 8 p 108

15. After this long period of recapturing and restoration, Fadak was
returned to the posession of the usurpers and their heirs as it seems,
no further mention was made in History and the curtain fell!

Is it (then that) the judgement of (the times of pagan) ignorance they
desire? And who (else) can be better than Allah to judge for a people of
assured faith. [ 5 : 50 ]
