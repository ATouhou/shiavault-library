Story no. 48:Saeeda and request for chadar
==========================================

Saeeda, who went to school everyday, one day came home and said “Mother,
today I saw our neighbour wearing a chadar and coming to school. The
children exclaimed “This chadar is for big women, why did you wear it?”
to which she replied “My parents said “You are close to being big. Why
not start wearing chadar from now on so that as you grow, you have a
practice for it”. Saeeda said “Mother, I too want a chadar”.  
 Her mother said “I will go to the market, buy some cloth and sew a
chadar for you tomorrow.”  
 Bravo to those mothers who are aware of wearing Islamic Hijaab and make
their daughters too aware of this divine obligation.
