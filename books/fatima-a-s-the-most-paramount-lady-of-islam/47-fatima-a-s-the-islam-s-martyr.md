Fatima (a.s), the Islam’s Martyr:
=================================

With no shadow of doubt, Fatima (peace be upon her) the first martyr of
Islam after the Prophet’s demise. She sacrified herself to the way of
Allah and religion. As Imam Sadeq (a.s) stated, “She received severe
blows on her body for the defense of Ali (peace be upon him) i.e. the
model of the holy Quran and the incarnation of Islam, and died when she
was young.”

Her right was usurped, her side was broken, and she was banned from her
heritage. Her husband was an oppressed, too; her children were martyred
in the way of Allah….

The Prophet (peace be upon him and his descendants) stated, “there is
nothing more valuable than two drops for Allah: the drop of tear, shed
because of the fear of Allah, and the drop of blood, shed in the way of
Allah.”

Fatima (peace be upon her) has got these two valuable drops. After the
Prophet’s demise, in about three months, she passed away, and it is said
that she was not more than 18 years old.
