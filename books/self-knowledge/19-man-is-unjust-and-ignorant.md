Man is unjust and ignorant
==========================

These two qualities are expressed in the following verse: ***“Surely he
is very unjust, very ignorant”*** (33:72)

Two qualities, man being very unjust and his being very ignorant are
expressly emphasised. In Arabic there is a difference ilm, and alam. A
zdlim is a person who commits sin, even if only once, but according to
Arabic grammar zalam (RA) is said to be the exaggeration form of zallim
It means a person who frequently commits unjust actions. Also, jahul is
the exaggeration form of jahil. It means a person who is very ignorant
or completely unwise.

Human beings suffer from ignorance and injustice. The unjust act is not
restricted to others. It can be applied to the person himself.

***“Every person who breaks Divine laws, has oppressed himself”
(95:61)***

if a person does not pray or fast then he has been unjust to himself.
When a person beats someone or robs him of his money, he is initially
doing a disservice to himself, then to the other person. Committing a
sin is just like drinking poisoned water. Now if this person drinks
poison, he is hurting himself. The same logic can be applied when he
harms another being. The consequences of his ill acts would be his
destroying the bases of his inherent God-given purity. He initiates
hindrances on the way to his perfection.
