39 . Welcoming People who Return from Hajj
==========================================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَنْ أَبِي عَبْدِ اللٌّهِ (ع): مَنْ لَقِيَ حَاجًّا فَصَافَحَهُ كَانَ
كَمَنْ إِسْتَلَمَ الْحَجَرَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

   
 It has been narrated from Abi ‘Abdillah [Imam Ja’far Ibn Muhammad
as-Sadiq] (peace be upon him) that: “A person who meets one who has
returned from Hajj and shakes his hand (welcomes him back) is like a
person who rubbed his hand on the Hajrul Aswad.”
