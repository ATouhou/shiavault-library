Lesson One Hundred Twenty Two: Lifespan
=======================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَوْتُ الاْنْسانِ بالذُّنُوبِ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ مَوتِهِ بِالأَجَلِ وَ
حَياتُهُ بِالْبِرِّ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ حَيَاتِهِ بِالْعُمْرِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Early death of men is more often due to sin than for natural reasons,
and long life of individuals is more often due to their righteousness
than for natural reasons.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Undoubtedly, a lot of sins and bad habits have a direct impact on
shortening life (as in the case of drinking, gambling, jealousy, envy
and vindictiveness) . Many also shorten it through indirect means such
as the resulting social disorders, lack of public security and
occurrence of wars (as in the case of usury, injustice and oppression).
On the other hand, righteousness could lead to a long life due to its
deep effect on the peace of spirit and conscience.

Therefore, sin, besides its harmful spiritual effects, is also very
effective in shortening man’s life, whereas righteousness prolongs life
in addition to generating other benefits and spiritual rewards.
