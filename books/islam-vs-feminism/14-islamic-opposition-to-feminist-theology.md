Islamic Opposition to Feminist Theology
=======================================

Since there is no holy Trinity in Islam, no God the Father nor God the
Son, the concept of God in Islam is not as gender specific as it is in
Christianity. In the Arabic of the Qur'an, masculine pronouns are used
to refer to God, but this provides little leverage for the development
of the sort of critique feminists have leveled against the Christian
concept of God. Goddess feminism, on the other hand, is clearly
incompatible with the teachings of Islam. The God of Islam is not a
woman, and He has no daughters.

Theological discussions of the attributes of God indicate very clearly,
however, that there are feminine and masculine aspects of divinity, and
even that the feminine has priority.23 Now, as Wolfson has argued in his
study of Islamic theology,24 discussions of the names and attributes of
God play a role in Islamic theology comparable to discussions of the
Trinity among Christian theologians. So, not only is the Islamic concept
of the divinity free of the male bias present in the concept of the
Trinity, but the closest thing we can find in Islam to the idea of
relations internal to divinity discussed in Christianity in terms of the
Trinity, is the idea of the divine names and attributes in which not
only is there an absence of bias against the feminine, but the feminine
is dignified as paramount. God's mercy precedes His wrath.25
