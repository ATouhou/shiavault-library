Lesson One Hundred Eighteen: Real Physician
===========================================

The Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلطَّبِيب اللّهُ وَ لَعَلَّكَ تَرْفِقُ بِأشْياء تُحْرِقُ بِها
غَيْرَكَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The real physician is God, and the things useful for you may be harmful
for others.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The events happening in man’s life are sometimes due to his wrong
policies, choices or will and there are a lot of painful events like
these.

Sometimes seemingly unpleasant events occur due to none of the above
factors. Such adversities may in fact be medicines administered by God (
who is the real physician ) to treat his servants. Although these drugs
may be bitter, they are a much needed wake-up call, a means of remedial
attention to man’s weaknesses and for removal of his conceit.
