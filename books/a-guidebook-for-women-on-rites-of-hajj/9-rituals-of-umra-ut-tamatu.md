Questions and Answers
---------------------

**Q1.** If a pilgrim forgets to wear ihram or because of unconsciousness
or lack of knowledge does not wear it, what should she do?

**Ans:** If it is possible to return to one of the Miqats then it should
be done. If it is not possible and the pilgrim has already entered the
*Haram*, then she should leave the *Haram* and go as far as possible and
wear the ihram. If it is not possible to go out of the Haram then the
ihram may be worn there. If the pilgrim has not yet entered the *Haram*
but the return to Miqat is impossible then she should go as far away as
possible and wear the ihram.

**Q2.** Can a lady during menstruations enter a mosque to wear ihram and
does she need ablutions before entering the mosque?

**Ans:** No she can enter the mosque without ablutions to wear ihram.
