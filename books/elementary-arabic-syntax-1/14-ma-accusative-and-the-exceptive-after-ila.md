Ma’ Accusative and the Exceptive After Ila
==========================================

39. What is a *ma'* accusative?  
 A *ma'* accusative is a noun preceded by a *wāw* that has the meaning
of with mentioned to describe what the action was performed with. For
example: **اِذهَب** **و** **الشّارعَ** **الجَدیدَ** (Go on the new
road.)

40. What is an exceptive after *ila*?  
 An exceptive after *ila* is a noun mentioned after the preposition
*ila* which has a different ruling than what was mentioned before *ila*.
For example: **خَرَجَ** **التلامذةُ** **المَدرَسَةِ** **ﺇلا** **خالداً**
(The students left the school, except Khālid.) Here Khālid is the
exceptive because it is mentioned after *ila* and is not part of the
rule 'leave' which is related to the students.

41. When is it obligatory to put the exceptive after *ila* into the
accusative state?  
 It is obligatory to put the exceptive after *ila* into the accusative
state if the phrase before it is complete and positive, for example:
**یعیشُ** **الناسُ** **براحة** **إلا** **الکسلانَ** (People live in
comfort, except lazy people.) Here it is obligatory to put lazy people
into the accusative case because the phrase before the *ila* is complete
and positive.
