Principle Two: Human freedom
============================

We are free. This is philosophically true because no one has complete
control upon our decision or acts by himself. This is also morally and
politically true because no one other than God has authority upon us and
therefore needs to be served or obeyed. In a well known hadith, Imam Ali
(A) says:

*“Do not be a servant of other people. God has created you free.”*
