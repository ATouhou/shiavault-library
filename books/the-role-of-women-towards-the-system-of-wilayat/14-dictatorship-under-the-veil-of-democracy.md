Dictatorship under the Veil of Democracy
========================================

We don't have the rights to live in any type of system, neither by
Shariah nor by our intelligence and specifically living under the
Fironic system. These governmental systems which have raised the slogans
of democracy are all representative of Satan (devil).

As Allama Iqbal narrates in one of his poems, that Satan called for an
annual conference, where all his representatives came. Satan analyzed
the work over the past year and drafted a plan for the coming year to
misguide people. Iqbal says, when Satan inquired about the situation in
the world from his representatives, they replied to him that our
devilish plans are failing in many places due to certain reasons. One of
the representatives of Satan came forward and said that one of the
biggest dangers to Satan is from democratic system of governance which
is spreading across the globe and democracy is a very good system. Satan
said there is nothing to be afraid about this, because this democracy is
the same dictatorship.

This is the same Fironic system, the same arrogant system of the past
and I have just changed its outlook. First it was imperialism,
dictatorship, feudalism and now also it is the same but I have changed
its dress to democracy.
