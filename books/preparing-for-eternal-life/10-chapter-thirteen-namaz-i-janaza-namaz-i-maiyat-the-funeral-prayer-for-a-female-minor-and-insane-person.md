of the prayer leader.

daughter of Your servant and Your maid.

She has gone over to You and You are the best to be gone to.

O Allah! we know not about her save good and You know her better than
we do. O Allah! if she was a doer of good then add her good acts.

**Chapter Fourteen : The Grave and Burial**

The Grave needs to be the length of the deceased but needs to wide
enough for a man to be able to sit or stand between the deceased and the
wall of the grave, on the Qibla side.

If it is to be a man who is to lay the deceased down in the grave, he
is to not wear anything on their feet or their head. If it is to be a
woman who lays the deceased down in the grave, she is not required to go
bare feet and still wears head cover.

It is Makrooh (undesirable) for a Naa Mahram (an individual who is able
to marry) to enter the grave of the deceased but a husband or wife of
the deceased is allowed. If a Mahram man is not available then a pious
woman may enter the grave. If a pious woman is not available, them a
pious man may enter the grave for the final laying down of the
deceased.

All Naa Mahrams need to move away from the grave when a woman is
transferred from the bier to the grave, or a curtain is to be drawn
around the grave. [Sayyid, Hadi Husayn (1988), pg. 155]

Allamah Qutubuddin Rawandi is quoted as having said that after the
death of Lady Maryam [A.S.], her son Prophet Isa [A.S.] called out to
her and said:

"O Mother! please speak to me and tell me whether you are desirous of
returning back to this world." Lady Maryam [A.S.] said:

"Yes, I desire to return back, so that during the cold winter nights I
could recite Namaz, and during the hot summer days I could fast. O my
dear! Verily the way to the hereafter is very difficult"

[Qummi, Shaikh Abbas (1999), pg. 44.] How to Move a Deceased Woman into
the Grave The deceased woman is to be laid laterally to the grave and
lowered in by her side and not by the side of her head.

How to Move a Deceased Man into the Grave
The deceased man is to be laid at the tail end of the grave and lowered
in from the side of the head with the head down first.
