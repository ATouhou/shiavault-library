74: the Man Wearing a Cloak (muddath-thir)
==========================================

This chapter is commonly considered to be the second one revealed to
Muhammad, six months after his very first one called The Clot 96, and
even before The Opening 1, which formally introduces the Qur'an. Its 56
Meccan verses were revealed as a complete chapter in two sections. They
have a short, rapid style which is difficult to copy in English,
although I have attempted to imitate some of this by means of free
verse.

The Interval or gap between the Prophet's first call and his second is
referred to as the Fatra. This chapter contains some striking pictures
of the Last Trumpet; the Proud Man; and Hell Fire. The last section (II)
lays down conditions for individual responsibility. It all requires
thought and explanation. SEE also Extinguished!

81 for a similar apocalyptic mood.
