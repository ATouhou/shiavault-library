The Treacherous
===============

**The Treacherous الخائن والمزيع**

1. The treacherous person is one who busies himself with other than his
self and his ‘today’ is worse than his ‘yesterday’.

> 1ـ الخائِنُ مَنْ شَغَلَ نَفْسَهُ بِغَيرِ نَفْسِِهِ، وكانَ يَوْمُهُ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
شَـرّاً مِنْ أمْسِهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

2. The enticer [towards deviance] and the treacherous one are alike.[^1]

> 2ـ المُزيعُ والخائِنُ سَواءٌ.

3. The treacherous person has no loyalty in him.

> 3ـ اَلخائِنُ لا وَفاءَ لَهُ.

4. From the signs of being forsaken [by Allah] is considering the
treacherous to be trustworthy.

> 4ـ مِنْ عَلاماتِ الخِذْلانِ ايتِمانُ الخُوّانِ.

[^1]: Or in another reading: The discloser [of secrets] and the
treacherous one are alike.
