Chapter 21 : Fourth Phase of Our Existence
==========================================

**Life after Resurrection Resurrection**

The last phase of our existence, and the second stage of the life after
death is Resurrection. This will be the beginning of the life that has
no end i.e., the eternal life. This is the end of which there is no
end.

In the Holy Quran, Resurrection has been described by various
characteristic names, each gives a definite explanation of the event
related to the Resurrection.

Though, a lot of Quranic verses and ahadith of the Holy Prophet (sws)
and Imams(as) are there to enlighten us about the events that will take
place one after the other, but still the complete picture of
resurrection is beyond our comprehension. It is a very vast subject. The
words, terms, and expressions that we have in the vocabulary of all the
spoken languages are not sufficient to encompass the variety of things
related to this subjects.

**Day of Judgment**

The Day of Judgment is the fundamental ar ticle of Islamic faith. This
is the basic reason of resurrection. It is the day when every person,
who lived anywhere and at any time, will be brought to the Divine Court
for final judgment. Allah Subhanahu taala Himself will be the judge and
will decide the ultimate fate of every individual. We are repeatedly
reminded this truth in Surah al-Fatiha which we recite daily at least 10
times in prayers.

"Master of the Day of Judgment" ( 1:4 )

There shall be absolutely fair and impar tial judgment. Quran has
repeatedly said that there will be no injustice at all. Hence, on the
Day of Judgment, Allah will establish a real Supreme Court where nothing
but justice will prevail. However, Allah is Just but His mercy always
overshadows His justice. He will pay 10 times or even more against one
good deed, but will give one punishment for one evil or will forgive.

Court Procedure:

This will be a unique Court of Justice, where no one can deny from what
he had done. Quran confirms;

" On the Day when their tongues and their hands, and their feet will
testify against them about their actions. On that Day Allah will pay
them back their just dues, and they will realize that Allah is the
truth." (24:24-25)

Allah (swt) has prepared a written record of every individual. This
written record will be given to him on the Day of Judgment.

Quran clearly states on this matter.

"The works of each man, We have bound about his neck. On the Day of
Judgment, we shall confront him with a book spread wide open, saying:
Read your book, enough for you this day that your own soul should call
you to account". (17:13)

This confirms that a Video film of our whole life is being prepared and
on the Day of Judgment, Allah (swt) will give the same Video cassette to
us to see everything which we had done in this world.

Quran says:

"O woe unto us! what is about this book: it had not left any small or
big thing without recording it thoroughly:"

Imam Jafar as - Sadiq (as) said;

"On the Day of Judgment, a man will be given his scroll, to read
....... then Allah will make him remember: there will be not a single
look, or a single word, or a single step, or anything which he had done
but that he will remember as he had done it that very moment. It is for
this reason that they will say ; " O woe unto us! What is about this
book: it had not lef t any small or big thing without recording it
thoroughly."

The description of Amaal Book (Nama-i-amaal) in Imam's hadith gives a
clear picture of Video Recorder. 1400 Years ago, no better description
than this was possible. Today, after the discovery of video cameras,
computers and televisions , everyone of us can understand that how truly
Quran and ahadith have told us about the events that will occur in
future in this world and hereafter.

Nor could they spend anything (for the cause) - small or great- nor cut
across a valley, but the deed is inscribed to their credit: that Allah
may requite their deed with the best (possible reward).

The good people will be given their book in their right hands and will
be asked to proceed to Jannat, while the bad people shall get their book
in their lef t hands and will be thrown out into the Jahannum.

Allah Subhanahu taala out of His unlimited mercy and grace will allow
His Prophets and Imams to release many of His servants from the
Hell-fire.

Thus, the Holy Prophet and the Holy Imams (as) will save a huge number
of people from the hell-fire. But shifaat doesn't mean that everyone
will be pardoned. The Holy Prophet (sws) and Imams(as) have made it very
clear that there are certain sins and attitude for which there is no
Shifaat.

We must know the basic criteria of Shifaat so that we can know for whom
they will do shifaat and for whom they will not do it. For instance,
Imam Jafar Sadiq (as) said that anyone who takes Salaat for granted is
not qualified for our Shifaat.

This is a simple matter which any person of average intellect can
understand. But many people misinterpret the concept of Shifaat and
think that the Prophets and Imams will save them from the hell-fire even
if they were disloyal and disobedient to Allah (swt). Quran has made it
very clear that no Prophet or Imam will do Shifaat without the consent
of Allah.

**Sirat**

Sirat is an Arabic word which means path. Pul-e-Sarat is a bridge over
the Hell. All people have to cross it. Quran confirms "Not one of you
but will pass over it. This is an established decree of the Lord. Then
we shall save, those who guarded themselves against evil, and we shall
leave the wrong- doers therein to their knees." (19:71-72)

this world is inferior and of lesser value comparing to the bounties of
Jannat. Quran has described the Jannat in 76 verses just to give some
idea of the Jannat's blessing. But the actual Jannat is beyond our
imagination.

Mulla Hassan Yazdi has described some of the bounties of the Jannat
from Quran and ahadith in his famous book Anwar ul Hidayah. They are as
follows:

1 - The greatest bliss in the Jannat will be Allah's proximity.

2 - The people in Jannat will get married with 70000 beautiful women
and will enjoy their company.

3 - The people in Jannat will get in abundance numerous kinds of foods,
drinks, fr uits and tasty things.

4 - The people in Jannat will have full comfor t, security, stability.
There will be no pain and fear of anything. No death and no disease, no
pover ty and no distress.

5 - The people in Jannat will live in big castles. These castles will
have beautiful big gardens, streams, rivers and many other things which
we can not imagine.

6 - The people in Jannat will have many kinds of enter tainment.

7 - The people in Jannat will get anything they will like to have.

8 - The people in Jannat will be allowed to visit the Holy Prophet
(sws) and Imams(as) and any other person they would like to meet.

9 - The people in Jannat can invite The Holy Prophet, Imams and
billions of other people at a time.

10 - Quran and ahadith summarize the blessings of Jannat in the
following words: "No person knows what delights of the eyes are kept
hidden in Jannat for them as a reward for their good deeds."

"I have kept ready for my servants what no eye has ever looked and no
ear has ever heard, nor any heart has ever imagined." Hadith Qudsi Those
who believe, and work righteousness,- their Lord will guide them because
of their faith:

beneath them will flow rivers in gardens of bliss Thus, all beautiful
and precious things of this world are just the ordinar y samples to have
some idea of the Jannat.

In this world, not a single person is free of two miserable things.

1 - Fear.
2 - Sorrow.

If a person is extremely rich, then he has intense fear of death,
disease and insecurity. Poor people cry for poverty In Jannat, there
will be neither fear nor sorrow but pleasure and pleasure, and that will
be absolutely new kind of pleasure which no one has ever experienced
before.

**Names of Jannat**

There are many different names of Jannat. Some of the names are as
follows.

1 - Jannat ul- Firdaus
2 - Jannat ul- Khuld
3- Jannat ul- Mawa
4- Jannat un- Naeem
5- Dar-us-Salaam
6- Dar-ul-Akhirah
7- Dar-ul- Maqaamah

In each Jannat, there are millions of classes. The lowest class of
Jannat will be billions times better than the most precious and most
beautiful city of this world. Jahannum - Hell Fire.

Jahannum is the house of all kinds of miseries and painful things. It
is a place where disgrace and rebellious people will live to face many
different kinds of punishments. As no one can imagine the blessing of
Jannat, no one can also imagine the tor ture and pains of Jahannum.
Quran has described some of the miserable conditions of Jahannum in
order to avoid it by all means.

**Names of Jahnnum**

Jahannum has also many different names and each name reflects a
peculiar kind of miser y. Some of these names are as follows.

Ludha - House of fire. Electric furnace.
Jaheem - House of Fire. Full of burning charcoal.
Hutamah - A furnace of its own kind. It will grind the bones into
ashes.
Hawiyah - A miserable house.
Saquar.
Saeer - Blazing fire.
Jahannum.

**Aaraf**

Aaraf is a huge mountain between the Jannat and Jahannum.. Those people
who are neither in Jannat nor in Jahannum will stay here for some
definite period of time.
