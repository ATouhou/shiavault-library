[Introduction]
==============

Human evolution, and particularly the evolution of the human brain and
mind is not something that is well understood scientifically. But it
seems clear that at some point in the evolution of human consciousness,
an inner world free from passive captivity in sensory impressions came
to be  -- a life of the mind, if you like.  The task of this inner world
was to impose order on the content of our senses; that is, there came a
point in our evolutionary past when our minds began to demand that the
universe make sense.
