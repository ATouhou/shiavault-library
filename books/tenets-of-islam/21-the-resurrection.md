The Resurrection
================

Surely Allah will physically resurrect the dead as they were in this
world in order to restore the rights to all those to whom they were due.
The Resurrection of the dead is not inconceivable and the Prophets have
informed us of it. The Holy Qur'an is full of the verses telling about
Resurrection, and there is no possibility of interpreting them in some
other way. Therefore it is obligatory to have belief in physical
Resurrection.
