Eating
======

A little food is praiseworthy in every case and with all people,
because it is salutory for the outer and the inner being. Eating is
praiseworthy when done out of necessity, as a means and provision, at a
time of plenty, or for nourishment. Eating out of necessity is for the
pure; eating as a means and provision is a support for the precautious;
eating at a time of plenty is for those who trust; and eating for
nourishment is for believers.

There is nothing more harmful to the believer's heart than having too
much food, for it brings about two things; hardness of heart and arousal
of desires. Hunger is a condiment for believers, nourishment for the
spirit, food for the heart, and health for the body. The Holy Prophet
said, 'The son of Adam fills no worse vessel than his belly.'

David said, 'Leaving a morsel of food that I need is preferable to me
than staying up for twenty nights.'

The Messenger of Allah said, 'The believer eats to fill one stomach,
and the hypocrite seven.' And elsewhere, 'Woe to people who are swollen
in two places!' When he was asked what they were, he replied, 'The
stomach and the genitals.'

‘Isa (‘a) said, 'The heart does not have any worse disease than
hardness, and no soul has been more weakened than by lack of hunger.
They are two halters of banishment and disappointment.'
