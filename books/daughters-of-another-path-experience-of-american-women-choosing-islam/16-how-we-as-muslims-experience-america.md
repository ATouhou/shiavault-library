How We, As Muslims, Experience America
======================================

+Americans in general seem to have a tendency to stereotype. They see
us in a scarf and automatically think our husbands dominate us and that
we are conservative. +This response will be the hardest because of the
bitterness I feel toward this country. "The land of the free, home of
the brave . . ." is nonexistent and the hypocrisy of this government
really burns me up. The arrogance of this society that this is the best
society and culture on earth in terms of women rights, human rights,
children rights, minority rights is exasperating. The statement I make
to people when they push their superiority on me is "This is America
where everyone has a right to choose what they want to believe."
Personally, I do not believe the American experiment is working. The
society has been stripped of all values and Christian churches have
warped the Bible so badly by giving people the philosophy that all sins
will be forgiven and whatever feels good do it. I know that no society
is perfect, but I want to increase my children's odds of success by
putting them in an environment of a one-culture society, the culture and
society with values that we hold important-a society with a limited
amount of choices as to acceptable behavior. My husband and I can
provide the high-tech opportunities of the West without poisoning our
children with the value-deficient culture of the United States.

+American women have chosen or accepted Islam through research and
understanding and not by force or influence from their husbands. Just
because there is a story of one crazy Iranian who abused his family-even
if it is true doesn't mean the whole country is like that. I urge people
to think about what kinds of abuse and molestations go on here every
second! I urge the American people to use their God-given brain and not
to sleep through life!

+It gives me great pain to know that Muslims and Islam are so terribly
misunderstood by the majority of Americans, which gives rise to hatred,
dirty looks, and rude comments, which impedes our rights as Americans to
practice our religion freely. This country was founded by religious
people seeking a country where they would not be persecuted for their
beliefs. We are now even more of a melting pot than ever, and if we want
to succeed as a nation and keep the ideals of the Constitution alive, we
have to understand, accept and respect each other, regardless of
religion, customs, or style of dress. I-strongly encourage all
Americans, whenever they see a woman in long, modest clothing covering
all but her hands and face, instead of staring and feeling sorry for
her, smile, greet her in peace, knowing that she is a strong, confident
person trying to worship her God and your God the best she can. We are
all citizens of this country where we are supposed to be free to worship
as we please. Let's work together to keep it that way.

**Epilogue**

When Jodi came home to visit us that Thanksgiving day and shared the
news with us of her conversion to Islam, it was like she had stabbed us
with a knife. How could our sweet daughter do anything as bizarre as
this? Both my husband, Joe, and myself were deeply hurt. Certainly, Jodi
did not want to hurt us-but she had-and we were unable to understand
what she had done. We were numb, but we were also angry and not sure we
wanted our daughter as a part of our family. A decision would need to be
made. Should we just consider she was no longer welcome in our home and
treat her as if she were dead?

Jodi was not the first daughter who had disappointed her parents by
making a decision contrary to their tradition. In fact, daughters and
sons rarely make decisions that are completely in harmony with parental
wishes. Oftentimes we have discovered the parental response is "get out
and never come back; you are dead to our family." We were very fortunate
that we were able to resist such a temptation. It could be worked out.
As a family we would try to understand, and in trying to understand, we
also have journeyed on another path and discovered a way of life which
although strange to Americans, is wholesome and fulfilling for many of
those who have chosen the Muslim experience.

Part of the discovery was that the media portrayal of Islam which is
generally negative, does not often view the positive kinds of things
that are happening. The negative sells. Therefore, the view most often
displayed does not consider the wonderful, strong women I have met
through this study who have chosen to resist the path of purely personal
gratification and instant pleasure. Choosing Islam in America is not an
easy path. Muslims are considered to be strange by most Americans.
Wearing a scarf; refusing social drinks, not gambling, not being
patriotic to the United States or Canada-those are not ways to win
friends. Some seem to dismiss those who convert as just "not very
smart." A study of Muslims in this country would no doubt reveal a very
high number of professionals-doctors, engineers, nurses, professors,
business men and women, teachers-along with blue collar workers,
students, and homemakers.

The prevailing view by many Americans is that Muslims are terrorists,
and they are quickly blamed whenever there is an act of terrorism. This
prejudice has resulted in many attacks on Muslims. Following the bombing
in Oklahoma City, in April 1995, Muslims across the country suffered
personal indignities as the media quickly blamed the attack on Muslim
terrorists. Many Muslims were spit on, crudely addressed, threatened, or
in other ways put down as if they were responsible for the bombing just
by being Muslim. Such behavior may not represent the bulk of the
American population; however, it does demonstrate a certain bias against
a religious minority in this country.

The United States of America was founded by those seeking the
opportunity to worship freely and according to their own desires. We who
are citizens of the United States have been quite proud of our history
of religious freedom. Whether or not we intend to allow that freedom to
be equally shared will be tested as Islam and other Eastern religions
begin to grow and take their place in this culture. Islam is one of the
fastest growing religions on the North American continent, and it is
important to know and understand these people who seek to live and find
happiness among us.

Sometimes loved ones make choices that cause reactions in us ranging
from heart-wrenching to heart-warming. Some choices may push us too far,
and we may respond as Tevya did, in Fiddler On the Roof, at the marriage
of his third daughter when he indicated that there was no "other hand"
because if he bent that much (to accept what she had done, who she had
married), he would break. By contrast, some choices our daughters make
(and sons, too), may open us up to the world around us if we allow
ourselves to explore this new path in the spirit of adventure and
discovery. Jodi's decision to follow Islam was the beginning of such a
walk for my husband and me. In our walk, we have discovered many
wonderful people trying to live full and abundant lives by trying to
eliminate the mediocrity of the present-day culture and attempting to
bring up their children to respect God and the rights of others. The
choice was there to accept or reject, and thanks be to God, we decided
to take the road of acceptance. It has been an exciting and fulfilling
journey sharing with and learning from these daughters of another
path.

Appendix A: Letter and Questionnaire: American-Born Women Converted to
Islam (Collected from September 1993 through July 1994)

TO: American-born women who have converted to Islam

FROM: Carol Anway, a parent whose daughter, Jodi, converted to Islam
and Jodi Tahireh Mohammadzadeh, the daughter who converted RE: A
research project to foster understanding of the choice to convert to
Islam and the effect of that choice on one's life DATE: September 1993
Twelve years ago our daughter, Jodi, married a young man from Iran and
about two years later converted to Islam. Although we were very
accepting of our new son-in-law, it was a struggle to accept this change
of religion which Jodi chose. We are so grateful that they lived close
enough so that we had time to work through our relationship with her and
Reza regarding their lifestyle and traditions that were so new to us.
That relationship has been enriched even more by the coming of two
grandchildren.

Friends and acquaintances are familiar with the book and movie, Not
Without My Daughter, and other articles that are very negative. They do
not understand the strength and quality of life Jodi and her other
American Muslim sisters have in their Islamic commitment. We want to
share a more realistic image by gathering and sharing some of your
stories through a descriptive research and possible articles or book.
Carol, the director of the research project, has a master's degree in
education/counseling. Jodi is working on her master's degree in nursing.
We will be assisted by a small group of American-born women who have
converted to Islam and are professional educators. This is a
cross-sectional study of women in major urban areas of the United States
and Canada. The study is based on those American-born women who have
converted to Islam and wear the covering (hijab).

whether married or unmarried. Our intent is to gather stories of women
from a wide geographical area of the United States and Canada by their
completing this questionnaire.

The purpose of this study is to explore and describe the effect that
conversion to Islam has had on the lives of American-born women and
their families. We want to emphasize the positive aspects as well as
acknowledge stresses that have occurred. We hope, through the writings
that will result from this study, to encourage the families of origin of
American Muslim women to work through their struggle to understand and
accept this choice to convert to Islam. The data in the attached
questionnaire contains both objective and subjective questions to
answer. This will assist you in describing your experiences as a Muslim
woman.

The questionnaire collection period has been extended from May 15 to
June 15 but we would like for you to send your completed questionnaire
to us as soon as possible. We want to reinforce the confidentiality of
this project. Carol will be the only one who will know what name goes
with what data and will be very careful to keep what you share separate
from your name. However the data gathered will be used in articles and
possibly a book to reflect the data and stories collected.

If you have any questions about the study, please call Carol at
816/2527541 in the Kansas City area.

Sincerely,
