Guarding the Creed
==================

The Shiite creed, right from its expansion at the time of the Prophet
(s.a.w.a.) and Imams (a.s.) was subject to attack by the enemies and
more so during the time of occultation. This is because by the twelfth
Imam’s absence, they find the arena empty and thus utilise this
opportunity by misguiding and deviating the people.

Those who truly and sincerely await the Imam of the age (a.t.f.s.) are
responsible for defending the creed and ideal of Imam and answering the
satanic doubts and inspirations of the enemies with all their might.
Imam Hadi (a.s.) says:

*“If during the absence of your Qaem, there remains no scholars who
invite the* *people towards him and defend his religion with divine
proofs and arguments and free Allah’s helpless slaves from the trap of
Satan and the enemies…, none would remain except those who turn their
backs to Allah’s religion and become apostates.”*[^1]
