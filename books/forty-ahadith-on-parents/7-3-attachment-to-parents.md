3. Attachment to Parents
========================

فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللٌّهِ (ص): فَقِرَّ مَعَ وَالِدَيْكَ فَوَ الَّذِي
نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَأَُنْسُهُمَا بِكَ يَوْماً وَ لَيْلَةً خَيْرٌ مِنْ
جِهَادِ سَنَةٍ.

[A person once approached the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and
his family) and said: “I have an old father and mother, who due to their
attachment towards me, are not keen for me to go to Jihad.”] 

[Hearing this], the Noble Prophet (peace be upon him and his family)
said: “(If such is the case then) Stay with your parents for, by the One
in whose control lies my soul,  their attachment of one day and one
night to you is better than one year of Jihad.”
