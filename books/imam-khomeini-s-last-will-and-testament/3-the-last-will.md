The Last Will
=============

***In the Name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate***

Let Ahmad Khomeini read this last will and testament of mine to the
people after my death, or if pardonable the respectable President or
majlis speaker or Chief Justice, and if pardonable a member of the
respectable jurisprudents of the Council of Guardians.

**Ruhollah al-Mousavi al-Khomeini**
