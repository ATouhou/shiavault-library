***In The Name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful.***

**Praise be to Allah the Lord of the worlds. Benedictions upon Muhammad
(S) and his Purified Progeny (A).**

**Peace upon the righteous Companions.**

Some of the controversial issues have divided the Muslims. These issues
have been misused by the enemies of Islam to divide the Muslims and to
weaken them. Therefore in order to unite the Muslims and to defend the
boundaries of Islam it is necessary to clear the misunderstandings
regarding these differences. In sorting out these issues we have been
ordered to confine ourselves within some limits. As the Almighty Allah
says:

***‘Obey Allah and His Apostle,***
***And never with each other quarrel,***
***For then you shall lose heart,***
***And all your power shall depart; ...’ [Holy Quran, al-Anfaal; The
Spoils, Nikayin 08:46]***

It is a must for us today, and for all times to refer to Quran and
Hadith in case of any difference of opinion. As the Almighty Allah says:

***‘; ... should you quarrel***
***About a thing, refer it unto Allah,***
***And unto His Apostle, ...’ [Holy Quran, al-Nisaa; The Women, Nikayin
04:59]***

In these series we shall refer to the Quran and Hadith to guide us on
the correct path in various controversial topics. We seek the help of
the Almighty in this.
