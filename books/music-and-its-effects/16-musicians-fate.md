Musicians Fate
==============

The Holy Prophet (S) said," The person possessing aguiler will be
brought on the Day of Judgement with a black face he would have a guitar
of fire in his hand, and above him will be seventy thousand angels all
carrying the maces of fire. They would be striking the maces on the head
and face of that person and the singer shall arise from his grave blind,
deaf and dumb and the adulterer shall also be raised from the grave in
this way. And the one who plays flute shall be similarly raised and the
one who plays the drum too."  
 The above Tradition clearly proves that all those people involving
themselves in singing, committing adultery or playing musical
instruments will be gathered on the Day of judgement as Deaf, Dumb and
Blind.

Let us seek refuge in Allah from the temptations of Shaitaan so that he
may never lead us into the disgraceful vice of listening to music. Let
us make a firm resolution to keep our houses clean of this ignominy, let
our children listen to sounds invocating and glorifying Allah(swt)
rather than the satanic chants of music.  
 Let us not follow the habits promoted by the killers of Imam Hussain
(a.s.).  
 Let us make a firm determination to eradicate this sin from our society
completely.
