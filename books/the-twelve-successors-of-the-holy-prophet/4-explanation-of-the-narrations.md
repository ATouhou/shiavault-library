Explanation of the Narrations
=============================

After having discussed the traditions regarding twelve successors, we
can derive the following points: The number of Imams for this *Ummah*
shall be twelve, in a continuous line. Secondly after the twelfth of
these Imams, the world shall reach its end.

According to the first tradition:

"The Islamic religion will continue until the Hour has been established,
or you have been ruled over the twelve Caliphs have passed among you."

This tradition has fixed the period of Islam's supremacy till the day of
Qiyamat and also fixed the number of Imams for this *Ummah* as twelve.

According to the fifth tradition:

"The Islamic religion will continue until there are twelve (Imams) from
the Quraysh. And when they all die the Earth will swallow its
inhabitants."

This tradition proves that Islam will continue till the end of this
world or till the reign of twelve Imams and after them this Earth shall
be destroyed.

The eighth tradition limits the number of Imams to twelve:

"After me there shall be Caliphs equal in number to the companions of
Musa (a.s.)."

This tradition shows that there will be no more than twelve Caliphs
after the Holy Prophet (S). And the Messenger of Allah (S) has clarified
that the number of Caliphs will be limited to twelve and after these
Twelve, the Qiyamat will surely occur and the Earth shall be destroyed.

Other traditions clarify the above statements.

On the basis of this, we have to admit that in order to supervise the
affairs of humanity, one of the Imams must have a long life which is an
unusual phenomena. Thus the twelfth Caliph and the successor of the Holy
Prophet (S), that is, Imam Mahdi (a.s.) was bestowed with a long life.
