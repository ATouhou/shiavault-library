57: Iron (hadid)
================

This chapter containing 29 verses in four sections from the Madinese
period was revealed after The Earthquake 99 and before Muhammad 47. It
is composed in a different style from those immediately before and after
it, because its verses are longer, like those found in other chapters
composed in Madina.

It begins in a lyric mood with a hymn to God's omnipresence (I) and then
presents a picture of hypocrites begging for light to guide them (II).
Other subjects discussed are showers of rain (III), different prophets
(IV) monasticism and finally God's bounty or grace. Iron, which gives
the chapter its title, is mentioned as the source of physical power
(III).
