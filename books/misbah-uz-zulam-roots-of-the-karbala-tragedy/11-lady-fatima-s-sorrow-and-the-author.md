Lady Fatima’s Sorrow and the Author
===================================

It may be remembered that Lady Fatima’s grief and sorrow may not be of
any concern to her opponent but the writer considers it such a serious
and terrible thing, which is impossible for him to put in writing. I
regard the sinless lady’s grief or displeasure as a grief and
displeasure of Allah and His Prophet, rather, more severe than that,
because Lady Fatima is a beloved of both Allah and His Messenger.

Allah forbid, what havoc can be caused by such a sinless lady’s grief in
the Hereafter? Everyone can guess it! Qadi Sanaullaah also was not
unaware of the consequence of this grief, and therefore he gave the
meaning of “ashamed” to “frowning.” Thanks to the Lord that the writer
was not living during the time of Lady Fatima (s.a.). He cannot imagine
in what way he would have erred. It is indeed his good luck that despite
being full of errors and sins, he is saved from observing the grief of
the Lady of Paradise. He cannot be more fortunate than this.
