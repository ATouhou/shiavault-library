82: Bursting Apart (infitar)
============================

These 19 early Meccan verses were revealed after !Soul-]Snatchers 79 and
before Splitting Open 84. Like the previous chapter, this one also deals
with Doomsday.

The late Professor Nicholson observes on p. 167 (n. 2) in his Literary
History of the Arabs that this passage is written in true prophetic
style ". Zamakhshari tells how it brings God's abundant mercy whenever
it is recited.
