Translator's Preface
====================

Thanks to the Almighty God, Who gave me success to accomplish
translation of this book.

Allah may send blessings on our Prophet, Muhammad (S), who guided us to
His Straight Path, and illuminated our heart with His guidance.

I offer the reward of this book to the spirit of my late grandmother,
May God have mercy on her, and beseech Allah to make it, for me and her,
a means of attainment to His reward and pleasures on the Day of
Judgment.

I shall acknowledge that my reference books have been: \`\`A Glossary of
Islamic Technical Terms'', Islamic Research Foundation of Astan Quds
Razavi, \`\`Holy Qurâ€™an'', Arthur J. Arberry, and \`\`Nahjul Balagha'',
S. Ali Reza.
