S - Shorayh Al-Qadhi
====================

A judge in Kufa originally from Yemen. Shorayh was a learned man, but
extremely naive. In the reign of â€˜Umar he was given the position of the
supreme judge of Kufa and remained in this position for 60 years. Imam
Ali did not remove him despite the fact that Shurayh had once naively
accepted to indirectly remove Imam Ali from his position as Caliph and
choose Mu'awiyeh.
