Arrival of Muslims
==================

   
 The first Muslims were brought here some two centuries ago, by European
slave traders mostly from Western Africa. Those helpless Africans lost
their liberty on the shore of Africa; their dignity was drowned in the
Atlantic Ocean, and not long after their arrival at the plantations they
lost their identity, culture and then religion in quick succession. But
in recent past some of them reverted with vengeance to what they thought
was their original religion, Black Muslims. Now Imam Warith Deen
Muhammad, the son of the founder of the movement, is bringing them to
the main Muslims’ tenets and beliefs. They have built hundreds of
mosques for their use, and they preach mostly among black Americans.  
    
 Beginning with this century up to the end of World War II, hundreds of
thousands, if not millions, of Muslims came to the Western Hemisphere.
An overwhelming majority of them was from the Middle East, Turkey, and
probably North Africa. A considerable number of them proceeded ahead to
South America and hundreds of thousands of them are now settled in
Columbia, Brazil and Argentina, as well as in some Caribbean countries.

From 1950 onwards, other groups have emigrated from the Indian
sub-continent, East Indies and Africa, apart from the former areas.
