The Triple Nature of Possession
===============================

Capitalism views private possession as a basic need which voluntarily
fulfils the community's desires and requirements rather than being in
conflict with it. Capitalists consider Nationalisation as exceptional
cases of remedies for temporary crisis of the Nationalised economy. It
argued that nationalised sectors of economy can be de-nationalised after
that crisis has disappeared.

Socialism, on the other hand, claim collective ownership as the
fundamental concept in its economic system. Private capitals must be
nationalised according to Socialism. But the Socialists were confronted
in the field of application with difficulties and were forced to
recognise private possession. That attitude was a temporary cure for
their economic problems. It is argued that when the difficulties have
gone, then the private sectors are re-nationalised again.

Islam recognises three kinds of possessions.

(a) Private Possession

بِالْبَاطِلِ إِلَّا أَنْ تَكُونَ تِجَارَةً عَنْ تَرَاضٍ مِنْكُمْ ۚ

***"O ye who believe!*** ***Eat not your property among yourselves in
vanities: but let there be amongst you traffic and trade by mutual good
will." ( Qur'an, 4:29)***

فَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُوا فَأْذَنُوا بِحَرْبٍ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ۖ
وَإِنْ تُبْتُمْ فَلَكُمْ رُءُوسُ أَمْوَالِكُمْ لَا تَظْلِمُونَ وَلَا
تُظْلَمُونَ

***"But if ye turn back, ye shall have your capital sums: deal not
unjustly and ye shall not be dealt with unjustly ?" ( Qur'an, 2:279)***

The Prophet (p.b.u.h.a.h.f.) said: "The possession of a Muslim is
illegal to his brother except which he willingly offers to him."

(b) Collective Possession
-------------------------

This field covers the national wealth which belongs to all people of the
Islamic State, irrespective of their financial status. The bulk of the
wealth is expended and utilised in building schools, hospitals, etc. The
sources or incomes of this sector of economy are specific and noted. For
example, the so-called (Kharaj land) is one source which is a land
naturally productive.

Prophet Muhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.f.) said: "People are to share three
.things, fire, water, and grass." All Muslim thinkers throughout the
Islamic history accepted the generalisation of this statement to include
all natural resources to be under collective ownership. There are many
other examples of income to the collective possession, which can be
consulted in the Islamic legislation books.

(c) State's Possession
----------------------

State's possession differs from other kinds of possession not only in
the sources of income but in utilisation and fields of expenditure also.
There are specific sources of income to this economic sector, like the
so-called (Dead land). The evidence of this in the Qur'an is the
following verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْأَنْفَالِ ۖ قُلِ الْأَنْفَالُ لِلَّهِ
وَالرَّسُولِ ۖ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"They ask you concerning "Anfal" (accessions) say "Anfal" is at the
disposal of God and the Apostle. " (Qur'an, 8:1)***

The Prophet is mentioned here as a representative of the Islamic
Government. The ways in which this wealth is used are many. One of the
basic channels is helping poor people to work, by offering small capital
or building a factory for their employment.
