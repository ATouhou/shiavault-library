Lesson Fifty Six: The Wise and The Fool
=======================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلعاقِلُ يَعْتَمِدُ عَلى عَمَلِهِ وَ الْجاهِلُ يَعْتَمِدُ عَلَى
أَمَلِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The wise man relies on his endeavor and action and the fool relies on
his wishes.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The wise are positive and truth seeking individuals. So they always look
for their high objectives in the external existence, and since
attainment to them is not possible without endeavor and attempt, they
focus their effort on their action.

The foolish and unaware , on the other hand, are drowned in a sea of
wishes and imaginations, and seek for what they have lost in the world
of imaginations, and since access to fancies does not require work and
effort, negative tendencies are manifested in all aspects of their life.
They live on their dreams, content with waiting for subjective victories
in a tomorrow that never comes.
