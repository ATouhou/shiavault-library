Translator’s Note and Acknowledgements
======================================

This small and simple book was most difficult and complex to translate.
The translation was begun four years ago by my father, Shaykh Fadhlalla
Haeri ,when he translated “The Lantern of the Path” during some
discourses. Though the task then fell to me to coordinate and execute
the final translation, it was not without the considerable help of
several scholars that the final version was achieved.

A formal translation was first done by Aisha Abdar-Rahman al-Tarjumana.
Both hers and Sheikh Fadlallah’s versions were used in translating it
anew, throughout which Muhsim Muzaffar helped in unearthing the meaning
of obscure words and phrases. This translation was subsequently reviewed
and edited by both Asadullah adh-Dhakir Yate and Christopher Flint.

I am deeply grateful to all of them, not least for all that I learned in
the process, especially from my father.

I sincerely hope that those who learn “The Lantern of the Path” it will
open up inner delights, as it has done for me.
