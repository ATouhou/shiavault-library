Not to Counterfeit Religious Sayings
====================================

Forging lies against Allah, the Messenger and the Religious Authorities
is forbidden in religion.

Allah the Most High said: ***“And who is more unjust than he who forges
a lie against Allah.***”

He also said: ***“Surely those who forge lies against Allah shall not
prosper. They will have little enjoyment for a while, but theirs will be
a painful punishment.”***

The Holy Prophet Muhammad (S) said: *“Any one who intentionally forges
lies against me prepares for a residence of fire.”*

Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (a.s.) said: *“The forging of lies against
religious authorities is like the forging of lies against the Messenger
of Allah; and the forging of lies against the Messenger of Allah is like
the forging of lies against Allah; and he who forges lies against Allah
will he punished by the Most High Allah.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“Forging lies against Allah, His Messenger and the
later’s successors is a grave (mortal) sin.”*
