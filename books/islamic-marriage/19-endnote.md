I have referred to Ali Akber Mazaheri’s *Youth and Spouse Selection* for
Chapters of *Importance of Marriage in Islam* and *Spouse Selection*.
Chapters Four to Eight and Chapter Eleven, are wholly taken from Maulana
Sayyid Muhammad Rizvi’s *Marriage and Morals in Islam,* which I think is
the best book on this subject. The Chapter of *Ghusl Janabat* is adapted
from the book, *Ritual and Spiritual Purity* also by Maulana Sayyid
Muhammad Rizvi. For Chapter of *Mutual Rights* I have referred to the
following books: *Youth and Spouse Selection by* Ali Akber Mazaheri,
*Principles of Marriage and Family Ethics* by Ibrahim Amini and *A Gift
for the Youth* by Shabeeb Rizvi.
