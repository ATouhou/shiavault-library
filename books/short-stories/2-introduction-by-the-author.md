Introduction By The Author
==========================

Dear Readers,

To embody the general concepts of the Islamic viewpoint concerning life
is the aim behind these stories. I believe concepts at the theoretical
level cannot produce a change or an effect as they can when presented in
the form of events or incidents from real life. Thus the Holy Qur'an
gives examples and values through pictures with details of the events in
which prophets and the righteous suffered for the sake of Allah.

If these short stories are knitted of imagination, they are certainly
taken from the depth of present-day Muslim girls' lives. Hence, any girl
may read in these stories, incidents she has experienced in some way or
directly.

In each story, there is the positive stance of an Islamic viewpoint. The
difference is great between this pure and sublime Islamic stance and the
impure, corrupted stance of non-Islamic views.
