Origins of Wahhabi Thought
==========================

The Wahhabi sect has two basic tenets, a declared tenet and a hidden
one. The declared tenet is commitment to divine unity and opposition to
idolatry and paganism. But as we shall see later, this commitment is not
confirmed by the actual history of the Wahhabi.

The hidden tenet is sowing the seeds of schism, discord, conflict and
war among Muslims to serve the goals of foreign domination. This is the
real purpose which the Wahhabia has sought to achieve since its
inception and until the present day. This means that the declared
objective or tenet served only to impress followers and enlist their
efforts in achieving the real objective.

Undoubtedly the slogan of reviving the concept of divine unity and
opposing idolatry has its attraction, and followers can be expected to
rally around it with enthusiasm but without being aware that it is only
a camouflage for the real hidden purpose.

Experts on the history of the Wahhabia confirm that the movement was
originally established upon an order by the British colonial
administration. The list of authoritative sources supporting this
conclusion is long and includes Saint John Philpy in *The History of
Najd*, Khairi Hamad in *The Pillars of Colonialism*, Hamaion Him√°yati
*in Al-Wahhabi Criticism and Analysis*, and finally, Haiem Wiseman, the
first prime minister of the Jewish entity in Palestine in his memoirs.
