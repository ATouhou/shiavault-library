Prophethood
===========

Our Prophet Muhammad (May Allah's blessing and peace be on him and his
descendants) son of Abdullah, son of Abdul-Muttalib, son of Hashim, son
of Abd Munaf, is a true and rightful Prophet. He claimed Prophethood and
wrought miracles, which proved that he was a true Messenger of Allah.
His greatest miracle is the Holy Qur'an - the glorious distinguisher
between truth and falsehood.

It will continue to exist till the Day of Resurrection. It is a proof of
its authenticity for the whole mankind. It is inimitable on account of
its extraordinary eloquence and the beauty of its diction and style.
When challenged, no rhetorician or man of letters could produce even a
small surah (chapter) or a complete verse like it.

Our Prophet (May Allah's blessing and peace be on him and his
descendants) was a Prophet to himself before he was formally raised.
Afterwards he was a Prophet for the whole mankind. He himself has said:
“I was a Prophet when Adam was still between water and clay”. And if it
were not so then preference to the inferior over superior becomes
necessary which is absurd.
