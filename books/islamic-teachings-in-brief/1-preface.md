In the Name of Allah,

The All-compassionate, The All-merciful

*Praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all being;*

*the All-compassionate, the All-merciful;*

*the Master of the Day of Judgement;*

*Thee only we serve, and to Thee alone we pray*

*for succour;*

*Guide us in the straight path;*

*the path of those whom Thou hast blessed,*

*not of those against whom Thou art wrathful,*

*nor of those who are astray.*

\* \* \* \* \*

*O' Allah! send your blessings to the head of*

*your messengers and the last of*

*your prophets,*

*Muhammad and his pure and cleansed progeny.*

*Also send your blessings to all your*

*prophets and envoys.*

***Call unto the way of your Lord with wisdom and good exhortation, and
reason with them in the best way. Lo! your Lord best knows those who go
astray from His path, and He knows best those who are rightly guided***

(Qur'an, 16:125)
