Safari To Makkah
================

The way is long

But he is young and strong

The road to Makkah

From Africa

Are many miles

But they will be crossed

with smiles they will be crossed

Labbaik Allahumma Labbaik

with cries

I come O' Master

I come O' Lord

On your chosen road

In the village

Relatives and friends gather of all age

To wish Haji well

To bid him farewell

The sister wept

The mother cried

Oh, My child

You are travelling through Jungles wild

Who will cook for you

Who will look after you

What if you lose way

What if you go astray

Smiles Haji brave

'Mother confidence have'

Said he, 'as I have'

In Allah - My God

My Master and My Lord

He created you and me

He will protect me

Gaze upon him all sad eyes

Safari starts and Haji cries

Labbaik Allahumma Labbaik

as he walked and walked

To himself he talked

Said the inner voice

There is but one choice

The way to Makkah

(even if it is) Far from Africa

I know not the road

I will carry my load

However painfully slow

I must go

In his voice strong and gay

This he spoke all the way

Labbaik Allahumma Labbaik

in the scorching sun

Haji goes on and on

On Safari to Makkah

Far from Africa

Clad in two pieces garment

And faith as his armament

Under the starry sky

Answering cry

Labbaik Allahumma Labbaik

in the sun and shade

Mighty river he made

He crossed the high mountain

With that strength and fountain

In the heart that lies

On and on he goes and cries

Labbaik Allahumma Labbaik call

days pass

The stars shine and moon

and night fall

Haji sleeps alone

On sand or stone

He prays in the desert

And says

Labbaik Allahumma Labbaik

he meets

Jingling bells sweet

Of camel caravan

Under the burning sun

they are his friends

On safari to Makkah

On the desert of Africa

With them he is not shy

They don't ask him why

They all have a common cry

Labbaik Allahumma Labbaik

Passed full moon five

The Haji is still alive

A little alim But he will go

Even it is slow slow

On his way to Makkah

Far from Africa

Silently he prays

he says

Labbaik Allahumma Labbaik

On evening about his cooking fire

Death he desire for Journey had him tire

Far from Africa

He goes to sleep

His eyes silently weep

Knows he not Right

under his feet

Lies holy land sweet

In his dream

He screams

Labbaik Allahumma Labbaik

When dawn broke

And muezzin spoke

He saw magnificent sight

Through the golden light

He was in Makkah

Not far from Ka'aba

With silent sighs, With silent sighs

Tears of pleasure flow from his eyes

He does not know what to say

So he bows down and prays

Labbaik Allahumma Labaik

I come O' Master

I come O' Lord

On your chosen road
