 These acronyms refer to the phrase "Peace Be Upon/with Him" which mean
in Arabic: "*'Alaihis Salam*" عليه السلام, an expression articulated
when the name of a prophet is mentioned. This expression does not convey
the meaning of "*Salla Allahu 'Alaihi Wa Alihi wa Sallam*" صلى الله عليه
وعلى اله و سلم which means: Allah blesses him and his family and sends
them His greetings."
