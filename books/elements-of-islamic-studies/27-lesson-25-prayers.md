 1. Daily prayers of five times (Subh: 2 rakaats; Zuhr: 4 *rak’at*s;
Asr: 4 *rak’at*s; Maghrib:3 *rak’at*s; Isha: 4 *rak’at*s). .  
 2. Friday Prayer (*wajib takhyiri* in the *ghaybah* of Imam)  
 3. Prayer of *ihtiyat*. All of these are related to the daily prayer.

(b) Three prayers connected with a dead person:  
 4. Salat *al-mayyit*;  
 5, *Qadha* Prayers of the parents (obligatory for the eldest son} ;  
 6. If the son does not pray the *qadha* of the parents himself, he may
ask some other person to pray on behalf of the dead person. It is called
prayer of *ijarah*.
