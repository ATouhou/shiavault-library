Section 6 : the Ministry of Salih Commentary : Verse 61
=======================================================

Salih exhorts the people of Thamoud to believe in and worship none but
the only - God They disbelieved and were destroyed.

(61) وَ إِلى‏ ثَمُودَ أَخاهُمْ صالِحاً قالَ يا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ
ما لَكُمْ مِنْ إِلهٍ غَيْرُهُ هُوَ أَنْشَأَكُمْ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ وَ
اسْتَعْمَرَكُمْ فيها فَاسْتَغْفِرُوهُ ثُمَّ تُوبُوا إِلَيْهِ إِنَّ
رَبِّي قَريبٌ مُجيبٌ

61. " And unto(the people of)Thamoud(We sent)their brother S alih, He
said: 'O my people! Worship Allah! You have no god other than He. It is
He Who produced you from the earth and settled you therein: so ask
forgiveness of Him, and turn unto Him in repentance: surely my Lord is
Nigh, Responsive'. "

**Commentary :**

Salih(a.s.) is the third prophet who succeeds Noah and Hud(a.s.) in the
Divine mission.

The Qur'anic story of the people of 'Ad ended with all of its
instructive lessons and now it is the turn of the people of Thamoud, the
people, who, according to historical narrations, lived then in the land
of "Wadi al Qurra" which was located between Medina and Damascus.

Here again we note that the Qur'an, when mentioning their prophet,
terms Salih as a brother, a compassionate person who had no other aim
except wishing his people well. The noble verse says:

" And unto(the people of)Thamoud(We sent)their brother Salih, ..."

The verse also continues:

"... He said: 'O my people! Worship Allah! You have no god other than
He. ..."

Afterwards, in order to elevate their sense of appreciation and their
sense of gratitude, he refers to an example of Allah's favor which, from
the point of view of their existence itself, they would not able to
deny, he says:

"... It is He Who produced you from the earth ..."

After referring to the blessings of creation, the verse reminds them of
all the favors which Allah had bestowed upon them in being enriched in
the earth, and implies that Allah is He who has left the development of
the earth to you and has empowered you with the means of its
exploitation. The verse says:

"... and settled you therein: ..."

It is to be noted here that the Qur'an does not claim that Allah
developed the earth and made it available to them, on the contrary, it
says that He left the development of the earth to them. Allusion is here
made to the fact that all the means of exploitation had been readily
available from all points of view, however, it is up to men to develop
the land with their own toil, and obtain its resources. And they would
not be able to claim any share of it without working and making the
required effort.

Since such is the case, they should seek repentance from their sins and
return to Him for Allah is always near to His subjects and accepts their
requests. The verse concludes:

"... so ask forgiveness of Him, and turn unto Him in repentance: surely
my Lord is Nigh, Responsive'. "


**Commentary : Verse 62**

(62) قالُوا يا صالِحُ قَدْ كُنْتَ فينا مَرْجُوًّا قَبْلَ هذا أَ
تَنْهانا أَنْ نَعْبُدَ ما يَعْبُدُ آباؤُنا وَ إِنَّنا لَفي‏ شَكٍّ مِمَّا
تَدْعُونا إِلَيْهِ مُريبٍ

62. " They said: 'O Salih! You have hitherto been a source of hope
among us. Do you(now)forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped
Truly we are in disquieting doubt as to that unto which you invite us'.
"

**Commentary :**

The idol worshippers told Salih(a.s.) that before he used to be their
source of hope and pride and because of this they loved him. They said
this so that he might be encouraged to try to preserve the good
relationship they used to have, and give up his calling to them towards
monotheism.

They told him that he was their source of hope in the past and they
used to appeal to him asking his counsel, they used to have faith in his
wisdom, insight, and in his intelligence, and they never cast any shadow
of a doubt upon his benevolence and compassion.

However, they told him that unfortunately, you made us lose hope in you
with your opposition against our way of life which is the worship of
idols and icons according to the way of our ancestors. This has been our
source of pride and thus indicates that you do not have the slightest
respect for our leaders, nor do you have any faith in our wisdom and
intelligence nor do you defend our traditions. The verse says:

" They said: 'O Salih! You have hitherto been a source of hope among
us. ..."

Do you actually want to dissuade us from worshipping what our fathers
used to worship? They declared:

"... Do you(now)forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped?
..."

The fact of the matter is that we are in doubt as to the way of life to
which you are calling us(that is monotheism)and, at the same time, we
are also pessimistic about it. They said:

"... Truly we are in disquieting doubt as to that unto which you invite
us'. "


**Commentary : Verse 63**

(63) قالَ يا قَوْمِ أَ رَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُ عَلى‏ بَيِّنَةٍ مِنْ
رَبِّي وَ آتاني‏ مِنْهُ رَحْمَةً فَمَنْ يَنْصُرُني‏ مِنَ اللَّهِ إِنْ
عَصَيْتُهُ فَما تَزيدُونَني‏ غَيْرَ تَخْسيرٍ

63. " He(Salih)said: 'O' my people! Bethink you if I be upon a clear
proof from my Lord and He hath sent Mercy unto me from Himself, who will
then help me against Allah if I(were to)disobey Him So you do not add to
me other than loss. "

**Commentary :**

Metaphysically orientated religions and Divinely appointed prophets
call on people to adopt monotheism and the worship of Allah by providing
sound reasoning and miracles, and not by force, threats and ignorance.

The position of being appointed as a prophet is a special favor and a
privilege accorded to certain individuals by Allah.

One should never abandon Allah's way by imaginary and wishful thinking
about popular support. We should take note of the fact that deviant
people will add nothing to others except to their losses, for opposing
truth itself is something very detrimental for man. The verse says:

" He(Salih)said: 'O' my people! Bethink you if I be upon a clear proof
from my Lord and He hath sent Mercy unto me from Himself, who will then
help me against Allah if I(were to)disobey Him So you do not add to me
other than loss. "


**Commentary : Verse 64**

(64) وَ يا قَوْمِ هذِهِ ناقَةُ اللَّهِ لَكُمْ آيَةً فَذَرُوها تَأْكُلْ
في‏ أَرْضِ اللَّهِ وَ لا تَمَسُّوها بِسُوءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذابٌ
قَريبٌ

64. " O my People! This she camel of Allah is a Sign for you. So leave
her alone to graze in Allah's earth, and do not touch her with any harm,
lest a swift chastisement will seize you! "

**Commentary :**

‏The story of Salih's she- camel has also been reiterated in suras Ash-
Shu'ara and Al- Qamar as well.(1)

Salih(a.s.) said to the people that he would ask their idols something
and they also should ask something from His Lord. Whoever, provides the
right answer, could be the object of his and their worship. The idol
worshippers accepted and their request was for a pregnant she- camel to
come out of the mountain just then and there. Allah accepted their
request and a camel, meeting all those requirements, came out of the
mountain.

This she- camel of Salih was extraordinary in many respects.

1. It came out of the innermost part of the mountain.

2. It was pregnant without having any contact with a male camel.

3. For one full day, she had drunk of the water of that village.

4. It provided a daily supply of milk that was sufficient for meeting
the needs of the people of the area.

5. The people had no responsibilities towards her.

6. It served as a reason and as a miracle which was quite tangible and
understandable for the people.

(1) Sura Ash- Shu'ara No. 26, verses 155 158, and Sura Al- Qamar No.
54, verses 27 31.


**Commentary: Verse 65**

(65) فَعَقَرُوها فَقالَ تَمَتَّعُوا في‏ دارِكُمْ ثَلاثَةَ أَيَّامٍ
ذلِكَ وَعْدٌ غَيْرُ مَكْذُوبٍ

65. " So they hamstrung her. Then he said: 'Enjoy yourselves in your
abode for three days, (then will be your ruin). That is a promise not to
be belied. ""

**Commentary :**

Through traditional narrations we are informed that only one person had
killed the she- camel. Despite this, the Qur'an says:/ 'aqarouha/ which
means that all of them killed her. This indication signifies that there
had been a consensus of opinion among them about the killing. From the
Islamic point of view, the ideological bond between individuals causes
them to be responsible for the sins of single individuals within the
context of that ideology.

Question: What is the underlying philosophy of a three- day grace
period Firstly: So as to give them a chance to repent.

Secondly: To provide a means for spiritual pressure and augmentation of
the penalty. If a person is told that he will be killed within three
days, this very news will serve as the greatest blow upon him
psychologically speaking.

Thirdly: It provided another good proof for the legitimacy of the
Divine prophet since fixing a dead line results from having access to
news from the invisible world.

However, one should never take Divine warnings as jokes or lies as
scorning them will cause the infliction of Divine penalties.


**Commentary : Verse 66**

(66) فَلَمَّا جاءَ أَمْرُنا نَجَّيْنا صالِحاً وَ الَّذينَ آمَنُوا
مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِنَّا وَ مِنْ خِزْيِ يَوْمِئِذٍ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ
الْقَوِيُّ الْعَزيزُ

66. " And when Our Decree came(to pass), We saved Salih and those who
believed with him by a Mercy from Us, and(delivered them)from the
ignominy of that day. Verily, your Lord is the All- strong, the All-
mighty. "

**Commentary :**

The Arabic term/ xizy/, applied in this holy verse, means a kind of
defect of deformity, the appearance of which causes man embarrassment
and loss of prestige.

Natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, floods or dangerous epidemics
may happen to both to the faithful as well as to idol worshippers, just
like carelessness, which may be seen in one man, but the effects of
which can be felt by all. However, when the issue in question is the
Divine punishment, the faithful are secure and safe unless they have
merited punishment owing to their lack of action, their condescension to
oppression, or their ceasing to dissuade others from what has been
forbidden. The verse says:

" And when Our Decree came(to pass), We saved Salih and those who
believed with him by a Mercy from Us, and(delivered them)from the
ignominy of that day. Verily, your Lord is the All- strong, the All-
mighty. "


**Commentary : Verse 67.68**

(67) وَ أَخَذَ الَّذينَ ظَلَمُوا الصَّيْحَةُ فَأَصْبَحُوا في‏
دِيارِهِمْ جاثِمينَ

(68) كَأَنْ لَمْ يَغْنَوْا فيها أَلا إِنَّ ثَمُودَ كَفَرُوا رَبَّهُمْ
أَلا بُعْداً لِثَمُودَ

67. " And the(mighty)Blast overtook those who were unjust, so they
became motionless corpses in their abodes. "

68. " As if they had never dwelt there. Behold! Verily Thamoud rejected
their Lord. Behold! away with Thamoud! "

**Commentary :**

The Arabic term,/ ja imin/ is derived from/ ja ama/ which means sitting
on one's knees or falling on face, like the state in which one has
received an electric shock which renders one immobile, making that
person lose the power to escape.

The Qur'anic term/ yaqnau/ is derived from/ qiniy/ which means staying
in one place.

The record of these obstinate and oppressive people of Thamoud comes to
a close in this verse.

S alih(a.s.) is one of the Arab prophets, and the tribe of Thamoud is
an ancient tribe belonging to prehistoric period, which resided in Wadi-
al- Qura, located between Medina and Damascus. They were a nation of
farmers and used to engage in horticulture. The name of Salih has been
mentioned in the Books of the Divine prophets.

The annihilation of the people of Salih by the mighty blast has been
likened to and resembles that of the supersonic jets of today which
break the sound barrier when their speed exceeds that of sound. The
terrifying sound caused, shatters glass windows, can cause abortions in
pregnant women, and hasten heart attacks. As a result of the mighty
blast, the Thamoud people also were annihilated. The verse says:

" And the(mighty)Blast overtook those who were unjust, so they became
motionless corpses in their abodes. ..."

The end of time will also be associated with a Divine mighty blast
which will exterminate everything. Sura Yasin, No. 36, verse 49 says:
"They will not have to wait for anything but a single Blast: it will
seize them while they are yet disputing(among themselves). " Again, Sura
Yasin, No. 36, verses 29, 32, say: "It was naught but a single(mighty
)Blast, and behold! They were(like ashes)quenched and silent. " "And all
of them shall surely be brought before Us. " The raising up of the dead
on the Day of Resurrection will also be made manifest in the same way.

However, the Divine punishment inflicted upon the oppressors takes a
similar course as a result of their injustice and cruelty. It must be
noted that Allah's retributions are not given only in the Hereafter, but
injustice and cruelty will be rewarded even in this very world, too. The
verse says:

"... As if they had never dwelt there. Behold! Verily Thamoud rejected
their Lord. Behold! away with Thamoud! "
