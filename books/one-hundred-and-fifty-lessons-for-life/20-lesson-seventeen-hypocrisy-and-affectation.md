Lesson Seventeen: Hypocrisy and Affectation
===========================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لا تُرّاءِ بِعَمَلِكَ مَنْ لاَ يُحْيي وَ لا يُمِيْتُ وَ لايُغْنِى
عَنْكَ شَيْئاً"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Do not do your good deeds for affectation and trying to impress people .
You should realize that people have no power on life or death nor can
they solve any problem for you.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

All appearances of the life of those who have gotten used to pretension
and hypocrisy become hollow and empty. They are contented with aspects
of life that have little substance and spiritual meaning, leaning
instead towards vain imaginations, illusions and empty religious rituals
. They gain nothing save appearances! For this reason, Islam strongly
criticizes this ugly attribute and says that your destiny in not under
control of these people, so why this facade?
