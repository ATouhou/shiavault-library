Preface
=======

By the Grace of the Almighty we present the Second Volume of Ayatullah
Dastghaib Shiraziâ€™s Greater Sins (Gunahane Kabira).

Since the publication of the first volume, the readers were eagerly
waiting for the second and there were many enquiries. However, since we
intended to maintain the same quality there was a delay. We hope the
readers find this volume as useful and interesting as the first one.

We would like to sincerely thank Sister Zainab Muljiani for editing and
revising this volume as she had helped us with Volume One. May Allah
reward her for the long hours she devoted to this work.

We also request the readers to pray that Allah (a.j.) give us the
Tawfeeq to publish the third and the final volume as soon as possible.
