Foreword

In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful

With the demise of Imam Khomeini on June 3rd, 1989, the world lost a
great revolutionary and an unparalleled leader who awakened the Muslims,
revived Islam and restored it to its pristine grandeur through his
honourable and dignified life.

The Imam was a shining light in the history of Islam that continues to
shine years after his demise. Millions flocked to his funeral; millions
more have since congregated in mourning ceremonies and processions all
over the world to pray tribute to him.

Much has been written about Imam Khomeini as a political and spiritual
leader of the Islamic Revolution. However, the aim of this book is to
give the reader an insight into Imam Khomeini’s personal life, the man
behind the scenes.  
    
 He was a perfect archetype of a complete Muslim in every facet of
life.  Indeed, this was a man who appealed to all levels of society and
all backgrounds, especially the oppressed peoples of South Africa, Iraq
and Palestine.   
    
 It is hoped, God Willing, that this compilation will be a great source
of inspiration and benefit for readers from all creeds and backgrounds.
