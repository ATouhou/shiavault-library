Mukhtar sends a Message
=======================

From his prison, Mukhtar sent a message to Ryfaah and his companions.
The message was as follows:

*Allah has made your reward greater. He has just decreased your sins for
fighting the unjust. If you give money or walk, Allah will reward you.*

Rufaah answered Mukhtar 's message. In it he said:

*We are ready to break into the prison to release you!*

Mukhtar ordered them not to do that.
