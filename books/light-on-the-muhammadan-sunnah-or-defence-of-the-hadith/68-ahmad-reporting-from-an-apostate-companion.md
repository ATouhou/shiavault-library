Ahmad Reporting From an Apostate Companion:
===========================================

Ibn Hajar, in Fath al-Bari, says: In Musnad Ahmad we find hadith of
Rabi’ah ibn Umayyah ibn Khalaf al-Jamhi, who embraced Islam during
conquest of Makkah, attending the Hijjat al-Wada’ with the Messenger of
Allah, relating his traditions after his demise…then he was disgraced.
During the caliphate of Umar he joined the Romans, adopting the
Christian religion, because of something that enraged him. Reporting
such a hadith is verily a dubious thing, and that who reported it might
not get acquainted with the story of his apostasy. <span

These were comments uttered by eminent leaders (imams) about Musnad
Ahmad, which suffice for introducing it and manifesting its worth as it
was actually not as was known about it. It was one of the sources that
were unreliable and unfit for argumentation, like all other Musnads.
