Fatima’s State of Being Oppressed:
==================================

Fatima (peace be upon her) is an oppressed woman, but she never yield.
She had so many strong objections to the unjust acts of the Caliphs.

But she was oppressed, because her right was neglected, nobody answered
to her shout in the mosque, and even killed her with pain. Although the
Prophet (peace be upon him and his descendants) knew Fatima’s
dissatisfaction, his, nobody paid attention to her dissatisfaction.

When Ayesheh (the Prophet’s wife) made a fuss, Talheh and Zobeir rushed
to help her despite the fact that their reaction was considered as the
development of injustice in the history and Islamic society. But, on the
contrary, at the time when the society had the tinge of the Prophet
(peace be upon him and his descendants) yet, and the remembrance of the
Prophet (peace be upon him and his descendants) had not forgotten yet,
nobody paid attention to Fatima’s plead. It was as if Fatima (peace be
upon her) was inferior to Ayesheh.

Yes, she was oppressed, but who was the oppressor? Who seized her right?
