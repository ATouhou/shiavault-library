Fridays of the Month of Ramadan
-------------------------------

Imam Baqir (A.S.) has said: Surely, the Fridays of the month of Ramadan
possess an excellence over the Fridays of the other months, just as the
Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) possesses an excellence
over the other prophets.*Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 69, pg. 376*
