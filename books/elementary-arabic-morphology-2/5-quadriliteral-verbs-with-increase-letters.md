29. There are two types of quadriliteral verbs:

• Regular: when there aren't any doubled letters in its root. For
example: **دَحرَجَ** (he rolled)

• Double-lettered: when the first and third root letters are identical
as well as the second and fourth. For example **زَلزَلَ** (it quaked)

30. The pattern for the quadriliteral verb is **فعلل**. The first letter
is called the first root letter, then the second root letter, then the
third root letter then the fourth root letter.

31. A single quadriliteral verb is a qaudriliteral verb that does not
have any increase letters. For example: **دَحرَجَ** (he rolled)

32. A quadriliteral verb with increase letters is a quadriliteral verb
that has one or two letters added to its root.

• **تَفَعلَلَ** This is form II. Here a *tā'* is added to the root. For
example: **تَدَحرَجَ** (he rolled down)

34. There are two forms of a quadriliteral verb with two increase
letters:  
 • **اِفعَنلَلَ** This is form III. Here a glottal stop and a *nūn* are
added. For example **اِحرَنجَمَ** (translate)

• اِفعَلَلَّ This is form IV. Here a glottal stop is added and the
fourth root letter is doubled. For example: **اِقشَعَرَّ** (he shivered)
