Responsibility 9: Arranging Religious Gatherings
================================================

Another responsibility of the believers is to arrange gatherings in
which Imam al-Zaman (ajtf) is mentioned, as this is also a sign of one’s
love for the Imam. If a true believer is well versed in public speaking
and is able to speak about the Imam and his qualities, then he must
perform this act.

Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad as-Sadiq (as) said to Fudhail:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
تَجْلِسُونَ وَ تُحَدِّثُونَ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ جُعِلْتُ فِدَاكَ قَالَ:
إِنَّ تِلْكَ الْمَجَالِسَ أُحِبُّهَا فَأَحْـيُـوا أَمْرَنَا يَا
فُضَيلُ فَرَحِمَ اللٌّهُ مَنْ أَحْـيَا أَمْرَنَا
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Do you gather and discuss (about us the Ahlul Bayt)?” Fudhail said:
“Yes, may I be sacrificed for you!” The Imam said: “Verily I love such
gatherings, so keep our teachings alive O’ Fudhail! May the mercy of
Allah be upon a person who keeps our teachings alive.”[^1]

Indeed, establishing such gatherings is the true essence of helping the
religion of Allah and the Hujjah of our time and will result in the
spread of the religion of truth.

In fact, it is possible that at certain times, it may actually become
obligatory to establish such programs. For example, if there is a
possibility of danger coming to the religion and people are being led
astray, then in order to save the faith and protect the souls of the
people, it will become obligatory to hold such gatherings.
