Part Two : the Qur'an in the Traditions
=======================================

**Learning the Qur'an**

The Messenger of Allah (S) said:

'There are three groups of people who will not be concerned with the
reckoning (on the day of judgement), nor will they fear the shriek (on
that day) nor the great consternation: firstly, one who learns the
Qur'an and knows it off by heart and acts according to its (teachings)
for he will come to Allah as an honoured nobleman, secondly the muethin
(he who calls the faithful to prayer) who has practised for seven years
and never sought any payment for it, and thirdly the servant who has
obeyed Allah and obeyed his master.' 49

The Messenger of Allah (S) also said:

'Allah rewards the man who kisses his son kindly with a blessing, and
he who makes his son happy, Allah makes him happy on the day of
resurrection, and he who teaches his son the Qur'an, the parents will be
summoned on the day of resurrection and will be clothed in garments
whose light illuminates the people of Paradise.' 50

48 The traditions on the learning and recitation of the Qur'an is a
further evidence that the Holy Qur'an was compiled, and therefore
referred to by the Muslims during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad,
peace be upon him.

The Messenger of Allah (S) also said:

'This Qur'an is the etiquette of Allah so learn his etiquette as much
as you can.' 51

He (S) also said:

'There is not a single believer, man or woman, freeman or bondman who
is exempt from the right that Allah has over him to learn the Qur'an and
to study its meanings. Then he read the following verse: {Be ye
worshippers for you have taught the book . . . }52 53

He (S) also said:

'The best of you is he who learns the Qur'an and teaches it.' 54

He (S) also said:

'Everything will seek forgiveness for the teacher and the learner of
the Qur'an, even the fish in the sea.' 55

He (S) also said:

'Learn ye the Qur'an, for the similitude of one who carries the Qur'an
(in his heart) is he who carries a bag full of musk which when he opens
it fills the air with the sent, and if keeps it shut, it keeps the scent
of the musk.56

The Messenger of Allah (S) also said:

'One who teaches his child the Qur'an is like one who has made ten
thousand Hajj pilgrimages, and ten thousand 'Umrah pilgrimages, and has
freed ten thousand slaves of the sons of Ishmael, and fed and clothed
ten thousand poor, hungry and unclothed Muslims. For every letter he
will

receive ten blessings and ten evil deeds of his will be wiped out, and
the Qur'an will be with him in his grave until the day he is
resurrected. His balance scales will tip in his favour and he will be
taken across the Sirat as quick as lightning and the Qur'an will not
leave him until he has reached a station the loftiness of which is more
than can be imagined.57

He (S) said also:

'Allah will crown the parents of the one who teaches his child the
Qur'an with a kingly crown and clothe them in robes the like of which
has never been seen before.'58

Related from Amir al-Mu'minin 'Ali Ibn Abu Talib (a) that the Prophet
(S) said:

'The best of you is the one who learns the Qur'an and teaches it .'
59

In one of his speeches contained in the book Nahj al-Balagha, Imam 'Ali
(a) says:

'Learn Ye the Qur'an for it is the best of speech and study it for it
is the springtime of the heart. Seek cure by its light for it heals the
breast, and make your reading of it beautiful for it is the most
beneficial of narratives. The learned man who acts without using his
knowledge is as the ignorant, confused man who will never awake from his
ignorance, in fact the case against him is greater and loss is more
incumbent upon him, and in the sight of Allah he is the most
blameworthy. 60

Also related from Imam 'Ali (a) is that he said:

'If the teacher says to his pupil: Say: 'In the Name of Allah The
Beneficent The Merciful.' And the pupil says: 'In The Name of Allah The
Beneficent The Merciful.' Then Allah

will give absolution to them both and to the pupil's parents.' 61
Related from Imam Ja'far al-Saadiq (a) is that he said:

'The believer should not die before learning the Qur'an or be in the
process of learning it.' 62

**The Magnificence of the Qur'an**

The Emissary of Allah (S) said:

'The Qur'an is a guidance from error, an elucidation from blindness, a
release from stumbling, a light in the darkness, an illumination from
events, a protection from destruction, a guidance against temptations,
clarity from trials, and a conveyor from this world unto the next. In it
is your complete religion, no-one strays from the Qur'an but into the
fire.' 63

And he (S) said:

'Whoever is given the Qur'an by Allah and thinks that any man has been
given anything better than he has been given, then he has diminished a
great thing and aggrandised a minor thing.' 64

And he (S) said:

'The virtue of the Qur'an over the rest of speech is as the virtue of
Allah over His creation.' 65

And he (S) said:

'Allah does not punish the heart which is a vessel for the Qur'an.'
66

65 Seas of Lights: vol.89,p.19.

And he (S) said:

'Whoever makes his speech the Qur'an, and the mosque his house, Allah
builds for him a house in paradise.' 67

It is related that Abu Dharr came to the Prophet (S) and said:

'O Messenger of Allah, I fear lest I should learn the Qur'an and not
act according to it. ' So the Messenger of Allah (S) said: 'Allah will
not punish the heart in which He has made the Qur'an dwell.' 68

The Messenger of Allah (S) mentioned commotion one day, so we said: O
Messenger of Allah how do we save ourselves from it? He (S) said:

'By the book of Allah. In it is news of those who came before you, and
news of those to come after you, and a way to judge between yourselves.
It is the criterion and it is not in jest. No tyrant will neglect it but
his back will be broken by Allah. He who seeks guidance in other than
the Qur'an will fall into error. It is the sturdy rope and the wise
reminder and the straight path. Tongues cannot obscure it, it does not
pall despite much reading, nor do scholars ever tire of it. Its wonders
never cease . . .' 69

And he (S) said:

'The Angel Gabriel descended upon me and said: 'O Muhammad, everything
has a master . . ., the master of speech is the Arabic language, and the
master of the Arabic language is the Qur'an.' 70

Related from Mu'adh b. Jabal who said:

'We were travelling with the Messenger of Allah (S) and I said: 'O
Messenger of Allah, tell us about what it is that will benefit us.' He
(S) said: 'If you desire the life of the

felicitous, and the death of the martyrs, and deliverance on the day of
the gathering, and the shade on the day of heat, and guidance on the day
of error, then study the Qur'an for it is the speech of the Most
Merciful, and a refuge from Satan, and tips the balance scales in your
favour.' 71

And he (S) also said:

'The Qur'an is better than anything else other than Allah. He who
reveres the Qur'an has revered Allah and he who does not revere the
Qur'an has made light of the sanctity of Allah. The sanctity of the
Qur'an to Allah is as the sanctity of the father to his son.' 72

And he (S) said:

'It is not proper for one who carries the Qur'an to think that anyone
has been given something better than he has been given, for even if he
owned the entire world, the Qur'an would be better than what he owned.'
73

And he (S) said during the days of his passing from this world, among
that which he advised his companions:

'The book of Allah and the people of my household. The book of Allah is
the Qur'an. In it is the proof, the light and the evidence. It is the
speech of Allah, it is live and always valid, and applicable to current
issues. Whenever it is read thoughtfully it is always fresh, and it is
the witness (upon those concerned). It is just judge, and it is a
reference which can always be referred to. . . . Tomorrow (on the day of
judgement) it will confute against groups of people, and their feet
would slip off the Sirat (the straight path) 74.

In a hadith from Abu Dharr who said:

'I heard the Messenger of Allah (S) saying: 'Looking upon 'Ali b. Abi
Talib (a) is an act of worship, as is looking upon one's parents with
kindness and mercy. Looking upon a

page from the Qur'an is an act of worship, and looking upon the Ka'bah
is an act of worship.' 75

Commander of the Faithful, Imam 'Ali (a) says in description of the
Qur'an:

'. . . Then, Allah sent to him the Book as a light whose flames cannot
be extinguished, a lamp whose gleam does not die, a sea whose depth
cannot be sounded, a way whose direction does not mislead, a ray whose
light does not darken, a separator (of good from evil) whose arguments
do not weaken, a clarifier whose foundations cannot be dismantled, a
cure which leaves no apprehension for disease, an honour whose
supporters are not defeated, and a truth whose helpers are not
abandoned. Therefore, it is the mine of belief and its centre, the
source of knowledge and its oceans, the plantation of justice and its
pools, the foundation stone of Islam and its construction, the valleys
of truth and its plains. An ocean which those who draw water cannot
empty, springs which those who draw water cannot dry up, a watering
place which those who come to take water cannot exhaust, a staging place
in moving towards which travellers do not get lost, signs which no
wayfarer fails to see and a highland which those who approach it cannot
surpass it.

Allah has made it a quencher of the thirst of the learned, a bloom for
the hearts of religious jurists, a highway for the ways of the
righteous, a cure after which there is no ailment, an effulgence with
which there is no darkness, a rope whose grip is strong, a stronghold
whose top is invulnerable, an honour for him who loves it, a peace for
him who enters it, a guidance for him who follows it, an excuse for him
who adopts it, an argument for him who argues with it, a witness for him
who quarrels with it, a success for him who argues with it, a carrier of
burden for him who seeks the way, a shield for him who arms himself
(against misguidance), a knowledge for him who listens

p.854.

carefully, a worthy story for him who relates it and a final verdict
for him who passes judgements.' 76

He (a) also said:

'The outer manifestation of the Qur'an is elegant, and the inner
meanings of it are deep, its marvels never cease nor do its wonders come
to an end, darkness cannot be dispelled except by it.' 77

He (a) also said:

'Allah has not admonished anyone before with the like of the Qur'an. It
is Allah's sturdy rope, and His trustworthy means, in it is the
springtime of the hearts, and the founts of knowledge, hearts do not
have illumination without it.' 78

And he (a) said:

'This Qur'an is the counsellor that does not give false counsel, the
guide that does not lead astray, and the speaker that does not lie.
No-one will sit with this Qur'an but that he stand up from it with an
increase and a decrease; an increase in guidance, and a decrease in
blindness. Know ye that after knowing the Qur'an, no-one can again
experience poverty, neither can anyone before knowing the Qur'an
experience riches. Seek ye in it the cure to your ailments, and succour
in your hardships. In it is the cure from the greatest of ills, which
are unbelief, hypocrisy, blindness, and errancy. Beseech Allah through
it, and seek a direction to Him through the love of it, and do not ask
of his creation through it. (There is) nothing like it that leads the
people to monotheism. Know ye that it is an intercessor whose
intercession is accepted, and a speaker which confirms the truth, and
that whoever the Qur'an asks intercession for on the day of resurrection
will be granted such, and whoever the Qur'an speaks against on the day
of resurrection it will speak the truth against him. On the day of
resurrection a herald will proclaim: Verily

every ploughman is afflicted in what he sows and the outcome of his
works except in the tilth of the Qur'an. So be of its tilth and its
followers and seek evidence in it about your Lord, and counsel about
yourselves, and question with it your opinions, and seek to expose with
it your vain desires.' 79

From Imam Zayn al-'Abidin (a):

'The verses of the Qur'an are treasure houses. Therefore every time you
open a treasure house you must look to see what is in it.' 80

And he (a) said:

'If all the peoples of the east and the west were to die, I would not
feel alone as long as the Qur'an was with me.' 81

From Imam al-Baaqir (a) who said:

'The Commander of the Faithful (a) said: 'Shall I inform you about the
true religious scholar? He is one who does not invoke in the people a
despair of the mercy of Allah, nor does he invoke in them a sense of
security from the punishment of Allah. He does not give licence to
disobeying Allah and does not neglect the Qur'an seeking other than it.
Indeed there is no good in a knowledge in which there is not a deep
understanding, nor is there any good in a recital of the Qur'an in which
there is no pondering, nor is there any good in an act of worship in
which there is no heartfelt comprehension.' 82

And he (a) said:

'The Qur'an will arrive on the day of resurrection in the most
beautiful aspect and form. It will pass by the Muslims and they will
say: this man is one of us. Then it will pass beyond them to the
prophets and they will say: he is one of us. It will then pass beyond
them to the Archangels and

they will say: he is one of us. Until it ends up before The Lord of
Power, Almighty and Exalted is He, and it will say: Lord, I made such
and such a person thirsty during his middays, and kept him awake during
his nights on Earth. But I did not make such and such a person thirsty
during his mid-days, and did not keep him awake during his nights. So
Allah Almighty will say: Let them enter the garden according to their
stations. So (the Qur'an) will arise and they will follow it and it will
say to each believer: Recite and advance. So they recite and advance
until each person has reached his allotted station and has settled
therein.' 83

Also from Imam al-Baaqir (a) that he said:

'Learn the Qur'an, for it will come on the day of resurrection in the
most beautiful of forms ever seen by Allah's creation. There the people
will be arrayed in one- hundred and twenty thousand rows; eighty
thousand rows are the nation of Muhammad (S), and forty thousand rows
for the remainder of the nations. The Qur'an will come to the ranks of
the Muslims in the form of a man. He will greet them and they will look
towards him and say: There is no god but Allah the Patient the Generous.
This man is one of the Muslims we recognise him by his aspect and
character except that he was of a greater understanding than us in the
Qur'an. Hence he has been given of magnificence, beauty and light that
which we have not been given. Then he passes on until he comes upon the
ranks of the martyrs who say: There is no god but Allah the Most
Merciful Lord. This man is one of the martyrs, we recognise him by his
features and character except that he is one of the martyrs of the sea,
for it is from there that he has been given of beauty and virtue that
which we have not been given. Then he passes on until he comes upon the
ranks of the martyrs of the sea in the form of a martyr. The martyrs of
the sea look upon him and their wonderment is great and they say: This
man is of the martyrs of the sea, we recognise him by his features and
character except that the island in which

83 Usul al-Kafi: vol.2, p.601; The Shi'a Guide to the Shari'a: vol.4,
p.824.

he met his end was more fearful than the island in which we met our
ends. Hence he has been given of magnificence, beauty and light that
which we have not been given. Then he passes on until he comes upon the
ranks of the prophets and messengers in the form of a prophet and
messenger. The prophets and messengers look upon him and great is their
wonderment of him and they say: There is no god but Allah the
Magnificent the Esteemed. This is a prophet and messenger, we recognise
him by his character and features except that he has been given a great
bounty. They then gather together and approach the Messenger of Allah
(S) and ask him: O Muhammad! Who is this man? He says: Do you not
recognise him? They say: We do not recognise him, he is one that has not
the wrath of Allah upon him. The Messenger of Allah (S) says: This is
the proof of Allah upon his creation. So he gives a greeting of peace,
and passes on until he reaches the ranks of the Angels in the form of an
Archangel. The Angels look upon him and great becomes their wonderment
until it becomes too much for them for what they see of his virtue. They
say: Exalted is our Lord and Most Holy, this servant is one of the
Angels, we recognise him by his features and character except that he is
the most near of the Angels in station to Allah The Most Powerful and
Majestic. Hence he has been attired in light and beauty.' 84

Imam al-Saadiq (a) said:

'Among that which the Commander of the Faithful (a) enjoined upon his
companions was that he said: 'Know Ye that the Qur'an is the guidance
during the night and the day, and the light during the dark night over
exertion and poverty.' 85

And he (a) said:

'In this Qur'an there is the beacon of guidance and the lanterns of
darkness . . . Therefore he who wants to polish

85 Seas of Lights: vol.65, p.212; Usul al-Kafi: vol.2, p.216.

his eyes (to see the truth) he should open his sight to the light (of
the Qur'an) . . . since reflecting and thinking is the life of the heart
of the wise, just as the one with torch of light walks in darkness.86

A man questioned Imam al-Saadiq (a) and said:

'What is it with the Qur'an that despite the propagation and studying
of it, it only increases in freshness? So he said (a): 'It is that
Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, has not made the Qur'an for one
specific era rather than another, or for one group of people rather than
another. Therefore, in every time it is new and amongst every people is
fresh until the day of resurrection.' 87

He (a) also said:

'That Allah Blessed and Exalted is He, revealed in the Qur'an an
exposition of every thing, so that He has not neglected anything needed
by his servants, and so that no servant is able to say: if only such and
such a subject was in the Qur'an, but that Allah has sent down
revelation about that subject in it. 88

And he (a) said:

'Then the Qur'an ends up standing to the right of the throne and The
Omnipotent will say: By My Greatness and My Majesty, and the Exaltedness
of My Station, I will indeed honour today those who have honoured you
and I will humiliate those who have belittled you.' 89

And he (a) said:

'The Qur'an is a prohibitor and an orderer; it orders to paradise and
prohibits from the fire.' 90

He (a) said:

90 Usul al-Kafi: vol.2, p.601.

'The Qur'an is riches, there are no riches without knowledge of it and
no poverty after knowledge of it.' 91

From Imam al-Saadiq (a) from his forefathers (a):

'The Messenger of Allah (S) said: 'When trials and temptations descend
upon you like the darkness of the night, then look to the Qur'an for it
is an intercessor whose intercession will be accepted, and a schemer who
confirms the truth. He who keeps it in front of him will be lead by it
into paradise, he who puts it behind him will be driven into the fire.
It is the guide to the best path, and a book in which is explanation,
exposition, and learning. It is decisive and not in jest. It has an
outside and an inside, its exterior is judgement, and its interior is
knowledge, its outer manifestation is elegant and its inner meanings are
deep. (when it is studied) Truth and wisdom stems from it. And every
truth leads to even more wisdom. Its marvels are without number, and its
wonders never cease. The lanterns of guidance, and the lighthouse of
wisdom, and the guide to knowledge. Therefore he who wants to polish his
eyes (to see the truth), and attain serenity in his vision, and he who
wants to release himself from impaired vision and entanglement of the
mind, let him use the Qur'an. For thought and reflection gives life to
the heart of the wise, just as the one who walks in darkness with a
torch. Therefore it is upon you make sure to rescue yourselves in the
best possible way and in the shortest possible time. 92

And from Imam al-Saadiq (a) from his father who said:

'Indeed it is a source of wonderment to me that there is in a house a
copy of the Qur'an with which Allah Almighty is He expels the Satans.'
93

From Imam al-Ridha (a) that he mentioned the Qur'an and said:

'It is the sturdy rope of Allah and His firm grip, and His perfect road
that leads to paradise, and delivers from the

fire. It does not pall despite the passing of aeons, and does not
dissipate despite being oft repeated, because it was not created for one
time rather than another but as the argument and proof for all humanity.
Falsehood does not approach it from before it or behind it, a revelation
from The All Wise, The All Praised.' 94
