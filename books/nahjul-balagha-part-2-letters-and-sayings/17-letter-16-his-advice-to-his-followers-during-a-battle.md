Letter 16: His advice to his followers during a battle
======================================================

*He used to give to his followers at the time of battle*

The retreat after which return is intended and the withdrawal after
which attack is in view should not make you unhappy. Do justice with the
swords (allow your swords to do their duties). Keep ready a place for
the falling of bodies (of your foe); prepare yourselves for hurling
strong spears and striking swords with full force, and keep your voices
down as that keeps off cowardice.

  <p>
لاَ تَشْتَدَّنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ فَرَّةٌ بَعْدَهَا كَرَّةٌ، وَلاَ جَوْلَةٌ
بَعْدَهَا حَمْلَةٌ، وَأَعْطُوا السُّيُوفَ حُقُوقَهَا، وَوَطِّئُوا
لِلْجُنُوبِ مَصَارِعَهَا، وَاذْمُرُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ عَلَى الطَّعْنِ
الْدَّعْسِيِّ، وَالضَّرْبِ الطِّلَحْفِيِّ، وَأَمِيتُوا الاْصْوَاتَ،
فإِنَّهُ أَطْردُ لِلْفَشَلِ

By Him Who broke open the seed (for growing) and created living beings,
they had not accepted Islam but they had secured safety (by verbally
professing it) and had hidden their misbelief. Consequently when they
found helpers for their misbelief they disclosed it.

[فـ] والَّذِي فَلَقَ الْحَبَّةَ، وَبَرَأَ النَّسَمَةَ، مَا أَسْلَمُوا
وَلَكِنِ اسْتَسْلَمُوا، وَأَسَرُّوا الْكُفْرَ، فَلَمَّا وَجَدُوا
أَعْوَاناً عَلَيْهِ أَظْهَرُوهُ.
