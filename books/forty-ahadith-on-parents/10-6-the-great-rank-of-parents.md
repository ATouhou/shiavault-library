6. The Great Rank of Parents
============================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَن أَبِي الْحَسَنِ الرِّضَا (ع) قَالَ: إِنَّ اللٌّهَ أَمَرَ
بِثَلاَثَةٍ مَقْرُونٍ بِهَا ثَلاَثَةٌ أُخْرَى: أَمَرَ بِالصَّلاَةِ وَ
الزَّكَاةِ فَمَنْ صَلَّى وَ لَمْ يُزَكِّ لَمْ تُقْبَلْ مِنْهُ
صَلاَتُهُ وَ أَمَرَ بِالشُّكْرِ لَهُ وَ لِلْوَالِدَيْنِ فَمَنْ لَمْ
يَشْكُرْ وَالِدَيْهِ لَمْ يَشْكُرِ اللٌّهَ وَ أَمَرَ بِاتِّقَاءِ
اللٌّهِ وَ صِلَةِ الرَّحِمِ فَمَنْ لَمْ يَصِلْ رَحِمَهُ لَمْ يَتَّقِ
اللٌّهَ‏.

Imam al-Ridha (peace be upon him) has said: “Allah, the Mighty, the
Glorious, has commanded three things with which he has associated three
other things. He associated payment of zakat along with prayers such
that one who offers prayers, but desists from offering zakat, his
prayers are rejected. He associated gratitude to Him with gratitude
towards parents such that one who is grateful to Allah, but ungrateful
to his parents, will be deemed as ungrateful to Allah.  He associated
righteousness with bonds of kinship such that one who is righteous, but
has severed relations with his kin, will be deemed as not being
righteous.”
