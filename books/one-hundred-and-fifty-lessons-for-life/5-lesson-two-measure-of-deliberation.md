Lesson Two: Measure of Deliberation
===================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"صَلاحُ حالِ التَّعايُشِ و التَّعاشُرِ مِلء مِكْيال ثُلْثَاهُ فِطْنَةٌ
وَ ثُلْثَهُ تَغافُلٌ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Improving the situation of life and association is possible through
using a measure, two thirds of which is vigilance and one third of which
is negligence.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

No work project can be started without proper study, planning and
vigilance, and yet a project cannot be completed in a timely manner
without some bold decisions based on intuition, experience or outright
risk-taking.

In other words, if we dive into endeavors without careful investigation,
feasibility studies and work plans, we will not succeed. However, this
should not mean that we get bogged down for months and years in trying
to tie up all loose ends and going into unnecessary details to cover all
possible uncertainties. In most cases, time is of essence for a
successful outcome.

Hence the need to balance the vigilance for most part (two-third) with
some non-vigilance or expediency (for the remaining one third).
