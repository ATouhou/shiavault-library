The Letter S’aad (S’)
=====================

1. S’abr Of His Eminence
------------------------

In the tradition of the *Lauh* (tablet) mentioned in *Kamaluddin* and
other books through different channels it is narrated in the qualities
of His Eminence, Qaim (aj) that:

“He possesses the perfection of Moosa, the elegance of Isa and the
patience of Ayyub.”[^1]

We have already mentioned sayings connected to this matter under the
topic of calamities of His Eminence. Moreover, how beautifully it is
said:

“The grief that I suffer is such that Yaqoob did not have to experience
even a little bit of it, and all the calamities of Ayyub are but a part
of the troubles that afflict me.”

It is so because all the types of calamities will come together for His
Eminence and they would be prolonged thus causing the intensification of
the tribulation and sufferings. Think over it and the reality of the
matter will become clear to you. Thus it is necessary that you pray for
His Eminence with all sincerity and invoke the Almighty for his
reappearance.
