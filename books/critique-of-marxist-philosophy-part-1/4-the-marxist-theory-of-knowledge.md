The Marxist Theory of Knowledge
===============================

Here, the statement of the Marxist position by the author is,
unfortunately, not based either on the original works of Marx or Engels
or their authoritative interpreters. Perhaps due to the non-availability
of translations, he bases his criticism on the writings of second-rate
interpreters, such as Mao Tse-tung. The result is that the Marxist
position stated is weak, weakening in turn somewhat the author's
criticism of Marxist epistemology.

According to Marxism, all knowledge begins in experience. The next step
is that of ordering of information, inference and application.

It does not accept that some knowledge is independent of sense
experience. Denying that there exists some primary knowledge which
enables the mind to move from the first to the second stage, it fails to
explain how the mind can move from the stage of sense perception to that
of theory and inference.

The conclusion is- drawn that only the rationalist theory provides an
adequate explanation of how the mind is able to move from the first to
the second stage of knowledge. It is only the knowledge of the general
rational laws that affords the scientist to develop theories and to draw
inferences in his endeavour to discover the reality that lies beyond
empirical phenomena. The rejection of primary rational knowledge, which
is independent of experience, makes it impossible to go beyond the stage
of sense-perception.
