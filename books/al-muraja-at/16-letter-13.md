Letter 13
=========

Argument Regarding These Traditions Weak
----------------------------------------

**Thul-Qi’da 1329**

May Allah bless your hand and pen! How elevated their pages above the
position of that who challenges and opposes! How defensible their wise
writings against the sight of the critic and researcher! Their pages
struggle towards one destination, going along an aimed path, in a
purposeful way. Their arguments do not come across the hearing of the
wise without reverberating in acclamation.

Concerning your latest letter, its torrent has been overflowing,
over­brimming, supported by perfect verses and worthy proofs, with your
own self coming thereby out of the charge put forth against you without
committing any shortcoming in whatever entrusted to you. Whoever
challenges you is bad in argument, stubborn, arguing about falsehood and
acting like the ignorant.

Your opponents, however, may argue that those who narrated these verses
supporting your argument are Shi’a, and these cannot be relied upon by
the Sunnis. What would your answer, therefore, be? Please kindly provide
it, if you will, and please do accept my thanks. Peace be with you.

Sincerely,

*S*
