Prophet Yusuf (a)
=================

The Pharaoh of Egypt

called Firawn had many

people working for him.

One of his assistants had

a very wicked wife who

said many things about

Yusuf that were quite

untrue. She thought

she loved him but he

told her that she should

honour her husband.

She became very angry

and persuaded her

husband to have Yusuf

put in prison.

While he was in prison,

Yusuf used to tell everyone

what their dreams meant

and his explanation of the

dreams always came true.

Allah had given Yusuf

this great gift.

Firawn kept

having a strange dream

and none of his wise men

could explain what it meant.

Then Firawn heard of

Yusuf's great gift and

sent for him.

Yusuf would not leave

the prison until he had

proven his innocence.

Firawn had an inquiry

and discovered that Yusuf

really was innocent, so

he was able to leave prison.

Firawn's dream was most

unusual. In it, he saw

seven skinny cows eat

seven big fat ones and

there were seven skinny

ears of wheat and

seven fat ears of wheat.

Yusuf explained that

this meant there would

be seven years of plenty

but seven years of famine

would follow, when there

would be no water and

no food for anyone.

After that there would

be a year of rain.

Firawn liked and trusted

Yusuf so he put him in

charge of all the store houses

in the land.

Yusuf had worked himself

up to a very powerful position.

Allah always rewards

good people.

Yusuf worked hard; he

made sure the store houses

were filled with wheat and

grain.

Just as he had said,

there were seven years

of plenty. Those years

passed very quickly.

Soon the seven years of

famine came. The crops

failed. People were

hungry. Others were

starving.

Yusuf had planned for

this. He opened his

stores and let everyone

have some of the wheat.

Back in Palestine,

Israil too was facing

a hard time with

no food for his family

or the animals.

He sent his sons to

Egypt to get grain from

the famous treasurer of

Egypt. When they arrived

they were told that they

must get permission from

the governor to buy grain.

They went to see him, but

did not realise that the

fine man, in splendid robes was

really their brother. He told

them they could have some

grain, but if they wanted

any more, they would have

to come with their youngest

brother and parents.

Yusuf had recognised them

straight away and he longed

to see his father, mother

and young brother Benjamin

again.

Eventually the eleven

brothers returned with

their mother and father.

They bowed down before Yusuf.

Yusuf put his father on his

throne and reminded him of

the dream he had had so long ago.

The sun, the moon and

eleven stars had bowed

down before him just as

his father, mother and

brothers had done at this

meeting, This was a great

moment in his life

and he thanked

Allah, for all He

had done for him.
