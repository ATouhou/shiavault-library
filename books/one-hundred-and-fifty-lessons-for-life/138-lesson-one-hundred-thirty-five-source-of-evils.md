Lesson One Hundred Thirty Five: Source Of Evils
===============================================

The Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اِجْتَنِبِ الْخَمْرَ فَإِنَّها مِفْتاحُ كُلِّ شَرٍّ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Avoid wine which is the key of all evils.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Many books and articles have been written in respect of the harmful
effects of wine, including fatal effects on the nervous and digestive
systems and the heart, arteries, liver, kidneys and other organs of
body. Its painful social and economic consequences and shocking
statistics have been investigated by thousands of scientists and
contemplative minds. However, no phrase could be found as short , yet so
comprehensive , as the valuable tradition of our Prophet which , in one
short sentence, says it all.
