Pretending to Cry while Mourning for the Awliya’ of Allah
=========================================================

The verdict regarding making pretence of crying [tabaki]
--------------------------------------------------------

Because of certain conditions that exercise control over the hearts,
some people find it hard to cry and shed tears. When such people present
the appearance of crying, they will acquire the same reward as acquired
by those who actually cry. It has been recounted that the Noble Prophet
(S) recited the last part of the *Surat al-Zumar* for a sizable number
of the Helpers [*ansar*],

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
﴿ وفَسيقَ الَّذينَ کَفَرُوا إِلى جَهَنَّمَ زُمَراً ﴾
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“And those who disbelieved shall be driven to hell in companies.”*[^1]

All the people who were present cried except one youth. The youth said,
“Tears did not flow from my eyes, but I pretended to cry.” The Holy
Prophet (S) said,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
«من تباکی فله الجنّة.»
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Whoever feigns to cry will be rewarded with Paradise.”[^2]

Jarir narrates that the Holy Prophet (S) said,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
«إنّي قاري عليکم ﴿ ألْهکُمُ التَّکَاثُرْ ﴾ من بکی فله الجنّة ومن تباکی
فله الجنّة.»
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Verily, I am reciting *Surat* *al-Takathur*. Paradise will become
incumbent upon whoever cries and whoever feigns to cry.”[^3]

Shaykh Muhammad ‘Abduh says, “*Tabaki* occurs when a person forces
himself to cry, but without the intention of acting hypocritically.”[^4]

Mir Sayyid Sharif Jurjani says, “The source of feigning to cry is the
word of the Prophet (S), who said,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
«إن لم تبکوا فتباکوا.»
  </p>
</blockquote>

“If you cannot cry, then give the appearance of crying.”

The objective of this sentence is for a person who has a desire to cry
but is unable to, not a person who feigns to cry with the intention of
sport and hypocrisy.”[^5]

It can also be understood from the traditions of the *Ahl al-Bayt* (as)
that feigning to cry with correct intention is desirable.

Imam al-Sadiq (as) said,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
«من تباکی فله الجنّة.»
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Any who feigns to cry will be rewarded with Paradise.”[^6]

And he also said,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
«... ومن أنشد في الحسين شعراً فتباکی فله الجنة.»
  </p>
</blockquote>

“… and Paradise becomes incumbent on any person that recites elegies and
presents the appearance of crying for al-Husayn (as).”[^7]
