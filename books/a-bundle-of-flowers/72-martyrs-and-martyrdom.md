Martyrs and Martyrdom
=====================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "There is a goodness above any goodness until
when a believing person, (fighting against the enemies of Islam who
slaughter Muslims), is killed in the way of Allah, Almighty and
Glorious, then there is no goodness above it."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 10, p. 100

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "He who is slain in the path of Allah (as a
martyr), He will not recount anything of his sins to him, (his sins will
be forgiven totally)."

Furu’ al-Kafi, vol. 5, p. 54

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "...By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if
all the members in the skies and on the earth gather to kill a (sinless)
believer or be persuaded to it, Allah will surely put them all in the
Fire."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 75, p. 149

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "No drop is more beloved with Allah, Almighty
and Glorious, than the drop of blood which is poured in the way of
Allah.
