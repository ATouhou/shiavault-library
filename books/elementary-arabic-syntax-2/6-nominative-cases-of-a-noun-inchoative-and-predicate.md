Nominative Cases of a Noun: Inchoative and Predicate
====================================================

39. What is an inchoative?  
 An inchoative is a noun in the nominative case that is mentioned at the
beginning of a sentence. For example: **العلمُ** **نافعٌ** (Knowledge is
beneficial.)

40. What is a predicate?  
 A predicate is a word that completes the meaning of the inchoative. For
example: **المطرُ** **غزیرٌ** (The rain is heavy.)

41. What is the rule regarding inchoatives and predicates?  
 The inchoative is a definite noun that comes first and a predicate is
an indefinite noun, if it is a noun, which comes after the inchoative.

42. Is it possible for an inchoative to be an indefinite noun?  
 The inchoative can be indefinite if it is useful. For example: **شمسٌ**
**مضیئةٌ** **ظَهَرَت** (A luminous sun appeared.)

43. When does the predicate come before the inchoative?  
 The predicate comes before the inchoative if:  
 • the inchoative is intended by itself. For example: **ما** **عادلٌ**
**إلا** **اللهُ** (There is no just being except Allah.). This means
that Allah, nothing else, was intended.

• the predicate is a adverbial noun of time or place or a genitive
prepositional phrase and the inchoative is indefinite. For example:
**في** **البیت** **لصٌ** (A thief is in the house.)

• the predicate is one of the words that must come at the beginning of a
sentence. For example:

**أینَ** **الطریقٌ** (Where is the path?)  
 • if the inchoative is connected to a pronoun that refers to the
predicate. For example:

**في** **الدارِ** **صاحبُها** (The owner of the house is in the house.)

44. What is a sentence comprised of an inchoative and a predicate
called?  
 A sentence comprised of an inchoative and a predicate is called a
nominal sentence. For example: **الکسلُ** **عاقبتُهُ** **الفقرُ** (The
end of a lazy person is poverty.)

45. How many types of predicates are there?  
 There are three types of predicates:  
 • Noun, for example: **عليٌ** **أسدٌ** ('Alī is a lion.)

• Sentence, for example: **الکسل** **عاقبته** **الفقر**

• Fragment, for example: **بَلاء** **الإنسانِ** **مِن** **اللسانِ**
(Man's tribulations come from the tongue.)
