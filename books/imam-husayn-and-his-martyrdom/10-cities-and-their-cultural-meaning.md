Cities and their Cultural Meaning
=================================

The building of Kufa and Basra, the two great outposts of the Muslim
Empire, in the 16th year of the Hijra, was a visible symbol that Islam
was pushing its strength and building up a new civilisation, not only in
a military sense, but in moral and social ideas and in the sciences and
arts.

The old effete cities did not content it, any more than the old and
effete systems which it displaced. Nor was it content with the first
steps it took. It was always examining, testing, discarding,
re-fashioning its own handiwork. There was always a party that wanted to
stand on old ways, to take cities like Damascus readymade, which loved
ease and the path of least resistance. But the greater souls stretched
out to new frontiers - of ideas as well as geography.

They felt that old seats were like dead wood breeding worms and
rottenness that were a danger to higher forms of life. The clash between
them was part of the tragedy of Karbalaâ€™. Behind the building of new
cities there is often the burgeoning of new ideas. Let us therefore
examine the matter a little more closely. It will reveal the hidden
springs of some very interesting history.
