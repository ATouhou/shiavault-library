109. The Accusative of Distinction (Revisited)  ألتمييز .
=========================================================

In point \# 48 we mentioned that** کـَم** , which means "how many,"
should always be followed by an idefinite noun

in the accusative case. Arab Grammarians called this noun**التمييز
العَدَدي** "The Distinction of Number." Consider the following example:

<p dir="rtl">
**قـَرأتُ عِشرينَ** کِتاباً **خِلالَ العُطلـَةِ.**
</p>

I read twenty books during the break.

The underlined word could be articles, reports, magazines, charts, etc.

There is another form of this accusative noun which deals with
kind/type. It is called      .**التمييز النوعي** Usually it is an
indefinite singular noun/verbal noun which has the meaning of "with
respect to, in terms of, as to," and thus involves some level of
comparison.

<p dir="rtl">
**هي أکثرُ الطلابِ** استِعداداً **للأمتحانِ.**
</p>

As to preparedness for the exam, she is the most among all students.

However, it is not necessary that the accusative of distinction is
limited to expressing comparison. Consider the following sentence:

<p dir="rtl">
**مَلأتِ الأمُّ البَيتَ سَعادَةً.**
</p>

The mother filled the house (with) happiness.
