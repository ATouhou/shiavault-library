Lesson one Hundred Eleven: The Holy Quran is Evergreen
======================================================

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ اللّه تَعالَى لَمْ يَجْعَلِ الْقُرآنَ لِزَمان دُوْنَ زَمان وَ لا
لِناس دُوْنَ ناس فَهُوَ فِى كُلِّ زمانِ جَدِيدٌ وَ عِنْدَ كُلِّ قَوْم
غَضٌّ إلى يَوْمِ الْقِيامَةِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

God has not confined the Holy Qur’an to a specific time or for a
specific nation, and so it is new at all times and fresh for all
nations.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Imam (a.s.) gave the above reply to one who had asked why Qur’an does
not get old by repeated study, recitation and publication? This saying
points to the reality that Qur’an is not a product of the material world
and man’s transient and variable thoughts. So the dust of obsolescence
does not cover it . It does not age with time. Rather, it has originated
from God who is All-knowing, Omniscient, Eternal. The more it is read,
the more it reveals, the more relevant and interesting it becomes with
the passage of time. This in fact is one of the signs of Qur’an’s
greatness and grandeur.
