Invitation from Kufa
====================

When the Kufa invitation reached the Imam, he pondered over it, weighed
its possibilities, and consulted his friends. He sent over his cousin
Muslim to study the situation on the spot and report to him. The report
was favourable, and he decided to go. He had a strong presentiment of
danger. Many of his friends in Mecca advised him against it.

But could he abandon his mission when Kufa was calling for it? Was he
the man to be deterred, because his enemies were laying their plots for
him, at Damascus and at Kufa?

At least, it was suggested, he might leave his family behind. But his
family and his immediate dependants would not hear of it. It was a
united family, pre-eminent in the purity of its life and in its domestic
virtues and domestic affections. If there was danger for its head, they
would share it. The Imam was not going on a mere ceremonial visit.

There was responsible work to do, and they must be by his side, to
support him in spite of all its perils and consequences. Shallow critics
scent political ambition in the Imam's act. But would a man with
political ambitions march without an army against what might be called
the enemy country, scheming to get him into its power, and prepared to
use all their resources, military, political and financial, against him?
