Lesson Ninety Three: The Self-Conceited!
========================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ رَضِىَ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ كَثُرَ السّاخِطُ عَلَيْهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

He who is self-conceited will find a lot of people dissatisfied with
him.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Self-love and self-concern in proper measure is necessary for survival,
but if it exceeds the bounds, it becomes selfishness and self-conceit.

The self-conceited people never look at their own faults and consider
themselves responsible, pure, faultless and important in the society.
For this reason they have a lot of unreasonable expectations from
people, and this causes widespread anger against them .
