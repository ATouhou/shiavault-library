4: Making Him Popular Among The People
======================================

The arguments that were applicable for the previous duty are also
applicable here. Reason dictates that we propagate the love of one whose
love is Wajib and it is the best of deeds. This would be liked by Allah
most. That is why the Almighty Allah said to Musa: Make Me loved among
My creatures. This clearly proves this fourth duty.

There is a tradition in Raudatul Kafi from Imam Sadiq (as): “May Allah
have mercy upon the one who makes us loved among the people and does not
do anything that would make people inimical to us and hate us. By Allah!
If they had conveyed our meaningful sayings verbatim to the people they
would have created love and affection in their hearts. And no one could
have put any sort of tag on them.” But the fact is that a person hears
one thing and adds ten more from his own side.[^1]

In Majaalis, Imam Sadiq (as) is quoted to have said, “May Allah have
mercy on one who turns the love and affection of the people towards us
and he speaks about those whom they know. And he leaves those who
deny.[^2]
