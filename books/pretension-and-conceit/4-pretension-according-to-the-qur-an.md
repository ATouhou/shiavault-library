Pretension According To The Qur'ān:
===================================

1. ***So, woe unto the worshippers, who are neglectful of their prayers,
those who (want only) to be seen (by men), but they refuse (to supply
even) neighborly needs.*** ***(Qur'ān, 107:4-7)***

2. ***And they have been commanded no more than this: To worship Allāh,
offering Him sincere devotion, being true (in faith). (Qur'ān, 98:5)***

3. ***Is it not to Allāh that sincere devotion is due?*** ***(Qur'ān,
39:3)***

4. ***Whoever expects to meet his Lord, let him do righteous deeds, and
in the worship of his Lord, admit no one as (His) partner. (Qur'ān,
18:110)***
