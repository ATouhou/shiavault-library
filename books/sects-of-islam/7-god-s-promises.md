God’s Promises
==============

Based upon our stand on justice and grace is our view that ”whatever God
has promised as reward for any good work, He will fulfil it; but
whatever He has threatened as punishment for any bad work, it is upon
His discretion. If He meted out the punishment, it will be by His
justice; if He forgives it, it will be by His grace.” [^1]

We are confronted both by the Kharijites and Mu’tazilites on one side
and the Ash'arites on the other. The Mu’tazilites and Kharijites say
that it is incumbent upon God to fulfil His threats also. He has no
power to forgive. The Ash’arites, on the other hand say that it is not
incumbent upon Him even to fulfil His promises of rewards. They go so
far as to say, “even if Allah was to send the Prophets to Hell, and
Satan to Paradise, it is not against virtue, because there is no
inherent demerit in any action.”
