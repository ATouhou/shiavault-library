Chapter 12: Az-Zakiyyah
=======================

The word "Tazkiah" has been mentioned several times and in different
forms in the Holy Qur’an. It means the attestation of someone's
honorable record, or to purify one's self. For instance, the following
verses spoke of "Tazkiah":

***"Truly he succeeds that purifies it,"*** (91: 9)

***"Hast thou slain an innocent person,"*** (18: 74)

***"(To announce) to thee the gift of a holy son."*** (19: 7)

and

***"That is (the course making for) most virtue and purity amongst
you."*** (2: 232)

The meaning of the first verse is to purify one's self from evil
characteristics which develop from corrupt nutrition, excessive speech,
anger, envy, greed, self and material worship, conceit and vanity. This
type of purification is performed by abandoning such traits and adhering
to the noble characteristics which contradict the above mentioned ones.

The second verse means: Have you killed someone who, I attest to his
honourable record, for he has not committed a crime, or, an action,
which necessitates punishing?

The third verse speaks of granting a prophet a virtuous son made pure
from all sins, and whose nations conform to goodness. Lady Fatima
az-Zahra (sa) is “Zakiyah” in all the above-mentioned meanings. This is
understood from the verse of purification, which we have already
discussed, and concluded that she was pure of all abominations, or,
"Rijs."

As for the fourth verse, you can refer to the study in regard to her
name "Al-Mubarakah", for here we have explained the purification meant
in this verse.
