Part 4: Ibadaat
===============

First Chapter: Kitabu T Taharah
-------------------------------

Taharat means cleaning from the impurities, which are of two types:
Khabath and Hadath.

Those impurities which have been specified as inherently najis like
urine, excrement, blood, semen etc. are called Khabath. When our bodies
or clothes come into contact with them, they have to be made clean. Then
there are certain acts of Taharat which are ritual and are a
prerequisite to the acts of worship like Namaz and Tawaf. These are
Wudhu, Ghusl or Tayammum. They are invalidated by natural causes like
sleeping, urinating or entering into a state of Janabat, and they have
be reinstated.

Second Chapter:­ Kitabus Salaat
-------------------------------

In this chapter, various prayers like the daily Namaz, Namaz of Idd,
Namaz­e­Mayyit, Namaz­e­Tawaf, Nafila etc are outlined. Then the laws
which explain the prerequisites of salaat, and the acts which invalidate
the prayers are elaborated. Details are given about Namaz in one's own
home town, Namaz of a traveller, Namaz prayed alone, and the one in
congregation (jamaah), Namaz prayed on time, and those as qadha.

Third Chapter­: Kitabuz Zakah
-----------------------------

In this chapter, various types of wealth tax are discussed; especially
the one which is applied to gold, silver, wheat, barley, dates, grapes,
cattle (big and small) and camels. Details of percentage levied, and the
ways of spending Zakat are also explained.

Fourth Chapter: ­Kitabul Khums
------------------------------

Khums means one fifth (20%) and is also a type of wealth tax. According
to sunni Fiqh, this is applicable to the spoils of war only. But in our
Fiqh, the spoils of war are just one of the many other incomes and
accruals on which khums is to be paid. For example, the minerals, the
treasures, the wealth which is mixed with Haram in a manner that it
cannot be extricated, and its rightful owner cannot be traced, the
wealth acquired by diving, and the net savings and profit in businesses
etc.

Fifth Chapter: ­Kitabus Sawm
----------------------------

This chapter deals with the laws governing fasting, and distinguishes
obligatory fasts of the month of Ramadhan from other categories. For
example, the forbidden fasts on Idd days, the Makrooh fast on Ashura’
day, and so on.

Sixth Chapter: Kitabul I'tekaf
------------------------------

Literally, it means to retire into a place. In Fiqh, it is a form of
worship. When a person wishes to do I'tekaf, he has to retire into a
mosque for three days or more, and fast for three days. He remains
secluded, not stepping out of the mosque. This act is optional in
itself, but if one commences it and continues for two days, then it is
wajib to complete the third day.

Originally I'tekaf was to be observed in Masjidul Haram (i.e. Makkah),
Masjidul Nnabi (i.e. Madinah), Masjid of Kufa. But it is also allowed in
the central mosques of any town or city, excluding small mosques. The
Prophet (s.a.w.) always observed I'tekaf in the last ten days of holy
Ramadhan.

Seventh Chapter: ­Kitabul Haj
-----------------------------

This deals with all the obligatory and optional acts, during pilgrimage
to Makkah, like wearing Ihram, Tawaf, Namaz Of Tawaf, Wuqoof At Arafah,
Mashar, Mina etc.

Eighth Chapter: ­Kitabul Umrah
------------------------------

It is a smaller or lesser Haj, and it is obligatory for the Hajis who
must perform it first before proceeding to complete the Haj. It consists
of Ihram, Tawaf, Namaz of Tawaf, Saee', Taqseer.  
 The acts of Umrah are performed in the following order:

Ninth Chapter: Kitabul Jihad
----------------------------

This chapter deals with the holy wars which are deemed absolutely
necessary for the preservation of security and welfare of a society.
Jihad can be of two types:­ One initiated and another defensive. Shi’a
Fiqh stipulates that in order to initiate a Jihad, consent must be had
from the Prophet (s.a.w) or any Masoom Imam. As for the defensive holy
war, it can be waged as and when it becomes necessary. This chapter also
deals with the laws pertaining to Dhimmis who seek refuge under an
Islamic state, and about truce and peace treaties between Islamic and
non­Islamic countries.

Tenth Chapter: Amr Bil Ma'roof and Nahy Anil Munkar
---------------------------------------------------

In an Islamic society, it is the responsibility of every Muslim to
enjoin good and forbid evil. Of course, there are conditions and
regulations for carrying out this duty. This chapter deals with them
extensively.
