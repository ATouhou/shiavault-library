Genitive Cases of a Noun

 A noun is put into the genitive case in two cases:  
 • If it comes after a preposition.

• If it is a word after a prefixed noun.

 There are eleven prepositions:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مِن إلی عَن عَلَی في رُبّ الباءُ الکافُ اللامُ واوالقَسَم و
تاءُالقَسَم
  </p>
</blockquote>

For example: **ذَهَبتُ** **مِنَ** **البیتِ** **إلی** **المدینَةِ** (I
went from the house to the city.)

51. What is the compliment to a prefixed noun?  
 The word before a prefixed noun is a compliment to a prefixed noun. For
example: **خادِمُ** **الامیر** (the general's maid)

52. What is the ruling of a prefixed noun?  
 If the prefixed noun has nunation it must be erased. For example
**سورُ** **المدینَةِ** (the city's wall) takes the place of **سورٌ**
**المدینَةِ**. If the prefixed noun is in the dual form or the masculine
sound plural form, the *nūn* must be erased. For example: **یدا**
**الرّجُلِ** (the man's two hands) takes the place of **یدانِ**
**الرّجُلِ**.
