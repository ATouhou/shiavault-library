Responsibility 30: Giving Charity on Behalf of the Imam
=======================================================

Another responsibility is to give Sadaqah (charity) for the safety and
protection of the Imam. The amount and type of Sadaqah given is not
important, rather what is vital is the sincere intention that it is
given with, and that what is given is within oneâ€™s ability (a person
does not go through untold hardships to offer this charity such as
giving too much).

The giving of Sadaqah for the safety of the Imam can be done on a daily,
weekly or monthly basis whatever is easy for the believer and at the
time of giving the Sadaqah, one should remember and pray for the safety
of Imam al-Hujjah (ajtf).

A person giving the Sadaqah can and should pray for the safety of his
friends and family members his father, mother, children, and others such
as his teacher and other people as well. Therefore, within the
intention, one can specify that he is giving Sadaqah with the hopes that
it will be accepted as a protection for all of these people not just the
Imam.
