Letter 15
=========

**Thul-Qi’da 1329**

I A Flash of the Truth,
-----------------------

1) Your latest letter has been perfect in organization, clear in
expression, sweet, great in benefit, easily accessible, vast in sphere,
far­sighted, well­supported. I have looked into it keenly, and from
among its contents indications of your success have flashed, and signs
of your victory shone.

II Requesting Details on Sunnis Relying on Shi’a Authorities.
-------------------------------------------------------------

2) When you stated that Sunnis rely on Shi’as, however, you were very
brief. You did not elaborate on your statement in this regard. It would
have been better had you mentioned those men by their names and quoted
Sunni texts indicating that those men were Shi’as and that they
nevertheless relied on them. Could you please provide it so that the
flags of truth may be seen and the lights of certainty shine? Peace be
with you.

Sincerely,

*S*
