Fatima’s Jihad and Struggle:
============================

During her short life, especially in the last three months of her life,
Fatima (peace be upon her) had a great jihad, an effective and vital
jihad; a jihad which has been unique in the history of women’s lives,
and due to this fact, it has been registered in the history. She proved
that struggle is not all by sword and arrow. SOmmetimes, it is
aggressive and sometimes, quiet. Sometimes, struggle is achieved by the
application of silence, lack of attention, and disagreement, and
sOmmetimes by the application of aggression.

She was aware that struggle has damages, and even may result in death.
Being aware of these aspects, she accepted the struggle and its
resultant damages.

She knew that sOmmetimes the struggles do not achieve the result
immediately, but sometimes, the seed of a movement is planted and its
fruit will be obtained after decades or even centuries. Therefore, she
never gave up and did not evade struggling until she had power in her
body. She continued her struggles along with Ali (peace be upon him) and
sometimes independently. She argued with the word of logic and defamed
them and then proved she was right although she was prohibited from her
right.
