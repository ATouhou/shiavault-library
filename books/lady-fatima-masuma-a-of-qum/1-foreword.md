Foreword
========

*All praise and thanks are due to Allah, Who has guided us to this, for
we would not have been guided except by His guidance. May the salutation
and blessings of Allah shower on the last and best of His Prophets,
Muhammad Mustafā (S) and the sinless members of his progeny (A).*

In the autumn of 2002, my family and I were blessed with the opportunity
to come and pursue our studies in the city of Qum in Iran. I was
immediately struck by the influence and effect that the presence of Lady
Fatima Masuma (A) has on the inhabitants of the city.

I tried to find out more about this holy personality and discovered that
hardly any material is available about her in the English language; of
course, there was material in Persian, which I had just started to
learn.

I distinctly remember sitting at her shrine, upset because the Persian
language was proving difficult to master; at the time I made a pact with
the noble lady, “Bless me in the task of learning this language and I
will first use this knowledge to write your biography in English!”

This book is the result of that noble lady’s blessing and love for all
those who reside in her city. Alhamdulillah, it was completed on the
birthday of her noble father, Imam Mūsā al-Kāđim (A).

I would like first and foremost to thank Allah for giving me the
opportunity to have spent 9 months in this holy city. I would next like
to thank my children, Shaahid Hasan, Tahira Mahdiyya and Mujtaba Husain
for their help in typing this book and their enthusiasm. And of course
my husband, Abbas for his encouragement, criticism, editing and
patience.

I would also like to thank my tutor, Agha Mohammed Ali Shomali, for
meticulously proof-reading the book and for his valuable suggestions and
input.

This book is dedicated for the pleasure and approval of Allah, and in
honour of Lady Fatima Masuma (A) and her grandfather the Prophet of
Allah (S) and the Pure Members of his household (A). May Allah accept
this small token from all of us.
