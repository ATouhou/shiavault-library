"أَرْبَعٌ لا يَدْخُلُ بَيْتاً وَاحِدَةٌ مِنْها إلاّ خَرِبَ وَ لَمْ
يَعْمُرْ بِالْبَرَكَةِ: الخِيانَةُ و السَّرِقَهُ وَ شُرْبُ الخَمْرِ و
الزّنا"

Translation
-----------

If any one of the following four things enters a home it will ruin the
home and divine blessing does not re-establish it: treachery, larceny,
drinking, adultery[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

This is true for homes as well as for the entire society.

When treachery penetrates into a society, the spirit of confidence
disappears.

When larceny, in its different forms, appears therein, peace will not be
found anymore.

When alcohol drinking becomes popular among people, they will have weak
thoughts, disabled children and useless youth.  
 Lastly, when they are stained with adultery, the foundation of families
will be weakened and their next generation will be mischievous.
