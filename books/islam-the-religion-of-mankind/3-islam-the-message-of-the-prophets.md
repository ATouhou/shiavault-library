Islam : the Message of the Prophets
===================================

The concept of submission to Allah has thus been described as the core
of the religion and the gist of faith. Here, 'Islam' as a special title
given to the eternal Divine Religion - the Message of Prophet Muhammad
(s.a.w.) - and as a general title for the calls of all the prophets,
will be discussed .

Since all the prophets called for monotheism and invited mankind to
worship Allah alone and liberate themselves from servitude to others,
Islam is thus a general title for their calls.

In attempting to analyze this subject, one should refer to Qur'anic
verses which deal with the concept of 'Islam'. Among these numerous
verses which discuss religion, servitude and submission to the Lord of
the worlds, preached by the prophets and messengers from Noah (a.s.) to
Muhammad (s.a.w.), one should also note when and how the term 'Islam'
has been used. In this way, the clear meaning of 'Islam' and its
relation with the calls of all the prophets becomes readily apparent.

The Qur'an uses this word repeatedly and in diverse forms to define
true faith and complete submission to Allah's commands. 'Islam' has been
used in the form of commands, benedictions and other expressions by the
prophets and their faithful followers, announcing their submission or
response to its call.

Allah the Exalted, proclaims through His servant Noah (a.s.):

"But if you are averse I have asked of you no wage; my wage is only
with Allah, and I am commanded to be of those who are Muslims (submit to
Him)."

Sura Yunus (10:72)

Also, Allah proclaims through Abraham (a.s.):

"When his Lord said to him; be a Muslim, he said: I submit to the Lord
of the worlds. And the same did Abraham enjoin upon his sons, and (so
did) Jacob, (saying): O my sons! Surely Allah has chosen for you this
(We) faith, therefore die not unless you are Muslims."
Sura Baqara (2:131 - 132)

"....the faith of your father Abraham (is yours). He named you Muslims
before (in previous scriptures)...."
Sura Hajj (22:78)

Allah also relates Joseph'(a.s.) prayer:

"My Lord! You have given me (something) of the kingdom and taught me
(something) of the interpretation of events: Originator of the heavens
and the earth! You are my Guardian in this world and the hereafter; make
me die a Muslim and join me with the righteous."
Sura Yusuf (12:101)

Allah the Exalted, relates Moses' proclamation in the Qur'an:

"And Moses said: O my people! If you believe in Allah, then rely on Him
(alone), if you have indeed become Muslims (those who submit to Him)."
Sura Yunus (10:84)

Allah also says:

"Surely We revealed the Torah, in which Was guidance and light, by
which the prophets who submitted themselves (to Allah) judged the
Jews..."
Sura Ma'ida (5:44)

And,

"And when I inspired the disciples, (saying): Believe in Me and My
Apostle (Jesus), they said: We believe and bear witness that we are
Muslims (have submitted)."
Sura Mai'da (5:111)

Allah also commands Muhammad (s.a.w.) like all other prophets to say:

"I am commanded only to serve the Lord of this land (Mecca), Who has
made it sacred, and His are all things: And I am commanded to be of
those who are Muslims (submit to Him)"
Sura Naml (27:91)

Thus, all these divine invitations meet along the line of submission -
Islam - to the Lord of the worlds in its true context; that is,
servitude and true faith in Allah, the Exalted. The explicit meaning
becomes apparent in Abraham's (a.s.) words: "I submit to the Lord of the
worlds"; that is, he regards his submission as a religion for worship,
as a trust he commits to his sons and his followers, as a slogan for the
monotheists, and as a motto for the invitation to faith:

..... the faith of your father Abraham (is yours); He named you Muslims
before (in previous scriptures)....."
Sura Hajj (22:78)

Through these Qur'anic verses we understand that all the prophets
followed this unified line of faith with a single aim: The
implementation of servitude to Allah mankind's submission to the Lord of
the worlds liberating them from the worship of tyrants or their own
inner desires.

As such, the Qur'an regards belief in the prophets as a major basis of
a Muslim's ideology and as a historical and logical proof of the
truthfulness of Muhammad's (s.a.w.) message:

"Say (O Muslims): We believe in Allah and (in) that which has been
revealed to us, and (in) that which was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael
and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and (in) that which was given to
Moses and Jesus, and (in) that which was given to the prophets from
their Lord, we make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we
submit (become Muslims)."
Sura Baqara (2:136)

"Say: I am not the first of the apostles, nor do I know what will be
done with me or with you: I do not follow anything but that which is
revealed to me, and I am (nothing) but a plain warner."
Sura Ahqaf (46:9)

All the prophets, as is understood from the above verses, offered to
mankind the same religion and the same belief which Allah considered to
be the base and the starting point for the reformation of man. It would
deliver him from the dark labyrinth of ignorance which has resulted from
the ages of legends and myths fabricated by primitive peoples. Man has
suffered from this ignorance as he has suffered from the oppression of
tyrants, and from poverty, injustice and corruption. He will continue to
suffer unless he turns to the path of the prophets who all shared the
same call. This call aimed at the salvation of humanity - generation
after generation, nation after nation - from its sufferings and
tragedies.

Allah the Exalted, willed that all His messengers should pour their
offerings into the same stream, that their flames should unite into a
single illumination. This was the call of Islam, the message of Muhammad
(s.a.w.), as the eternal religion, the final message, and the theme
dominating and encompassing all other missions of the apostles.

"And We have revealed to you the Book (Qur'an) with the truth
confirming whatever of the Book(s) was before it and a guardian over it,
so judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow
their low desires (to turn away) from the truth which has come to you;
for everyone of you We have appointed a divine law and a (traced out)
way..."
Sura Ma'ida (5:48)

"He it is Who sent His Apostle with the guidance and the true religion;
that He may make it overcome (other) religions, all of them, however
much the polytheists may be averse."
Sura Saff (61:9)

Islam overcame all other religions as it is characterized by equality,
rationality, universality and eternity, enabling it to expand over vast
periods of man's history, encompassing all aspects of human growth and
development. Religion is thus, like a great river which has flowed
through all eras of man. This river is represented by Islam - the great
religion that was preached by the prophets in accordance with the needs
and potentials of their nations - which has flowed through all
generations, nations and prophets. Men have taken from this river as
much as they needed, yet it remained flowing with life; fertility and
growth for all humanity through all ages.

For this reason Allah sent the prophets throughout human history .to
guide man to the shores of this great spiritual river which endows him
with prosperity and life.

"O you who believe! answer (the call of) Allah, and the Apostle when he
calls you to that which gives you life..."
Sura Anfal (8:24)

Therefore, the calls of the prophets were alike as all of them
advocated Islam, which is the religion of mankind for all time.

As for differences among the messages of the prophets, these were due
to the particular requirements of societies during the various periods
of prophecy, the societies' level of comprehension and extent of
tolerance.

When man thus attained full maturity, he became ready to accept this
religion-Islam-to carry its message, and to follow its guidance. This
has been explained and confirmed by the Qur'an.

"Surely the religion with (acceptable to) Allah is Islam (submission to
His will) and those to whom (formerly) the Book had been given did not
oppose (about Islam) but after knowledge (of Islam's truth) had come to
them, out of envy among themselves; and whoever disbelieves in the
revelation of Allah then surely Allah is swift at reckoning."
Sura Aal Imran (3:19)

"And whoever follows a religion other than Islam, it will not be
accepted from him, and he will be one of the losers in the hereafter."
Sura Aal Imran (3:85)

This was the religion from which the prophets derived their messages,
but it was not their duty to insure the total acceptance of their
nations. They had been given the task of informing their nations
according to their nation's immediate needs and potentials, leading them
to the way of righteousness and peace. This is what the Qur'an says
about religion and messages, and about the unity of source and aim,
stressing that religion is one- Islam - and the messages of all the
prophets were derived from it:

"He has made plain to you of the religion which He enjoined upon Noah,
and that which We have revealed to you (Muhammad), and that which We
enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus, (saying): Establish the
religion, and be not divided therein; dreadful for the unbelievers is
that which you call them to; Allah chooses for Himself whom He pleases,
and guides to Himself him who turns (to Him) frequently."
Sura Shura (42:13)

Consequently it is incorrect to describe the calls of the prophets as
different religions, because these emanations originated from a single
source, inviting towards the same religion, though the messages slightly
varied, according to the times, the geographical location, the language
and levels of comprehension of the peoples.

"And We did not send any apostle but with the language of his people,
so that he might explain to them clearly;..."
Sura Ibrahim (14:4)

In this way the Qur'an proves the oneness of the line and direction
followed by the prophets, and affirms that all of them had been
commanded to establish the true religion-Islam.

Going through the Qur'anic verses concerning the concepts of religion
and its messages, we realize that Islam is the frame encircling all the
divine revelations. Islam in fact is the final formulation of the
complete divine message that draws a perfect picture of man and life on
earth. It is the very base from which the divine calls and messages were
made, such as those of Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and others (peace be
upon them):

"And surely it is in the original of the Book with Us, truly elevated,
full of wisdom".
Sura Zukhruf (43:4)

Thus what was revealed to the Seal of the Prophets, Muhammad (s.a.w.)
was the most advanced programme and the most perfect law of the divine
religion, Islam ,which was to be conveyed to all humanity.

Since Muhammad (s.a.w.) is the last prophet and the divine message has
been revealed in all its entirety and perfectness, therefore all the
former messages are to be regarded as null and void, after the
revelation of the holy Qur'an. Because the messages sent through the
previous prophets were of a temporary nature and limited in time-span,
and were the prelude for the final and great call of Islam.

The divine message revealed to Muhammad (s.a.w.) embraces all future
eras and generations, and is the final stage of mankind's historical
march. Therefore it is life according to the incumbent upon mankind to
mould revealed through the final call and the message of Islam, Seal of
the Prophets.
