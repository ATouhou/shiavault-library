Iv.- Final Comments
===================

Humanity today is currently in a period of its history in which
profound changes are occurring and these are extending progressively
throughout the universe. These changes, provoked by human intelligence,
incide on its way of thinking and acting with respect to things and
other persons. We stand before a true social and cultural transformation
that also redounds to the spiritual and religious lives of people.

Mankind has never had such an abundance of riches, possibilities and
economic power, and yet a great part of the world population experiences
hunger and misery. Men have never had a more acute sense of freedom as
they do today, yet new types of social and psychological slavery, such
as consumerism and drugs - to cite only two of them - are appearing in
society.

The world feels itself as interdependent: a necessary solidarity
appears that is divided by the antagonistic forces dividing society into
the political, the social, the economic, the racial and the ideological,
without forgetting the danger of a war capable of destroying
everything.

Man seeks to create a perfect order in this world using his own means,
without worrying about progressing in the same way with his spiritual
development. Spirits are perturbed: man fails to find himself, and it is
beginning to dawn on him that he is incapable of seeing his own history
through, and that this is overwhelming him.

These conditions are especially felt in the religious lives of people.
Increasingly more persons are moving away from religion. They deny the
existence of God or simply dispense with Him, particularly the youth,
some of them in response to a new humanism, or due to the demands of the
modern scientific world in which they put their blind faith.

The conviction is growing that man not only can and should increasingly
strengthen his dominion over creation, but also that it exclusively
falls upon him to establish Paradise on earth. The full and true
liberation of humanity is expected solely through human effort, and it
is believed that the future reign of man over the world will fulfil his
heart's desires.

Say Prophet Muhammad,( p.b.u..h), "I cannot control any harm or benefit
that come to me, except as God wills. There is an appointed term for
every community, and when it is reached they can neither delay nor
hasten it, even for a moment." (35)

Title of the article: Mahdism and Messianism utopia: believers
attributes at "The Time of Appearance".

"Do not make haste for a matter which is to happen and is awaited, and
do not wish for delay in what tomorrow is to bring for you." (1) There
is an increasing interest in our society today concerning the appearance
of the Messiah for Christians and the Mahdi (a.s. ) for Muslims that
will bring God kingdom to earth. Many religions and schools of thoughts
have prophesized and predicted it.

The Mahdi (a.s.) is the main eschatological messianic figure in Islam
that will bring peace and reconciliation to our suffering world before
the "End of Time". His appearance will bring spiritual harmony and order
and He will encourage people to live for the needs of "others".

The strong believe of the Shi´a religious community in the appearance
of the Mahdi (a.s.) has propitiated hope and inspiration to them to
accept the responsibility of taking the necessary steps to accomplish
all changes needed before his appearance.

"So have no fear of them; for nothing is covered up that will not be
uncovered, and nothing secret that will not become known. What I say to
you in the dark, tell in the light; and what you hear whispered,
proclaim from the housetops." (2)

The appearance of the Mahdi (a.s.) or Messiah is inevitable and sure,
but those that believe in His appearance will have to be aware of the
transcendental changes that will occur in their life at a personal and
professional level. Is no doubt that this is the greatest task that a
human being could ever had in his/her life, but, still is a long journey
to go and a lot of work to do before His appearance, but a bright future
is awaiting us at the end of the "Journey".
