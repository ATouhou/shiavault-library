وَأمّا حَقُّ السَّائِلِ فَإعْطَاؤُهُ إذا تَيَقَّنتَ صِدْقَهُ
وَقَدَرْتَ عَلَى سَدِّ حَاجَتِهِ، وَالدُّعَاءُ لَهُ فِيمَا نزَلَ بهِ،
وَالْمُعَاوَنةُ لَهُ عَلَى طَلِبَتِهِ، وَإن شَكَكْتَ فِي صِدْقِهِ
وَسَبَقْتَ إلَيهِ التُّهْمَةُ لَهُ وَلَمْ تَعْزِمْ عَلَى ذَلِكَ لَمْ
تَأْمَنْ أَنْ يَكُونَ مِنْ كَيْدِ الشَّيْطَانِ أَرَادَ أَنْ يَصُدَّكَ
عَنِ حَظِّكَ ويَحُولَ بَيْنَكَ وبَينَ التَّقَرُّب إلَى رَبكَ
فَتَرَكْتَهُ بسِترِهِ وَرَدَدتَهُ رَدًّا جَمِيلاً. وَإنْ غَلَبتَ
نفْسَكَ فِي أَمْرِهِ وَأَعْطَيتَهُ عَلَى مَا عَرَضَ فِي نفْسِكَ
مِنْهُ، فإنَّ ذلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ الأُمُورِ.

**And the right of him who asks from you**[^1] **is that you should
grant him (his request) if you are certain that he is honest and you are
able to fulfill his need. You should also pray to God to relieve him
from what has befallen upon him, and help fulfill his needs.**

**But if you doubt his honesty and he has already been accused of
dishonesty, but you are not convinced about this, you will not be sure
whether this is one of the plots of Satan who is trying to deprive you
of your fortune and cause a blockage between you and your approach to
your Lord.**

**Then you should leave him and overlook**[^2] **and should turn him
down gently. But if you can overcome yourself in this respect and grant
him what he has asked for despite what is presented to you regarding
him, then this is due to your resolution in the conduct of affairs.**

This topic is discussed along with the rights of him from whom you beg
in the next chapter.

[^1]: In the other version it continues: “is that you give to him in the
measure of his need.”

[^2]: His dishonesty.
