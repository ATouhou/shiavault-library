109: Disbelievers (kafirun)
===========================

These 6 early Meccan verses were revealed after Almsgiving 107 and
before The Elephant 105. They implicitly teach us to practice tolerance
even with atheists, and tell us to treat non-Muslims with respect yet
firm disavowal. This chapter forms the traditional Islamic answer to any
suggestion of compromise.
