Introduction
============

The battle of Harrah was a bitterly disastrous and painful event that
took place in 63 A.H. (682 C.E.) during the reign of Yazīd b. Mu'āwiyah
between the Syrian troops and the people of Medina.  
 In Arabic lexicon, Harrah means a rocky and rough terrain that is
difficult to pass.[^1]4

This event has been named as such because the invasion of the state army
of Shām (Syria) took place from the east of Medina, i.e., from the rocky
region of the city.[^2]

It has also been called “The Battle of Harrahtu Wāqim” in some
historical sources since the rocky terrains around Medina have been
extensive and protracted, covering various sections of its surrounding
among which only the rocky terrains of the east side have been called
“Harrahtu Wāqim”.[^3]

The historians have recorded the distance between Harrahtu Wāqim and
Masjid al-Nabī as to be one *mīl*.[^4]7
