A Critical Assessment of Umm Kulthum’s Marriage to Umar
=======================================================

***In the name of Allah, the Compassionate the Merciful***

All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. May the peace and
blessings of Allah be upon our Master, Muhammad, and his pure family,
and may the curse of Allah be upon all of their enemies.

Since the early Islamic centuries as of now, many inquiries and
investigations have been made and answers given concerning the following
narration: “The Commander of Faithful, Ali (a.s.) married his daughter
to Umar b. Khattab”.

As well, books, treatises and articles have been written in this regard.
For instance, Sheikh Mufid, may Allah be pleased with him, has authored
two well-researched treatises in this regard, of which one has been
presented in the book titled Ajwebat Al-Masail Al-Sarawiyah in reply to
the tenth question and the other has been presented in Ajwebat Al-Masail
Al-Hajibiyah in reply to the fifteenth question.

The present book is the result of research concerning this incident. In
this study, first of all, the original narration has been cited from the
most famous Sunni books whereupon their chains of transmission as well
as their significations have been examined and criticized.

This study aims to examine the story, unveil and clarify the truth and
finally put a stop to controversies and disputes in this regard.

And Allah is Felicitous and He is the Helper.
