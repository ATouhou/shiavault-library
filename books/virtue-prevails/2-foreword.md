Foreword
========

Dear readers,

I am not a professional storywriter. What I present herein are but a few
of the many portraits of life in which Good confronts Evil and spiritual
faith and belief confront an imperialist, dominating culture.  
 The apex of my hope is to produce a faithful image of the ideological
call for virtue to prevail over vice.

Muslim men and women live contradictory existences of contemporary life
as presented in the following fiction. I have tried to pave the way for
the revival of one of the propagative apparatus, the story, which
influences our lives at this juncture in Islamic history.
