Southeast Asia
==============

Turning to Southeast Asia and the Malay world, here we encounter a
unique phenomenon, namely the role of the School of Ibn ‘Arabī,
sometimes called wujūdiyyah, in the very formation of Malay as an
intellectual language suitable for Islamic discourse. Hamzah Fansūrī (d.
1000/1592), the most important figure of this School, was a major Malay
poet and played a central role in the development of Malay as an Islamic
language while he also had a command of Arabic and Persian. He was,
moreover, a master of the doctrines of the School of Ibn ‘Arabī.33 He
was followed in his attachment to this School by Shams al-Dīn Sumātrānī
(d. 1040/1630). Although this School was opposed by certain other Malay
Sufis such as Nūr al-Dīn Rānirī and most Malays paid more attention to
the operative rather than the doctrinal aspect of Sufism, the School of
theoretical gnosis continued to be studied in certain places and even
today there are circles in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia where the
teachings of this School are followed and many of the classical texts
continue to be studied.34
