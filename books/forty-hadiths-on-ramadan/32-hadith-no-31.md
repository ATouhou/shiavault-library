Reward of an Obligatory Act
---------------------------

The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) has stated: (The
rewards of) one, who performs in it (the month of Ramadan) a single act
from amongst the obligatory (wajib) acts of Allah, would be like (that
of) one, who has performed seventy obligatory acts in the other
months.*Wasaail al-Shia'h, vol. 10, pg. 307*
