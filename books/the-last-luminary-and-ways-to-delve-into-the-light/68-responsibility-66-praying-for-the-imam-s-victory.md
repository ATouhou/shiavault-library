Responsibility 66: Praying for the Imam’s Victory
=================================================

Another responsibility is to supplicate for the victory of the Imam over
the disbelievers, hypocrites, those who do not accept him and all of his
adversaries. In summary, this supplication should be targeted against
all enemies of the religion of Allah.

One of the best supplications to use in these regards is Du’a
al-Nudbah[^1], however there are many other ones mentioned in the books
of supplication.

In Du’a al-Nudbah, we come across many lines which convey the victory of
the Imam:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَللّٰهُمَّ وَ أَقِمْ بِهِ الْـحَقَّ وَ أَدْحِضْ بِهِ الْبَاطِلَ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“O’ Allah! Through him (the Imam), establish truth and destroy all
falsehood.”

In addition, we read:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ أَذْلِلِ بِهِ أَعْدَائَكَ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Through him (the Imam), humiliate all of your enemies.”
