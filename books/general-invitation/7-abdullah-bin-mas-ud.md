Abdullah Bin Mas'ud
===================

The Muslims who had embraced Islam secretly were telling among
themselves that Quraysh had not heard the Holy Qur'an and it would be
quite appropriate if one of them went into Masjid ul-Haram and recited
some verses of the Holy Book with a loud voice. Abdullah son of Mas'ud
expressed his willingness to do so. He came into the Masjid when Quraysh
had assembled by the side of the Holy Ka'bah and recited the following
verses with a loud and melodious voice:

In the name of Allah the Compassionate the Merciful. It is the Merciful
who has taught the Qur'an. .....(Surah al-Rahman 55:1-2)

The eloquent verses of this surah struck Quraysh with a strange awe.
And in order to forestall the effect of the heavenly call which was
reaching their ears through a defenceless person they all stood up and
beat him so much that blood began to flow from his entire body and he
returned to the companions of the Holy Prophet in a pitiable condition.
They were however happy that the invigorating voice had eventually
reached the ears of the enemies.[^16]

Whatever has been said above was by way of example for otherwise the
number of self-sacrificing devotees of Islam who endured the gravest
hardships during the early days of the Prophet's mission and showed
steadfastness in the path of achievement of their aim is much larger
However we refrain from mentioning their names and the events of their
lives for the sake of brevity.
