The Father
----------

My beloved child! You are not only advised to treat your parents with
respect in their lifetime, but after they die too, you must speak of
them with honour. You must beg Allah to forgive them. For, if you are a
child worthy of your father, you can still earn your parents rewards
from Allah.

Imam As-Sadiq (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ليس يتبع الرجل بعدموته من الاجر الاثلث خصال: صدقة اجراها في حيوته وهى
ترجى بعدموته وسنة هدى سنها فهى يعمل بها بعدموته او ولد صالح يدعوله.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“After a man dies, he can still rewards from Allah in three different
ways:*

*1. From what he has left behind which still benefits he public.*

*2. From establishing a useful tradition be followed by others after his
death, and*

*3. From prayers done in his name by pious child.”* [^1]

So, when your parents are dead and no longer are able to do rewarding
deeds for themselves, you can come to their help. You can be thinking of
them and make them happy by asking Allah to bless their souls. As they
thought of you throughout their lives.

The Child
---------

I pray to Allah to keep you and protect you for many years to come, and
to succeed in doing my best in fulfilling my obligations to you; and to
make both of you absolutely happy with me.
