Lesson 54: Sawm (fasting)
=========================

*Sawm* means to abstain from those things which break the fast, from
*subh al-sadiq* (true dawn) till Maghrib, in obedience to Allah.

Obligatory fasts
----------------

8 fasts are obligatory (*wajib)*: (1) Month of Ramadan; (2) *Qadha* of
the month of Ramadan; (3) 3rd day of *I’tikaf*; (4) 10 days of *'badal
al-hadi'* in Hajj; (5) Fast of *kaffarah* becoming obligatory for
various reasons, (6) Fast which becomes obligatory on account of
*nadhr*, ‘*ahd* or *qasam*; (7) Saum of *kaffarah* of breaking or
leaving fast; (8) Fast which has become *qadha* from father, becomes
obligatory on his eldest son after his death (It is better to include
'mother' also in this rule).

Conditions of the Fast
----------------------

These are the conditions for the validity of the fast:-  
 1. Sanity; 2.Islam 3. *Iman* (faith); 4. Remaining free from *haidh*
and *nifas* for whole day; 5. Not remaining a traveler (*musafir*) at
the time of *zawal*; 6. Not being in danger of illness by keeping fast.
If a traveller returns to his home-town or reaches a place where he
intends to stay 10 days, before *zawal*, and has not done anything which
breaks the fast, he must do the '*niyyah*' of fasting, and his fast will
be valid. Likewise, if he begins his journey after *zawal*, his fast of
that day will remain valid.  
 If a person is afraid that by keeping fast his illness will increase or
he will become sick by fasting, or that the treatment of his disease
will become more difficult, he must break his fast. If he does keep
fast, it would be null and void, and he, in addition, would be
committing a sin. Being *baligh* is not a condition of validity of fast;
if a child keeps fast, it would be all right. But fast is not obligatory
on a 'minor' (*ghayr-baligh*).
