18. Forgiveness Of Sins
=======================

The evidence of this – in addition to the fact that it makes one
eligible for the intercession of the Holy Prophet (S) and the last
successor of His Eminence – is a tradition narrated in *Tafseer Imam
Hasan Askari (as)* from the Messenger of Allah (S) that he said:

“By the one Who sent me as a true prophet, if a man from our followers
has sins equal to more than many times of Mt. Uhad and the earth and the
sky, as soon as he repents and renews our *Wilayat,* his sins will be
destroyed more severely than a collapsing of a building or a stone.”

I say: Apparently renewing of *Wilayat* is a matter that proves the
obligation of man to the *Wilayat* of Infallible Imams (as), his
attention with regard to them and his submission to their command, and
there is no doubt that it will be achieved by praying for the
reappearance of Maula, the Master of the Time (aj), because it is the
sign of their waiting for reappearance and an indication of their
attachment to their *Wilayat* and if it is not so, the real belief of
the heart requires no renewal even though it requires further
strengthening.
