The Discovery of the Self and of God
====================================

The rediscovery of the self, in addition to the above two, requires to
fulfil one more condition, and that is the realization and knowledge of
the Cause of one's creation and existence. That is, it is impossible for
man to recognize himself and know himself by viewing himself in
separation from the Cause of his creation. The real Cause of every
existent is prior to it and nearer to it than it is to itself:

And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. (50:16) And know that
God stands between a man and his heart. (8:24)

The Muslim mystics have laid great emphasis on the point that the
knowledge of the self (ma'rifat al-nafs) and the knowledge of God
(ma'rifat Allah) are not separate from one another. To experience the
spirit, which according to the Quran is God's 'breath', is, to
experience the Divine Essence. The Muslim mystics have raised severe
objections against the statements of Muslim philosophers regarding the
problem of self-knowledge and consider them to be inadequate.

Shaykh Mahmud al-Shabistari was sent a series of versified questions by
someone from Khurasan. His poem Gulshan-e raz is the reply he gave to
the questions. In one of the questions, the enquirer asks:

Who am I?

Inform me about my self.

What is meant by "Journey within thy self"?

The Shaykh's reply is elaborate. There he says:

Forms and spirits, from the same light are derived,
Reflected of mirror or beaming from the lamp.
I' the word is everywhere in all your speech.
It refers to the soul, the spirit. 'I' and 'You ',
are greater than the body and the spirit,
Which are together parts of the self.
Go then, my good man, first know well your self,
And remember: edema is different from robustness.

[^10]

Leave one of them to soar over the undulations of space and time,

Abandon the world to become a world in yourself.

A further elaboration of this theme will take us outside the scope of
our present discussion. To be brief, it should be said that the gnosis
of the self is inseparable from that of God. This is exactly the meaning
of the famous saying of the Prophet (S), and the same theme recurs in
the recorded statements of Imam 'Ali (A):

He who knows his self knows his Lord.

In the Nahj al-balaghah it is reported that Imam 'Ali (A) was asked by
somebody: 'Have you seen your God?' Ali (A) replied: 'Would I worship
what I have not seen?' Then he elaborated his answer thus:

He is not visible to the eyes but the hearts perceive Him through (the
factual experience of) faith (iman).

[^11]

An interesting point that is implicit in the statements of the Quran is
that man is in possession of himself as long as he 'possesses' God. Only
through the remembrance of God does he remember his self and become
fully aware of it, and to forget God is to neglect one's own self.
Forgetting God is accompanied by self-forgetfulness:

Be not as those who forgot God, and so He caused them to forget their
selves. (59:19)

Rumi, following his verses quoted above, says:

Even if the body should lie amidst fragrance and musk,
On death it will petrify and give out its stink.
So scent not the body, but perfume the soul with musk,
What is that musk except the Name of the Glorious Lord ?

Hafiz says:

Hafiz, if you desire presence,
do not be absent from Him.
If you desire His rendezuous,
abandon the world and forget it.

This shows why the remembrance of God is essential for the life of the
heart; it awakens and illumines the heart and gives peace to the soul;
it revives, purifies, refines, and humbles the human conscience and
fills it with delight. How profound and beautiful are 'Ali's words in
the Nahj al-balaghah where he says:

Certainly God Almighty has made His remembrance a means for cleaning
and polishing the hearts. It makes them hear after deafness, see after
blindness, and makes them submissive to guidance after being stubborn
and resisting. In all periods and times when there were no prophets,
there were individuals to whom He whispered through their thoughts and
spoke to them through their intellects. As a result they were
enlightened with a light awakening their hearts, their vision and their
hearing.

[^12]

Worship and the Rediscovery of the Self:

There is so much that can be said about worship that if we were to be
elaborate we would have to devote scores of chapters to this subject.
Here we shall make a brief reference to the value of worship in the
rediscovery of the self.

As much as the bondage to material matters and immersion in them severs
man from his true self and induces self-alienation, worship helps him in
recovering his own self. Worship awakens and arouses man from his
spiritual slumber. It rescues him from drowning in the sea of
self-neglect and forgetfulness and saves his identity from being lapsed
in the world of material things. It is in the mirror of worship and
God's remembrance that man can observe himself as he really is and
become aware of his failings and faults.

It is in worship that he acquires the true perspective of being, life,
space and time, like watching a city from a high mountain, and perceives
the insignificance, pettiness and abjectness of his materialistic hopes,
desires, and ambitions. It is in worship that a yearning is awakened in
his heart to attain to the very core of being.

I have always marvelled at the following words of the famous scientist
of our age, Albert Einstein. What adds to my amazement is that he was a
physicist and a mathematician, not a psychologist, theologian or
philosopher. After dividing religion into three stages, he calls the
third stage of religious experience as the one arising from 'cosmic
religious feeling.' He describes this religious experience in these
words:

The individual feels the futility of human desires and aims, and the
sublimity and marvellous order which reveal themselves both in nature
and in the world of thought. Individual existence impresses him as a
sort of prison and he wants to experience the universe as a single
significant whole.[^13]

William James, writing about prayer, says:

The impulse to pray is a necessary consequence of the fact that whilst
the innermost of the empirical selves of a man is a self of the social
sort it yet can find its only adequate socius (its "great companion") in
an ideal world. Most men, either continually or occasionally, carry a
reference to it in their breasts. The humblest outcast on this earth can
feel himself to be real and valid by means of this higher recognition.

[^14]

Iqbal also has something profound to say about worship and prayer and
their value for the rediscovery of the self. He writes:

Prayer as a means of spiritual illumination is a normal vital act by
which the island of our personality suddenly discovers its situation in
a larger whole of life.

[^15]

We conclude our discussion of this extensive subject right here.

Some Relevant Issues:

Now that our discussion about the concept of the world in the Nahj
al-balaghah is nearing its conclusion, I want to clarify some issues
with attention to the principles discussed above.

**The World Versus the Hereafter:**

1. Some Islamic traditions seem to imply that there exists a kind of
conflict between the world and the Hereafter. For instance, it is stated
that they are like 'two rival wives' who can never be reconciled, or it
is said that they are like the East and the West: one cannot approach
any one of them without moving farther from the other. How should one
interpret these statements in order to reconcile them with what has been
said above?

The answer is that, firstly, as has been expressly stated in most
Islamic traditions, a reconciliation between winning the world and the
Hereafter is not only possible but is a necessity of the Islamic creed.
That which is impossible is their reconciliation as ultimate ends and
goals.

The enjoyment of the good things of the world does not necessarily
require deprivation from the blessings of the next world. That which
deprives one of the rewards of the next life is a series of mortal sins,
not the enjoyment of a wholesome, comfortable life and the availing of
pure and lawful bounties provided by God. Similarly, that which leads to
deprivation in the world is not taqwa or righteous deeds or the
endeavour for the Hereafter; a number of other factors are responsible
for it.

Many prophets, Imams, and pious believers, whose virtuousness and piety
are indubitable, have been among those who benefited greatly from the
legitimate bounties of the world. Accordingly, even if it be assumed
that the religious texts do imply irreconcilability between the
enjoyment of the world and that of the Hereafter, they would not be
acceptable because of the incontrovertible evidence to the contrary.

Secondly, if we scrutinize such traditions closely, an interesting
point comes to the surface in whose light we observe no contradiction
between them and the incontrovertible principles of Islam. But before
that this point may be explained, we should examine three possible
relationships between the world and the Hereafter:

1. The relation between enjoyment of the good things of the world and
enjoyment of the rewards of the Hereafter.
2. The relation between the world as the ultimate goal and the
Hereafter as such.
3. The relation between adoption of one of these as the ultimate goal
with the enjoyment of the other.

There is no conflict whatsoever involved in the first case. Accordingly
a reconciliation between the two is quite possible. The second case,
however, involves a contradiction; for there is no possibility of
reconciling these two opposite goals.

As to the third, it involves in turn two cases: first, the adoption of
the world as the ultimate end and the enjoyment of the Hereafter;
second, the adoption of the Hereafter as the ultimate goal and the
enjoyment of the world. The first case involves a contradiction, whereas
the second doesn't.

**The Primary and the Secondary:**

The conflict between the adoption of either the world or the Hereafter
as ultimate ends and the enjoyment of the other is the kind that exists
between a perfect and an imperfect end. If the imperfect is made the
ultimate goal, the perfect is necessarily missed; whereas if the perfect
were one's end and goal, it would not necessarily preclude the
imperfect. The same is true of anything primary in relation to its
secondaries. If something secondary were made the aim, it would result
in deprivation from the primary. But if the primary is made the aim and
goal, the secondary, being a corollary of the primary, is automatically
included. This is most eloquently explained in Hikmah 269 of the Nahj
al-balaghah:

There are two types of workers among the people of the world: (One type
is represented by) the man who works in this world for this world and
his involvement in the world makes him forget the Hereafter. He is
worried about those whom he shall leave behind (on death) lest poverty
should strike them as if he were himself secure of it (in the
Hereafter). So he spends his life for the (worldly) benefit of others.
The other type of man works in the world for the sake of the Hereafter
and secures his share of the world effortlessly. Thus he derives benefit
from the both and comes to possess both the worlds. As a result he
acquires honour before God, Who grants him whatever he asks of Him.

Rumi offers an interesting allegory. He compares the Hereafter and the
world to a train of camels and the trail of dung that it leaves behind.
If one's aim were to own the train of camels he would also have the
camels' dung and wool. But if one wants only the dung and the wool, he
will never come to acquire the train of camels and will always be
collecting dung and wool of camels which belong to others.

Hanker you after faith for its pursuit yields
Beauty, wealth, honour, and good fortune.
Consider the Hereafter as a camel train;
The world is a trail of wool and dung in its rear.
If you want only the wool, you will never the camels own;
Yet if you own a camel train, isn 't its wool your own ?

That the relation of the world to the Hereafter is like that of a
secondary thing to its primary; that worldliness, being a pursuit of the
secondary, leads to deprivation from the benefits of the Hereafter; and
that other worldliness by itself ensures the benefits of the world, is a
teaching that originates in the Quran. Verses 145-148 of the Surat Al
'Imran expressly, and verses 18 and 19 of the Surat al-'Isra' together
with verse 20 of the Surat al-Shura implicitly present this view.

**A Tradition:**

1. There is a well-known tradition found in the texts of hadith as well
as other books and is also mentioned in the last will of al-'Imam
al-Hasan al-Mujtaba (A). This is the text of the tradition:

In regard to the world be as if you were going to live for ever. With
respect to the Hereafter be as if you were going to die tomorrow.

[^16]

This tradition has been highly controversial in that it has led to
contradictory interpretations. Some interpret it as implying that one
should deal with worldly matters with relaxed inattention and without
hurry. Whenever one is faced with an affair of worldly life, one should
say to himself "There is still a lot of time, why hurry?" But when
performing good deeds for the Hereafter, one should imagine as if he
were not going to be alive after tomorrow and say to himself: "There
isn't much time left; it is already too late."

Others with the conviction that Islam would never recommend negligence
and carelessness, which certainly has not been the practice of the
leaders of the faith, have said that what is implied is that one should
always approach the worldly affairs as if he were immortal, attend to
them with attention and care, and not perform them in a perfunctory
manner with the pretext that life is fleeting.

Rather, they say, the works of the world should be done with firmness
and great foresight and attention, as if one were going to live till the
end of the world. The rationale for this is that if one were to die,
others will derive benefit from one's works. The affairs of the
Hereafter, however, are in God's hand; so think of them as if you were
going to die tomorrow and there is not much time left for anything .

As can be noticed, the first one of these two interpretations
recommends negligence and lack of commitment towards the affairs of the
world, whereas the second one advises a similar attitude towards the
Hereafter. Obviously, none of these two interpretations can be regarded
as acceptable.

In our opinion, this, one of the most subtle of traditions, consists of
an invitation to action, care, and attention and avoidance of negligence
and indifference, whether with respect to the worldly activities or
those which relate to the Hereafter.

Suppose a person living in a house knows that sooner or later he will
have to move to another house where he will stay permanently. However,
he does not know the day, the month or the year when he shall have to
make the shift. Such a man is in a state of dilemma with regard to
matters relating to his present home and his plans about his future
house.

If he knows that he will move tomorrow, he would not pay any attention
to the repairs and upkeep of his present house, and attend only to
matters concerning the planned Shift. But if he knows that he would not
be shifting his residence for several years, he will act in an opposite
manner; presently he will devote all his attention to the present house,
knowing that there is much time left to deal with those relating to his
future residence.

Now this person, in a state of doubt about the exact date of the shift,
not knowing whether he will have to shift in near future or remain in
his present house for years, meets a friend who wisely advises him to
attend to the affairs of his present house as if he were to continue
living there for a long time and not to neglect its upkeep. As to the
other house, the wise friend advises him to get it ready as if he were
going to move tomorrow and have it furnished as soon as possible. This
advice will have the consequence that it will make him adopt a serious
and active attitude towards both his houses.

Suppose someone wants to start a work, like writing a book or founding
an institution or taking up a project which requires years of pursuit.
If such a person thinks that he will not live long enough to finish his
work, he might desist from starting it. That is why it is said that one
must think that he will live for long.

But the same person, from the point of view of repenting for his sins
and compensating for the past excesses with regard to religious duties
or the rights of the people he has transgressed-all of which require
little time for their accomplishment given the will to do so-may keep on
postponing them every day so that the promised tomorrow may never
come.In such cases, contrary to the first kind of attitude, to assume
that one has still enough time and there is no reason to hasten, would
result in negligence and delay in fulfilment of one's duties. Therefore,
here one should assume that there isn't much time left.

Therefore, we see that in one case to assume that one has enough time
encourages action and endeavour and the assumption that there is no time
left would lead one to abstain from action and endeavour. In the other
case, the result is quite the opposite. Here, the assumption that one
has still a lot of time leads to negligence and procastination, and the
assumption that there isn't much time left leads to quick accomplishment
of duties.

In the light of this, the hadith means to say that in regard to one
kind of duties one should assume that he is going to live on and with
respect to another kind suppose that not much remains of his life.

This interpretation is not baseless. There are several traditions which
confirm the above interpretation. The reason that this tradition gave
rise to controversy is that attention was not paid to such traditions.

Safinat al-bihar, under rifq, relates a tradition of the Holy Prophet
(S) addressed to Jabir:

Indeed this (i.e. Islam) is a firm religion. So (do not make it hard on
yourself but) act in it with mildness ... Cultivate like him who thinks
he will never die and work (for the hereafter) like him who is afraid he
will die tomorrow.

In volume XV of Bihar al-'anwar (the section on akhlaq, Bab 29), it is
related from al-Kafi that the Holy Prophet (S) addressed 'Ali (A),
saying:

This (Islam) is a firm religion ... So work like him who hopes to live
for long and be cautious like him who is afraid that he would die
tomorrow. That is, when commencing a useful project that requires a long
time for its completion, assume that you will live long enough to
complete it. However, in regard to matters which you might postpone
thinking that you have enough time to handle them, assume that you shall
die tomorrow, so that time is not wasted and delay is avoided.

In Nahj al-balaghah, it is related from the Holy Prophet (S) that he
said:

Attend to the affairs of the world; but with respect to the Hereafter
be such as if you were going to die tomorrow.

In the same book, the Prophet (S) is related as saying:

Work like the man who imagines that he will never die; and be cautious
like him who knows he is going to die tomorrow.

In another tradition the Prophet (S) is reported to have said:

The mu'min is the most vexed of men, for he must attend to the affairs
of the world as well as those of the Hereafter.

In Safinat al-bihar, under nafs, a hadith of al-'Imam Musa al-Kazim (A)
is related from Tuhaf al-'uqul to the effect that:

He who abandons the world for his Hereafter or abandons his Hereafter
for his world is not from us.
The above discussion on the whole confirms our interpretation of the
hadith and also shows that this approach finds recurring echo in the
teachings of the leaders of the Islamic faith.
