The Ahlul Sunnah Fatwa Naming the Enemies of Islam
==================================================

In the same book we read:

O Muslim fake sects are growing like tadpoles, today we have such
kaffir sects: Madhabi or la Madhabi Wahabis whose Imam is Abdul Wahab
Najdhi and lesser Imam Shah Ismail Dehlavi and they have an Imam Qasim
Nanuthawi, Ashraf Ali Thanvi and Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, Khaleel Ahmad un
Bhaaytee they are equal in their filth Chukurwaalvi Sir Sayyid Ahmad
Khan Aligarhi

Anayathullah Khan Mushrikee"

"Tajhahib Ahl ul Sunnah" by Naasir Sunniyath Abu Tahir Muhammad Thabib
Siddiqui Dhana Purri, page 435

The Ahlul Sunnah Fatwa declaring that Hajj
should be postponed during the Wahabi reign
Ellahi states that proof of their hatred of Wahabies is their claims
that Hajj should be postponed under their rule.

Al Barelviyaath by Ehsan Ellahi page 211

Najdi Nasibis are the descendants of Iblis
Ibn Kathir records the following:

Before Hijrah the people wanted to kill the Prophet they called a
meeting, in it a Shaythan appeared as a Najdi, the kafir asked what is
your name, Shaytan said I am a Najdi elder I am hear to listen to your
plot. The kafirs welcomed him".

al Bidayah wa al Nihayah by Ibn Kathir Volume 3 page 175

The Nasibi are the descendants of Shaykh Najdhi who was present at this
meeting.

Allah (swt) says in the Quran to Iblis:

You will be associated with the offspring of the enemies of Allah and
their wealth. These Imams are waiting at the Gates of Hell, whoever
follows them will go the same way. Let it be known the Sunni Ulema have
declared kufr Fatwa on their Imams Thanvi, Gangohi etc.

The Hanbali Sunni Fatwa that la madhabi / Ahl ul
Hadith are transgressors
The Hanbali scholar Qadi ibne Abil 'Ali states:

Whoever doesnt believe in taqlU\`S(d and that there is no Leader, that
person is a transgressor in Allahs eyes".

Tabaqat ay Hanbala, Volume 1 page 31 by Qadi ibne Abil 'Ali

Today these Nasibis are appearing everywhere, they say whoever follows
and Imam is misguided.

The Sunni Fatwa that Ahl Hadith are Apostates and misguided
In al Barelviyaath, Ehsan Ellahi records the following: page 175 we
read:

Ahlul Hadith are Kaffir, misguided encourage others to follow them".

al Barelviyaath by Ehsan Ellahi page 175

The Sunni Fatwa that Ahlul Hadith are the dogs of hellIn Hanafeeyuth
aur Mahziyaat, a collection of Hanafi Fatwas we read: page 35

La madhabi are the dogs of hell, Wahabis are worse than Hindus whoever
reads behind Ahlul Hadith it is not permitted to read behind them, his
nikah becomes void from Fatawi Razooba Volume 6 page 90, 13 and 121 and
Thalash Munzil page 23".

The Ahlul Sunnah Fatwa declaring Ahl ul
Hadith as worse than dogs
As above page 20 quoting "Muallif Abdul Ghafoor Asree pages 18-68 or
18 - 69

If a Maulana found out that an Ahl ul Hadith had prayed in the Mosque
he should would change the floor or get them washed

These Nasibis that attack the lovers of Ali, mourners of Hussain (as)
are the true kaffirs hence you are nothing.

The Ahlul Sunnah Fatwa that praying behind Ahlul
Hadith makes it haram to have sex with your wife
Ellahi quoting "Fatawi Razooba, Volume 4 page 121" records this
fatwa:

"Whoever prays behind Ahl'ul Hadith can't have sex with his wife
(after)".

al Barelviyaath page 176 al Bab al Rabay, by Ehsan Ellahi quoting
Fatawi Razooba, Volume 4 page 121

The Ahlul Sunnah Fatwa stating that if you touch
Ahlul Hadith you should perform Wudhu again
On the same page quoting Fatawi Razooba Vol 1 page 209, Ellahi
quotes:

When touching an adherent of Ahlul Hadith its better that they make
Wudhu again".

al Barelviyaath page 176 al Bab al Rabay, by Ehsan Ellahi quoting
Fatawi Razooba, Volume 4 page 176

Ahlul Islam Fatwa that Deobandi books

should be spat and urinated on

Ellahi quotes this verdict in al Barelviyaath page 183

"Deobandis books should be spat upon and urinated on"

al Barelviyaath page 176 al Bab al Rabay, by Ehsan Ellahi quoting
Fatawi Razooba, Volume 4 page 183

In the eyes of Sunnis their books are just toilet paper.

**Sunni Fatwa that Shah Ismail Shaheed was a Kaafir**

In Fitnah Wahabiyaath page 36 Haji Nawabadeen and Maulvi Fazl Haq Sahib
Khayr Abadi, quote one of the previous books, in which they have stated:
The kufr of Ismail has been proven by the Ulema quoting Mufti Azam
Allamah Shah FuzulAllah Badhyawni (ra) 10 13 Hijri Fitnah Wahabiyaath
page 36 Haji Nawabadeen and Maulvi Fazl Haq Sahib Khayr Abadi, in their
commentary "Tahqeeq al Fatawi Fi Abthal at Thaqhi Kamal Sharra wa
basath" - pages 18-20

**Sunni Fatwa that it's a duty to kill Shah Ismail**

In the same book, Haji Nawabadeen answering question 2 writes:

"Ismail Dehlavi according the Sharia is a Kaffir and his killing is a
duty. Whoever doubts his Kufr is also kaffir and cursed". Haji
Nawabadeen and Maulvi Fazl Haq Sahib Khayr Abadi, in their commentary
"Tahqeeq al Fatawi Fi Abthal at Thaqhi Kamal Sharra wa basath" - page 20
Sunni Fatwa that the Imam of Ahlul Hadith Nadheer Dehlavi was a Kaffir
In "al Barelviyaath" Ehsan Ellahi quotes this fatwa:

For a Muslim it is a must that the people know that Nadheer Hussain
Dehlavi was a kaffir and denounced his Faith his book Miyhar ul Haqq is
kufr and is more impure than urine" "al Barelviyaath" page 174, Chapter
"Al Rahbeh" by Ehsan Ellahi Sunni Fatwa that Ashraf Ali Thanvi was a
Kaafir In the Pakistani Political Party 'The Muslim Leagues book'
"Private Matter of the Muslim League" the author Muhammad Miyaar Qadri
writes: "The scholars of Ahl'ul Sunnah and the Ulema of Ka'ba, Arabs and
non Arabs have a united Fatwa that Ashraf Ali Thanvi is kaafir whoever
doubts this is also a kaafir".

"Private Matters of the Muslim League" page 7 by Muhammad Miyaar
Qadri

Sunni Fatwa that Rashid Ahmad Gangohi was a Kaafir Ellahi records this
fatwa against his beloved Nasibi Imam / lover of Yazid, Rashid Ahmad
Gangohi: Rashid Ahmad Gangohi was a kaffir whoever doubts this is also a
kaffir, his book is more impure than the urine". al Barelviyaath page
188 Chapter al Rahbeh, by Ehsan Ellahi

How Allamah Rashid Ahmad Gangohi is
remembered by the Sunni Ulema
In Tahjanib Ahl' ul Sunnah page 10

Kaffaran (Followers) ai Gangohi and their Leader Iblis

Those who have became kaffirs on the basis of their hatred of the
Prophet

**Fatwa by three hundred Sunni Ulema declaring that the Deobandis are
Kaffirs**

The Deobandis love collecting kufr fatwas of their beloved Imams on the
Shia. Interestingly they should carefully look at a unanimous fatwa by
not one, not two but by an astounding three hundred Sunni Ulema
declaring that they are kaffirs. The fatwa was published by Muhammad
Ibrahim of Bhagalpur, under the title the Unanimous Fatwa of Three
Hundred Ulama.

"The Deobandis, because of their contempt and insult, in their acts of
worship, towards all saints, prophets, and even the Holy Prophet
Muhammad and the very Person of God Himself, are definitely murtad and
kafir. Their apostasy and heresy is of the worst kind, so that anyone
who doubts their apostasy and heresy even slightly is himself a murtad
and kafir.

Muslims should be very cautious of them, and stay away from them. Let
alone praying behind them, one should not let them pray behind one, or
allow them into mosques, or eat the animal slaughtered by them, or join
them on happy or sad occasions, or let them come near one, or visit them
in illness, or attend their funerals, or give them space in Muslim
graveyards. To sum up, one must stay away from them completely."

Read this Nasibis and weep!
