A Description of the Hypocrite
==============================

The hypocrite is content to be far from the mercy of Allah, because his
outward actions appear to be in line with Islamic laws; and yet he is
heedless and ineffective, mocking and transgressing its truthfulness in
his heart.

The mark of hypocrisy is disregard for lies, treachery, insolence,
false claims, insincerity, foolishness, error and lack of modesty,
making little of acts of disobedience, desiring believers to lose faith,
and making light of misfortunes in the faith; pride, praise, praise of
love, love of praise, envy, preferring this world to the next and evil
to good, inciting slander, love of amusement, dealing with
prevaricators, helping aggressive people avoiding good deeds,
disparaging those who do good, considering good the evil done by the
hypocrite and recognizing as odious whatever good another person does;
and many other things like that.

Allah has described the hypocrites in more than one place. He said,


<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ عَلَى حَرْفٍ فَإِنْ أَصَابَهُ
خَيْرٌ اطْمَأَنَّ بِهِ وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ انقَلَبَ عَلَى
وَجْهِهِ خَسِرَ الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةَ ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْخُسْرَانُ
الْمُبِينُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And among men is he who serves Allah [standing] on the verge. So that
if good befalls him he is satisfied therewith, but if a trial afflicts
him he turns back headlong; he loses this world as well*** ***as the
next; that is a manifest loss.*** (22:11)


In describing them, Allah said,

>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ آمَنَّا بِاللّهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الآخِرِ
وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ. يُخَادِعُونَ اللّهَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَمَا
يَخْدَعُونَ إِلاَّ أَنفُسَهُم وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ. فِي قُلُوبِهِم
مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَهُمُ اللّهُ مَرَضاً وَلَهُم عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا
كَانُوا يَكْذِبُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***There are some people who say, "We believe in Allah and the Last
Day", but they are not at all believers. They desire to deceive Allah
and those who believe, but they deceive only themselves while they do
not perceive. There is a disease in their hearts, so Allah added to
their disease.*** (2:8-10)


The Holy Prophet said, 'The hypocrite is he who, having made a promise,
breaks it; when he acts, he does evil; when he speaks, he lies; when he
is trusted, he betrays; when he is given provision, he is reckless; when
it is withheld, he makes much of his life.'

He also said, 'A person whose innermost being contradicts his public
face is a hypocrite whoever he is, wherever he is, in whatever time he
lives, and whatever rank he has.'
