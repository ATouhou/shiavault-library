53: the Star (najm)
===================

This chapter was revealed after Sincerity (or [God's] Oneness) 112, and
before He Frowned! 80. It consists of three sections !0ntalning a total
of 62 early Meccan verses, except for v. 32 which dates from Madina. The
star referred to is variously stated to be either the morning and
evening star which is called Venus in Western terminology, or else the
dogstar or Sirius mentioned in iii, or perhaps the cluster of the
Pleiades.

This chapter too is mystical and soaring in spirit, for it concerns the
Mi'raj! or Ascension of the Prophet which is also described at the
beginning of The Night Journey 17 (I). The first section announces
Muhammad's call to prophethood and explains how intercession is of no
avail; while the second emphasizes that God is Just. The complete vision
is superb and should be studied carefully for inspiration.
