Bahlool and Haroun Rashid Go to the Public Bath
===============================================

One day Haroun Rashid went to the hot bath with Bahlool. The Khalifa
jokingly asked, “If I am a slave then what would be my cost?”

Bahlool said, “Fifty dinars.”

The Khalifa angrily said, “Lunatic! The low skirt that I am wearing is
just fifty dinars.”

“I only gave the cost of the skirt because the Khalifa has no value.”
