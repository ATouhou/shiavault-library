29. The Point of Unbelief
=========================

**The Point of Unbelief (*****Haddu’t -Takfir*****)** [^1]

Thus, it is not possible to maintain that he who is an unbe- liever can
know Allah, or that he who believes in Him can be ignorant of Him.
According to our principles, he who is an infidel is also ignorant of
Allah. Consequently, he who, though he be among the community of Islam,
deviates from the principles of the faith, is, in our opinion, ignorant
of Allah, the Exalted, even if he professes the Unity of Allah.

As is also the case with those who do not believe in the Messenger of
Allah, even though there are amongst them some who profess the Unity of
Allah and behave in a fashion which might delude the weak into
(believing) that they know Allah. Allah, the Almighty, says:

***And whosoever believes in his Lord, he shall fear neither loss nor
wrong [72:13];***

thereby He excludes the believers from the decrees binding on the
infidels. Also, Allah, the Almighty, says:

***But no, by thy Lord! They will not believe till they make thee the
judge regarding the disagreement between them [4:65].***

Thus, He denied faith to those who believe not in the Messenger of Allah
and because of their reservation in this matter, their knowledge of
Allah cannot be accepted. He, the Almighty, the Exalted, says:

***Fight those who believe not in Allah and the Last Day . . . and they
are in a state of subjection [9:29],***

Whereby He denied faith to the Jews and the Christians, and relegated
them to unbelief and error.

[^1]: Hadd: Literally means to restrain from, al-man‘. In jurisprudence
it means the restrictive ordinances of the religious law of Islam. See
al-Jurjani, at-Ta‘rifat, p.57; Ibn Manzur, op. cit., vol.3, p.142.
