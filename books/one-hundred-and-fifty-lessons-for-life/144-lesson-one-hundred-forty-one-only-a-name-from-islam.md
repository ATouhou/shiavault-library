Lesson One Hundred Forty One: Only A Name From Islam
====================================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَاْتِى عَلَى النّاسِ زَمانٌ لا يَبْقى فِيهِمْ مِنَ الْقُرآنِ اِلاّ
رَسْمُهُ وَ مِنَ الاِسْلامِ اِلاّ اِسْمُهُ، مَساجِدُهُم، يَوْمَئِذ
عامَرَةٌ مِنَ البِناءِ، خَرابٌ مِنَ الْهُدى
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

A day will come for people when only letters and drawings from the Holy
Qur’an and Islam in name only will remain among them. Muslims' mosques
will be improved in building structure and ruined as regards the
guidance they provide. [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

We cannot say whether this interesting prediction has already
materialized fully in this present time or is yet to happen in future.
But surely we are witnessing some examples of it here and there. It is
surprising that in such cases the Muslims complain about their
backwardness when they themselves have caused it by their mistaken
notion that it is sufficient to adopt Muslim names and pay a nominal lip
service to Islam, and that Qur’an is there only for decorative purposes.

They have not accepted Qur’an’s real role as a “book” of unbeatable
value for education , training and application in day to day life. Nor
have they accepted Islam as a “school” that must engage and permeate
their practical and intellectual lives. Can you find a real Islamic
society (which follows Islam in substance , not just in form), which has
been backward or has not enjoyed an honorable status in the world ?
