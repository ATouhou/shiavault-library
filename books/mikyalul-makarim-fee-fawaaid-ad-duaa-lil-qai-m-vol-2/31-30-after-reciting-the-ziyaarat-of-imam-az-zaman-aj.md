30. After Reciting The Ziyaarat Of Imam az-Zaman (Aj)
=====================================================

This has been emphasized by the great Shaheed-e-Awwal, Muhammad Ibne
Makki (a.r.), in his al-Duroos.

I say: That which supports this point is the supplication that is to be
recited after the Ziarats of His Eminence, each of which will be
mentioned in Part Eight, Insha Allah.

Also that which proves this is the intellect and reason, because it is
an accepted convention that when we are in the presence of great
personalities we must pray for them. Therefore it is appropriate that
one should be aware of the convention when one is reciting the Ziarat of
Imam (as). And one must not be negligent of this matter. In addition to
this, such a course of action brings us closer to him and it is what he
expects from us as proved from the Epistle in which he is reported to
have said: And pray more for the reappearance, as in it lies your
success.
