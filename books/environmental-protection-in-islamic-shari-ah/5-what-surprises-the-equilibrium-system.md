What Surprises the Equilibrium System?
======================================

“The following fact is a clear example of an important criterion with
regard to man’s existence. Some few years back, a type of cactus was
planted in Australia and, in no time, this plant covered a large tract
of land to the extent that it disturbed the whole community and their
farming activities. All efforts to prevent the spread of this plant
proved fruitless, and Australia continued to be plagued by this plant.

Consequently, research conducted by some entomologist found that an
insect, which cannot live without this cactus, reproduces rapidly,
unhindered in the whole of Australia. In no time, this insect invaded
and destroyed the cactus.

Therefore, this is how this criterion and balance was changed.”7
