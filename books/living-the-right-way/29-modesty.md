Modesty
=======

Appropriate modesty is a morality encouraged by religion.

The Holy Prophet Muhammad (S) said: *“May Allah bestow His mercy on him
who is modest to the Lord as he must be, who keeps both his mind and
stomach safe from sin, who remembers his being worn out in his grave,
and who reminds himself of his being raised in the hereafter.”*

He (S) also said: *“Modesty is of two kinds: The modesty of wisdom which
brings knowledge and the modesty of foolishness which brings
ignorance.”*

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) the Commander of the Faithful said: *“Impudence is the
head of all evils.”*

Imam ‘Ali Zayn al-’Abidin (a.s.) said: *“A believer does not do any good
thing to be seen, nor does he give it up for modesty.”*

Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (a.s.) said: *“Modesty and faith are tied up
together; they are always to be found together.”*

Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (a.s.) said: *“Modesty is a sign of faith; and
faith takes you to paradise.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“There is no faith for him who has no modesty.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“The head of morality is modesty.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“Do not abstain from learning because of
modesty.”*

Imam Musa al-Kazim (a.s.) said: *“Surely Allah has forbidden paradise to
him who is impudent and abusive, who has no modesty, who cares neither
about what he says nor about what is said on him.”*
