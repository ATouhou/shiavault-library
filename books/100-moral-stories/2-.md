THE TRAVELERS AND THE PLANE TREE
Two men were walking along one summer day. Soon it

became too hot to go any further and, seeing a large

plane tree nearby, they threw themselves on the

ground to rest in its shade.

Gazing up into the branches one man said to the other:

“What a useless tree this is. It does not have fruit or

nuts that we can eat and we cannot even use its

wood for anything.”

“Don’t be so ungrateful,” rustled the tree in reply.

“I am being extremely useful to you at this very

moment, shielding you from the hot sun.

And you call me a good-for-nothing!”

All of God’s creations have a good purpose.

Islam teaches us that we should never belittle Allah’s blessings.

LEARN FROM MISTAKES

Thomas Edison tried two thousand different materials in search of a
filament for

the light bulb. When none worked satisfactorily, his assistant
complained,

“All our work is in vain. We have learned nothing.”

Edison replied very confidently, “Oh, we have come a long way and we
have

learned a lot. We now know that there are two thousand elements which we

cannot use to make a good light bulb.”
