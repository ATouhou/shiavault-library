Foreword
========

It seems a long time since the Mission published the first two
collections of its Bedtime Stories. We were, therefore, glad when Haji
Mohamedtaki N. Rajwani brought to us these nine stories written by his
(then unmarried) daughter, Zishaane Fatima.

However, what with one snag or the other, further four years have
passed before this third collection could be sent to the press, in this
year of Al-Ghadir's 14th century. In the last ten to fifteen years, an
appreciable literary taste has developed in the youths of the
community.

Boys and girls are trying their hands at pen-manship, as is evident
from various regular and not-so-regular youths' magazines like the
Knowledge, the Scholar, and the Awaited (all from Dar es Salaam) and
Al-Qa'im (from Nairobi). We hope that from among them some talented
writers will come up to sincerely serve the cause of religion.
