**In the name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful**

Our greatest treasures of knowledge after the Holy Qur’an are the
practices of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) and the
valuable traditions of the household of the Prophet(peace be upon him
and his progeny).

Unfortunately, these traditions which are without dispute oceans of
science and knowledge are yet to be well known. There are many
traditions that in one short phrase speak volumes in terms of useful
lessons which can solve many problems that we face today as a society.
This book is a selection of such powerful and meaningful traditions
together with a translation and a brief description.

It all started with the Friday weekly interpretation discussion meetings
of the Assembly of Religion and Science inside the Imam Husayn Masjid in
Tehran. A tradition was selected and everyone was to practice it
throughout the week as a lesson. The traditions were so well received
that it was decided to publish them.

This small book serves as an example of Islam’s attributes for those who
want to know Islam better through a short study. What is even more
important in appreciating their worth is the practicing of these
programs in our lives. Let us pray to God for success in understanding
these traditions and then for being able to act on them.
