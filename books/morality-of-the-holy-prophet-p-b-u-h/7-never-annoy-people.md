Never Annoy People
==================

It is reported that One day, the Holy Prophet had fever and that day
was the turn of being in Hafsah’s house. On that day, \`A’ishah cooked
barley soup for the Holy Prophet and a slave-girl took the pot to
Hafsah’s house.

At the door, Hafsah said, “What is this?” The slave-girl said, “This is
barley soup \`A’ishah has cooked for Allah’s Messenger.” Hafsah was very
disturbed to hear this, saying, “\`A’ishah has infringed my right. Can’t
I cook barley soup? Is my love for the Holy Prophet less than hers?”
Then she took the pot from the slave-girl and threw it down so the pot
broke and the barley soup spilled on the earth.

The Holy Prophet took a piece of the pot in which there was a little
soup and ate it saying to the slave-girl, “If \`A’ishah asks you whether
the Prophet ate from it, say yes and do not tell her what you have seen
or heard here so that there will be no cause of annoyance between
them.”

It was after this event that the following verse was revealed,

وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلى خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ (4)

And most surely you conform yourself to sublime morality. (68:4)

**Nobility**

It is reported that when Mecca was conquered, \`Ikrimah, son of
Abu-Jahl, escaped to Yemen. When he was informed that Allah’s Messenger
would not blame anyone for his past faults and would not take him to
task, he returned to Mecca and to the Sacred Mosque. Seeing him, the
Holy Prophet rose up, spread his cloak for him and kissed him between
the eyes. \`Ikrimah said, “I loved the Holy Prophet more than myself, my
father, and my son.” \`Ikrimah became Muslim. He truly believed in Islam
and was martyred in one of the battles.[^25]

**Asking For Fair Price**

A Bedouin came to the Holy Prophet saying, “I have several camels for
sale but I have no idea of their price in the market of Medina. I am
afraid of being deceived by buyers. Would you come to the market with me
giving your knowledge in this field?” The Holy Prophet said, “Bring the
camels to me and present them one by one.” He did so and the Holy
Prophet priced them each.

The Bedouin went to the market and sold the camels for the price the
Holy Prophet had said. Coming back, he said, “You guided me and I made a
huge profit. Now accept something from me and take of this money
whatever you wish.” The Holy Prophet said, “I expect nothing.” The
Bedouin said, “Accept a gift from me.” The Holy Prophet said, “I am not
in need of anything.” The Bedouin insisted. The Holy Prophet said, “Now
that you insist, bring me a female camel which gives milk provided that
you have not separated it from her young.[^26]

**Gathering Wood For Making Fire**

The Holy Prophet and his companions were on a journey. When they
alighted in a place, the Holy Prophet ordered them to slaughter a sheep.
One of them said, “I will slaughter it.” The second said, “I will skin
it.” The third said, “I will cook it.” The Holy Prophet said, “I will
gather wood for making fire.” The companions said, “O Allah’s Messenger!
Take no pains! We will gather wood for fire.” The Holy Prophet said, “I
know you would; but Allah hates to see His servant enjoy a state of
privilege among his friends and companions and distinguish between
himself and the others.”[^27]

**A Gracious Generosity**

It is reported that the Holy Prophet and Jabir ibn \`Abdullah were
riding a camel belonging to the latter. Allah’s Messenger asked him to
sell him the camel. Jabir said, “My father and mother are at you
disposal! It is yours.” The Holy Prophet told Bilal to give the money to
Jabir. Jabir said, “O Allah’s Messenger! To whom should I entrust the
camel?” The Holy Prophet said, “May you enjoy the camel and its price
and may Allah bless this transaction.”[^28]
