Messenger of Allah Arrives At Medina
====================================

When the news of the Messenger's exodus from Mecca to Medina reached
the Muslims in Medina, they began to go every morning to the lava fields
and wait there until the heat of noon drove them back. Many days they
waited until one day when they had returned to their houses it so
happened that a Jewish man was looking out from his fortress when he saw
the Prophet shimmering in the haze. No sooner had he sighted him than he
hailed the Muslims at the top of his voice saying:

'O Muslims, here is your Master whom you await!'

The Muslims immediately rushed to meet the Messenger of Allah on the
crest of the lava fields. He then kept going until they had reached
Qubaa where he stopped with the clan of Amr ibn Awf. The Muslims hailed
'Allahu Akbar' (God is Greatest) with joy at his arrival. The Prophet
stopped at Qubaa for three days awaiting the arrival of Ali. He did not
want to enter the Medina without Ali.

The Prophet remained with Ali with the clan of Amr ibn Awf for a day or
two. During his stay in Qubaa he established the mosque of Qubaa, and
thus it was the first ever established in Muslim era.

And on the Friday, the Prophet entered the Qubaa mosque and led the
Muslims in the Friday prayers and gave a sermon. And this was the first
Friday sermon ever given. The Prophet prayed in the direction of
Jerusalem and one hundred men prayed behind him. After performing the
prayers, the Prophet mounted his camel, along with Ali who never left
his side, and the rest of Muslims and headed towards Medina.

Once in Medina, Muslim families invited the Messenger of Allah to stay
with them. In order not to turn down the request of any one of them, the
Prophet decided that he would stay with the family that his she-camel
would stop by their house. He said: 'Let her be for she is being
ordered.' The camel kept on walking until she reached the door of the
house of Abu Ayyub, who happened to be amongst the poorest in Medina.

Then Abu Ayyub hurried to the Prophet's baggage and took it into his
house. Abu Ayyub's mother, who was blind, said: 'O if only I had sight
so that I could see my master the Messenger of Allah!' The Prophet
Muhammad then called to Allah for her and her eyes opened. This was the
first of his miracles in Medina.

It is said that when the Messenger of Allah entered Medina, it was the
most joyous occasion ever witnessed by the people. One eyewitness said:
'I saw the day when he entered Medina and I have never seen a brighter
or better day than that day. And I saw the day he died and I have never
seen a worse or darker day than the day on which he died.'

**First Muslim Community**

With a significant number of those who embraced Islam migrating from
Mecca to Medina, as well as the majority of the native Medinans, it
could be said that the first Muslim community began to take shape in the
city of Medina, under the guidance of the Prophet. Through his
teachings, the Messenger of Allah brought about harmony and peace
between the different rivalries and warring groups and tribes of the
city and its surroundings. Whereas prior to his arrival, greed, enmity
and wars prevailed between the inhabitants, in a short space of time the
Prophet managed to sow the seeds of a peaceful cohesive order to the
extent that they shared everything they had amongst themselves and with
the Muslim migrants from Mecca despite their poverty. With the city of
Medina being some 400 km north of Mecca, some of the Muslims considered
it to be a reasonably safe distance from the Quraysh who were mostly in
Mecca.

However, the Quraysh and their allies did not relent, and they forced
the Muslims of Medina into a number of battles and skirmishes. These
were usually unequal, especially at the early days, with the Quraysh and
their allies being superior in number and armour. For example at the
battle of Badr, which was one of the early clashes between the two
sides, the Muslims combatants were 313 men, who had seventy camels and
two horses, while their opponents were about one thousand, had seven
hundred camels and one hundred horses.

Peace between the two sides was eventually brought about through the
peace treaty of Hodaybiyah - signed in the eleventh month of the sixth
year after Hijrah - which was highly biased in favour of the Quraysh and
their allies, to the extent that some of the companions of the Prophet
protested to him for agreeing and signing a treaty that was 'unfair and
unacceptable'. However, subsequent events after the Hodaybiyah were
pointedly in the interest of the Muslims, which in turn exonerated the
Prophet's judgement and decision, and proved his wisdom and
farsightedness.

**Mecca Liberated**

Less than two years after the treaty of Hodaybiyah, Quraysh grew
impatient with the environment of peace and security that reigned in the
land. Muslim losses in the battle of Mu'tah in north Arabia - in today's
Jordan - encouraged the Quraysh to stir up unrest in the land and break
the treaty that they had signed with the Messenger of Allah at
Hodaybiyah. They began to distribute weapons to their allies and urged
them to attack the allies of the Muslims at night, in breach of the
peace treaty they had with the Muslims.

The Messenger of Allah left Medina on a Friday in the month of Ramadan
in the eighth year of the Hijrah. He took with him all the Muslim troops
which numbered ten thousand and nearly four hundred horsemen. Then the
Messenger of Allah proceeded until he arrived at Marr al-Dhahran, the
heights of Mecca, in the evening. He ordered his companions to light
more than ten thousand fires. News of his progress had been kept hidden
from the Quraysh who were concerned and feared that he might attack
them.

It is reported that Abu Sufyan, the Prophet's archenemy, was saying: 'I
have never seen such fires as last night nor such a camp.' He said:
'What is the news and what are all these fires?'

The narrator responded to him: 'The news is that the Messenger of Allah
has arrived here. He has come with a force you cannot resist; with ten
thousand of the Muslims.'

Abu Sufyan said: 'What is to be done?' I said: 'By Allah, if he defeats
you he will surely strike your head off so ride this donkey with me so
that I can take you to the Messenger of Allah and I will ask him for an
amnesty for you.' So he rode behind me.

It is related that Ali ibn Abu Talib said to Abu Sufyan ibn al- Harith:
'Go to the Messenger of Allah and say to him what Joseph's brothers said
to Joseph: e By Allah, Allah has preferred you over us and we have
certainly been sinful f6 Then the Messenger of Allah said in answer to
him and seeking to best him in speech: e He said: Let there be no
reproach upon you this day. Allah will forgive you and he is the Most
Merciful of those who show mercy f7

6 The Holy Qur'an: Joseph (12): 91.
7 The Holy Qur'an: Joseph (12): 92.

The banner of the Muslims was with Sa'ad ibn 'Ibadah and when he passed
by Abu Sufyan he said to him: 'Today is the day of slaughter, today the
women will be captured'. Abu Sufyan heard him and kept it to himself
until the Messenger of Allah passed by him when he said: 'Do you know
what Sa'ad ibn 'Ibadah has said?'

The Messenger of Allah said: 'What he has said is of no consequence.'
Then he sent someone to Sa'ad and took the banner from him and passed it
to Ali and said: 'Enter with kindness.' Ali took the banner and began to
proclaim: 'Today is the day of mercy, today honour will be protected.'
Then the Messenger of Allah turned to Abu Sufyan and said to him: 'O Abu
Sufyan, proceed to Mecca and let them know of the sanctuary.'

When the Messenger of Allah entered Mecca, a tent was pitched for him
by the grave of his uncle Abu Talib. He refused to enter his house or
the houses of his companions in Mecca that had been confiscated by the
Polytheists.

Then the Messenger of Allah, after having rested a little in his tent,
bathed and mounted his camel and set out for the sacred mosque. The
Muslims were before him and behind him and all around him and they were
repeating along with the Messenger of Allah the words of Allah Almighty:
e The truth has come and falsehood has perished, indeed falsehood is (by
nature) perishing f8

Mecca resounded with the sound of their voices until he entered the
sacred mosque and approached the black stone at the corner of the
Ka'bah, and kissed it. Then he circled the House upon his camel and with
a bow in his hand. Around the 8 The Holy Qur'an: The Tribe of Israel
(17): 81.

House there were some three-hundred and sixty idols and he began to
stab at them with his bow saying: e The truth has come and falsehood has
perished, indeed falsehood is perishing f and e The truth has come and
falsehood will not revive again and will not return f9 while the idols
fell upon their faces. Then he raised Ali upon his shoulders so that he
could bring down the rest of the idols which were upon the Ka'bah.

And thus a whole era of idol worshipping in Arabia was brought to an
irreversible end, and Mecca was liberated. The conquest of the Capital
City of the idolaters and the liberation of the holy city of Mecca at
the hands of Prophet Muhammad took place without bloodshed.

But the Prophet never again took his birth city, Mecca, as his abode.
The Prophet only stayed in the city for fifteen days to manage its
affairs. When he left the city of Mecca for Medina, he appointed Etab
ibn Osayd, 21 years of age, as the city's governor.

**Ideal Islamic Order**

From early days, the Prophet gradually established an Islamic system of
governance and a way of life. In its first years, the nascent Muslim
community in Medina had to contend with a number of attacks and
onslaughts by the Quraysh and their allies. The Prophet used every
opportunity to teach the Muslims the right code of conduct for a Muslim
in times of war and peace; from personal and ethical qualities they must
aspire to, to social, political and fiscal policies.

9 The Holy Qur'an: Sheba (34): 49.

On the political front, the Prophet enjoined the community to avoid
wars and violence as far as possible, and it should only be the absolute
last resort, when all other avenues have been exhausted. The Prophet
Muhammad went out of his way to avoid conflict and violence, and it is
recorded that in the ten years that the Prophet was in Medina and
despite the many battles that the Muslims were drawn into, a total of
some 800 were killed on both sides throughout the period. The Prophet
instructed his army against destroying houses or pillaging or cutting
down fruiting trees. He ordered them not to draw their swords except in
dire need. He used to rebuke some of his generals and physically put
right their mistakes.

Another social-political principle instilled by the Prophet Muhammad
was that "Land belongs to Allah and whoever develops it" 10. This had a
very significant impact on the development of the country both socially
and politically, not to mention the economic progress and revival it
entailed.

Another socio-economic policy was established by the Prophet's
declaration "I am responsible for them" 11. He who dies and leaves
family who do not have enough to make ends meet, then the Prophet would
be responsible for them and they should go to him. On the other hand,
"he who dies and leaves a wealth behind, it is for his heirs" 12. All
that wealth is for the family he leaves behind, i.e. no inheritance tax
in Islam. But this policy did not stop there, and it went further when
the Prophet announced that if a person dies and leaves a debt behind,
then he [Muhammad, and subsequently

the leader of the Islamic state in general] is responsible for paying
it 13.

The Prophetic legislation also addressed the interest of the
non-Muslims living under the Islamic state, referred to as dhimmy;
literally means "the responsibility of" [the Islamic state]: "He who
hurts a dhimmy, then indeed he has hurt me" 14. Such laws, and the
peaceful liberation of Mecca, encouraged many to come and live under the
Islamic State, for there was at least economic and security guarantees
for them and their families, present and future. People started to
embrace Islam as a way of life en masse. Thus came the divine
revelation:

\>By the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful, When came
Allah's succour and the conquest, And thou saw the peoples entering into
the religion of Allah in troops - So glorify the praise of thy Lord and
seek His forgiveness, indeed He is relenting.@ 15


**The Two Momentous Things**

In the holy city of Medina, Messenger of Allah ensured that he
addresses the two most vital issues during his lifetime, for these
should be the sanctuary, guide and leader for the Muslims after his
departure from this life. These were the compilation of the Holy Qur'an
as a bound copy, and the appointment of his successors to lead the
nation after him, both of which he did on direct instructions from the
Almighty.

13 al-Kafi, by al-Kulayni, vol. 1, p 407.
14 Bihar al-Anwar, by al-Majlesi, vol. 22, p 486.
15 The Holy Qur'an: The Succour (110)

**The Holy Qur'an**

The Prophet ensured arrangements be made to compile a 'bound' copy of
the Holy Qur'an - known at the time of the holy Prophet, and also today,
as the mus}h}af. The Messenger of Allah commissioned Ali son of
Abu-Talib to gather and compile the entire Qur'an, which Imam Ali did
during the lifetime of the holy Prophet and under his supervision16. The
Messenger of Allah validated and authenticated the end result - the
mus}h}af - even verifying the order and position of the individual
verses within a given chapter or surah, as instructed by the Almighty.
According to traditions, when archangel Gabriel used to reveal a
particular ayah or verse to the Prophet, the former would also indicate
its position within the surah or chapter of the Qur'an and the surah it
belonged to.17

Reports state that during the lifetime of the Prophet, when the entire
text of the Holy Qur'an was committed to writing and it had been
compiled as mus}h}af, people used to come to the mosque of the Prophet,
where the compiled Qur'an - the mus}h}af - was kept by the pulpit, to
make their copies of the Holy Scripture.18

It is sometimes stated, through a minor misunderstanding, that the Holy
Qur'an was first compiled during the reign of the third ruler Othman ibn
Affaan, some twenty years after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. The
root of this misunderstanding stems from the incorrect assumption of the
meaning of the Arabic word jamc that means 'to collect', but

16 Bihar al-Anwar, by al-Majlesi, vol. 89, p 48, Beirut ed.
See also "The Qur'an: When was it compiled?" by the author.
17 ibid

18 ibid
instead it is taken to mean 'to compile'. What was in fact commissioned
at that time was to collect the incomplete documents holding some verses
or chapters of the Holy Qur'an and to complete them as copies of the
entire Qur'an. Any compilation that took place during this time was to
reproduce the authentic copy of the Holy Qur'an as per the version
compiled by Imam Ali during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad and
under his supervision.

**The Ahl al-Bayt**

The other fundamental and vital task that the Prophet had to secure
during his lifetime was to address the question of his successorship. On
instructions from the Almighty, the Messenger of Allah named and
appointed the successors who must lead the Muslim community after him
according to the teachings of the Holy Qur'an and the Messenger of
Allah. The Prophet Muhammad used numerous occasions to instruct the
people to follow and adhere to his twelve appointed successors,
'Caliphs' or 'Imams', the first of whom was Imam Ali son of Abu Talib,
and the twelfth is the living Imam Mahdi, who is hidden from public
view19 until such a time when the Almighty instructs him to reappear in
public "to lead the nations of this world from tyranny and oppression to
tranquillity and bliss". [The Prophet Muhammad, his daughter Fatimah,
his cousin and son-in-law Imam Ali and the eleven impeccable Imams
descendents of Ali and Fatimah form Ahl al-Bayt as referred to in the
holy Qur'an 33:33.]

In 630CE, seventy days before his death, and just after performing the
farewell Hajj pilgrimage, on instructions from 19 Imam Mahdi lives
amongst the public but without being recognised by them. However, as and
when required, he would make himself recognisable to those who are
sincerely pious and devout.

the Almighty, at the location of Ghadir Khum, the Prophet appointed Ali
as his successor and ordered the Muslims who were present there to pay
Ali homage of allegiance as The Commander of the Faithful, and their
leader after the Prophet. The revelation from the Almighty on this day
in this particular respect was:

\>O Messenger! Convey that that has been revealed to thee from thy
Lord, and if thee do not, then thee would have not conveyed His Message;
and Allah will protect thee from the people. Surely Allah guides not the
disbelieving people.@20 After the revelation of the above instruction,
the Messenger of Allah declared:

"Whoever I am his master and leader, then Ali is his master and leader
too. O Lord support whoever supports Ali, and oppose whoever opposes
him." 21 "Ali is my caliph and successor upon ye after me." 22

Some chroniclers put the number of those present at Ghadir Khum who
gave the homage of allegiance to Imam Ali as the Commander of the
Faithful and the successor of the Prophet Muhammad at up to 120,000 men
and women.

To confirm and conclude this momentous event, the Almighty then
revealed: \>Today I have perfected your religion for ye, completed My
favour upon ye and have sanctioned Islam for ye as a religion.@ 23 In
order to reveal the station of his successors present and future, the
Prophet frequently used to refer the Muslims to the Ahl al-Bayt - at the
time notably Ali - for they were the most knowledgeable about the
teachings of the Qur'an and the Prophet himself. To clarify any possible
doubt about his immediate successor, in the famous tradition of "City of
Knowledge", the final Messenger of Allah states:

"I am the City of Knowledge and Ali is its Gate, so whosoever wishes to
access this City, then let him do so through its Gate." 24 According to
many Prophetic teachings and traditions the Holy Qur'an and the Ahl
al-Bayt are considered as the two inseparable and complementary
components of the divine

message. Towards the end of his life, the Messenger of Allah often used
to say:

"I leave with ye the two momentous things - the book of Allah and my
kin the people of my Ahl al-Bayt. As long as ye adhere to them both ye
will never go astray after me."25

However, after the death of the Prophet Muhammad, the people did not
honour their pledge of allegiance that they had given at the time of the
Prophet to the successor he appointed on instructions from the Almighty.
After several failed attempts on his life, and by various means, the
culprits eventually succeeded in assassinating the Prophet Muhammad -
this time through poisoning. The final Messenger of Allah to humanity
died on the 28th day of the lunar month of Safar in the 11th year of the
Hijrah, 630CE.

The Prophet Muhammad brought about a nation and a civilisation that in
a relatively very short space of time won the prime position amongst all
other nations. The Muslims attained such achievement so long as they
adhered to the 25 Sahih al-Tirmidhi, vol. 5, p328, hadith 3874 & 3876,

teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. Today although the Muslims are
numerous, they do not occupy the eminent station amongst the nations
anymore, for they did not adhere to "the two momentous things" that the
Prophet Muhammad left behind for them. The Muslim nation may still be a
candidate to lead mankind to bliss and prosperity if they ensure to
adhere to the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and his successors.
