The Episode of Harrah
=====================

It is pertinent here to allude to the episode of Harrah. Muslim ibn
Aqaba attacked Medina in 64 H., creating more horror and terror and
causing total isolation of the Progeny of Prophet Muhammad (S). The
Harrah incident occurred when Yazid in 62 H. appointed an inexperienced
young general of Damascus (erstwhile Shaam) as the ruler of Medina.

The new ruler decided to reconcile the citizens of the city with Yazid.
Hence, he invited a group of them to go to Yazid in Damascus. They went
to Damascus and met Yazid who paid a large amount of money (50,000 to
10,000 drachmas) to them. Being the Companions of the Prophet
Muhammad(S) or their descendents, they were outraged after witnessing
Yazid's system.

Upon their return to Medina, Abdullah - the son of "Hanzalah
Ghasil-ul-Malaa'ikah" whose body was washed by the angels after his
martyrdom - rose against the central government and announced autonomy
for Medina. Yazid sent Muslim ibn Aqaba to Medina who created one of the
saddest tragedies recorded in the history books. The event added to the
horror and fear of the people.
