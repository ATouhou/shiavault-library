Introduction
============

In more than ten percent of the Qur’anic verses, we see references to
natural phenomena. A subject of fundamental importance is to discover
the kind of message that the so-called scientific verses have for us,
and how we benefit from them. There are two views about this matter.

One view says that the Holy Qur’an includes all kinds of knowledge and
therefore it contains the basic ingredients of all the sciences of
nature. The second holds that the Qur’an is merely a book of guidance,
and there is no room for the physical and natural sciences in it. We
shall, first, explain these two views in some detail and then try to
spell out our own views.
