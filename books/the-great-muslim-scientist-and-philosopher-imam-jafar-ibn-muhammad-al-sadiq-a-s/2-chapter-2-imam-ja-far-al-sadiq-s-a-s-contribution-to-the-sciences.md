Chapter 2: Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq's (A.S) contribution to the sciences
====================================================================

Birth & Early Childhood
-----------------------

Imam Jafar al-Sadiq (A.S) was born in Medina on the 17 of Rabi ul-Awwal
in the year of 82 Hijra. His father was the 5th Imam Mohammed Baqar (a)
and his mother was Umme Farwa. It is said that Jafar al-Sadiq (A.S) was
born circumcised.

Contrary to the Western belief, the Shias firmly believe that Imam Jafar
al-Sadiq (A.S) had Ilm-e-Ladunni or 'God given Knowledge'. The Shias
believe that a man's subconscious mind is quite different from his
conscious mind. It is the treasure house of knowledge of mankind and of
the world. Modern science lends support to this theory. Biological
studies have gradually proved that every group of cells in the human
body knows whatever is knowable from the beginning of the world till
today. The Shias contend that when someone is chosen as a Prophet or as
an Imam, the curtain which hangs between the conscious and subconscious
mind, is lifted and he can make use of the knowledge which is stored in
his subconscious mind.
