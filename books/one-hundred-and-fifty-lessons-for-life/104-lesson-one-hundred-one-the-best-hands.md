Lesson One Hundred One: The Best Hands
======================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَلأيدِى ثَلاثَةٌ: سائَلَةٌ و مُمْسِكَةٌ وَ مُنْفِقَةٌ و خَيْرُ
الأَيْدِىْ مُنْفِقَةٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

There are three types of hands: begging hands, keeping hands and
bountiful hands, and the best hands are bountiful hands.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Islam teaches its followers to aim for high aspirations , far reaching
endeavors and strong affection. Therefore it recommends its followers to
avoid begging and dependency on others as far as they can. Not only
that, it discourages Muslims from hoarding and keeping everything they
have for their own exclusive benefit. Rather, they are urged to share
their bounties with others as much as they can, and so we read in the
above tradition that the best hands are the bountiful hands.
