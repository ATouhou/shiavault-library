Justice
=======

Allah is Just and Judicious in the sense that He does not do anything
obnoxious and does not derange what is obligatory to do because what is
obnoxious is a fault and deranging what is obligatory will be a fault.
Therefore Allah is free from everything obnoxious and from disturbing
anything obligatory.

It is a disputed point whether it is a matter of common sense or a
matter of Islamic law that certain things are right and certain others
are wrong. We hold that it is a matter of common sense that certain
things like justice, truth, honesty and faithfulness are right and
certain things like tyranny, oppression, and transgression are wrong.

The Ashaâ€™irah maintain that it is only a matter of Islamic law in both
cases. Therefore only that which has been described by it as right, is
right and only that which has been described by it as evil, is wrong.
