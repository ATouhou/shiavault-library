  The views of our leading mujtahideen, compiled in this booklet, are
  guidelines for us to follow the example of the Ahlul Bayt (a.s.). In our
  interaction with the fellow Muslims, the question is not about what to
  say and not to say, the question is about how to say it and how not to
  say it.
