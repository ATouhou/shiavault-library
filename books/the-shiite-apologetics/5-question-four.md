Question Four
=============

### Who are the Imams?

Answer:
-------

The holy Prophet made it clear that following him there would be twelve
successors, all from the Quraysh, and that their leadership would bring
glory to Islam. Jabir Ibn Samarah says, I heard the Prophet (a.s) say,
Islam will always be honored under these twelve successors. Then he said
something that I did not quite hear. I asked my father what the prophet
said; he answered, The prophet said that they would all come from the
Quraysh.[1]

In the history of Islam, there can be found no twelve successors
guarding and preserving the honor of Islam except the twelve Imams in
whom the Shiites believe, because it is only the twelve successors
mentioned by the prophet who were all introduced as his immediate
vicegerents.

Now, let us see who these twelve Imams are. If we exclude the four
caliphs immediately following the holy Prophet (whom the Sunnites call
the Rightly Guided Caliphs, the Rashidun, the other caliphs did not
bring any honor to

Islam, as is evident from the history of the Umayyad and the Abbasids.
But the twelve Imams of the Shiites were paragons of virtue and piety in
their own time, and about whose knowledge and trustworthiness historians
have given clear proof were the guardians of the Sunnah of Gods Prophet
and were in the center of attention of the Companions and their
followers as well as of the Muslims of later generations. These twelve
Imams are:

\`Ali Ibn Abi-Talib  
 Hasan Ibn \`Ali (Mujtaba)  
 Husayn Ibn \`Ali  
 \`Ali Ibn Husayn (Zayn al-\`abidin)  
 Muhammad Ibn \`Ali (Baqir)  
 Ja\`far Ibn Muhammad (Sadiq)  
 Musa Ibn Ja\`far (Kazim)  
 \`Ali Ibn Musa (Rida)  
 Muhammad Ibn \`Ali (Taqi)  
 \`Ali Ibn Muhammad (Naqi)  
 Hasan Ibn \`Ali (\`Askari)

Mahdi (Qa'im) about whom successive traditions have been quoted from the
Prophet calling him the promised Mahdi.

To obtain further information about the biography of these great
leaders, whose names have been mentioned by the Holy Prophet (a.s), see
