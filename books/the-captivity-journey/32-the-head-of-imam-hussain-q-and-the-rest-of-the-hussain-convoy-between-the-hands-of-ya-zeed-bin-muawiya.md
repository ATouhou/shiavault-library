The Head of Imam Hussain (Q) and the Rest of the Hussain Convoy between the Hands of Ya-zeed Bin Muawiya
========================================================================================================

Yazeed was overwhelmed with pleasure and delight, and he ordered an
assembly full of nobles, dignitaries and public figures from among the
people of Sham and representatives from other countries and religions,
just like what they did for the head of Goliath. So, it was a very
important assembly internally and externally. Thus, he wanted to present
himself as the victorious king who overpowered his enemy. And when the
captive’s convoy of Ahlu El-Bayt (R) was admitted to him, the people
started congratulating him for his victory.

Imam Baqer (Q) said: "We were brought before Yazeed Bin Muawiya (may God
curse him) after they had killed Hussain, we were twelve children, no
one of us was left without chaining his hands to his neck! And among us
was Ali Bin Al-Hussain…"

Then the head of Imam Hussain (Q) was brought and put between the hands
of Yazeed, so the brat was pleased with his killing, and he started
patting the head with a cane.

While the murderer of Imam Hussain (Q) came to Yazeed and said:

Fill up my bags with gold and silver,

As I have killed the unreachable king!

I killed the son of the best mother and father,

And the best of all, should we speak about parentage.

So, the cursed man said to him: "If you knew he is the best person why
did you kill him?"

He answered: "I wanted the reward!"

So, Yazeed answered him: "Get out of my sight, no reward for you".

This was the only public assembly that Yazeed had gathered the nobles in
it, as there were many private sittings where the head of Imam Hussain
(Q) and Ahlu El-Bayt were presented to Yazeed. Yazeed used to attend the
places where they drink alcohol, sing songs, and listen to music while
having the head of Imam Hussain (Q) between his hands.
