Lady Umm Kulthum
================

Lady Fatima’s (sa) household welcomed their second daughter and fourth
child with happiness and glorification, as with the other children.

Lady Umm Kulthum (as), like her sister, shared the honorable
relationship to the Prophet (S), Imam ‘Ali (as), and Fatima az-Zahra
(sa) in addition to the excellent upbringing.

She was also a victim of historical oppression, and sorrowful
inflictions and pains, which strong men can barely put up with.

Perhaps I will be able to elaborate on the life of Lady Umm Kulthum (as)
when I speak about Zainab (as) in new book, if Allah (SwT) wills.
