14: Abraham (ibrahim)
=====================

This chapter consists of 52 verses arranged in seven sections which are
all late Meccan, except for vv. 28 & 29 which date from Madina. It was
revealed after Noah 71 and before Prophets 21.

The chapter contains two parables, " Ashes in the Wind (III) and The
Good and the Bad Tree " (IV). Abraham's famous prayer is found in
section VI (VV. 35-41); this is followed by a graphic picture of the Day
of Reckoning with which the chapter ends.
