Commentary : Verse 41
=====================

(41) إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ أَن تَزُولاَ
وَلَئِن زَالَتَآ إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِن بَعْدِهِ إِنَّهُ
كَانَ حَلِيماً غَفُوراً

41.“Verily Allah holds the heavens and the earth lest they remove (from
the orbit); and did they remove, none would hold them after Him; verily
He is the Forbearing, the Forgiving.”

**Commentary:**

The situation of the heavens and the earth, as well as their motions
and orbits, are with the will of Allah, and it is He Who protects them
in every moment.

The words in this holy verse are about the sovereignty of Allah over
the whole heavens and the earth. In fact, next to the negation of the
partnership of the artificial objects of worship in the world of
existence, it proves the Unity of divinity and Lordship. It says:

“Verily Allah holds the heavens and the earth lest they remove (from
the orbit); …”

Not only the creation at the beginning is done by Allah, but also their
maintenance providence and protection are in His infinite Power.
Moreover, in any moment they have a new creation, and the grace of being
comes down to them from that bountiful source a moment after another, so
that if their communication with that great source is ceased for a short
moment, they will face with destruction.

It is true that the verse emphasizes on the subject of the protection
of the superior system of existence, but, as it has been proved in the
philosophical discussions, all beings are in need of the Origin for
their permanence in the same form that they are for their temporal
origination. And, thus, the protection of the system is not anything
except the continuation of new creation and Divine emanation.

It is worthy to note that, without being fastened by anything, the
celestial spheres have been rotating for millions of years in their
places with the same orbs that have been decided for them without the
least deviation, the example of which is seen in solar system. Our
globe, the earth, rotates in its orb round the sum for millions or
milliards of years with an exact order, which originates from the
equilibrium of the power of polarization, and it obeys the command of
Allah. Then, as an emphasis, the verse says:

“… and did they remove, none would hold them after Him; …”

Neither your idols, nor the angels, nor anything other than them is
able to do this job.

In order not to shut the door of repentance to deviated polytheists and
let them return in any stage they are, at the end of the verse the
Qur’a-n says:

“… verily He is the Forbearing, the Forgiving.”

Because of His forbearance, Allah does not hasten in punishing them,
and because of His forgiveness, He accepts their repentance, with its
conditions, in any case and stage it is. Thus, the ending part of the
verse refers to the situation of polytheists and that His Mercy
encompasses them at the time of repentance and returning.

Some commentators have taken these two attributes in relation to
maintenance of the heavens and the earth, because their destruction is
an affliction and a punishment, and Allah, because of His Forbearance
and Forgiveness, does not let people get this punishment and affliction,
though the sayings and deeds of many of them require that this
chastisement should be sent down, as Sura Maryam, No. 19, verses 88 to
90 say: “And they say: ‘The Beneficent (Allah) has taken (unto Himself)
a son’.” “Indeed you have put forth something hideous!” “At it the skies
are about to burst, and the earth to split asunder, and the mountains to
fall down crashing.”

During the length of the history of human beings this event has
repeatedly happened that some of the astronomers have foreseen that, in
its way, a particular comet, or other than it, may pass by the earth and
probably it crashes this globe. These predictions have worried the
thoughts of all people in the world.

In these circumstances this feeling appears for everybody that in this
problem nobody can do anything, because if, for example, so and so
celestial globe comes towards the earth and, under their gravity they
crash each other, there will remain no trace from the thousand-year-old
civilization of mankind, and even from other living creatures on the
earth; and no power, except the Power of Allah, can prevent this
event.

In these cases everyone feels absolute need unto absolute
Self-Sufficient Allah; but when those probable dangers are removed,
forgetfulness encompasses human beings.

Not only the crash of the celestial spheres and planets cause calamity,
but also a slight deviation of a planet, like earth, from its orb may
bring forth a calamity.


**Commentary : Verse 42**

(42) وَأَقْسَمُوا بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَهُمْ
نَذِيرٌ لَّيَكُونُنَّ أَهْدَي مِنْ إِحْدَي الأُمَمِ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ
نَذِيرٌ مَّا زَادَهُمْ إِلاَّ نُفُوراً

42.“And they swore by Allah with the strongest oaths that if a Warner
came to them, they would be more rightly guided than any one of the
nations; but when a Warner came to them, it increased them naught but
aversion (unto the truth).”

**Commentary:**

The polytheists believed in Allah and sanctified Him and used to swear
by Him, but upon the occasion of revelation of this holy verse it is
cited in Durr-ul-Manthu-r, Rauh?-ul-Ma‘a-li-, Mafa-ti-h-ul-Qayb and
other commentary books that: whenever the Arab polytheists heard that
some of the former nations, such as the Jews, had rejected the Divine
prophets and killed them, they said that they were not like them.

If the messenger of Allah came to them, they would be the best rightly
guided of the nations. But when the world illuminating sun of Islam
appeared in the horizon of their land and the Prophet of Islam
(p.b.u.h.) with the greatest heavenly Book came to them, not only they
did not accept it, but also tried to reject it and to play kinds of
tricks against it.

The abovementioned holy verse was sent down and blamed them for these
empty baseless claims. (Most of the commentary books, has been mentioned
under this verse.) The verse says:

“And they swore by Allah with the strongest oaths that if a Warner came
to them, they would be more rightly guided than any one of the nations;
…”

The Arabic term /’ayma-n/ is the plural form of /yami-n/ which means
‘oath’. Originally it means ‘right hand’, but since at the time of
taking oath and promising people they shake hands with their right hands
and take an oath, this word has gradually been used in the sense of
oath.

The Arabic word /jahd/ is derived from /jiha-d/ in the sense of
‘struggle and effort’. Therefore, the application of the Arabic phrase
/jahd-a-’ayma-nihim/ refers to the strong oath.

Yes, when they were observing the former events recorded in the pages
of the history, saying about disloyalties, ingratitude actions,
hindrances and crimes of the former nations, specially the Jews unto
their prophets, they wondered very much, while they had every kind of
claim and boast about themselves.

But when their own trial practically came forth and they wanted to
practise it, they showed that they were of the same kind, as the Qur’a-n
in this verse declares:

“… but when a Warner came to them, it increased them naught but
aversion (unto the truth).”

We must be also attentive to this matter. God forbids those who are
waiting for the advent of Had?rat Mahdi- (May Allah hasten his glad
advent) and say that if he (a.s.) comes they will do so and so, but when
he (a.s.) comes they stand against him.


**Commentary : Verse 43**

(43) اسْتِكْبَاراً فِي الأَرْضِ وَمَكْرَ السّـِيئِ وَلاَ يَحِيقُ
الْمَكْرُ السَّيّـِئُ اِلاَّ بِاَهْلِهِ فَهَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ سُنَّتَ
الأَوَّلِينَ فَلَن تَجِد َلِسُنَّتِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً وَلَن تَجِدَ
لِسُنَّتِ اللَّهِ تَحْوِيلاً

43.“On account of their arrogance in the earth, and devising evil; but
evil devising encompasses only the devisers themselves; so do they
expect anything except the way of (Allah against) the former people? For
never shall you find any alternation in the course of Allah and never
shall you find in the course of Allah any change.”

**Commentary:**

The origin of escape and hatred from the way of prophets is either
arrogance or evil devising. (Perhaps arrogance is from the side of
obstinate pagans and evil devising from the side of hypocrites.)

This holy verse is an explanation over what was said in the previous
verse. The verse implicitly says that their being aloof from the Truth
was for the sake that they paved the path of arrogance in the earth and
they never accepted to surrender to the truth. And, also, it was for the
sake that they used to commit devising evil, but the evil devising
afflicts none but those who do it. The verse says:

“On account of their arrogance in the earth, and devising evil; but
evil devising encompasses only the devisers themselves; …”

The Arabic sentence /la- yah?i-q/, derived from /h?aq/ means: ‘it does
not descend down, does not overtake, and does not overcome’. This points
to the fact that applying devises may temporarily reach others, but
finally they come forth against the devisers themselves and will make
them disgrace before the servants of Allah, and will make them shameful
in front of Allah; and this is the same evil fate that the pagans of
Mecca encountered. In fact, the verse implies that they did not suffice
only to get aloof from this great Divine Prophet, but also they took
help from their entire ability and power in hurting him; and the main
motive of it was arrogance, pride, and the lack of humility before the
truth.

In the continuation of the verse, the Qur’a-n threatens this arrogant,
deceitful and treacherous group by an expressive awakening sentence, and
says:

“… so do they expect anything except the way of (Allah against) the
former people? …”

This short sentence is a hint to the whole evil ends of the haughty,
and disobedient former nations, such as the people of Noah, ‘A-d,
Thamu-d, and Pharaoh, each of whom were afflicted with a great calamity,
and the Qur’a-n has frequently pointed to some parts of their painful
and evil fates. Here, by this very short sentence, the Qur’a-n
illustrates all of them in front of the eyes of this group.

Then, for a more emphasis, it adds:

“… For never shall you find any alternation in the course of Allah and
never shall you find in the course of Allah any change.”
