Question 5: Why do Shi’a say “Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad wa Ali Muhammad”
============================================================================

**When invoking blessings {*****salawat*****} on Muhammad (S), why do
you also associate his progeny {*****a*****} to him by saying,
“*****Allahumma*** ***salli ‘ala Muhammad wa Ali Muhammad*****” {“O
Allah! Bless Muhammad and the progeny of Muhammad”}?**

**Reply:** It has been established that the Prophet (S) himself had
taught the Muslims how to invoke blessings on him. When the following
noble verse,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
﴿ إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَمَلَائِكَتَهُ يُصَلُّونَ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ يَا
أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا صَلُّوا عَلَيْهِ وَسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا ﴾
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Indeed Allah and His angels bless the Prophet. O you who have faith!
Invoke blessings on him and invoke Peace upon him in a worthy
manner,”***[^1]

was revealed, the Muslims asked the Prophet (S): “How should we invoke
blessings (on you)?” The Prophet (S) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لا تصلّوا عليّ الصلوة البتراء."
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Do not invoke ‘incomplete’ blessings on me.”

They again asked: “How should we invoke blessings on you?” He (S)
replied: “Say:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مُحَمَّدٍ آلِ عَلىٰ وَ مُحَمَّدٍ عَلىٰ صَلِّ أَللّهُمَّ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*Allahumma* *salli ‘ala Muhammad wa Ali Muhammad.*

“O Allah! Bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.”[^2]

The exceptionally high station of the Prophet’s family {*al*} (*‘a*) led
Imam ash-Shafi‘i to compose the following famous poem:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يا أهل بيت رسول الله حبّكم فرض من الله في القرأن أنزله كفاكم من عظيم
القد أنكم من لم يصل عليكم لا صلوة له."
  </p>
</blockquote>

*O members of the Household {Ahl al-Bayt} of the Messenger of Allah!
(Our) love for you is an obligation, which God has revealed in the
Qur’an.*

*Your lofty station such that if one does not invoke blessings on you
(while offering prayers) one’s prayer will be of no avail.*[^3]
