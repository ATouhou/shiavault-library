***In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful***

The blessed Chapter has forty-four Verses and is regarded as one of
those revealed in Mecca, though some of the Verses were revealed in
Medina. The designation of the Chapter, connoting the angels’ places of
ascent, derives from the third Verse. Similar to other Meccan Chapters,
it mainly treats of Resurrection and warning to the polytheists and
opponents.

It also deals with the states of the disbelievers on the Day of
Resurrection and the characteristics of the peoples of Paradise and
Hell. The opening Verses of the Chapter concerns sending down torments
in this world whereby one of the deniers of Imam ‘Ali’s (as)
guardianship (wilaya) was afflicted and lost his life whose detailed
account will be mentioned under the first Verse.

The Merit of Reciting the Chapter
---------------------------------

It is narrated from the Noble Prophet (S) that whoever recites the Sura
Sa’ala Sa’il [namely, the chapter in question], God Almighty will grant
him the Rewards of those who keep their covenants as well as those who
are attentive toward the establishment of their ritual prayers.[^1]

In this vein, it is narrated from Imam Baqir (as) that whoever recites
the Chapter constantly, he shall not be investigated on the Day of
Resurrection regarding his sins, but he shall abide in Paradise beside
Muhammad (S).[^2] The bestowal of such Rewards is dependent on
fulfilling one’s religious obligations.

***1. A questioner asked for befalling a torment which befell.***  
***2. They are in store for disbelievers and none may avert them***  
***3. They are from Allah, the Lord whose angels ascent to the
heavens.***

The late ‘Allama Amini (rh), in his invaluable work titled al-Ghadir,
enumerates thirty eminent Qur’an exegetes and traditionists flourishing
in the third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries who maintain that the
occasion of the Revelation of the blessed Verse 1 concerns a man who
addressed the Noble Prophet (S) as saying:

*"You ordered us to fulfill our obligations regarding pilgrimage to
Mecca (hajj), fasting (sawm), and paying the alms tax (zakat) on the day
of Ghadir to which we consented, but you are not content yet as you
appointed your cousin to rule over us."*

Then, he added:

*"O Lord! If such appointment is true, send down rocks from the heaven
[such that we be destroyed and do not witness such day].*

A rock was sent down and he killed him.

Then the blessed Verse

***'A questioner asked for befalling a torment which befell'***

was revealed."[^3]

It would be of significance to make mention of some individual and
seemingly insignificant events so that others may take lessons.
Likewise, it was an individual disobedience which led to Divine Wrath
and his affliction and perdition.

The Qur’anic Verse makes a reference to the incident so that mankind may
take lessons and be aware that partial, obdurate, and inappropriate
requests may entail afflictions. It would be of interest to mention that
the inquirer in question is maintained by some Qur’an exegetes to be
Nu‘man ibn Harith or Nadhr ibn Harith.

The blessed Verse 2 is saying that such torment is in store for the
disbelievers and non one may impede it. The blessed Verse 3 makes a
reference to the Source of such torment, saying that the torment was
inflicted by Allah, the Lord of the heavens where angels ascend.

The Arabic word ma‘arij is the plural form of ma‘arij denoting place of
ascent which herein connotes the heavens where the angels ascend or
descend proceeding toward nearness to God Almighty following a certain
hierarchy.

Such angels who are vested with afflicting the disbelievers and sinners
with torments were the same angels who descended upon Abraham (as)
informing him of their appointment to cause the perdition of the people
of Lot (as).

They destroyed the cities of those people who had plunged into sins and
disgrace. They are also vested with inflicting torments upon other
sinners as well. It is to be noted, however, that some Qur’an exegetes
maintain that the word ma‘arij implies Divine Bounties and some others
hold that it connotes angels, though the former further befits the
lexical meaning of the word.

Surah al-Ma’arij – Verse 4
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
تَعْرُجُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ إِلَيْهِ فِي يَوْمٍ كَانَ
مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***4. The angels and the spirit (an archangel) ascend toward Him on a
Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years.***

Following the narrative of the person who had asked for Divine torment,
the blessed Verse in question treats of Resurrection and the torments in
store for sinners on that Day, saying that the angels and the spirit
ascend toward God Almighty on a Day whose measure is fifty thousand
years.

The ascension of the angels indubitably implies spiritual ascent rather
than the physical one.

In other words, they hasten toward nearness unto God Almighty and on
that Day, namely the Day of Resurrection, they are prepared to receive
Divine Commands and implement them, as it was mentioned above under
69:17 that

***"and the angels will be on its sides"***

implies that they will surround the heaven and will be prepared on that
Day to act upon Divine Commands.

The spirit (ruh) herein implies the archangel, namely the trusted spirit
(ruh al-amin) or Gabriel, to whom there is a reference elsewhere in the
Holy Qur’an[^4]:

***"Therein descend the angels and the spirit by Allah’s Permission with
all Ordainments."***

The angels and the 'spirit' descend by Divine Permission on the night of
Ordainment (laylat al-qadr) to implement Divine Ordainments and Decrees.
It is worthy of note, however, that the word ruh implies different
senses according to the contextual meaning, e.g. man’s spirit, the Holy
Qur’an, the Holy Spirit (ruh al-qudus), the archangel of Revelation, as
attested in different Qur’anic Verses.

The expression

***"fifty thousand years"***

reflects that the Day of Resurrection shall last fifty thousand years,
taking into account the passage of time in this world which does not
stand in disharmony with the

***"one thousand years"***

mentioned elsewhere in the Holy Qur’an[^5], since according to
traditions, there shall be fifty stations on the Day of Resurrection
each of which shall last one thousand years.[^6]

Some Qur’an exegetes have also suggested that the number

***"fifty thousand"***

herein implies multiplicity rather than quantity, namely that Day shall
last long.

At any rate, it concerns the sinners, wrong doers, and disbelievers. In
this vein, it is narrated on the authority of Abu Sa‘id Khudri that
following the Revelation of the blessed Verse in question, someone
asked:

*"O Allah’s Messenger (S)! How long shall be that Day?"*

He replied:

*"By the One in Whose Hands lie Muhammad’s life, that Day shall be
convenient for the disbelievers, more convenient than one obligatory
ritual prayer established in this world."*[^7]

</blockquote>

***5. So be patient with a good patience.***  
***6. They behold that Day from afar.***  
***7. And We see it near.***

Addressed to the Noble Prophet (S), the blessed Verse 5 asks him to be
patient with a good patience against their denial and harassment. The
Arabic phrase sabran jamilan literally denotes becoming patience which
calls for according attention to the same. Such patience entails
steadfastness and constant forbearance unadulterated by despair,
desolation, restlessness, and remonstrance.

The blessed Verse 6 is saying that they regard that Day as far remote,
though, according to the following blessed Verse, God Almighty regards
it to be close by. They actually do not believe in the existence of such
Day wherein the records of deeds of all people as well as the least of
their words and deeds shall be accounted.

That Day shall last fifty thousand years according to this worldly time
measurement. However, they do not believe in God Almighty and they
entertain doubts as to His Omnipotence, saying that it will be
impossible for rotten bones and scattered dust to assemble once again in
bodily form. Such unfounded doubts are to be met elsewhere in the Holy
Qur’an.

They also raise questions about the duration of fifty thousand years for
one single day. It would be of interest to note that according to modern
science, time measurements are different on different celestial bodies,
since they follow the time of their rotations on their axes.

Thus, one day on the moon equals two weeks on the earth. It is even
suggested that through the passage time, the earth may reduce the
velocity of its rotation on its axis, as a consequence of which one day
may turn into one month, one year, or hundreds of years.

It is said that the Day of Resurrection will be at that time, but it is
said that one day which equals fifty thousand years is not incredible as
per our worldly measurements and analogies. At any rate, the present
order of the earth and the heaven shall undergo alterations prior to the
Day of Resurrection. The disbelievers regarded Resurrection as a remote
possibility that may not stand to reason, though it is certain and close
by according to the blessed Qur’anic Verse.

***8. The Day that the heaven shall be like molten metal.***  
***9. And the mountains shall be like dyed wool.***

The blessed Verses in question further treat of Resurrection, saying
that on that Day, the heaven shall be like molten metal and the
mountains shall be like flakes of dyed wool. The Arabic word muhl herein
denotes molten metal and at times it is applied to the sediment of olive
oil. The former sense befits the contextual meaning, though, taking into
account the use as a simile, the latter is not that different.

The Arabic word ‘ihan denotes dyed wool. The heavens shall be torn
asunder and they shall melt. Mountains shall be shattered and scattered
through the wind like flakes of wool. Mountains are herein likened to
dyed wool owing to their different colors. Such destruction shall
antedate the creation of a new world wherein mankind shall be revived.

***10. And no intimate friend shall ask a friend about his
condition,***  
***11. They shall be made to meet one another [but they are preoccupied
with their own affairs], such that he sinner would desire to ransom
himself from the chastisement of that Day by his children,***  
***12. And his wife and his brother,***  
***13. And his tribe who protected him at all times,***  
***14. And all the people on the earth, so that he may find
deliverance.***

On Resurrection day in the new world, mankind shall be so preoccupied
with the records of their past deeds that they never think about others,
even their intimate friends, but they think about their own deliverance
from torments.

The same theme is reflected elsewhere in the Holy Qur’an[^8]:

***"Everyone on that Day shall have enough to make him careless of
others."***

The blessed Verse 11 is saying that people shall recognize their
intimate friends, since they shall be made to meet their friends, but
they are careless of them owing to being preoccupied with their own
affairs and they shall stand in such awe that they shall never think
about others.

Proceeding with further depiction of that awe inspiring scene, the
blessed Verse further adds that the sinners would desire to victimize
their children so that they may find deliverance from the torments in
store for them on that Day.

The blessed Verses 12-14 say:

***"And his wife and his brother, his tribe who protected him at all
times, and all the people on the earth, so that he may find
deliverance."***

The torments to be inflicted upon them on that Day shall be so awe
inspiring that man shall desire to ransom himself by victimizing his
beloved ones, his children, wives, brothers, and kith and kin who used
to protect him at all times. He shall even desire to victimize all the
people so that he may find deliverance from the torments on the Day of
Resurrection.

The Arabic verbal form

***yawaddu ("he would desire")***

derives from w-d-d denoting "desire."

The Arabic verbal form

***yaftadi ("ransom oneself from")***

derives from f-d-’ implying protecting oneself from afflictions against
some payment.

The Arabic nominal form fasila is used in the sense of the tribe and
family from whom one descends (literally: is cut off), though it
connotes offering shelter and safe haven. At any rate, filial ties as
well as those with one’s spouse, brothers, and kith and kin shall all
fall victims to deliverance from torments, though they shall be of no
avail.

It is noteworthy that we are supposed to turn into the people of Hell
for the sake of the welfare of our spouse and children and obtaining the
satisfaction of our friends and relatives, since they shall be of no
avail to us on the Day of Resurrection.

***15. By no means! It shall be flames of fire.***  
***16. Taking away hands, feet, and head skin!***  
***17. Calling those who turned their backs to Divine Command***  
***18. And those who amassed wealth and concealed it.***

Addressing all such desires, the blessed Verse 15 says:

***"By no means! No ransom shall be accepted. There shall be burning
flames of fire constantly ablaze consuming whatever lies beside it.***

The blessed Verse 16 says that the flames take away hands, fee, and skin
head. The Arabic word latha implies "flame" and it is also one of the
names of Hell, both senses are possible in the blessed Verses in
question. The Arabic word naza‘a is applied to something which is
consecutive.

Shawa is used in the sense of "hands and feet and the sides of the
body," though it also connotes broiling; the former sense is herein
intended, since when burning flames touch something, they first burn its
sides and extremities and take them away.

Some Qur’an exegetes maintain that the word is here in used in the sense
of skin (of the body), though some others hold that it is applied to
head skin and calf (foot). All these senses are applicable to the
context, taking into account the aforesaid broad semantic domain. It
would be surmising to note that despite all these afflictions, the
victims shall not die.

The blessed Verse 17 makes a reference to those who fall prey to such
fire, saying that theses burning flames call unto themselves those who
turned away from Divine Commands and disobeyed him.

The blessed Verse 18 says that they amassed wealth and concealed it
without expending it in Allah’s Cause. Thus, the burning fire constantly
calls unto itself the sinners by the God given verbal or non-verbal
language.

The victims shall be those who turned away from faith disobeying God
Almighty and His Messenger (S) on the one hand, and were preoccupied
with amassing lawful and unlawful wealth and concealing it without
according attention to the rights of the needy or even comprehending the
reason behind the bestowal of Divine Bounties upon them.

***19. Man was created impatient and avaricious,***  
***20. Irritable when evil touches him,***  
***21. And impeding others when good touches him.***  
***22. Except those who establish their ritual prayers.***  
***23. Those who remain steadfast in establishing their ritual
prayers.***

Having recounted some of the torments in store for sinners on the Day of
Resurrection, the blessed Verses in question treat of the character
traits of the disbelieving and the truly believing, stating the reasons
behind the torments and the deliverance in store for them.

The blessed Verses 19-21 reflect that man is created avaricious and
impatient, irritable when evil touches him impeding others when good
touches him. Some Qur’an exegetes and lexicographers maintain that the
Arabic word hulu‘ denotes "avaricious," though some others hold that it
implies "impatient."

The blessed Verses 20 and 21 provide further explanation as to the
meaning of the Arabic word in question. The former meaning makes a
reference to three moral vices of such people, namely avarice,
restlessness, and niggardliness. The latter refers to restlessness and
niggardliness. Both senses may be implied by the word hulu‘, since the
two are dependent on each other. In other words, avaricious people are
oftentimes niggardly and impatient against incidents and vice versa.

The blessed Verses 22 and 23 treats of further character traits of the
believing preceded by the conjunction "except" (illa), saying that those
who establish their ritual prayers are exceptions, those who are
steadfast in the establishment of their ritual prayers.

Such characteristic of theirs establishes and maintains their constant
ties with Divine Threshold. Such nexus is created and maintained by the
establishment of ritual prayers that impede man from committing vices,
fostering his heart and spirit, makes him remember God Almighty at all
times, and thereby impedes him from plunging into vanity, arrogance,
concupiscent desires, and bondage in satanic shackles and fetters.

It is needless to say that steadfastness in establishing prayers does
not entail their establishment at all times, but it indicates that they
establish their ritual prayers at certain times. Generally speaking,
steadfastness in doing any good deed positively affects man’s heart.

In this vein, it is narrated from the Noble Prophet (S) as saying:

*"The most beloved of acts before God Almighty is what is done
constantly, even if it happens to be seemingly insignificant."*[^9]

It is narrated from Imam Baqir (as) that what is intended herein is that
whenever man regards one of the supererogatory things as an obligation
and constantly does the deed.[^10] Another tradition narrated from the
Noble Imam (as) reflects that the blessed Verse in question concerns the
establishment of obligatory ritual prayers.[^11]

The difference may lie in the fact that "protection" befits the
establishment of obligatory prayers which must be performed at certain
times, though "constancy and steadfastness" befit supererogatory
prayers, since man may perform them and fail to do likewise at other
times.

***26. And those who stand in awe against Divine Recompense,***  
***27. And those who find no deliverance from the torment of their
Lord.***  
***28. The torment of their Lord is that before which none can feel
secure.***

Following a treatment of the establishment of ritual prayers as the best
deed and the best state of the believing, the blessed Verses 24 and 25
dealt with those in whose possessions there is some recognized right for
the mendicant and the deprived. Thus, they maintain their ties with both
the Creator and the created.

In this respect, some Qur’an exegetes maintain that

***"recognized right"***

herein implies alms tax (zakat) whose measure is apportioned and it
should be paid to the mendicant and the deprived. It is known that the
Chapter in question is Meccan and the Divine Decree as to the payment of
tax alms had not been revealed in Mecca, or even if it had been
revealed, the measure had not been apportioned.

Thus, some other exegetes hold that

***"recognized right"***

herein implies something other than alms tax which one feels obliged to
pay to the needy. In this respect, a tradition is narrated from Imam
Sadiq (as) that upon being asked as to the exegesis of the blessed
Verse, he said that it was something other than the alms tax and the
blessed Verse concerned those upon whom God Almighty bestowed wealth and
they paid one to three thousand of which to help their next of kin and
help with the removal of adversity from amongst their people.[^12]

Regarding the difference between the mendicant and the deprived, it may
be said that the former express their needs and ask for assistance,
whereas the latter may not act likewise owing to shame and dignity. It
is narrated from Imam Sadiq (as) as saying that the deprived are those
who take troubles to earn a living, though they are involved with
financial straits.[^13]

The blessed Verses 26-28 make a reference to the third and the fourth
characteristics of theirs, saying that those who believe in the Day of
Recompense and stand in awe against Divine torment, since they find no
deliverance from Divine Chastisement. They believe in the Day of
Recompense.

In this respect, it may be mentioned that the Arabic present verbal form
yusaddiqun reflects progression, implying that they are attentive at all
times that the records of past deeds shall be taken into account on that
Day. Some Qur’an exegetes hold that the verbal form is indicative of the
confirmation of certain acts, namely acting upon obligations and
abstaining from committing unlawful acts.

However, the contextual meaning of the blessed Verse implies theoretical
and practical confirmation.

Since some people may believe in the Day of Recompense but imagine that
they shall not be chastised, the blessed Verse is saying that the
believers find not deliverance from Divine torments, namely they feel
obliged at all times to act upon Divine Commands and regard their
righteous good deeds as insignificant and their sins as grave.

In this vein, it is narrated from the Commander of the Faithful, Imam
‘Ali (as) that providing his child with admonitions, he said:

*"O my child! Stand in awe before God Almighty such that even if you
happen to have done all the righteous deeds in this world, He may not
accept them and set your hopes on Him, such that even if you have had
committed all the sins in this world, He may forgive your sins."*[^14]

Even the Noble Prophet said:

*"No one shall be admitted to Paradise for his deeds.*

Upon being asked:

*"Even you?"*

He replied:

*"Yes, even me, unless I will be granted Divine Graciousness."*

***30. And do not engage in sexual intercourse, except with their wives
and female slaves [who are like their wives], but they are not
blameworthy for having been engaged in sexual intercourse with
them.***  
***31. But whoever seeks beyond that shall be a trespasser [of Divine
Bounds].***

The preceding blessed Verses treated of four characteristics of the true
believers and those who will be the people of Paradise and the blessed
Verses in question deal with further characteristics.

The blessed Verses 29 and 30 say:

*"They are the people who protect themselves from unchastity and do not
engage in sexual intercourse, except with their wives and female slaves
and they will not be blamed for such engagement.”*

The sexual drive is one of the easily unchecked human drives and the
source of many a sin, such that some hold that its trace may be found in
all serious criminal cases. Thus, checking the drive serves as a
significant token of fear of God Almighty.

It is worthy of note that checking the drive follows acts like
establishment of ritual prayers, helping the needy, believing in the Day
of Resurrection, and fearing Divine torments.

The exception following the check reflects that the drive is not to be
totally removed and people are to move against the laws of creation like
monks, nuns, and some priests; it is logically impossible, since many a
monk and nun have failed to remove the drive from their lives and even
if they do not officially marry, but many of them privately engage in
sexual activities.

Such instances of disgrace and ignominy abound in the world and
Christian historians, e.g. Will Durant, have unveiled instances of such
unchastity and indecency.

The Arabic plural nominal form azwaj comprises permanent and temporary
wives. Some have imagined that the blessed Verse negates temporary
marriage, since they do not notice that it is also a kind of marriage.

Laying further emphasis on the issue, the blessed Verse 31 says:

***"But whoever seeks beyond that shall be a trespasser [of Divine
Bounds]."***

Thus, the Islamic faith plans a society in which innate natural drives
may find vents without entailing unchastity and indecency. It is
noteworthy that female slaves used to possess many a legal right of
wives, but dealing with such issue is presently out of the question.

Verse 32, saying

***"Those who keep their trusts and covenants."***

It is noteworthy that the Arabic word

***amana ("trust")***

encompasses a broad range of meanings implying not only different
earthly trusts of people but also Divine ones and also those of the
Prophets and Infallible Imams (as). Each of the Divine Bounties is one
of His trusts. Likewise, social positions, particularly leadership, are
amongst the most important trusts.

Thus, it is narrated from Imam Baqir (as) and Imam Sadiq (as) concerning
the exegesis of the blessed Verse

***"Verily Allah commands you to restore the trusted things to their
owners"***

that people are commanded to restore rulership and guardianship to their
worthy guardians.[^15]

It is attested elsewhere in the Holy Qur’an[^16]

***"Verily We did offer the trust to the heavens and the earth and the
mountains, but they declined to bear it and were afraid of it; but man
bore it. He was unjust and ignorant."***

Above all, it is incumbent upon Muslims to preserve Divine religion and
His Book, as His Greatest of trusts.

The Arabic term

***‘ahd ("covenant")***

implies a wide semantic range, including both people’s and Divine
covenants, since the term is applied to any kind of obligation vested
with someone. Therefore, one who believes in God Almighty and His
Messenger (S) has indubitably accepted great obligations. Great emphasis
is laid by the Islamic faith on keeping one’s trusts and covenants as
one of the most significant tokens of true faith.

The blessed Verse 33 adds that it is the characteristic of the believers
and those who rise bear true testimony, since bearing just witness and
refraining from concealing the same are most significant pillars of
administering justice in human society.

They inquire as to the reasons behind bearing testimony against people
entailing in their animosity and thereby creating problems for
themselves. Such people are indifferent toward human rights, devoid of
social spirit, and irresponsible toward administration of justice.

It is in this vein that the Holy Qur’an recurrently calls Muslims unto
bearing true witness and regards its concealment as a sin[^17]. The
issue is of particular significance in Islamic law serving as the pillar
of proving many an individual and social law governed by particular laws
and rulings.

The last characteristic of the good is mentioned in the blessed Verse
34, which once again refers to the establishment of ritual prayers,
mentioned above in the opening blessed Verses, saying:

***"those who guard their ritual prayers."***

Reference was made above of the point as per which obligatory ritual
prayers are herein intended by salat. Reference was already made of
supererogatory ritual prayers.

The first characteristic alludes to steadfastness in establishing such
prayers, though the one in question make mention of acting upon the
rules, pillars, and the characteristics of the same through which such
prayers are preserved from corruption and the spirit of salat, the
presence of mind while performing it, is reinforced.

Thus, the moral impediments to its acknowledgement are removed and it is
regarded by no means as a repetition. Such beginning and end reflect
that above all, according attention to the establishment of ritual
prayers is the most significant characteristic of the believers, since
it is the most exalted school of spiritual growth and the most
significant means of the purification of the soul and society.

Finally, the blessed Verse indicates the final goal of those who possess
such characteristics.

In the same manner that the preceding Verses were indicative of the
final goal of the sinners, the blessed Verse 35 reflects tersely that
those who possess such characteristics shall dwell in the Gardens of
Paradise and shall be cherished from all respects, as they are Allah’s
guests for whom all means of comfort and hospitality will have been
available by the Most-Compassionate and the Omnipotent Allah.

The twain expressions,

***jannat ("gardens")***

and

***mukramun ("honored")***

allude to the material and spiritual Bounties bestowed upon such people.

to Paradise?***  
***38. Does everyone of them aspire to enter the Paradise abounding in
Divine Bounties?***  
***39. No, that is not like that! We have created them out of that which
they know!***

The preceding Verses treated of the characteristics of the believers and
the disbelievers and their fates. The blessed Verses in question deal
with the disbelievers and their derision of sacred matters.

Some Qur’an exegetes maintain that these blessed Verses were revealed
concerning some polytheists who upon hearing the Noble Prophet (S)
reciting some Resurrection Verses to the Muslims in Mecca, gathered to
utter that if there be Resurrection, they will enjoy a far better state
in the Hereafter than those believing him, since they enjoy a further
comfortable life compared to those believing in him.

The blessed Verses 36-38 respond to their claims saying:

***"What is the matter with the disbelievers who hasten to come to you,
in groups on the right and on the left expecting to be admitted to
Paradise? Does every one of them aspire to enter the Paradise abounding
in Divine Bounties?"***

How do they expect to be admitted to Paradise with their unworthy deeds?
The Arabic plural nominal form muhti‘in is the accusative plural form of
muhti‘ denoting one walking hastily with his neck raised up in quest of
something and at times walks with his neck raised up searching for
intelligence.

The Arabic nominal form ‘izin is applied to scattered groups and at
times to being related to others, since groups getting together are
somehow related or they pursue one single goal, hence the application of
the word ‘iza to a group.

At any rate, the vain polytheists produced numerous, similar, unfounded
claims and regarded their comfortable life, consequent to their unlawful
acts like plunder as their exalted rank before Divine Threshold
resorting to baseless analogies as to their elevated ranks in the
Hereafter.

It is true that they did not believe in Resurrection as reflected in the
Holy Qur’an, but at times they treated of it as a possibility, saying
that had there been Resurrection, they would have such and such exalted
positions in the Hereafter. They might have aimed at deriding such
beliefs.

The blessed Verse 39 responds to their false claims, saying:

***"No, that is not like that! We have created them out of that which
they know!"***

Such response aims to shatter their vanity, since it is said that they
know from what they were created: a worthless drop of semen. So, what is
the reason behind their vanity?

Furthermore, the blessed Verse responds to those who deride the belief
in Resurrection by saying that if they entertain doubts as to the
veracity of Resurrection, they may accord attention to the fact that God
Almighty creates perfect beings out of a worthless drop of semen that
undergoes developments in womb each and every day and it is created anew
each time.

The other point is that such people whose record of deeds abounds with
sins may not expect to be admitted to Paradise, since a being created
out of a worthless drop of semen is materially ignoble and nobilities
are consequent to having faith and doing righteous good deeds which they
lack. So, how do they expect to set foot in the Gardens of Paradise?

***40. Therefore, I swear by the Lord of all the points of sunrise and
sunset in the east and the west that surely We are All-Able***  
***41. To replace them by others better than them and We are
Invincible.***

Instances of the singular form of "east and west" are also attested in
the Holy Qur’an, as in:

***"And to Allah belong the east and the west"***[^18]***.***

The expression at times appears in the dual form, as in:

***"The Lord of the two easts and the Lord of the two
wests"***[^19]***.***

The plural form also appears, as in the blessed Verse in question. Some
narrow-minded people have considered these expressions to be
contradictory, whereas they harmoniously point to one point: the sun
rises from a new point and sets in another new point each and every day,
hence there are as many sunrises and sunsets as the number of the days
of the year.

Furthermore, two easts and two wests are distinguished amongst so many
easts and wests: the summer and winter solstices when the sun reaches
its zenith in the tropic of Cancer and the tropic of Capricorn. Besides
these two distinct solstices, there are two spring and autumn equinoxes
when the day and the night are equal.

Some maintain that

***"the Lord of the easts and the Lord of the wests"***

alludes to the same phenomenon, a point which is noteworthy.

However, the singular attestations solely lay emphasis on the east and
the west without according any attention to individual instances.
Therefore, the aforesaid expressions convey certain points urging man to
heed the alterations in the sunrise and the sunset and the regular
alterations of the solar orbits.

***42. Therefore, leave them to plunge in vain talk and play about,
until they meet their Promised Day.***  
***43. The Day when they shall come out of the graves instantly as
racing toward their idols,***  
***44. With their eyes lowered in fear, enwrapped by humility and
ignominy. [It shall be said unto them:] That is the Day which was
promised unto you.***

These closing Verses of the blessed Chapter warn the obdurate
disbelievers mocking Resurrection and belief in the Islamic faith,
saying:

***"Therefore, leave them to plunge in vain talk and play about, until
they meet their Promised Day. The Day when they shall come out of the
graves instantly as racing toward their idols, with their eyes lowered
in fear, enwrapped by humility and ignominy. [It shall be said unto
them:] That is the Day which was promised unto you."***

Such decisive arguments are sufficient, since they are neither sensible
nor prepared to wake up. They are abandoned to plunged into their false
beliefs and engage themselves in child play until the Promised Day,
namely the Day of Resurrection happens.

The blessed Verse 43 depicts that Day and its awe inspiring tokens,
saying that they shall leave their graves instantly on that Day as if
they hasten toward their idols in celebrations or mourning. Such
dramatic juxtaposition aims at deriding their false beliefs in this
world.

The Arabic word ajdath is the plural form of jadath. Sira‘an is an
adverb of manner used in the sense of "instantly."

The Arabic nominal form nusub is the plural form of nasb denoting
something installed somewhere, though it herein connotes the stone idols
installed at certain places to be worshipped by idolaters by shedding
the blood of sacrificial animals on them. The difference between nasb
and sanam is that the latter had a particular form, but the former was a
formless rock worshipped by idolaters.

The Arabic verbal form

***yufidhun ("race, hasten"),***

cognate with ifadha, implies rapid movement like that of water running
from its fountainhead. Some Qur’an exegetes maintain that nusub implies
the banners installed amongst armies or caravans at certain places
toward which everybody hastens.

The blessed Verse 44 further treats of other tokens, saying that on that
Day, their eyes shall be lowered owing to the intensity of horror
looking at their surroundings with humility while they shall be
enwrapped by ignominy and humility.

The blessed Verse closes by saying that that is the Day promised to
them, though they used to deride it, saying that granted that such Day
exists, they shall be far better in terms of convenience and comfort
compared with the believers. Nonetheless, they dare not raise their
heads owing to horror and disgrace. They shall be covered with the dust
of humility. They shall plunge into sorrows, but their regrets shall be
of no avail.

*O Lord! Protect us by Your Compassion on that awe inspiring Day.*

*O Lord! Rank us amongst the believers who have kept their promise to
You and have obeyed Your Commands.*
