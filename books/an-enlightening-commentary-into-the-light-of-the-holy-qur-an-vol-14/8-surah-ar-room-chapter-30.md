***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

Imam Sadiq (as) in a tradition said:

*“Whoever recites Suras Al-‘Ankabut and Ar-Room in the month of Ramadan
at the twenty third night, by Allah he will be admitted in Paradise, and
I do not consider any exception in this word…(with the condition that he
fulfils his religious duties). These two Suras have an important
situation with Allah.”*[^1]

In another tradition narrated from the Prophet (S), he has said:

*“Whoever recites Surah Ar-Room, will be rewarded ten rewards as the
number of every angel who glorifies Allah between the heaven, and the
earth, and whatever he has lost in that day and night will be
recompensed.”*[^2]

It is evident that he who puts the content of this Surah, which is full
of teachings about Monotheism and the great court of Hereafter in his
soul and manner, and observes the constant watch of Allah over him, and
knows the Day of Judgment and Divine court certain, the Divine
devoutness will fill his heart in a manner that he will be eligible for
such a great reward.

The Feature of the Surah
------------------------

This holy Surah contains 60 verses and has been revealed at Mecca.

Similar to many Meccan Suras, the main subject in this Surah is ‘Origin
and End’ and the statements of the believers and disbelievers are in
this relation.

This Surah begins with the Prophecy about the victory of Romans against
Iranians in the war, and for this reason this Surah has been called
Ar-Room.

A great part of the verses of this Surah is about the Divine bounties in
the heaven and in the earth, the conjugality system in plants and
animals, creation of man from dust, the relation between man and woman,
effort in the day and sleep at night, the fall of rain, the winds, and
the earth being revived after its death.
