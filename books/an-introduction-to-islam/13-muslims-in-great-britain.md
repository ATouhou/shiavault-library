Muslims in Great Britain
========================

There is a substantial Muslim community in Great Britain and at times
there occur conflicts between them and other communities.

It is wrong to link racism with religion. Racism is an attitude of
hostility based upon racial prejudice. This is often exploited by
unscrupulous politicians and community leaders for their own ends.

Unfortunately, both the victims and the perpetrators of racial prejudice
tend to foster the image of it being the result of the diversity in
religious beliefs. This often rallies support for the victim community
and provides the perpetrators with the mantle of defending their faith.

At the same time there is amongst the indigenous population a fear,
nurtured by irresponsible media, that Islam poses a threat to their
community.

If a solution is not found, and found soon, the Muslim communities could
be driven to extreme ethnicity with the future generation growing up as
pariahs in their own country.

Consideration must be given to promoting a better understanding of Islam
in the indigenous population. For this both the communities will need to
strive hard.

Islam is a tolerant religion. It accepts Christianity and Judaism as
sister faiths and respects other religions as well. The Muslims are
enjoined to respect churches, synagogues and other places of worship.

There is a need to ensure that each side is enriched by the values of
the religion of the other through amicable inter-action without anyone
from either side losing his identity.

To ensure harmony efforts must be made to create a community of British
Muslims rather than a community, or a number of communities, of Muslims
in Britain.
