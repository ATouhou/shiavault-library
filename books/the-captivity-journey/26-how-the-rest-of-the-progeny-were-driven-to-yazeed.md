How the Rest of the Progeny were Driven to Yazeed
=================================================

When the letter of Yazeed Bin Muawiya reached Bin Ziad, in which he
ordered him to send him the head of Imam Hussain (Q) and the heads of
those who were killed with him, along with his women, children and
belongings.

And when the people were done roving with the Holy Head, Bin Ziad gave
it to Zuhr Bin Qaeis and the heads of his companions as well, and he
sent him off to Yazeed Bin Muawiya. He also sent with him Aba Baradah
Bin Awf Al-Azdi and Tareq Bin Abi Thubian with a group from the people
of Kufa till they reached Yazeed in Damascus.

It was narrated that Jaafar Bin Muhammad Al-Sadiq (Q) had said: My
father, Muhammad Bin Ali told me: "I asked my father, Ali Bin Al-Hussain
about the way Yazeed took him, so he said: I was put on a camel’s back
with no saddle, while the head of Al-Hussain (Q) was raised on a flag!
Our women were behind me on mules… if one of us would have a tear in his
eyes, they would hit his head with a spear! When we entered Damascus a
person yelled: O people of Sham (old name for Damascus), these are the
captives of the cursed family!"

Consequently, the duration that the Hussain convoy stayed in Kufa was
twelve days.10
