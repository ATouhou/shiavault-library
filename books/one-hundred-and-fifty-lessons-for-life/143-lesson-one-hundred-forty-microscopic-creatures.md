Lesson One Hundred Forty: Microscopic Creatures
===============================================

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اِنَّما قُلْنا «الَّطِيفُ» لِلْخَلْقِ اللَّطِيفِ... وَ ما لا يَكادُ
عُيُونُنا تَسْتَبِينَهُ لِدِمامَةِ خَلْقِها، لا تَراهُ عُيُونُنا وَ
لاتَلْمُسُهُ اَيْدِينا!
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

We say God is All-subtle due to His creation of very fine, minute
creatures; so small that we cannot see them and our hand does not feel
them.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

What you see above is a small part of a long tradition which Fat’h Ibn
Yazid Gorgani has narrated from Imam Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.), in which it is
described that ‘these animals are so tiny that they are never felt, and
are scattered among the waves of the seas and barks of trees, and
deserts and plains’.

This is a miraculous tradition from our Imam dating back about one
thousand years which means hundreds of years before the discoveries of
microbiology founder Louis Pasteur (1822-1895 AD).
