Following the Imam of the Age
=============================

Acting upon the rules and etiquettes of Imam (a.t.f.s.) is among the
vital dimensions of ‘Awaiting’ (Entezar). Anyone calling himself a Shia
should please Imam (a.t.f.s.) by this act and should strive in
fulfilling his aims and aspirations. Amir-ul-Mu’minin (a.s.) while
seated on the pulpit of Kufa said:

*“O Allah, verily, Thy land is helpless but to have a hujjah appointed
by Thee for Thy creatures for guiding them towards Thy religion and
teaching them Thy knowledge so that Thy proof (argument) is not rendered
null and the followers of Thy saints (prophets) do not get deviated
after having received guidance. This hujjah may be manifest and not
obeyed or may be in hiding and in the state of waiting. If he goes in
hiding at the time of guidance, then the believers set firm his holy
knowledge and etiquette in the hearts and act upon them.”*[^1]

Imam Sadiq (a.s.) says:

*“Truly, the master of this affair would go in hiding. So, (during that
time) a slave should fear Allah and should safeguard his religion.”*[^2]

*“Anyone wishing to be among the followers of the ‘Qaem’, should await
his advent while at the same time keeps himself aloof from sins and
adopts good ethics. If such a person dies before the ‘Qaem’s uprising,
his reward will be like the reward of someone who has been in the
presence of the ‘Qaem’. So strive hard and await his coming for you are
a group upon whom is the mercy.”*[^3]
