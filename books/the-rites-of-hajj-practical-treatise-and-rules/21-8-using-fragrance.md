8. Using Fragrance
==================

Using fragrance like perfumes, musk, saffron, rose water and other thing
by smelling or rubbing on the body or on clothing, or spraying in the
room or eating fragrant foods are Haraam for Muhrim men and women in the
state of Ihram.

Article 120

Eating fragrant fruits like apples and oranges is not a problem, but it
is better to abstain from smelling their fragrance.

Article 121

A Muhrim cannot wash himself/herself with aromatic soaps and shampoos,
and it is necessary to abstain from putting these things beside the
Ihram clothing, which causes them to be fragrant. Hajjis should not put
these objects in their sacks of their Ihram clothing.

Whenever a Muhrim reaches a place where there are pleasant odors
present, he/she should put something on the nose in order not to smell
the fragrance, unless this act causes him/her strong hardship. But
unlike this situation if a Muhrim reaches a place which has an
unpleasant odor he/she should not close the nose but can pass that place
quickly.

-----------

Smelling flowers is not permitted for a Muhrim as obligatory precaution.
