=================================================================

The following are conjunctions:

• Masculine:

    1. الّذی (single)

    2. اللّذانِ اللّذَینِ (dual)

    3. اللّذِینَ (plural)

• Feminine:

    1. **الّتی** (single)

    2. **اللّتانِ اللّّتَینِ** (dual)

    3. **اللّواتی اللاتی اللائی** (plural)

83. A definite noun with the *alif-lām* is any noun where an *alif* and
*lām* is added to make it definite. For example: **السَیف** (the sword),
**القَلَم** (the pen)

84. A prefixed noun is a noun that is constructed to a definite noun.
For example: **کِتابی** (my book), **کتابُ ﺇبراهیمَ** (Ibrāhīm's book),
**کتابُ المُعَلّم** (the teacher's book)
