44: A Special Prayer In A Particular Time For Hadiya Of Imam az-Zaman (aj)
==========================================================================

Sayyid Ibne Tawoos relates the following in his book Jamaal al-Usboo: It
is recommended to recite eight rakat prayer on Friday. Four rakats may
be presented as hadiya (gift) to the Holy Prophet (S) and four rakats to
Fatima Zahra (s.a.). Then four rakats should be recited on Saturday and
made hadiya to Amirul Momineen (as). In this way every subsequent day
recite prayer of four rakats and gift (hadiya) to each succeeding Imam
(aj).

Again the next Friday recite eight rakat Namaz and gift Thawab of four
rakats to the Messenger of Allah (S) and of four rakats to Fatima Zahra
(s.a.). Again on Saturday recite four rakat prayer and make hadiya to
Imam Musa al-Kazim (as) and till Thursday next continue to pray four
rakats everyday and give hadiya to each Imam (as) in turn. Then on
Friday recite a four rakat prayer for hadiya of Imam az-Zaman (aj) and
after two rakats recite the following Dua:

O Allah, You are peace, the peace is from You; all peace returns to You,
O Lord, cause us to live with Your peace, O Allah, these units of prayer
from me are dedicated to the Proof (Hujjat), son of al-Hasan, so, O
Allah, bless Muhammad and the progeny of Muhammad and extend it to him,
O Allah, bestow on me the best of my hope and expectation in You and
Your Prophet, may Your blessings be on him and his holy progeny.

In place of so and so son of so and so recite the name of the particular
Masoom for whose hadiya we are reciting the prayer.
