Story no. 76: The children’s complain against their parents.
============================================================

Mar’at, Ilham and Aram were brothers and sisters.  
 One day they were talking about the jobs of their household when Mar’at
said “I dont think that there are any mothers and fathers like ours”.  
 Ilham said “I am pleased with both of them but I don’t know about
them”.  
 Aram said “I dont think any of the children are as lucky as us. But I
have noticed one thing about mother and father; whenever we talk to them
they do not pay attention to what we are saying, it is also possible
that we want something”.  
 They decided to discuss this important matter to their parents.

Yes, it is very good if parents pay attention to their children and
grant their wishes when possible.
