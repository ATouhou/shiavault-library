***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

The sixteenth Surah of the Glorious Qur’an which contains 128 verses is
called ‘Nahl’ ‘Bees’ owing to allusions made in it to the creation of
bees.

Notwithstanding the Qur’an is a Book of Divine legislation, but many of
its Suras are named based on creation, such as An-Najm (star),
‘Ash-Shams’ (the sun), ‘Al-Fil’ (the elephant), ‘Al-‘Ankabūt’ (spider),
and ‘An-Nahl’ (the bee).

These names are clues as to the fact that all the creatures whether in
the sky or on the earth, whether small or great, they are all equal to
Him due to His Power, and the Book of legislation is based on the Book
of nature, both of which have their sources in one origin.

One of the names of this Surah is ‘the Surah of the Blessings’ for there
are the names of over 50 blessings mentioned in it.

The issues dealt with in this Surah are: the Divine blessings, reasons
for monotheism and resurrection, ordinances concerning the Holy war, the
threats against the pagans, the dissuasions of injustice, indecency,
breaking of one’s promises, innovations, and satanical temptations.

Incidentally, most of the commentators are of the opinion that it is
understood from the occasions of the revelation of the verses of this
Surah that the first forty verses of it have been revealed at the end of
the Meccan era, while the remaining eighty eight were revealed during
the early period of the migration to Medina. Therefore, this holy Surah
is both Meccan as well as Medinite.

The Virtues of Reading This Surah
---------------------------------

In some quotations narrated from the Prophet (S), it has been confirmed
that he said:

*“He who recites this Surah, Allah will not hold him accountable for the
blessings which He has bestowed on him in this world.”*

All means will be made available to him to go to Paradise. [^1]

Certainly, that kind of reading is meant hereby that is coupled with
meditation and decision which leads one to practice and taking steps on
the path of gratitude.
