M - Muhajir Ibn Aws
===================

Amongst Omer Ibn Sa'ad's army. When he saw Hor Ibn Yazeed Alreyahi come
closer to Imam Husayn's tents he came up to him and said: 'Why Hurr, if
I was told who is the strongest man in Kufa I would have said without
any doubt you. Why do you look so weak now?' Hurr answered him: 'I see
myself between Paradise and Hellfire, and by God I shall choose nothing
over Paradise'. It was then that Hurr joined the Imam's army.
