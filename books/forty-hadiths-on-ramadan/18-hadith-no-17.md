Ramadan: The Month of Spiritual Striving
----------------------------------------

In his testament to his sons, Imam Sadiq (A.S.) said: When the month of
Ramadan arrives, exert yourselves, for surely it is in this month that
livelihood is distributed, the hour of death is ordained and the
arriving for Hajj is decreed. In it is a night, deeds in which are
better than deeds in a thousand months.*Al-Kafi, vol. 4, pg. 66*
