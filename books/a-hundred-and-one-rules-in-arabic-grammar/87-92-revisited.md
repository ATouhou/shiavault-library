92. ما (Revisited)
==================

We mentioned earlier three possible ways of using this word. The fourth
possibility for using**ما** is as a relative pronoun like**الذي** . With
that, it can introduce a relative clause for an antecedent that is only
expressed in a form of an object pronoun.

**اُحِبُّ ما / الذي قـَرأتـُهُ هذا الأسبوعَ.**

I like what I read this week.
