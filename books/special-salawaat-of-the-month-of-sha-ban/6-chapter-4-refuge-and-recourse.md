Uniqueness And Recourse
-----------------------

The most fundamental belief that has superiority and prominence is
uniqueness of God or as we call it Tawhid. This principle means that you
must not worship anyone and there is no creator for this world and there
is not any power except Allah. (ما شاءَ اللَّهُ لا قُوَّةَ إِلاَّ
بِاللَّه‏، الکهف ،39)

“It is as Allah has pleased. There is no power save in Allah”[^1].

Likewise believing in every indecent power and effect besides Allah is
also heresy. However while guarding our thoughts from heresy we must
also keep in mind that the wisdom of Allah dictates that He chooses an
instrument to get every job done. For example the power of healing is in
the Hand of Allah but for curing any diseases we must go to doctors and
use medicine. We must keep in our mind that the power of the mind of
that doctor and the effect of that medicine is also by Allah. Another
example that we must keep in mind is that the Sustainer of all creatures
is Allah. “Surely Allah is the bestower of sustenance”[^2] But we must
strive and work for the attainment of our sustenance.

Similarly, in the spiritual wayfaring there are some spiritual actions
that God prescribes for getting closer to Him. Dua is one of the
important ones. “Say: My Lord would not care for you were it not for
your prayer; but you have indeed rejected(the truth) so that which shall
cleave shall come”[^3]

Another one or maybe the most important one is intercession and the
phrases from the Salawat mentioned at the beginning of this chapter
highlight this.

Intercession in The Holy Quran
------------------------------

The Holy Quran enunciates resorting to Prophet and says,

> " ما أَرْسَلْنا مِنْ رَسُولٍ إِلاَّ لِيُطاعَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَ لَوْ
> أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جاؤُكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَ
> اسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّاباً رَحيماً "
> 40

***If when they had been unjust to themselves, (they) had come to you
(Muhammad) and begged Allah's Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged
forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allah All-Forgiving
(One who accepts repentance), Most Merciful.(4:64)***

Also in another Ayah it says:

> "یاأَيُّهَا الَّذينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَ ابْتَغُوا إِلَيْهِ
> الْوَسيلَةَ وَ جاهِدُوا في‏ سَبيلِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ41"

***O you who believe! Do your duty to Allah and fear Him. Seek the means
of approach to Him, and strive hard in His Cause as much as you can. So
that you may be successful.(5:35)***

Muslims throughout history have spent their money, time and even given
up their lives to execute the Quranic order. It has always been a
prevalent tradition among Muslims to visit the tomb of our beloved
Prophet and his Ahlul Bayt. The aversion shown towards this act by a
small group in the name of Wahabism (that was made up two centuries ago
by provocation of an English spy) is not something that can stand
against this deep-rooted tradition.

Intercession in Ahadith
-----------------------

In the Ahadith of the Prophet and the Ahlul Bayt, intercession is
strongly recommended and it has been constantly repeated in their
stories and traditions. There are many examples even from the resources
of the scholars of the Ahle Sunnat. Here we mention just two of them.

Hakim Neyshabori in the book of Mostadrak narrates from Omar, “The
Prophet said, “When Adam made that mistake, he told Allah, “O My Lord, I
ask you by the name of Mohammad to forgive me.” Allah replied, “How do
you know him notwithstanding I did not create him yet?” Adam said, “When
You created me by Your Mighty Hand and you blew your spirit into my
body, I looked to the pillar of Your Throne and I saw these words “There
is no lord but Allah and Muhammad is Allah’s Messenger.” So I understood
that Muhammad is the most beloved creature to You because You put his
name beside Yours” Allah addressed him and said, “You are right. He is
the most beloved to Me and because you have asked forgiveness in his
name I will forgive you and if Muhammad would not have existed I would
not have even created you.”[^4]

The matter of intercession is definite and accepted between all Muslims
and it is not a recent issue. In history we see when Mansor Al-Abassi
went for Hajj, he went to Medina to visit the Prophet’s tomb. Malik Ebn
Anas, the leader of the sect of the Maleki, told him, “Reduce your voice
because respecting the Prophet is essential whether he is dead or
alive.” Al-Mansor asked him, “When I am praying or reciting Dua, should
I face the Prophet’s grave or the Qibleh?” Malik said, “Why would you
want to turn your face away from the Prophet whereas he is your
interceder and the interceder of your Father Adam to Allah. Face him and
ask him for intercession because Allah has said, “If when they had been
unjust to themselves, (they) had come to you (Muhammad) and begged
Allah's Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them:
indeed, they would have found Allah All-Forgiving (One who accepts
repentance), Most Merciful”[^5].

Nevertheless, in the Shia theology, the issue of intercession has more
depth and is more widely discussed.

  </p>
</blockquote>

In a hadith, Ibn Fahd Helly narrates with the chain of narration that
Salman says, “I heard from the Prophet, “God says, “My servant, if
someone is in great need of you, you will not fulfil his need unless he
resorts to your beloved. Then out of respect you give his need. Thus the
most beloved and the most preferred people to me in this world are
Mohammad, his brother Ali and his successors. They are your interceders
to your God. So anyone who has a wish to make a profit or has a calamity
that he wants to avoid should ask Me by the name of Muhammad. Then I
will give him what he wants in the best shape.” This hadith has been
narrated in the Tafsir of Imam Hasan Askari[^6].

There are other kinds of Ahadith about intercession as well that
announce a way of resorting such as the following.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
َالکلینی بسنده عَنْ سَمَاعَةَ قَالَ قَالَ لِي أَبُو الْحَسَنِ ع إِذَا
كَانَ لَكَ يَا سَمَاعَةُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ حَاجَةٌ فَقُلِ اللَّهُمَّ
إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ بِحَقِّ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ عَلِيٍّ فَإِنَّ لَهُمَا
عِنْدَكَ شَأْناً مِنَ الشَّأْنِ وَ قَدْراً مِنَ الْقَدْرِ فَبِحَقِّ
ذَلِكَ الشَّأْنِ وَ بِحَقِّ ذَلِكَ الْقَدْرِ أَنْ تُصَلِّيَ عَلَى
مُحَمَّدٍ وَ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ بِي كَذَا وَ كَذَا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Kulayni narrates with a chain of narration from Samaeh. Samaeh narrates
from Imam Mossa Al-Kazem, “Samaeh whenever you have a request from God,
say “O, Allah I ask you to send your peace and blessings to
Mohammad -peace be upon him- and Ali because they are have a great place
and prodigious excellency before you. I swear by this Excellency, send
your peace and blessings to Mohammad and his household and please do
this or that for me.[^7]

Intercession Of The Righteous
-----------------------------

Sometimes we may think that intercession is only for sinners or for
regular people, but we see that even prophets and righteous people
resort to our Prophet and his household. This is mentioned in lots of
Ahadith.

> سَعِيدُ بْنُ هِبَةِ اللَّهِ الرَّاوَنْدِيُّ فِي قِصَصِ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ
> بِسَنَدِهِ بْنِ فَضَّالٍ عَنْ أَبِيهِ عَنِ الرِّضَا علیه السلام قَالَ:
> "لَمَّا أَشْرَفَ نُوحٌ عَلَى الْغَرَقِ دَعَا اللَّهَ بِحَقِّنَا
> فَدَفَعَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ الْغَرَقَ وَ لَمَّا رُمِيَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ فِي
> النَّارِ دَعَا اللَّهَ بِحَقِّنَا فَجَعَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ النَّارَ
> بَرْداً وَ سَلَاماً وَ إِنَّ مُوسَى لَمَّا ضَرَبَ طَرِيقاً فِي
> الْبَحْرِ دَعَا اللَّهَ بِحَقِّنَا فَجُعِلَ يَبَساً وَ إِنَّ عِيسَى
> لَمَّا أَرَادَ الْيَهُودُ قَتْلَهُ دَعَا اللَّهَ بِحَقِّنَا فَنَجَا
> مِنَ الْقَتْلِ فَرَفَعَهُ إِلَيْهِ"46

Our great scholar Ravandi in the book of Qassas of Al-Ambia (stories of
prophets) narrates from Imam Ridha’, “When the ship of Noah was about to
drown, he asked Allah by our right and Allah saved him from being
drowned. Also when Abraham was thrown into the fire, he asked Allah by
our right, so the fire turned cold and safe for him. In addition, when
Moses reached the sea, he too asked Allah by our right therefore God
dried his way. Indeed when the Jews wanted to kill Jesus, he asked Allah
by our right, because of which he was saved from murder and God elevated
him to Himself.”

Sheikh Hor Al-Ameli talking about resorting to the Prophet and the Ahlul
Bayt says, “Ahadith that are narrated about resorting are many. There
are also many AHadith and Duas full of intercession that the Ahle
Al-Sunnah narrate.[^8]
