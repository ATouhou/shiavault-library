Lesson 1o : Prophets & Scriptures
=================================

Almighty God did not leave man alone; he sent guidance in the form of
prophets and messengers. According to the common belief of all Muslims,
God sent 124,000 prophets and messengers to guide mankind in all parts
of the world.

The first was Prophet Adam and the last was Prophet Muhammad (peace be
upon them both).
The basic faith of all the prophets was the same: to call people to the
One and Only God (tawhid) and bring peace in human society; the
differences are only in the codes of law.

However, not all the 124,000 prophets were of the same rank and status;
some were greater than the other; some were sent as assistants to those
messengers who came before them; some were given a holy scripture while
others were not.

There were some prophets who came with divine laws which their
followers were to implement. Such prophets were higher in rank over the
others, and are known as ulu 'l-^azm prophets. Ulu 'l66 ‘azm means
"those who possess great responsibility". The ulu 'l- 'azm prophets are
five:

1. Prophet Nuh (a.s.) known in English as Noah.
2. Prophet Ibrahim (a.s.) known in English as Abraham.
3. Prophet Musa (a.s.) known in English as Moses. A person who believes
in the message of Prophet Musa (a.s.) is known as a Jew.
4. Prophet 'Isa (a.s.) known in English as Jesus. A person who follows
the message of Prophet 'Isa (a.s.) is known as a Christian.
5. Prophet Muhammad (a.s.). A person who follows the message of Prophet
Muhammad (a.s.) is known as a Muslim.

The divine laws brought by Prophet Nuh were followed till the advent of
Prophet Ibrahim and the more advanced divine laws were sent by God
through him.

Then Prophet Musa was sent with a new set of laws which were even more
elaborate; Musa was followed by Prophet "Isa who modified the laws of
Musa. Last of all came Prophet Muhammad with the most perfect and
comprehensive divine law. No prophet or Holy Scripture is to be sent
after Muhammad (a.s.).

Many prophets were also given scriptures—God commandments sent to
mankind through His prophets and messengers.

The scriptures that were revealed to Prophet Nuh and Prophet Ibrahim
are not well-known. The Qur'an talks about scrolls (suhuf) of Ibrahim
which shows that many books were revealed to him.

The most famous scriptures revealed to the prophets are the
following:

1. The Tawrat (Torah) revealed to Prophet Musa.
2. The Zabur (Psalms) revealed to Prophet Dawud (a.s.) known in English
as David.
3. The Injil (Gospel) revealed to Prophet Isa.
4. The Qur'an (pronounced as Qur-aan) revealed to Prophet Muhammad.
