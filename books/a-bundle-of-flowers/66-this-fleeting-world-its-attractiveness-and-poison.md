This Fleeting World, Its Attractiveness and Poison
==================================================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "At the moment when the coffin of a person is
being lifted and carried, the concerning soul follows its corpse and
regretfully calls: 'O you my children and my relatives! Beware that the
world does not cheat you as it did me. I gathered wealth regardless of
it being lawful or unlawful and left all of it for others. Now I am left
with its burden upon me while they enjoy the fruit of it; therefore,
avoid that which is similar to what happened to me'."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 6, p. 161

Imam Amir ul Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) said: "If man perceived his death and
its speed towards him, he would certainly detest the world and its
hopes."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 73, p. 166

Imam al-Kadhim, the seventh Imam (‘a), said: "The likeness of this world
is as a snake which is soft to the touch while there is killing poison
in its inside. Possessors of wisdom avoid it but children (naive ones)
are fond of it and like to catch it with their hands."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 78, p. 311

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "The love of this fleeting world is the origin
of all vices."

Al-Kafi, vol. 2, p. 315
