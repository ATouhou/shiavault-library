Introduction
============

This account is based principally on the account of Abu Mikhnaf (d. 132
A.H.) as it has been preserved in the writings of al-Tabari. The works
of other historians such as Ibn al-A'tham, al-Dinawari, and al-Ya'qubi
have also been referred to. Before disÂ­cussing the events that
culminated in the murder of the Prophet's grandson, it will be necessary
to discuss briefly, the situation that had developed in al-Kufa during
the previous twenty years.
