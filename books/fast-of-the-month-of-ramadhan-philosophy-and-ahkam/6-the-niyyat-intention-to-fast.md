The Niyyat (Intention) to Fast
==============================

When the crescent is sighted in your area or country, a *niyyat*, that
is, a silent declaration of intention should be made to fast during this
sacred month to attain nearness to Allah (*wajib qurbatan ila-Allah*).
Just like the five daily prayers, the *niyyat* of fast is obligatory and
mental, and so is the case of every deed according to Islam.
