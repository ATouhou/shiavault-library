Conclusion
==========

It is clear from what we have mentioned above that the question of
interpolation or profanity occurring in the Qur'an is baseless,
advocated by those who have poor judgement, or those who refuse to
ponder, or those who are infatuated with the task of disproving the
Qur'an â€‘ and indeed, infatuation makes a person blind and deaf. A person
with intellect and sense of justice can have no doubt about
groundlessness of this presumption.
