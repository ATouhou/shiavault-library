1: the Opening (fatihah)
========================

This initial or prefatory chapter is made up of seven verses from the
period which the Prophet passed in Mecca. It was revealed after The Man
Wearing a Cloak 74 and before The Flame 111.

The chapter has classical expression, and is "simple in wording but full
of meaning, " which eventually works into our consciousness as we repeat
it dally.

This is the customary invocation used in Islamic ceremonies of all
kinds, and it forms a true prayer, occupying somewhat the same place in
Islam as the Lord's prayer does with Christians. The chapter is often
said to contain the " essence of the Qur'an and in 15:VI it is called
the " Seven Oft-Repeated Verses This chapter should be read attentively
since many Islamic terms are introduced here and thus require
explanation, especially as they are repeated daily by every Muslim. It
also bears witness to God's presence everywhere.
