Ali (peace be upon him) on the Fatima’s Grave:
==============================================

After Fatima’s burial, Ali (peace be upon him) felt the pain of
seperation and got impatient. Nothing could console him on her grave
except two Rakats of prayer as well as the verse “ استعينوا
بالصبروالصلوة”.

Ali (peace be upon him) did not only lose his wife but his confidant and
partner.

Ali’s crying on her grave was an incarnation of a powerful emotion,
overcoming his natural forces on her grave, Ali (peace be upon him)
addressed her, “dear Zahra! I leave you but not because I do not like
your company, and if I settle near your grave is not because I have lost
my patience, for I am hopeful with Allah’s promise concerning the
patience.”

Yes, whenever he wanted to console his soul, he went to her grave and
opened his heart to her.
