Part 6: Iqaaat (Unilateral Pronouncement)
=========================================

Muhaqqiq divided these into eleven Chapters. In Iq'aa pronouncing a
formula is necessary, but it does not have two sides. It is done
unilaterally.

Chapter One­: Kitab Al­talaq
----------------------------

Dissolution of marriage ­ It is either Absolute (Bain) or Revocable
(Raje'e). The revocable Talaq is that in which the husband has the power
of revocation during the Iddat period, while in the absolute, the
husband has no power of revocation. This chapter discusses all the laws
in this connection. It also sets down all the conditions for Talaq to be
valid.

Chapter Two: Kitab Al­khula' & Mubaraat
---------------------------------------

These are two other types of absolute divorce. Khula' is when wife has a
dislike for her husband and asks him to divorce her in exchange of a
sum, or all or part of her Mahr. In such a case, when the husband agrees
to divorce, he forfeits the power of revocation, except when the wife
agrees to take back the money or ransom she gave.

Mubaraat is when dislike is mutual, and in this case also the wife has
to pay some ransom to the husband. However, the ransom paid in the case
of Mubaraat should not exceed the Mahr. This divorce is also absolute.

Chapter Three: ­ Kitab Al­dhihar
--------------------------------

In the pre­Islamic era, when husband said to his wife "you are on me
like the back of my mother", it was construed as Divorce. Islam has
effected an important change. It does not recognise Dhihar as a form of
divorce, but whoever does this ought to pay kaffara before he can resume
conjugal relations with his wife. This kaffara is freeing a slave, and
if that is not possible, he shall fast for two consecutive months. And
if that is not possible also, then he should feed sixty poor.

Chapter Four: ­Kitab Al­eela'
-----------------------------

It is an oath by God, wherein the husband swears that he would never
have conjugal relation with his wife, or that he would not have the
relation for a period exceeding four months. In such a case, when the
wife complains to Hakime Shara', the husband would be given a choice
either to divorce her or to abrogate the oath. Naturally, if the husband
abrogates the oath, he will pay the expiation (kaffara). In general,
Islam forbids abrogating the oaths, but in this case it recommends.

Chapter Five: ­Kitab Al­lian
----------------------------

This chapter deals with the slander or denial of a child. The law of
accusing someone without adequate proof etc. are also discussed. Husband
stands before Hakime Sharia and pronounces Lian, saying four times: "God
is my witness, that I am truthful in my accusation against my wife".
Then he says: "May God curse me if I were not speaking the truth".

Thereafter, the wife says four times: "God be my witness that my husband
has lied and accused me wrongly". Then she adds: "Curse of God befall me
if I was lying". When this process is complete, the marriage is
irrevocably dissolved.

Chapter Six: ­Kitab Al­itq
--------------------------

ùIt discusses about freeing the slaves. Islam does not encourage slavery
that is why we do not find a chapter on 'al­Riqq', (enslaving); the only
chapter is 'al­ltq' (freeing, liberating). The chapter outlines
circumstances in which the slaves are voluntarily or automatically
liberated.

Chapter Seven: ­Kitab Al­tadbeer, Mukatibah & Isteelad
------------------------------------------------------

This chapter deals with specific circumstances whicl1 lead to freeing
the slaves. Al­tadbeer is when the master makes a will stating that his
slave will be free upon his death. Mukatibah is when a slave wishes to
enter into an agreement witl1 his master that he be freed in exchange of
some consideration.

The Holy Quran says that if the master finds the slave capable and
righteous, he should accede to the wishes of the slave, and also endow
him with some of his own wealth. Isteelad is an automatic process. When
a female slave, for example, becomes pregnant by her master, such a
female slave will revert to her offspring upon her husband's (master's)
death. And since she is the mother, and Islam does not allow anyone to
be a slave of his or her forbearers however high, and descendants
however low, the female slave will automatically be free.

Chapter Eight: ­Iritab Al­iqrar
-------------------------------

It deals with admission and is connected with the judiciary. When a
person makes a claim against someone and has no evidence or witness to
substantiate it, the claim is not admissible. But if the debtor himself
wishes to admit the debt, which is Iqrar, then it is deemed adequate.

Chapter Nine: ­ Kitab Al­jialah
-------------------------------

It means offering a wage or reward. Apparently, it resembles the act of
hiring a worker or a labourer for a particular piece of work against
agreed amount. But in Jialah, the employer does not hire a particular
person, he makes a public announcement stating that whoever would do a
certain job for him, he would pay him a certain amount.

Chapter Ten: ­ Kitab Al­ayman
-----------------------------

Ayman is plural of Yameen, which means an oath. In this chapter, the
sanctity of a religious oath, taken in the name of Allah, is discussed.
It describes the implication of taking an oath in the name of Allah, the
types of oath, perjury and the expiation for one who breaks the oath.

Chapter Eleven: ­ Kitab Al­nadhr
--------------------------------

Nadhr is a solemn vow, or pledge made in the name of Allah. It explains
the formula which one has to pronounce or at least to have it in mind
before nadhr is formally established, and the occasions for nadhr. A
nadhr made for a mubah (ordinarily permissible) thing, having no
legitimate benefit here or hereafter, is not valid. Both oath and nadhr
are a covenant made witl1 Allah and they must be honoured.
