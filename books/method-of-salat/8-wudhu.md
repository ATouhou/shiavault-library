( Wudhu )
=========

It is compulsory to perform Wudhu for all the wajib Salat, with the
exception of Salat al-Mayyit (Salat for the deceased person). In Wudhu,
we wash our face and hands; and wipe our head and the top of our feet.

1. First, the face must be washed from the top of the forehead, the
place where the hair grows, until the bottom of the chin. The width of
the face that must be washed is the distance between the tip of the
thumb to the tip of the middle finger. We must wash our face from top to
bottom.

2. After washing our face, then we wash our right arm, from slightly
above the elbow down to our fingertips. This too must be washed from top
to bottom.

4. After these washings, are completed, with the water that is on our
right hand, we have to wipe the top of our head (hum about the distance
of one finger). We must not take any extra water for this.

tip of our toes, up to the ankle bone with the water that is remaining
in our right hand. Again, we must not take any extra water.
