Responsibility 47: Remembering the Imam Frequently Part 2
=========================================================

A true believer must always remember the Imam in all acts of worship
whether obligatory or recommended even in the Salat. One must be aware
that we are performing the Salat in the presence of Imam al-Zaman (ajtf)
and we must realize that the Imam is watching us.

When a true believer says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 إِهْدِنَا صِرَاطَ الْـمُسْتَقِيمَ. صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ
عَلَيْهِمْ... 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Keep us on the straight path, the path of those whom You have
blessed”*** [^1]

One must remember that the Imam is the Siratul Mustaqim (the Straight
Path) and Allah completed and perfected His bounties and favours upon
him and his forefathers.

When one recites the Tashahhud and says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلىٰ مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“O’Allah! Send your prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad”
then at this time too, one must remember the Imam since he is the most
perfect manifestation of the family of Muhammad!

When a believer recites the Salam in the Salat and says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَلسَّلاَمُ عَلَيْنَا وَ عَلى عِبَادِ اللٌّهِ الصَّالِحِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Peace be upon us and upon the righteous servants of Allah” or one says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَلسَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللٌّهِ وَ بَرَكَاتُهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Peace be upon all of you and may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon you as well” then one must also remember the Imam and the righteous
servants of Allah and realize that this line is actually being spoken to
Imam al-Mahdi (ajtf).

Even during the Ruku’, Sujud, Qunut one must remember the Imam in short,
one must always be thinking about him.

This great personality must always be in our minds and the focus of our
intentions, and when we send prayers upon him and his noble family we
must say:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلىٰ مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“O’Allah! Send your prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.”
