Consensus Concluded When Dispute Dissipated.
--------------------------------------------

**Safar 28, 1330**

Sunnis do not deny the fact that the allegiance was not taken after
consultation or serious consideration. Rather, they admit that it took
place suddenly and unexpectedly. They do not deny going against the wish
of the Ansar and their preference of Saâ€™d, nor in opposing the
descendants of Hashim and their followers from the Muhajirun and Ansar
who joined the Imam (as) in his boycott.

But they say that the caliphate was finally vested upon Abu Bakr who was
accepted by everyone as the Imam; dispute dissipated, hostilities
halted, and everyone became determined to support al-Siddiq and provide
him with counsel in secrecy and in public; therefore, they fought in his
wars, they supported him when he concluded a peace treaty, and they
carried out his orders.

Nobody at all differed in that regard, thus a total consensus was
finally reached, and the consignment of caliphate was accomplished;
praise be to Allah for having united their word after their dissension,
and for unifying their hearts after their discord, Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*S*
