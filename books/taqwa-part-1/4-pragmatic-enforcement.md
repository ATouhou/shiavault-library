Pragmatic Enforcement
=====================

In some books on spirituality, reference is made to some people who used
some practical method to force themselves to abide by divine law. For
example, they used to put pebbles in their mouths to control their
tongue from over-speaking or engaging in idle and/or prohibited talk.
Usually this type of approach is taken to represent the perfect example
of piety.

However, imposing pragmatic obligations on oneself in order to refrain
from committing sins does not necessarily mean one has perfected
himself. If we succeed in doing so and abstain from committing sins,
indeed, we have refrained from committing sins, yet our soul has not
changed. It is simply inactive because it has no means to commit wrong.

Thus, true perfection lies in a personâ€™s freedom to do wrong and yet he
chooses to refrain from sinning without practically imposing anything on
himself. These kinds of preventions may be considered perfection only
when they are seen as preliminaries to primary stages of creating the
attribute of piety.

That is because piety can be created after a course of opposing
practices against wrong acts. But the real essence of piety is far from
these practices. It is the great and potent holy state of the soul that
supports and protects human beings. One has to struggle to achieve the
true essence of piety.
