113: Dawn (falaq)
=================

These 5 Meccan verses were revealed after The Elephant 105 and before
the next and final chapter on Mankind 114. The theme of the title is
similar to that ofÂ  Daybreak 89.

This and the next chapter are called Al-Mu\`awwidhatan or \`Two
Entreaties or else Al-Mudanniyatan, \` the Pair that bring one close [to
God] \`, which are invoked in times of anxiety. This short chapter thus
forms a true prayer which may be used to dispel superstitious doubt
since it shows that something we think

of as being evil may actually have another purpose, especially if we can
consider it from some fresh aspect or point of view.
