he is the most learned man about the genealogy, the chronology, and the
history of the pre-Islamic days of darkness and the poetry of Arabs.

have certainly gained a large share. You must be very careful, when
acquiring such knowledge, to see from what kinds of people you receive
them.

Among us (the Ahlul Bayt, family of the holy Prophet s.a.) after every

fallacious ones and the interpretations of the ignorant ones."

narrate your Hadith. Which of these two people is better?" The Imam
replied, "The one who narrates our Hadith and ties them up to the hearts
of our followers is better than seventy thousand worshippers."
