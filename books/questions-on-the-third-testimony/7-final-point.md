The fundamental principles of Islam are five in number. AL KAFI - H
1480, CH 10, h 3

Abu Ali al-Ash'ari has narrated from al-Hassan ibn Ali al-Kufi from
'Abbas ibn 'Amir from Aban ibn 'Uthman from Fudayl ibn Yasar from abu
Ja'far, recipient of divine supreme cove- nant, who has said the
following: "Abu Ja'far, recipient of divine supreme covenant, has
said,
'Islam is based on five principles. They are: Prayer, al-Zakat
(charity), Fasting, Hajj and al-Wilayah. The call to none of the other
principles has been as emphatic as it has been to al-Wilayah. People
accepted the other four but they left aside this i.e. al- Wilayah.'"

There you are! Is this complete proof or what? In the books of the
Mujtahids that they give us (Tawzeeh Ul Masaail) you will find the four
principles of Islam. You will find therein:

Prayer - Salaat
Fasting - Sawm
Pilgrimage - Hajj
Charity - Zakaat
Khums

Hey wait a minute! That's five as well, you say!

Sure they are five, but Al Wilayah has been replaced by Khums, the
payment of which is not even obligatory any more (See booklet 'Questions
On Khums'). I wonder who is behind this. Reeks of a conspiracy to me.

Looks like It is the money that turns the wheel in the realm of the
Mujtahids. Bashir Alidina
