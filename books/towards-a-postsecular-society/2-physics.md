Physics
=======

Let us examine each of these contexts in turn.

The relationship between physics and mysticism is a contentious one, and
my own contribution to this debate (“Against Scientific Magisterial
Imperialism” published in*Network* , April 2002) argues forcibly against
the idea that physics directly supports the mystical worldview. (We
noted too that Ken Wilber was one of the first to point this out in his
book ‘Quantum Questions’.) However as a cultural phenomenon, there is no
doubt that the stream of writings begun by Capra and Zukav has had an
enormous impact in terms of a new receptivity to the spiritual. And
there is no doubt that the parallels between the ‘new’ physics and
mysticism deserve close scrutiny, though a postsecular interpretation -
which makes the spiritual a more equal partner in this debate - may
yield quite different insights. What the ‘new’ sciences carry in common
is what Stephen Hawking has called the ‘end of physics,’ that is, by
analogy with Gödel’s theorem in mathematics, an implication of the
limits to understanding as pursued by science. Beyond this is what
Tipler and Barrow have called the ‘anthropic’ principle, a quality in
the new physics that refers us back to ourselves, indeed which raises
what to the philosopher is the spectre of solipsism, but what to the
mystic is the bread and butter of spiritual experience.
