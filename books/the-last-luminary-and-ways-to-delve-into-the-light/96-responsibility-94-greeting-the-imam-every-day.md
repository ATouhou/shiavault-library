Responsibility 94: Greeting the Imam Every Day
==============================================

The true believers must perform the Ziyarat and send greetings to the
Imam every week rather if possible, this should be done every day!

Greeting the Imam can be done at any place and time however it is best
to greet the Imam during those times and in those places which he has a
special affinity to, such as the night and day of Jumu’ah, the Nights of
Qadr in the month of Ramaďhan, the 15th of Sha’ban and special places
such as Masjid as-Sahlah and Masjid Jamkaran.

It is recommended to read the Ziyarat of Imam al-Mahdi (ajtf) every day
and the visitation rights and salutation to him should be those which
have been taught to us by the Ahlul Bayt (as) and recorded in the books
of prayers and supplication. These prayers include Ziyarat Aale
Yasin[^1] which can be read at any time one wishes to greet Imam al-’Asr
(ajtf), and it starts with[^2]:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
سَلاَمٌ عَلٰى آلِ يٰسۤ، أَلسَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكَ يا دَاعِيَ اللهِ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Peace be upon the family of Yasin. Peace be upon you O’ caller to
Allah...”

In addition, the other special Ziyarat[^3] for the 12th Imam on the day
of Jumu’ah should also be recited [this Ziyarat will be mentioned in the
next responsibility.]
