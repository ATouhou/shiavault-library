( Tasbihat Al-arba'h )
======================

If we are praying a three or four Rak'at Salat, then after reciting the
Tashahud in the second Rak'at, we immediately stand up and recite the
Tasbihat al-Arba'h three times:

#### سُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَ الْحَمْدُ لِلّهِ وَ لاَ إلهَ إلاَّ اللهُ وَ اللهُ أكْبَرُ

###### *Subhaanal-laahi wal-hamdu lil-laahi wa laa illaha illal-laahu wal-laahu Akbar  
* (Glory be to Allah and praise be to Allah and there is no god except Allah and Allah is Greater than anything else)

We then go into Ruku' followed by Sajdah, and after performing the two
Sajdahs, we recite the Tashahhud and Salam. If we are reading a four
Rak'at Salat, then we read one more Rak'at just as the third Rak'at and
finish off the Salat with the Tashhahud and Salam.
