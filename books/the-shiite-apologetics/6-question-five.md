Question Five
=============

### Why do Shiites include the descendants of Muhammad when blessing him, saying, O Lord, bless Muhammad and his descendents?

Answer:
-------

It is obvious that the holy Prophet himself taught Muslims to bless him.
When the following verse was revealed: Surely Allah and His angels bless
the Prophet; O, ye who believe! Call for (Divine) blessings on him and
salute him with a (becoming) salutation. (33:50), the Muslims asked the
Prophet, How shall we salute you?

- Dont salute me incompletely, the Prophet answered.

-How, then, shall we salute you? they repeated.

- Say, he replied, O Lord, bless your apostle Muhammad and his
descendants.[1]

[1] Ibn Hajar, Al-Sawa\`iq al-Muhriqah, book 11, chap. 1, p. 146;
al-Durr al-Manthur, vol. 5; commenting on verse 56 of Chapter al-Ahzab,
the traditionists as well as the authors of Sihah and Masanid
(anthologies of traditions) such as \`Abd al-Razzaq, Ibn Abi-Shaybah,
Ahmad, al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu-Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah,
Ibn Mardawayh-all quoted similar statements from Ibn \`Ajrah, who
himself quoted from the Holy Prophet.

Saluting Muhammads descendants is so important that Shafii, in his
famous poem says:

*O descendants of our holy Prophet! Loving you is a precept recommended
by God in the Quran. Of the importance and elevation of your position it
suffices to say that whoever salutes you not, has performed no
prayers.*[1]
