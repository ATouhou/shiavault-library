Dedication
==========

*I dedicate (this book) to you... oh you who spread knowledge and light
in the earth.*

*To you, oh Apostle of Allah. To you, oh you who were the Last of the
prophets.*

*This humble book is about the life of your grandson, Ima\`m Mohammed
al-Ba\`qir. You called him Mohammed and gave him the nick-name as
Ba\`qir al-â€˜Ilm (the one who splits open knowledge). Thus, he renewed
your religion and enlivened your practices (sunna).*

*Therefore, no one is worthier of this dedication than you. Accept this
and be kind to me through your pleasure. So, it will be my provision on
the day when I meet Allah.*
