104: the Gossipmonger (humazah)
===============================

These 9 early Meccan verses were revealed after Resurrection 75 and
beforeÂ  [Winds] Sent Forth 77. As its name implies, the chapter deals
with slander of the Prophet, which hurt him deeply. The punishment
predicted is dire, yet natural, and to be expected.
