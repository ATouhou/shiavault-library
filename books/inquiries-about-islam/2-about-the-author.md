About the Author
================

Mohamad Jawad Chirri is a native of Lebanon and a graduate of the
distinguished religious institute of Najaf, in Iraq. He is a theologian
and lecturer. The Islamic Community invited him to Detroit, Michigan, in
1949. Imam Chirri is the director and spiritual leader of the Islamic
Center of America, 15571 Joy Road, Detroit, Michigan 48228.

His work extends far enough to include West Africa and the Middle East.
Two important Islamic schools of thought had been in disagreement and
dispute for centuries. While on a lecture tour of West Africa and the
Middle East, in 1959, Imam Chirri called upon the head of the Sunni
school, Sheikh Al-Azhar in Cairo, to recognize the other school.

In response to Imam Chirri's call, the majority leader issued a
historical declaration which stated that the teachings of both schools
are equally sound, and that Muslims have the right to choose either one.
