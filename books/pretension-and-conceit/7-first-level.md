First Level:
============

It has two degrees: In the **first** degree, one shows off the true
beliefs and divine branches of knowledge so he will be famous for being
pious and will have a status in people's hearts such as he may say, "I
see none effective in existence save All훮h," or he may say, "I rely on
none save All훮h". Or he may identify himself as being associated with
true beliefs by either affiliation or reference. This type of pretension
is the most widely circulated. For example, when either reliance on
All훮h or accepting His decree is discussed at a gathering, the pretender
will then sigh or move his head to beckon that he is on the path of
those who rely on or who accept the decree of All훮h.

In the **second** degree, he clears himself of or puts it above false
beliefs, seeking distinction and prominence in the hearts whether
explicitly or implicitly.
