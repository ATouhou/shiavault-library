Chapter 12: An Advice to Pregnant Women
=======================================

Pregnant women are advised to abstain from lifting heavy materials. They
should also avoid very tiring tasks. If a carrying mother tires herself,
she is likely to tire the baby too. In such cases there is the danger of
miscarriage of the pregnancy.

Travelling during the last months of pregnancy too is not advised. If
there is no urgent need of travelling, it is better the carrying mothers
do not undertake a journey in that period. However doing light work and
restricted movement is not harmful and, in fact, is beneficial for the
health of both the mother and the child.

Dr Jalali writes:

â€œExcessive fatigue in pregnant women gives rise to poisonous substances
in the blood. Since this blood is the source of nutrition for the
foetus, it can adversely affect the growth of the child.[^1]
