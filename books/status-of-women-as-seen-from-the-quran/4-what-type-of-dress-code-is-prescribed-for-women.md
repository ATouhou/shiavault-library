What Type of Dress Code Is Prescribed For Women?
================================================

Women have been identified in the Qur'an as a "zeenah" i.e. adornment
and beauty for all mankind.

"Adorned for the people are the worldly pleasures, such as the women,
having children, piles upon piles of gold and silver, trained horses,
livestock, and crops. These are the materials of this world. A far
better abode is reserved with Allah." (3:14) Since women are termed an
adornment or attraction (zeenah), they are required to cover certain
parts of their bodies. It should be noted that a woman being an
adornment for mankind is quite evident all over the world in all
societies.

The media is one example were she is quite abundantly promoted and made
as an attraction in place of men. Now since women are an open attraction
to mankind because of her bodily features, she is required to cover some
parts of herself in public. But before we see what are the physical
ingredients of her dress, let us see what Qur'an identifies as the best
dress.

**WHAT IS THE BEST DRESS?**

"O Children of Adam ! Surely We have sent down to you a garment that
would cover your shame and be a good vesture. And the garment of Piety
that is the best. That is from the Ayat (Signs) of Allah that they may
take reminder." (7:26)

Above verse says that the best dress is the garment of "taqwa" or
piety. Before wearing any physical garment we should adorn ourselves
with the garment of "taqwa" as without it we become prone to the vile
intentions of satanic people. (see 7:27)

**Ingredients Of Womens Dress In Public**

The areas of body which are to be covered by women in public, are
mentioned in 24:31. Allah informs us through His messenger:

"And say to the Believing Women,to lower their gaze and guard their
private parts. And they should not display their adornment save what is
apparent therefrom. And they should place their covers over their
bossoms. And they should not display their adornment except to their
husbands or their fathers or the fathers of their husbands or their sons
or the sons of their husbands or their brothers or their brother's sons
or sister's sons\` or their women or those whom their right hands posses
or Those under their authority other than skillfull men or small
children who are not aware of women's nakedness.

And they should not strike their feet so as to make known what they
hide of their adornment. O Believers turn you all together to Allah so
that you may be successful."(24:31)

From the above verse the following points are derived: 1. Women have
two types of "zeenah" i.e. beauty and adornment. (a) "ma zahara minha"
What is already apparent from their adornment and beauty. (b) "ma
yukhfaina min zinata hunne" That which is hidden from their adornment.

2. She is to cover her whole self publicly except those areas which are
apparent from her adornment. These areas are the exposed areas which if
covered will restrict daily work and have to be uncovered for performing
ablution. (see 5:6). The other type of or adornment of a woman
identified in the above verse is that which has been called as "ma
yukhfaina min zinata hunne" That which is hidden from their adornment.

This type of adornment is the one that becomes apparent when a woman
strikes her feet or walks. Allah has ordered that this type of adornment
be covered at all times. Thus the dress should be loose enough so as not
to reveal the shape and features of the body which get obvious when the
woman strikes her feet or walks. 3. They are to place their covers or
shrouds over their bosoms. In Sura 33:59 they are also ordered to bring
over them their over garments while going in public:

"O Nabi! Say to your wives and your daughters and the women of the
believers that they bring their over-garments nearer to themselves
(while in public); this will be more proper, that they may be
recognised, and thus they will not be given trouble; and Allah is
Forgiving, Merciful." (33:59)

In public she is to take "Jilbaab" or over garment over herself
according to above verse. 4. With her bosoms covered well, and dress
loose enough so as not to reveal her hidden adornment, she is to
maintain this type of dress in public in front of all relations. The
only exceptions are:

1. Husband
2. Fathers (Includes Grandparents as well).
3. The Fathers of their husbands.
4. Their sons.
5. The sons of their husbands.
6. Their brothers.
7. Their brother's sons.
8. Their sister's sons\`.
9. Their women.

10. Those whom their right hands posses. (i.e. those who were freed
from some tyrannical rule and are now under the care and guardianship of
believing men and women)

11. Those under their authority other than skillful men.

12. Small children who are not aware of women's nakedness.
