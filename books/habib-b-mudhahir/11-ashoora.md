Ashoora
=======

In the morning, Muharram 10th, Imam Husayn [a] and his companions said
their prayers.

Imam Husayn [a] prepared his companions for the battle. He divided them
into three small groups: Zuhair bin al-Qain headed the right wing. Habib
bin Mudhahir headed the left wing, and al-Abbas, the Imam's brother,
headed the core.

Imam Husayn [a] rode his she-camel and stood before Yazeed's Army. He
preached and advised them. He warned them of committing such a crime.
All Imam Husayn's efforts were in vain. Satan led Yazeed's fighters
astray. So, they forgot Allah.
