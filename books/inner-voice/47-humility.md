Humility
========

***“And the servants of Most Gracious God are those who walk on the
earth in humility, and when the ignorant people address them, they say:
‘Peace’. (Qur’an; 25:63).***

This verse of the Holy Book shows the best way to deal with such
stubborn fools who thrive on their ignorance. The true believers are to
ignore them.

***The same idea has been stressed upon in another verse: “And when they
hear vain talk, they turn away there from and say ‘To us our deeds, and
to you your deeds; peace be to you, we seek not the ignorants”
(28:55).***

The men of low society can never forgive any slight – real or imaginary.
But a really big man can afford to ignore his detractors. In fact, it is
not weakness; it is the sign of great strength.

And as the true faith is the greatest power, the believer can easily
ignore the invective of unbelievers.

The ignorant unbelievers want to involve the believers in their
illogical arguments; the believers should refuse to be dragged in such
vain talks, saying that we do not want to have any connection with
ignorant persons. After all, it is not possible to rectify each and
every absurdity in this vast world.

The ideal discussion is that which is held with an intention to reach at
the truth, without prejudice and without conceit. Such a dialogue is
welcome in Islam. But if a stubborn ignorant tries to drag a believer in
baseless arguments, not to seek the truth, but to show how wise he is,
the Qur’an advises to ignore him completely.
