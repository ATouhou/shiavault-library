***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

This holy Surah consists of two hundred and twenty seven verses. It has
been revealed in Mecca and, next to Surah Al-Baqarah, and it contains
the largest number of verses in comparison with other Suras of the
Qur’an.

Through four verses at the end of this Surah, faithful poets have been
admired while the poets who compose some vain poems have been
reproached, and that is why this holy Surah has been entitled Shu‘ara’,
and its other name is Ta Sin Mim.

There has come the biography of some prophets in this Surah, such as
Moses, Abraham, Noah, Lut, Salih, Hud, and Shu‘ayb (Jethro), as well as
the pertinacious conflicts of people against them.

At the end of each biography of these prophets, the Qur’an says:

***“Verily in that there is a sign, but most of them do not believe.”***

***“And verily, your Lord certainly is He, the Mighty, the Merciful.”***

And, therefore, this verse has been repeated eight times in order to
sooth the Prophet of Islam (S)and to tell him not to be afraid of the
pertinacity of the people of Mecca since all prophets had encountered
some people like them.

Yes, historical events are the best means for strengthening the
believers’ spirits, promoting the insight, tolerance, and a planning for
struggling against the enemies’ threats in the future. That is why the
leaders of the society must be aware of the history of the society.

The Virtue of the Surah
-----------------------

The holy Prophet of Islam (S) said:

*“One who reads this Surah will not get sunk and his home will be save
from burglary and fire; and one who writes this Surah on a paper and
mixes it with water and drinks it, all his diseases may be healed by
Allah.”*[^1]
