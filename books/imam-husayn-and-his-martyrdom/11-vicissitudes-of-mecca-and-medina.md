Vicissitudes of Mecca and Medina
================================

The great cities of Islam at its birth were Mecca and Medina. Mecca, the
centre of old Arabian pilgrimage, the birthplace of the Prophet,
rejected the Prophet's teaching, and cast him off. Its idolatry was
effete; its tribal exclusiveness was effete; its ferocity against the
Teacher of the New Light was effete.

The Prophet shook its dust off his feet, and went to Medina. It was the
well-watered city of Yathrib, with a considerable Jewish population. It
received with eagerness the teaching of the Prophet; it gave asylum to
him and his Companions and Helpers. He reconstituted it and it became
the new City of Light. Mecca, with its old gods and its old
superstitions, tried to subdue this new Light and destroy it. The human
odds were in favour of Mecca.

But God's purpose upheld the Light, and subdued the old Mecca. But the
Prophet came to build as well as to destroy. He destroyed the old
paganism, and lighted a new beacon in Mecca - the beacon of Arab unity
and human brotherhood. When the Prophet's life ended on this earth, his
spirit remained. It inspired his people and led them from victory to
victory. Where moral or spiritual and material victories go hand in
hand, the spirit of man advances all along the line. But sometimes there
is a material victory, with a spiritual fall, and sometimes there is a
spiritual victory with a material fall, and then we have tragedy.
