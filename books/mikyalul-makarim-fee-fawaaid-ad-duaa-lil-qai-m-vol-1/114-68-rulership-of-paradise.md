68. Rulership of Paradise
=========================

In *Kafi* it is narrated from His Eminence, Abu Ja’far Baqir (as) that
he said:

Among all the things that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime told His servant
Moosa in confidential conversation was: “Indeed, I have servants on whom
I have made Paradise lawful and I gave them rulership in it.”

Moosa asked: “My Lord, who are these people for whom You made Paradise
lawful and gave them rulership in it?” He replied: “All those who make a
believer happy…”[^1]

Also through authentic chain of narrators it is mentioned by His
Eminence, Abu Abdillah Sadiq (as) that:

“Allah, the Mighty and Sublime revealed to Dawood (as): Indeed, a
servant from My servants performs a good deed so I make My Paradise
lawful for him.” Dawood (as) asked with utmost politeness: “My Lord,
What deed is that?” He replied: “He makes a believer happy even though
it might have been with one date.” Dawood remarked: “One who recognizes
You must never lose hope in You.”[^2]
