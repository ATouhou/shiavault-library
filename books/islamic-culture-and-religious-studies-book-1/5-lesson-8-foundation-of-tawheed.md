Lesson 8 : Foundation of Tawheed
================================

You must be quite familiar with the life of Prophet Ibrahim (a.s.) and
the reconstruction of the Holy Ka'abah. Let us look at one aspect of
this amazing project.

Prophet Is'maeel (a.s.) was still a youth when both his father and he
travelled to the holy city of Mecca to re-build the House of Allah
(S.W.T.). He had made a promise that he would help his father to revive
the school of Tawheed. With this intention, they both started the work
of building the holy place.

Prophet Ibrahim (a.s.) and Is'maeel (a.s.) worked hard and carried many
heavy sacks of sand to and fro to make the bricks. Some people from the
tribes living nearby helped them build up the walls. Finally, when the
Holy Ka'abah was completed, Prophet Ibrahim (a.s.) raised his hands in
supplication and recited aloud:

"Yaa Rabbi (O my Lord)! The house of Tawheed is now ready for mankind
so that they may worship and attend to Your call of worship! O my Lord!
Accept this humble deed from Your weak servant and may this place of
worship remain safe and pure from any impurity, let it become the
foundation of Tawheed.

"O my Lord! Create from my offspring, lovers of Tawheed who can serve
You only! Send prophets in guidance to mankind. Show them the path of
true knowledge and wisdom."

**DA'WAH TO ALL**

Later, Prophet Ibrahim (a.s.) climbed on top of the Mountain of Abu
Qubays and called out aloud to all the people: "O people of Hejaz! O
people! Come and embrace the call of Tawheed at this central point of
Tawheed! Get rid of shirk, humiliation and idol-worshipping!"

**WHY VISIT THE HOLY KA'ABAH?**

Since the early days, the Holy Ka'abah has been a place of worship and
a means for people to meet in the way of Allah (S.W.T.) breaking all
boundaries of race, colour and social status. Unique Characteristics of
the Holy House

1. The Holy Ka'abah is a place of worship.
2. Muslims' spirits and hearts become united as they share religious
values. Although they come from different ethnic background, under the
fort of Tawheed, they are able to solve the social and political
problems in the global Muslim world. This sacred place gives Muslims an
opportunity to learn, share and exchange ideas.
3. The Ka'abah therefore becomes the uniting factor for Muslims. It
enables them to stand against the Kuffar and Mushrikeen and to be
actively involved in creating awareness in the Muslim societies. It
provides an opportunity to raise the banner of Islam and Tawheed. As the
central point of QIBLAH, where Muslims all over the world face during
their Salaat, it acts as a banner for Islam all over the world. All
prophets have visited the Holy Ka'abah for pilgrimage and every Muslim
tries to go for pilgrimage even if it is once in their lifetime.

4. This holy place re-kindles the spirits of Muslims towards the truth
of the message of Islam.

A Holy Verse The Qur'an says:

"And when Ibrahim and Is'maeel raised the foundations of the house,
(Ibrahim prayed): 'Our Lord accept from us (this duty); surely Thou art
the hearing, the knowing. Our Lord! And make us both submissive to Thee
and (raise) from our offspring a nation submitting to Thee, and show us
our ways of worship and turn to us (mercifully), surely Thou art the
oft-returning (to mercy), the merciful." Sura Baqara, Verses 127 & 128

**SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT…**

1. Prophet Ibrahim (a.s.) was a man of God - a Prophet sent by Allah
(S.W.T.) to convey the message of TAWHEED.
2. He was able to spread this message of truth with the help of his son
Is'maeel (a.s.).
3. Prophets enlightened people towards knowing Tawheed of Allah
(S.W.T.).
4. After the re-building of the Holy Ka'abah; love, co-operation,
spirit of brotherhood and good counsel spread in the Muslim ummah.

**Think and Answer**

1. In his time, what was the most important role Prophet Ibrahim (a.s.)
played?
2. What was the prayer of Prophet Ibrahim (a.s.) after laying the
foundation of the Holy Ka'abah?
3. Why does a Muslim visit this sacred place?


**Introduction to Chapter Four**

In The Name Of Allah (S.W.T.), the Beneficent, the Merciful

**THE HOLY PROPHET (S.A.W.W.) OF ISLAM
HIS SEERAH AND STAGES OF DIVINE PROPAGATION**

Prophet Muhammad Mustafa (s.a.w.w.) who was the son of Abdullah ibn
Abdul Muttalib is indeed the perfect and the most beloved of all
prophets of Islam. At the age of forty years, he received the first
divine revelation of prophethood of Islam.

The final message and completion of Islam came through him. During his
lifetime, he played a very important role in combating shirk i.e. idol
worshipping and all the other faces of polytheism.

In this chapter, we will study the message of the last and final
Messenger. It will be necessary for us to closely study the seerah of
the Holy Prophet of Islam (s.a.w.w.). From his life and personality, we
can learn how he resisted all sorts of kufr and how his excellent
manners brought even the polytheists to the belief in One God.

Because of this very akhlaq, he is referred to as the 'BEST EXAMPLE'
for mankind in the Holy Qur'an.


**Lesson 9 : Da'awah For The Near Ones To Islam**

By the 3rd year of Be'that (Prophethood), the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.)
had spent all his time just trying to revive the light of Islam. There
were several ways he used to do this. Initially, it was necessary for
him to hold small group meetings because the time had not yet come to
spread the message of Islam to all.
The people of Mecca were not aware of the Prophet (s.a.w.w.)'s real
objectives yet.

During the early stages of da'awah, there were about 40 Muslims who
showed loyalty, co-operation and supported his divine call. These people
stood firm behind him all through their lives.

Gradually, Islam established itself in the form of these trustworthy
and sincere individuals. In the meantime, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.)
tried to gain the trust of the general public and through his perfect
conduct, he succeeded so well that he became famously known as SADIQ
(TRUTHFUL) and AMEEN (TRUSTWORTHY).

Then the Divine call came down from the heavens and Allah (S.W.T.) said
to him:

"Awaken the hearts of the people towards the Almighty Creator Allah
(S.W.T.) and Islam, and protect them from the severe punishment of the
hereafter. It is time for you to spread the heavenly message with
compassion, gentleness, humility and wisdom."

Soon after, our Holy Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.w.) undertook his first
invitation. With the help of his cousin (and future son-in-law) - Imam
Ali Ibn Abi Taalib (a.s.), he organised a meal and invited the close
members of his family to join him.

Da'watul Dhul-Ashira - The First Invitation.

40 people arrived for the special meal. The Holy Prophet of Islam
(s.a.w.w.) showed them warm hospitality and said, "Ali and I express
sincere thanks to you for having accepted our invitation and may you
enjoy this humble meal…"

It was a blessed meal indeed! After everyone had eaten, the Prophet
(s.a.w.w.) began to speak about his mission. However, as soon as Abu
Lahab - one of his uncles - realised what he was saying, he created an
awful scene and prevented the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) from talking any
more. Chaos broke out and everyone left without hearing the important
message.

Let us try to reflect on what went on in that first meeting:

1. Did the behaviour of Abu Lahab in any way discourage the Prophet
(s.a.w.w.) from spreading the message of Islam?

2. Did it stop him from guiding the people? And did he despair and lose
hope in Allah (S.W.T.)?

3. What were the ways of the Prophet (s.a.w.w.)'s Islamic work? What
strategies did he use in guiding people? What course of action did he
use to put the love of truth in people's hearts?

When we ponder on these issues, we appreciate the fact that the Prophet
of Islam (s.a.w.w.) never gave up on his divine mission. He exercised a
lot of patience in order to perform his duties. This was for the sake of
saving humanity from the darkness of ignorance and to bring them into
the light of Truth and success. The Second Invitation

Trusting in Allah (S.W.T.), the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) waited for a
few days and then called the same people again for a second meal. He was
equally kind and hospitable this time around. After the simple but
wonderful meal, he began to speak. This time the people listened. He
said:

"Dear guests! What I am about to say may not be acceptable to your
ears, if you wish to listen to my counsel you may do so. If you do not
wish to do so, the choice is yours and you can follow your own path. But
I request you all to heed what I am about to say.

"I remind you that I am a gift and a blessing for you, a guide for you
and I will become your salvation in the hereafter, so think about what I
say.

"O people, if I were to tell you that there was an army of enemies just
behind this mountain, would you take my word and believe me? Or would
you run away like renegades? What steps would you take?"

All those gathered replied: "O Muhammad! We trust that what you utter
is nothing but the truth."

It was now time for the Prophet (s.a.w.w.) to make his announcement,
giving glad tidings to the guests and conveying the pure message of
Islam. He continued, "I wish nothing but goodness and happiness for you.
I do not and have never uttered a single lie. O people! Remember death
is not the end of our long journey, life after death is another
continuous life in another world.

"O people, I am a Prophet sent by Allah (S.W.T.), blessed by Him as a
mercy for the whole universe. I shoulder a heavy and a great
responsibility to spread this divine MESSAGE OF ISLAM, and I desire that
you should follow this path. Come and join this sacred course to Allah
(S.W.T.)…"

There was absolute silence in the room as the stunned people looked at
the Prophet (s.a.w.w.). It was then that a young man stood up from the
crowd and exclaimed, "O Prophet of Allah (S.W.T.), I believe in the ways
of Tawheed, Ma'ad, and have full trust in your prophethood and your
message of truth."

Do you know who it was? It was no other than Ali Ibn Abi Taalib! Joy
illuminated the Prophet (s.a.w.w.)'s face as he asked Ali to confirm
what he had said not once or twice but three times!

Then the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) made a second announcement, "Most
surely, this is my brother, my inheritor, my leader for you, so take
heed and obey him …" He then repeated and said, "This young man is my
close brother, and my Wazir, he is none other than Ali Ibn Abi
Taalib."

Al Kamil Fi-Tarikh Vol 2 Page 62 Even while some of those gathered were
excited and happy at the news, others like Abu Lahab and his followers
looked plainly angry and walked out. These became the permanent enemies
of the Prophet (s.a.w.w.) and of Islam.

The questions that come up in all our minds at this point is: Why did
some express feelings of joy and excitement when Imam Ali (a.s.) was
given such a great title and later turn against him?

Did the people who were present fully understand what the Prophet
(s.a.w.w.) was saying? Did they appreciate the high and noble status of
Imam Ali (a.s.) as given by the Prophet of Islam (s.a.w.w.)?

It is important for us to sit and seriously think about what actually
transpired in the mind of the people during this great event!

A Holy Verse The Qur'an mentions:

"And warn your nearest relations and be kind to him who follows you of
the believers." Sura Shua'ra, Verse 215

**SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT…**

1. The initial stage of da'awah performed by our Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.w.) was to a few people. Gradually more and more were called to
Islam
2. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) imparted the message of Islam through
love, kindness, care, gentleness and showed great patience in this
mission.
3. He enjoined the people towards goodness and imparted the
fundamentals of Islam clearly and with certainty.
4. He also prepared the Ummah, from the beginning, with a spiritual
guide and leader.

**Think and Answer**

1. Define da'awah in Islam? What were the unique ways of performing
da'awah that the Prophet of Islam (s.a.w.w.) used?
2. Why did the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) begin his mission with only a
handful?
3. Describe the event of the first and second invitations of the
Prophet of Islam (s.a.w.w.) and their respective outcomes.
4. Explain in your own words the content of the Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.w.)'s sermon during the latter event? Who replied him and what
was this reply? 5. What do you understand by the statement made by the
young man?
