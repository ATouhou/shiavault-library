The Mystic's Stations (maqamat)
===============================

The 'urafa' maintain that in order to arrive at the stage of true
gnosis, there are stages and stations that must be covered. Unless
covered, the 'urafa' hold, to arrive at the station of true gnosis is
impossible.

'Irfan has a facet that it shares with theosophy (hikmat ilahi), while
many of the facets of these two disciplines differ. The facet common to
them both is that the aim of both is knowledge of God (ma'rifat Allah).
They differ in that theosophy does not aim solely at knowledge of God
but rather aims at a knowledge of the order of being.

The knowledge that is sought by the theosophist (hakim) is of the
system of existence, of which, naturally, knowledge of God is an
important pillar. The goal of 'irfan, on the other hand, is exclusively
knowledge of God.

In the view of 'irfan, knowledge of God is total knowledge. Everything
must be known in the light of knowledge of God and from the point of
view of tawhid; such knowledge is a derivative of knowledge of God.

Secondly, the knowledge sought by the hakim is intellectual knowledge
and can be likened to the knowledge acquired by the mathematician after
thought and reflection on a particular mathematical problem. However,
the knowledge sought by the 'arif is experienced and witnessed; it can
be likened to the knowledge acquired by an experimental scientist in his
laboratory. The hakim seeks certain knowledge ('ilm al-yaqin), while the
'arif seeks the certainty of direct vision ('ayn al-yaqin).

Thirdly, the means employed by the hakim are his reason, deductions and
proofs, whereas those employed by the 'arif are the heart and the
purification, disciplining and perfecting of the self. The hakim seeks,
through the telescope of his mind, to study the order of existence,
while the 'arif seeks to prepare the whole of his being so as to arrive
at the core of reality. He seeks to reach reality like a drop of water
in the search of the sea.

In the view of the hakim, the perfection expected of a human being lies
in understanding reality, while in the 'arif's view it lies in reaching
reality. In the hakim's view an imperfect human being is one who is
ignorant, while in the 'arif's view the imperfect human is one who has
remained distant and separated from his origin.

The 'arif therefore sees perfection in reaching rather than in
understanding. And in order to reach the principal goal and the stage of
true gnosis, he views the traversing of several stages and stations as
being necessary and essential. This he calls sayr wa suluk, the science
of inward wayfaring.

These stages and stations have been discussed in great detail in the
books of 'irfan. Here it is not possible to explain, even briefly, each
and every one of them. However, in order at least to give a general
impression, I believe that we can do no better than to turn to the ninth
section of Ibn Sina's al-'Isharat.

Although Ibn Sina is mainly a philosopher, not a mystic, he is not a
'dry' philosopher, and especially towards the end of his life he
developed mystic inclinations. In his al-'Isharat, which appears to be
his last work, he has devoted a whole section to the 'stations' of the
gnostics. This section being extraordinarily sublime and beautiful, we
consider it more suitable for our purposes to present a summary of this
section, rather than citing or translating suitable passages from the
books of the 'urafa'.

**Zahid, 'abid & 'arif:**

He who abstains from the enjoyments of the world, even its wholesome
ones, is called a zahid (ascetic); and he who is careful to perform
worship, prayer and fasting and the like, is called an 'abid (devotee);
and he who keeps his thought turned perpetually towards the realm of
light in order that the light of the Real shine in his breast is called
an 'arif; and sometimes two or more of these epithets may apply to the
same person.

Although Ibn Sina defines here the zahid, the 'abid and the 'arif, yet
at the same time he is defining zuhd, 'ibadah, and 'irfan. This is
because a definition of zahid, 'abid, or tarif per se includes
implicitly a definition of zuhd, 'ibadah, or 'irfan. Thus the conclusion
to be drawn from this passage is that zuhd is abstinence from worldly
enjoyments;

'ibadah is the performance of specific acts like prayer, fasting,
reciting the Quran and the like; and 'irfan is turning away the mind
from everything but Allah and paying complete attention to the Divine
Essence so that the light of the Real may shine on one's heart.

The last clause indicates an important point. One or more of these
characteristics may occur in combination. Thus it is possible for an
individual to be an 'abid and a zahid, a zahid and an 'arif, an 'abid
and an 'arif, or an 'abid, zahid, and 'arif at one and the same time.
Ibn Sina has not elaborated this, but he implies that although it is
possible for one to be a zahid or an 'abid and not be an 'arif,

it is not possible for one to be an 'arif and not be a zahid and an
'abid. One may be both a zahid and an 'abid without being an 'arif, but
an 'arif by definition is also a zahid and an 'abid. So, although not
every zahid or 'abid is an 'arif, every 'arif is a zahid and an 'abid.

In the next passage we will see that the zuhd of an 'arif differs in
its goal from that of a non-'arif. In fact, the spirit and essence of
the 'arif's zuhd and 'ibadah are different from those of the
non-'arif:

The zuhd for the non-'arif, is a transaction by which he gives up the
pleasures of the world for the pleasures of the Hereafter, whereas for
the 'arif it is something through which he dissociates himself from
everything that keeps him from attention towards God and he looks down
on everything except God.

Whereas worship for the non-'arif is a transaction by which he performs
actions in the world for a reward (ajr, thawab) to be received in the
Hereafter, for the 'arif it is a kind of exercise that is aimed at
strengthening his self's intellectual and imaginative faculties, and
which, by repetition, draws away the self from the realm of illusion to
the realm of the Real.

**The 'arif's Goal:**

The 'arif desires the Real (God) not for the sake of something else,
and he values nothing above his knowledge of the Real, and his worship
of Him is because He is worthy of worship and it is a worthy way of
relating himself to Him; it is not out of desire (for rewards) or fear
(of chastisement).

The meaning of this is that in terms of his aims the 'arif is a
muwahhid. He seeks only God, yet his desire of God is not on account of
His gifts in this world or in the Hereafter. Were such to be the case,
the real object of his desire would be the gifts, God being only the
preliminary means by which the desired gifts are sought. In such a case,
in reality, the final object of worship and desire would be one's own
self; for the purpose of seeking those gifts is the pleasure of the
self.

However, the 'arif desires whatever he desires for the sake of God.
When he desires the gifts of God he does so because they are from Him,
and are His favours. They represent His Grace and Magnanimity. So, while
the non-'arif seeks God for the sake of His gifts, the 'arif seeks the
gifts of God for the sake of God.

Here the question may arise, if the 'arif does not seek God for the
sake of anything, then why does he worship Him? Is it not true that
every act of worship must have a purpose? Ibn Sina's passage contains
the answer. He states that the goal and motivation of the 'arif's
worship is one of two things.

One is the inherent worthiness of the Worshipped to be worshipped,
meaning that one worships God simply because He is worthy of worship. It
is rather like someone who upon noticing some admirable qualities in a
person or a thing praises that person or thing. If asked what motivated
him to utter such praise, or of what benefit was it to him, he will
reply that he sought no benefit from his praise, but simply saw that
person or thing as being genuinely deserving of praise. This is true of
the praise accorded to the heroes or the champions of each and every
field.

The other motivation of the 'arif's worship is the worthiness of
worship itself. It bears an intrinsic nobility and beauty of its own,
for it is a connection, a tie, between oneself and God. Thus it has a
worthiness of its own, and there is no reason why worship should
necessarily entail desire or fear.

**'Ali (A) has some famous words on this subject:**

My God, I do not worship You in fear of Your Fire, nor in desire for
Your Paradise, but I find You worthy of worship so I worship You.

The 'urafa' place great importance on this issue, considering it a kind
of shirk (polytheism) for one's goal in life and particularly in worship
to be something other than God Himself. 'Irfan totally rejects this kind
of shirk. Many have written elegantly and subtly on the subject, and we
will look at an allegory from Sa'di's Bustan which takes the outward
form of a story of Sultan Mahmud of Ghaznah and his close confidant
Iyaz:

One with the Shah of Ghaznah found fault, saying,What charm has he, the
Shah's friend Iyaz.

A flower indeed with neither colour nor smell,How strange of the
nightingale to set its heart upon such a thing.

Someone conveyed this remark to Sultan Mahmud,Who, on hearing it, was
besides himself with anguish.

'I love him for his disposition and character,Nor for his pleasing gait
and stature. '

Heard I once that in a narrow defile,The king's treasure-chest broke
open after a camel fell.

The king, after signalling his bequest,Spurred on his steed to get
ahead hastily.

The riders now fell upon the pearls and corals,Their thoughts now
turning from the king to the treasure.

None of the proud lads remained that day To follow in the king's train
except Iyaz Looking out, the king saw him, and beholding Iyaz, His face
like a flower bloomed with delight.

'What booty have you brought along, ' the king inquired.

'None, 'said, Iyaz. 'I hurried after you,Preferring your service to
treasure and bounties.

Sa'di then turns from this story to the point he wishes to make, which
he expresses thus:

If you look to your friend for his favours,You are tied to yourself not
to your friend A breach of the Way it was if the saints Desired of God
aught other than God.


**The First Station**

The first level of the 'arif's journey is what they eall 'resolution'
(al-'iradah), and this is a fervent desire to catch hold of the Firm Tie
(al-'urwat al-wuthqa) that catches hold of one who is perceptive of true
proofs, or who has settled his self through the covenant of faith, so
that it impels his heart towards the Holy in order to attain the spirit
of connection (with Him).

In order to explain the first stage of the spiritual path - which in
one respect potentially embraces the whole of 'irfan - we are obliged to
be somewhat elaborate. The 'urafa' primarily believe in a principle
which they sum up in the following phrase:

The ends are the return to the beginnings.

Clearly, for the end to be the beginning there are two possibilities.

One is that the movement is in a straight line, and that once the
object in motion reaches a certain point it changes its direction and
retraces exactly the same route that it came. In philosophy it has been
proved that such a change of direction would entail an interval of
motionlessness, even if imperceptible.

Furthermore, these two movements would be opposite to each other. The
second possibility is that the movement is on along a curve all of whose
points are equidistant from a certain central point, in other words a
circle. It is clear that if the movement takes the form of a circle,
naturally the path will end at the point of commencement.

An object moving in a circle will continually move farther from the
point of beginning until it reaches the point farthest from where it
began. This is the point diametrically opposite to the point of
commencement. It is also from this point that, with no pause or
interval, the return journey (ma'ad) to the point of departure (mabda')
commences. The 'urafa' call the first part of the journey, i.e. from the
point of departure to the point farthest from it, 'the arc of descent'
(qaws al-nazul), and the journey from there back to the point of
departure, 'the arc of ascent' (qaws al-su'ud).

There is a philosophical view associated with the movement of things
from the point of departure to the farthest point which the philosophers
call the 'principle of causality' (asl al-'illiyyah), and which the
'urafa' call the 'principle of emanation' (asl al-tajalli); in either
case objects travelling along the arc of descent are as if driven from
behind.

Similarly, the movement of objects from the farthest point to the point
of departure also has its own philosophical theory. This is the
principle of every derivative being's desire and passion to return to
its origin. In other words, it is the principle of the flight back of
everything estranged and stranded to its origin and homeland.

This tendency, so the 'urafa' believe, is inherent in each and every
particle of existence, including the human being, though in man it can
often be latent and hidden.

Man's preoccupations prevent the activity of this tendency, and a
series of stimuli are required before this inner inclination will
surface. It is the appearance and surfacing of this inclination that the
'urafa' term as 'resolution' or 'will' (iradah).

Thus in reality this resolution is a type of awakening of a dormant
consciousness. 'Abd al-Razzaq Kashani, in his Istilahat, defines iradah
as:

A spark in the heart from the fire of love that compels one to answer
the summons of the Real (Haqiqah).

Khwajah 'Abd Allah Ansari in his Manazil al-sa'irin defines iradah as
follows:

It is the voluntary answer (in actions) to the summons of the Real
(Haqiqah).

Here it is necessary to point out that the meaning of iradah being the
first stage is that it is the first stage after a chain of other stages
has been passed, stages that are called 'preparations' (bidayat),
'doors' (abwab), 'conduct' (mu'amalat). and 'manners' (akhlaq). Thus
iradah is the first stage in the terminology of the 'urafa' in the sense
that it signifies a genuine gnostic awakening.

Rumi describes the principle that 'the end is the return to the
beginning' as follows:

The parts are faced towards the Whole,
Nightingales are in love with the rose's face;
Whatever comes from the sea to the sea returns,
And everything goes back to its source;
Like the streams rushing down from mountain tops,
My soul, burning with love, longs to leave the body.

Rumi opens his Mathnawi by inviting the reader to listen to the
plaintive cries of the reed, as it complains of its separation from the
reed bed. Thus in the first lines of his Mathnawi Rumi is actually
bringing up the first stage of the 'arif, that is iradah, a desire to
return to one's origins that is accompanied with the feeling of
separation and loneliness. Rumi says:

Listen to the reed as its story it relates And of its separation it
complains.

Since the time that from the reed bed was I taken,
At my strains have lamented man and woman.
O, a heart I seek that is torn with the pain of separation
That it may hear the tale of my longing for return.
Whoever remains distant from his origins,
Seeks again the life of reunion.

To sum up, Ibn Sina, in the above passage, means that iradah is a
desire and longing that, after deep feelings of alienation, loneliness
and estrangement, makes its appearance in the human being and motivates
him to seek reunion with the Real, a union which puts an end to the
feelings of alienation, loneliness, and helplessness.

**Exercise and Self-Discipline**

Then what is certainly required is exercise (riyadah), and it is
directed towards three ends - the first is to clear the path of all but
the Real; the second is to subjugate the 'commanding self' (al-nafs
al-'ammarah) to the 'contented self' (al-nafs al-mutma'innah); the third
is to render the heart subtle for awareness.

After having commenced the journey at the stage of iradah, the next
stage is that of exercise and preparedness. This preparedness is termed
riyadah.

Nowadays this term is generally misunderstood and it is taken to mean
self-mortification. In some religions the principle of mortifying the
self is hallowed. Perhaps the best examples of this are to be seen in
the Yogis of India. In the terminology of Ibn Sina, however, the word is
not used in this sense.

The original meaning of this Arabic word is 'to exercise', or 'to break
in a colt.' Thereafter the word was used for physical exercise, a sense
which the word still bears today. The 'urafa' borrowed this word, and in
their terminology it is used to mean exercising the soul and preparing
it for the illumination of the light of knowledge (ma'rifah). It is in
this sense that the word is used in the passage above.

Ibn Sina then declares this exercising and preparing of the soul to be
directed towards three aims. The first of these is related to external
matters and entails the removal of distractive occupations and the
causes of negligence (ghaflah).

The second is related to the balance of the inner forces and the
removal of agitations from the soul, which he has described as the
submission of the 'commanding self' to the 'contented self'. The third
relates to qualitative changes in the soul, which he calls 'rending
subtle of the heart'.

And the first [of the three aims of riyadah] is aided by true zuhd
(i.e. zuhd removes the impediments and the hindering preoccupations,
which cause neglect, from the path).

The second is aided by several things: worship infused with (presence
of heart, concentration and) reflection; melody that serves to
strengthen the self through which the accompanying words have an effect
on the heart (such as melodious reciting of the Quran, supplications and
litanies, and the singing of mystic poetry); the instructive speech of a
pure, eloquent speaker who speaks gently and effectively in the manner
of a guide.

As for the third goal, it is aided by subtle thoughts (contemplating
subtle and delicate ideas and meanings which lead to spiritual
refinement) and a chaste love (a love that is spiritual and not physical
and sensual) which is directed by the virtues of the beloved and not
ruled over by sensuality.

Then, when iradah and riyadah reach a certain degree, flashes
(khalasat) of the dawning light of the Real will descend upon him,
delightful as they are, they are momentary like flashes of lightning
appearing and instantly vanishing. These they call 'moments' (awqat),
and these flashes increase in frequency with greater diligence in
riyadah.

As he advances deeper into this, they descend upon him even when he is
not exercising. Now often he will glance at something and his glance be
deflected from it towards the Holy, bringing to his attention some
aspect of the Divine, and a state of trance (ghashyah) descends upon
him, in which, as if, he sees God in every thing.

Perhaps it is at this stage that his states overwhelm him, disturbing
his equanimity, a change that would be noticed by anyone near him.

Then, he reaches a point in his exercises when his 'moments' change
into stable tranquillity, the brief snatches become familiar and the
flashes beeome a prolonged blaze. Then he achieves an enduring gnostic
state which permanently accompanies him from which he derives an
ecstatic delight. And when it departs him he becomes sad and
bewildered.

And perhaps it is at this stage the state in which he is in will make
itself apparent (to others); but as he progresses deeper into this
gnosis, its appearance will be less detectable in him and he will be
absent when (appearing to be) present, and travelling when (appearing to
be) still.

This passage calls to mind a sentence spoken by 'Ali ibn Abi Talib (A)
to his disciple Kumayl ibn Ziyad about the 'friends of God' (awliya'
al-Haqq), who exist in every age: Knowledge has led them to the reality
of insight, and they are in contact with the spirit of certainty. They
find easy what is regarded as rough by those who live in comfort and
luxury. They are intimate with what terrifies the ignorant. They are in
the company of people with their bodies, yet their souls are lodged in
the highest realm. (Nahj al-balaghah, Hikam, No. 147).

Until this stage, perhaps, this state of gnosis will occur to him only
occasionally. Thereafter it will gradually become such that it is
available to him whenever he wants.

Thereafter, he advances further than even this stage until his affair
no longer depends on his own wish. Whenever he observes a thing he sees
other than it (i.e God), even if his observation is not for the sake of
reflection. So, the opportunity presents itself to ascend from the plane
of false appearances to the plane of Truth. He becomes stabilized upon
it, while (in the world) he is surrounded by the heedless.

Up until this point we have been dealing with the stage of exercise,
self-discipline, struggle and the spiritual itinerary. Now the 'arif has
reached his goal.

When he crosses from the stage of riyadah to that of attainment, his
inward becomes like a clear mirror facing in the direction of the Real.
Sublime delights shower upon him, and he rejoices at his self for what
is there of the Real. Now (like one viewing an image in a mirror, who
looks either at the image or at the mirror reflecting the image) he is
perplexed by two views: the view of the Real and the view of his own
self.

Then, he becomes oblivious to his own self and views only the Holy. And
if he notices his self it is for the reason of its being the viewer, not
for the sake of its own beauty (like one who when looking at an image in
a mirror, views the image only; although he does not pay attention to
the mirror itself, nevertheless the mirror is seen while viewing the
image, though the mirror is not viewed for its own beauty). It is at
this point that the wayfarer attains union (and his journey from khalq
to Haqq becomes complete).

Here ends our summary of the ninth section of Ibn Sina's Isharat and
his account of the journey from creation (khalq) to God (Haqq). A point
that must be added is that the 'urafa' believe in four journeys: sayr
min al-khalq ila al-Haqq, sayr bi al-Haqq a al-Haqq, sayr min al-Haqq
ila al-khalq bi al-Haqq, sayr fi al-khalq bi al-Haqq (the journey from
creation to God; the journey with God in God; the journey with God from
God to creation; and finally, the journey in creation with God).

The first journey is from creatures to the Creator. The second is in
the Creator; it means that in the course of it the 'arif becomes
acquainted with His Qualities and Names and himself becomes adorned with
the same. In the third journey, he returns towards the creation, without
becoming separated from God, in order to guide the people.

The fourth journey is amongst the people while still united with God.
In this journey the 'arif is with and amongst the people and seeks to
guide their affairs so as to lead them towards God.

The summary from Ibn Sina's al-'Isharat given above is related to the
first of these journeys. He also gives a brief account of the second
journey, but it is not necessary for our purposes to include it. Khwajah
Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, in his commentary on al-'Isharat, says that Ibn
Sina has explained the first journey of the 'arif in nine stages.

Three stages are related to the beginning of the journey, three to the
journey from its beginning to its end, and three are related to the
arrival or the union. Some reflection on Ibn Sina's account makes the
point clear.

By 'riyadah ' which is translated as 'exercise', Ibn Sina means the
exercises in self-discipline that the 'arif undergoes. There are many of
these, and the 'arif must follow a chain of stations in these exercises
too. Here Ibn Sina is brief in the extreme, yet the 'urafa' have
discussed this matter in detail, and one may seek these details in their
works.
