Story no. 31: Safety of trust
=============================

Waheed said to his father  
 “I was playing with a ball with the children of our neighbours.  
 When we finished playing, one of them handed over the ball to me saying
that I was going to keep it for the night.  
 Father, I want to keep the ball for myself and not return it to
them!”  
 His father replied “no, no dear son, this is placed under you as a
trust and you must keep it safely, and return it back to the owner.”

Yes, keeping the trusted thing safe is one of the particularities of
Islam to which the leaders of that religion have invited us.
