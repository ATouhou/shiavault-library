Preface
=======

Finally, with the Grace of Allah, I have completed this short biography
of our Sixth Imam, Imam Jaffer Sadiq (A.S.) for those readers who need
to have a brief overview of the life of this divinely appointed Imam.

There is so much information on the life of our Sixth Imam that in the
initial stages I had no clue as to where to start and where to end this
daunting endeavor that I had agreed to undertake on behalf of the Bilal
Muslim Mission of Tanzania.

The more I thought of this project, the more discouraged I felt, until
when I learnt that there were quiet a few people who had read the short
biographies that I had written on the other Imams and who were inquiring
from the Bilal Muslim Mission for explanations as to why I had not
written on the life of our Sixth, Tenth, Eleventh and the Twelfth
Imams.

This inquiry encouraged mevonce more, to pull myself together and apply
my energies towards this unfinished task. The result of this effort is
the short sketch depicting the highlights of the life of our Sixth Imam,
Hazrat Jaffer Sadiq (A.S).

Every time I went through this work when it was in the draft form, I
felt that it was not worth printing as it did not encompass even the
most basics about the life of this illustrious personality.

I ended up making massive alterations. Finally, I came to the
conclusion that if I were to follow my instincts, this work would never
be completed. We therefore now h^ye this brief work for my readers.

My prayers to my Creator is that may He forgive me for the deficiencies
that may have remained unveiled in this book.

I take this opportunity to thank all those who have in one way or
another helped me in my efforts to undertake and complete this task. My
special sentiments are for Fidahussein Abdullah Hameer, the Publisher,
who tolerated my tardiness and constantly reminded me of my obligations
to complete this work.

**Chapter 1 : Imam Jaffer Bin Muhammad Al-Sadiq(A.S.) Childhood and
Early Manhood**

**INTRODUCTION:**

Imam Jafter Bin Muhammad (A.S.) is the Sixth Imam form the progeny of
Prophet Muhammad (S. A.W.W.). He is known more by his title (Lakab) fc
AL-SADIQ Several explanations have been given as to why he has been
singled out for this title despite the fact that all the Imams from the
progeny of the Prophet were truthful-AL SADIQ.

Muhammad Khazri in tesAT-TASHRM i JL ISLAM! says:

"Hazrat Abu Abdullah Jaffer Sadiq (A.S) came of the Sayyeds of the Holy
Household. He won the title of Sadiq because of his unchallengeable
truthfulness." Batras Bustani inhis DAERATAK MAAREFVol VI. reaffirms
this view.

Another explanations is, there was a need to distinguish him form
others who had a similar name and who had made false claims to be the
Imam of the time. By calling him AL-SADIQ, people would differentiate
him from the false ones.

A third explanation is that Allah, the Almighty, Himself chose this
title for him. The Prophet (S. A. W. W.) therefore foretold the birth of
this Imam and gave him this title.

The most important thing to note is that like the Prophet (S.A.W.W.)
who was acknowledged to be truthful i AL-SADIQ) even by his avowed
enemies, The Quraish of Mecca, similarly Imam Jaffer Sadiq's
truthfulness has been accepted at all times even by his enemies.

As for the name Jaffei; by. Arabic lexicon, it simpK means a stream.
But according to some traditions. Jaffer is a unique stream in paradise.
In view of the fact that Imam Jaffer (A.S) was to become a fountain head
of knowledge for all and sundry; he was given this name by his father,
the Fifth Imam.

The Sixth Imam is also known by many other titles C1LQAB') that include
FAADHIL (the excellent one), TAHIR (the pure one), SAB1R (the patient
one), QAEEM (the steadfast one) and MUSADDIQ (the ratifier).

Another unique thing about Imam Jaffer Sadiq (A.S) is, the Shia sect of
Islam is named after him. Thus when people talk of the 'madhab' of Abu
Hanifa, of Ahmed Ibne Hanbal, of Malik bin Anas, of Imam Shafi, they
talk of the madhab of Ahlul Bayt as madhab Jafferi.

**HIS PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS:**

His father was Imam Muhammad Baqir (A.S.).

His mother was Fatima (popular by the name of Umm Farwa). She was a
woman of many merits. Imam Sadiq (A.S.) had high regards for her, so
much so that he used to quote her as source of "hadith' from the Fifth
Imam. One such hadith is recorded by Kulayni in USULAL-KAFI:

Imam Sadiq (A.S.) reports that his father told Umm Farwa: "O Umm Farwa,
I pray to Allah for the sinners among the Shias day and night, a
thousand times, for we Imams endure the misfortunes that happen in the
light of what we know of the coming reward, whereas they suffer without
such knowledge."

This does not come, as a surprise knowing the fact that Umm Farwa's
father was Qasim, the son of Muhammad Bin Abu baqr. Qasim was a very
pious person and a devout student of Imam Zainul Abideen (A.S). He was
regarded amongst the seven top most jurists of Medina during his
times.

Qasim's father was Muhammad whose mother was Asma Binti Umays and whose
father was AbuBaqr, the first Caliph from Saquifa.

Asma Binti Umays had been previously married to Jaffer Bin Abu Talib
who was martyred at Mutta. She was then married to Abu Baqr after whose
death she married Imam Ali (A.S.). Imam Ali loved Muhammad Bin Abu Baqr
whom he addressed as his own son.

Qasim married his cousin, Asma, the daughter of Abdulrehman Bin Abu
Baqr. From this marriage was born UmmFarwa.

**HIS BIRTH:**

Imam Jaffer Sadiq (A.S.) was born on Friday 17th of Rabiul Ula 83 AH
(AD 702) in Medina. Remember: this is also the birth anniversary of our
Prophet (S. A.W.W).

Imam Ali BinHusain (A.S), his paternal grandfather, was still alive at
his birth. As a matter of fact, he lived with his grandfather for twelve
years when the latter passed away on 25th Muharram95A.H.

It is reported that when Imam Sadiq (A.S) was still in his mother's
womb, he used to communicate with her. According to Allama Majlisi, when
Imam Sadiq (A.S.) was bom, he bowed down and supported himself on the
ground.

Then he looked at the sky and read the "Kalema" and called out the
names of all Imams before him. His father read" Adhan" in his right ear
and Ikamaa' in his left ear. Like the previous five Imams who came
before him, he was bom clean and circumcised. Between his shoulders was
the seal of"Imamat".

**EARLY CHILDHOOD:**

Imam Sadiq (A.S) had the opportunity of spending 35 years of his life
with his father, Imam Muhammad Baqir (A.S.). He was an active
participant of the school that his father was running both in the mosque
of the Prophet (S.A.W. W) and in his own house in Medina. Imam Baqir
(A.S) would, time and again, involve Imam Sadiq (A.S) to conduct classes
so that the students could appreciate the young Imam's knowledge and
skills as an educator, and their future Imam.

Instances are quoted by Sheikh Mufid in his AL-IRSHAD when Imam Baqir
(A.S) introduced Imam Sadiq (A.S.) as his successor:

• A man by the name of Abu Al-Sabbah Al Kinani reports that once when
he and others were in the presence of Imam Mohammed Baqir (A.S), the
Imam looked towards his son,

Imam Sadiq (A.S) and said, "Do you see that man? He is one of those of
whom the Mighty and High has said; 4 We wish to grant a favor to those
who have been humiliated in the land and we will make them Imams and
inheritors. (xxvii:5)'"

• Jabir Bin Yazid Al-Jufi, who was a famous companion of the Fifth and
the Sixth Imams reports that once Imam Baqir (A.S) was asked about the
one who would take over form him as the Imam of the time.

He tapped Imam Sadiq (A.S) with his hand and said, "By Allah, this man
from the family of Muhammad (S.A.W.W.) will take charge."
