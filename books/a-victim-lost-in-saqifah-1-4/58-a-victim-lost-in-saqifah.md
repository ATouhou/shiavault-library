Allegiance of Amirul Momineen (a.s.) to Caliphs
===============================================

Motive of this research
-----------------------

Ali’s *Bay’at* with Abu Bakr is repeatedly mentioned in various styles
and used in different ways to bring out Abu Bakr’s Caliphate from its
characteristic feature of usurpation that surrounds it.

So they claim:

“It is said that Ali was tied by a rope round his neck and his house was
destroyed. I do not know such an Ali. He was not a man of such an
insult. He wisely paid allegiance and remained firm on it indicating his
satisfaction.”!**[1]**

“This proves that Ali did not view their Caliphate illegitimate.”**[2]**

“After he (Ali) gave Bay’at. He even mended and dressed the shortcomings
in Caliphs’ proceedings. This confirms the legitimacy of
Caliphs.”**[3]**

“Ali has given Bay’at to both (Abu Bakr and Umar). Of course he has done
this prudently.”**[4]**

“The behavior and conduct of Ali and his reverend sons towards Caliphs
was such that it could be called an approval and pledge of
allegiance.”**[5]**

**Those who make the claims (that Ali gave allegiance to Abu Bakr) have
an aim:**

A) Ali’s acknowledgment to Abu Bakr serves an umbrella to them, covering
illegitimacy of Abu Bakr’s Caliphate. Besides it supports their
persistence in their design to prove Ali’s consent and concurrence.

B) To benefit from Ali’s acknowledgment by removing from the public mind
suspicion of illegitimacy of Abu Bakr’s Caliphate. Besides, to pose it
as a Caliphate having God’s pleasure. In other words, to provide a
sanctity under shade of Ali’s allegiance.

Therefore we must go through these allegations thoroughly:

In the meantime we would like to scrutinize these two claims:

1) Claims that Ali’s *Bay’at* tantamount to public popularity of Abu
Bakr’s rule.

2) Claims that acceptance of Abu Bakr’s rule proves Ali’s allegiance to
Abu Bakr.

Therefore in this analysis we shall evaluate the sources claiming that
Ali gave allegiance to Abu Bakr. They are as follows:

Source One: Divine legitimacy (Legitimacy granted by God)

Source Two: Public Popularity (Standard of public accord)

Source Three: Existence (A fact/occurrence)

We shall again thoroughly investigate historical documents related to
these claims to find the extent of Ali’s approval to Abu Bakr’s rule.

Because the above subject has taken for granted that Ali in fact gave
allegiance to Abu Bakr.

Accordingly we can evaluate Ali’s belief in legitimacy and popularity of
Abu Bakr’s Caliphate and thereby gauge its authenticity in the light of
History.
