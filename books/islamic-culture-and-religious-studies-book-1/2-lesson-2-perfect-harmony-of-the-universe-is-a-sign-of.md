Lesson 2 : Perfect Harmony of the Universe Is a Sign Of?
========================================================

My uncle Ali is a farmer. He loves his job and works tirelessly day and
night on his land. "Farming is the best of occupations," he often
says.

It was a fine morning in spring, when my uncle asked us to join him and
our Aunt Sarah for a picnic. Fatemah - my sister - and I were very
excited to visit them at their farm. What an awesome sight! The flowers
and the roses in full bloom were beautiful. The air was fresh, the sun
was bright and the sky a clear, cloudless blue. Everything seemed
perfect for our picnic that day.

Uncle Ali was sitting in the middle of their small garden preparing hot
cocoa as we played around him when suddenly heavy, grey clouds appeared
from nowhere! The sky turned dark and angry and it began to pour! By the
time we managed to grab our things and rush to the cottage, we were
totally drenched! What a drastic change in the weather!

Once in the cottage, we quickly changed into dry clothes and then
stared out the window at the sheets of rain as they fell. We felt let
down and began to complain about the storm that had ruined our picnic.

I went to sit next to Uncle Ali who was setting up the hot cocoa again
and grumbled, "Uncle, why of all the days did it have to rain today?"

Fatemah, who was still at the window, turned when she heard my
question. "Oh, Hassan! Why do you ask such silly questions! It's raining
and our picnic is spoilt, what does it matter why it rained?"

Aunt Sarah came over and put her arm around Fatemah. "Don't worry,
dear," she consoled her. "Be patient and I'm sure the storm will
clear."

Uncle Ali then spoke again as he poured out the hot milk into four
mugs. "In the meantime, why don't I answer the question you asked,
Hassan? It was a very good one…"

We always enjoyed the stories that Uncle told us and so we huddled
under the blankets Aunt Sarah brought and with mugs of steaming cocoa we
settled down around him. He began:

"Children, tell me, do you think we would be able to get food, milk,
vegetables, fruits and other things without rain on the earth? The
wonderful rain makes the crops that we eat grow and also nourishes the
plants that feed the animals. From the animals we then get meat, milk
and the other products we use in our daily lives. What would happen to
farms and cattle without rain? And what about drinking water? Without
rain, we would have a difficult time finding water to quench our thirsts
with! Rain helps us to get the basic necessities of life, without which
we would certainly die."

"I can understand that we need rain." I replied. " But, why did it have
to rain today when we had planned to play outside and have some fun?"

Uncle Ali smiled again, " Hassan, that is the Will of Allah (S.W.T.).
He knows best whether the land needed rain or not. Surely you couldn't
expect him to put off what others need just because of our fun? It is at
times like this when He wants to see our patience and calmness."

I realised how unreasonable I had been. Embarrassed, I looked at the
floor. Suddenly, Fatemah asked, "Aunt Sarah, how does rain fall and
where does it come from?"

I was interested in knowing this too, so both Fatemah and I listened
quietly as Aunt Sarah explained the wonderful system of the water cycle.
At the end she recited verse 164 of Sura Baqara that says:

"Verily in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the
alteration of night and day, and in the ships that sail in the sea with
that which is of use to men, and in the water which Allah (S.W.T.) sends
down from the skies thereby giving life to the earth after its death,
and scattering therein (every kind of) animal, and in the changing of
the winds and the clouds controlled for service between the heavens and
the earth:

surely there are signs (of Allah (S.W.T.)'s Rule) for the people who
understand." As we thought about the verse, we realised that Almighty
God has designed this magnificent universe through His Power and
Knowledge and He controls everything.

Uncle Ali was very happy to see that we were so interested in what he
and Aunt Sarah had said. "Keep it up!" he told us. "You have been able
to learn a lot of things today. Now you can understand that Allah
(S.W.T.) works in mysterious ways, but always for the good of His
creatures."

We smiled at him and thanked him and Aunt Sarah for telling us all the
amazing things they had.

"Look the sun is out again!" Fatemah exclaimed, pointing out the
window. She was right! The rain had stopped and the sun was shining
through the clouds that were already clearing up. So we were able to
have our day out after all and lucky enough to have learnt more about
Allah (S.W.T.) at the same time! Alhamdulillah! Allah (S.W.T.) worked in
a mysterious way to teach us more about Himself!


**SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT…**

1. One of the most amazing things in the world is the water cycle. A
simple explanation of the cycle is as follows:

The sun heats the surfaces of large bodies of water and this cause
evaporation to occur. When the warm air filled with this moisture rises
up to the sky, it cools in the low temperatures there, forming what we
call clouds. Winds normally blow these clouds inland and when the
temperatures are low enough for the moisture to turn back into water, it
falls to earth as rain. Some of this rain gives the soil important
nutrients and revives the plants and the rest falls back into the oceans
and rivers.

Then the cycle begins again! Can you imagine what perfect planning is
required to make sure that all these different forces of nature work in
perfect harmony and co-ordination?

2. From the above we can see that Allah (S.W.T.) in His perfect
Knowledge and Wisdom controls all the universal systems for the well
being of His creations. This is why we need a Creator who is absolutely
perfect and independent. Allah (S.W.T.)'s work is all in perfect
balance.

3. Whatever is in the Heavens, and the Earth and other
extra-terrestrial worlds, are the glorious signs of Allah (S.W.T.). We
only need think about them to realise it. So next time, you find
yourself looking at the world around you, stop for a few minutes and try
to see Allah (S.W.T.)'s signature in the wonders you see!

**Think and Answer**

1. Give some examples of God's perfection and how He controls the
world.
2. How can you learn and appreciate Allah (S.W.T.)'s Greatness?
3. Why did Uncle Ali have to explain to his niece and nephew about the
formation of rain and its importance to the earth?

4. What do you understand from verse 164, Sura Baqara in the Holy
Qur'an?

5. How does the above-mentioned verse show us Allah (S.W.T.)'s Power
and Greatness?


**Introduction to Chapter Two**

In The Name Of Allah (S.W.T.), the Beneficent, the Merciful

MA'AD

**The Life in the Hereafter**

There is a great need for us to understand that human beings are
created for a sacred goal in this world. This is the world for actions
and it is our continuous purpose to try and understand the philosophy of
this life.

Here are a few fundamental points that we must know to begin with:

1. We as human beings have not been created in vain and have a
specific, sacred goal in life.

2. All other creations in this universe have been made for the purpose
of serving human beings and also to beautify the awesome universe.

3. In this world, we have been given an opportunity to sow the seeds of
good actions. Our harvest will follow in the life after death and the
hereafter. All actions - whether good or bad - performed by human beings
will receive their deserving compensation. The good deeds that one does
will turn into beautiful rewards. On the other hand, when a person does
anything bad he will obviously reap punishment in the life of the
hereafter.

In this chapter, we will study about the nature and the need of the
great event of the Day of Judgement. We will also familiarize ourselves
with what Allah (S.W.T.)'s plan for this Day is.By knowing, appreciating
and fully understanding the holy aims of Allah (S.W.T.), we will be
better equipped to serve Him in the best possible manner.

In our discussion, we will study the meaning of death and the concept
of Shahaadat (Martyrdom). Are they different names for the same thing?
Hardly! Martyrdom is a most noble choice made by those who wish to taste
the sweetness of Shahaadat.

Through all this, we will see that those who work hard in this life and
try to do good will definitely see the results of their efforts. One may
not see the fruits immediately but it is important to fully trust Allah
(S.W.T.) and place our hope and confidence in Him.

Finally, we will read parts of the "Will of a Martyr". In this, we will
see how a martyr prepares himself to remain firm and take up all sorts
of challenges just to gain the nearness of Allah (S.W.T.).


**Lesson 3 : Harvest Period**

Summer was leaving and the warm colours and chill breezes told us that
autumn was around the corner. The week before school opened, Uncle Ali
invited us to join him on his farm for the long weekend.

We started our journey early in the morning. By the time we reached the
orchards, the sun was high and bright and the sky was clear. As we
walked past the trees towards the cottage, we could see large, ripe
apples ready for picking. The other trees in the distance looked equally
heavy with healthy fruit.

Uncle Ali had seen us arrive and he opened the door before we even had
a chance to knock. "Welcome!" he said heartily. "I see you are nice and
early."

After the usual greetings and hugs, we settled down to breakfast all
together. Aunt Sarah set down a large tray, full of fresh, rosy red
apples, on the table and then went to fetch the tea. Uncle Ali smiled
warmly at all of us and then gestured towards the fruit.

"I thank Allah (S.W.T.) for accepting my hard work and rewarding me
with good results this year. The trees in the orchards are full of
similar colourful gifts from the Almighty." Then he looked at Fatemah
and me and asked, "Do you remember the last time you came over in
spring?

Do you remember how annoyed and upset you were because of the sudden
rain? Well, I am sure you have realised that if it hadn't rained during
last spring, we wouldn't have seen our plants grow and our trees
wouldn't have had such lovely fruits.

When you eat and enjoy the juicy apples, let it remind you of the
rains!" We nodded as we reached out for an apple each. Neither of us had
forgotten what Uncle and Aunt had taught us that day and we hoped we
would get a chance to learn something new on this visit too.

As we munched on our apples and waited for the tea, Uncle Ali gave us
some magazines to read. We pored over them while he and Daddy talked. I
was going through one of the magazines when I came across a page that
read: ' The Will of a Martyr'.

I was reading the article and did not notice that Aunt Sarah had
brought the tea. Seeing how engrossed I was in the magazine, she called
out "What are you reading, Hassan? Why don't you read it aloud to us."

"It is a very interesting article about martyrdom," I replied. "This is
how it begins: 'And do not think those who are slain in the way of Allah
(S.W.T.) are dead, nay, they are alive and Allah (S.W.T.) sustains
them…' That is an ayat from the Holy Qur'an, isn't it?" I asked after
quoting the verse.

"Yes, it is," my aunt agreed. "What else does the article say?"

"Well, it is a Martyr's will that he left behind for his mother. It is
too long to read out entirely but I liked one particular paragraph," I
answered. "Listen to this :

'… How beautiful it is to become a Shaheed in the way of Allah
(S.W.T.). Its fragrance is like a tulip. Yes! It is indeed a road of
resistance and patience in defending Islam and its enemies. One may
become a Shaheed by seeking God's guidance and the teachings of the Holy
Qur'an.

In case I am blessed with such an honourable status - that of a
shaheed - my deepest congratulations will be to my beloved mother as it
is she who taught me and encouraged me to follow that sublime path.
Indeed! I shall be received as a special guest of Allah (S.W.T.).'"

There was a moment of silence when I finished reading out the passage.
How beautiful it sounded and what confidence the Martyr had in Allah
(S.W.T.). Rather than sounding scared of what was to face him, the
Martyr spoke with eagerness to meet this fate! I wondered at his
attitude.

Even as we sat down to eat, thoughts about what I had read kept running
through my mind. Finally, when we had eaten and my mother and aunt were
in the kitchen, I sat down near Uncle Ali. Seeing that he was not very
busy, I asked him softly, "Uncle! I have been thinking during breakfast.
Tell me, how does a person attain martyrdom and seek Allah (S.W.T.)'s
pleasure in the way of Islam?" My Uncle looked intently at me.

"Hassan, in order to find an answer to that, you must first ask
yourself some important questions. Ask yourself, who are you? Why were
you born? What is the purpose of this life? Why do you have to work so
hard in this world and expect the results much later, that is, in the
Aakhera? Why has Allah (S.W.T.) created some things that the naked eye
can see and others that cannot be seen nor perceived?"

He paused for a while to let the questions sink. Then he continued,
"Allah (S.W.T.) has created all these things - seen and unseen - so that
as human beings, we may benefit from them not only physically but also
spiritually because they remind us of His Blessings and allow us to
realise His Greatness.

"When we understand what a Magnificent Creator He is, we then seek
nearness to Him and want to please Him because He deserves to be
pleased. This makes us prepare more eagerly for death and the life after
death.

"You see, Death is the next stage of life, leading us to another world,
which is eternal. Do you think that all our actions and good deeds in
this world will go in vain? Aren't we going to earn the fruits of our
hard work in the next world? Doesn't this encourage us to find out more
about death itself? For a true believer, the life after death is the
best place since it allows him to be closer to Allah (S.W.T.), which is
his dearest wish. This is why he looks forward to it so much."

As Uncle Ali finished speaking, I finally understood why the Martyr
sounded so happy and confident. Fatemah who had also been listening came
up and tugged at Uncle's sleeve. " But Uncle! What exactly is
Martyrdom?" she asked.

"What an excellent question!" Uncle exclaimed smiling as he lifted her
up on his lap. "My dear Fatemah, Shahaadat - which is the Arabic word
for Martyrdom - in its true sense means 'to give away one's life for the
pleasure of the Creator'. A person who chooses to face all the
difficulties that come his way and fights against the enemies till the
last moments of his life is a 'shaheed'.

"A martyr is a person who knowingly walks on the path towards death
with a deep love for Allah (S.W.T.) and yearning to meet with His Lord.
A shaheed looks forward to achieving the highest stage of shahadah.
Paradise (Jannah) waits for such people and they will keep the company
of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) and Aimmah (a.s.) in the hereafter.

"We need to remind ourselves from time to time that this world is for
performing our good deeds. Our actions should be such that our Creator,
Allah (S.W.T.), is proud of and happy with us. Remember that only those
who work sincerely for His sake and thank Him for His countless
blessings will be rewarded! We must be careful of our deeds and stay
away from forbidden acts that displease Him.

"When we all rise and face accounting on Yawmul-Hisaab - the Day of
Judgement - it will be a terrible time! That day will be equivalent to
50,000 years! Those of us who had been good in this world will be happy
on that day but those who had been bad will curse themselves then!"

"Oh!" cried Fatemah. "Then I am going to try and be the best girl!"

"That is wonderful to hear!" Uncle smiled. " Now, let us go and enjoy
the fresh air and pick some apples for you to take home!"

Aunt Sarah and Mummy joined as we all walked out to the orchards to
pick fruit. As we walked Uncle advised us saying, "Always keep alert to
the Glory of Allah (S.W.T.) because He has said in the Holy Qur'an:

"The sun, the moon, the planets are all in motion, O men! Then wake up
from the deep sleep of negligence."

A Holy Verse The Qur'an says:

"Every soul shall taste death, and then they will return back to us."
Sura Ankabut, Verse 57

**SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT…**

1. Our Almighty Lord, Allah (S.W.T.), is the Creator of everything:
big, tiny or even microscopic. Not only that, He created even those
things that the human being cannot see! He is the Maker, the Planner and
the Creator. All this, He has created for a purpose.

2. Human beings, in particular, have been created to seek obedience
from Allah (S.W.T.) and to follow His chosen path. This world is the
place for putting our total faith in Him and performing actions that
would please our

Lord, the hereafter is the eternal world for getting our rewards or
punishment according to what we did.

**Think and Answer**

1. Pretend that you are trying to relate what you have just read to a
friend. Explain Uncle Ali's discussion about Shahadah and the hereafter
with the children.

2. Why do you think we have to wait for so long to get the results of
our actions i.e. until the Day of Judgement?

3. What are the wonderful blessings of God in the hereafter, and who
would deserves these blessings?

4. What is the status of a shaheed in this world and the next?

5. This world is the passageway for the next world. What does this
mean?
