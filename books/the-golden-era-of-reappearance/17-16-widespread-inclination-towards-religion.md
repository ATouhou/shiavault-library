16.  Widespread Inclination Towards Religion
============================================

• Imam Mahdi's (a.t.f.s.) style of religious propagation will be such
that people will accept religion from the depths of their hearts and
worship Allah with utmost sincerity. Those distanced from religion will
return to the abode of contentment and security.[^1]

• In the government of Imam az-Zamaan (a.t.f.s.), innovations,
irreligiousness and deviations will be uprooted.[^2]
