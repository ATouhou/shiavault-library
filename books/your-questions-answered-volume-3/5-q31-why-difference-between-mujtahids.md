Q31: Why Difference Between Mujtahids?
======================================

Why Mujtahideen differ in the same subject? For instance, some
Mujtahideen say that Namaze Jum'a is Wajib while others say that it is
"Wajibe-Takhiri" or Sunnah? A. There are many reasons, most important of
them being the difference in the interpretation of some crucial words or
phrases in Ayat or Hadith.

**Q32: MUJTAHID AND TAQLID**

We would appreciate any information you could give us on Taqleed. A. In
every sphere of life we have to heed the advice of the experts in that
field. Likewise, in the matter of Islamic Laws, we must obey the rulings
of the experts of that Law. Those experts are called Mujtahids; and the
act of obeying their rulings is called Taqlid. Here are some of the
conditions which govern our choice of the Mujtahid:

(a) He must be Baligh (i.e. adult),
(b) 'Aqil (i.e. sane),
(c) man,
(d) alive at the time of beginning the Taqlid.
(e) Ithna-ashari,
(f) 'Adil,
(g) Mujtahid,
(h) A'lam,
(i) Legitimate child,
(j) Having good memory,

(k) Not involved in worldly affairs so as to hinder his scholarly
persuits. 'Adil means a person who does not commit big sins even
unintentionally; and if he commits small sins (not intentionally) he
repents at once.

Only an 'Adil can lead in prayers, be accepted as reliable witness and
appointed as Qadi. A'lam means one who is the most learned of all.

**Q 33: CALIBRE OF IJTIHAD**

Nowadays "Ijtihad" has become a child's play. Without mentioning the
name of our Mujtahids, "AWAKE" published by Young Muslim Association of
South Africa condomned those who claim Ijtihad but do not have deep
knowledge.

A. I did not see the said article; South African publications are
banned in Tanzania. But you should not be too much worried about it.
There is no room of "Inferiority complex" on our part. Even admitting
that the word "Mujtahid' has been misused especially in India and
Pakistan, the calibre and character of our scholars is far better than
any other sect.

**Q34: HOW TO REFORM ISLAMIC WORLD?**

How can we reform the Islamic world today in the light of the Prophecy
of the Holy Prophet that in the period nearing Qiyamat people will go
astray? A. By telling them of those prophecies and warning them to
abstain from evil deeds. Forewarned is fore-armed.

**Q35.FRIENDSHIP WITH ENEMIES OF ISLAMS**

"O ye who believe, choose not for friends such of those who received
the scripture before you, and of the disbelievers, as make a jest and
sport of your religion........" (v.60). Is it a sin (according to this
verse) to establish friendship with Jews, Christians or Atheists?

A. Yes. A faithful Muslim should not be in intimate association with
those "who take your religion for a mockery or sport", because such an
association will sap the earnestness of his own faith and turn him into
a cynical and insincere Muslim.

**Q36: IS MIDDLE EAST WAR A JIHAD?**

When recently in England, I heard a friend saying that the recent
Middle East War was classed as 'Jihad'. I was very surprised to hear it
because I am under the impression that a war is classed as Jihad only
when fought for the defence of Islam.

A. A war is called 'Jihad' if it is fought with permission of Prophet
or Imam (peace be on them all). Also a war fought for the defence of the
Muslims (not "defence of Islam") is called Jihad.

Now the war of the Muslims against Israel is 'Jihad' (in the meaning of
Defensive War) because it is the Jews who have come from all around the
world to Palestine and have turned the Palestinian Muslims out,

usurping their country, land, farms and homes Now a generation has
passed that the Palestinian Muslims are living in tents of the refugee
camps, without any root anywhere. They are fighting to regain their
homes and motherland, and as such it is a 'Jihad'.

**Q37: CAN LADIES AND GENTS SIT TOGETHER IN RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL
GATHERINGS?**

The Ithna-asheris in our town (in Canada) have established a Union to
perform religious ceremonies. At the moment the Union does not have any
particular place to hold Majlises; they hire halls for this purpose once
a month. In these majlises and other social functions, our ladies and
gents sit in the same room or hall where there is no purdah at all.

The argument put by them is: "When our ladles go out for work or for
shopping, they are not in Purdah; then why purdah in majlis?

Also, they say that discrimination is prohibited in the country.

I, by this letter, seek guidance from you, according to the rules of
the Sheriat. A. I was shocked to read that the Union "is holding
majlises and other functions where the ladies and gents sit in the same
room or hall where there is no purdah at all".

It is amusing to note that they are doing it in the name of avoiding
'discrimination'. Your country is a Christian one. Neither the Catholics
nor the Protestants admit women into priesthood.

Catholic nuns are obliged to cover their whole body even in their
dormitories; and a woman going before the Pope must cover her whole
body, even if she, in her public life, is a 'striptease artist'.

So, the 'anti-discrimination' laws have not compelled the Christians to
relax their rules that are obviously 'based on sex-discrimination.

Now coming to the Shia Ithna-asheri Sheriat: -

It is the unanimous ruling of all the Mujtahids, right from the
beginning upto now, that:- 1. A woman must cover her entire body and
hair in such a way that it is not seen by any man who is not within
prohibited degree. (Within prohibited degree: with whom marriage is
prohibited, like father, brother, son etc. )

2. It is 'Harem' (unlawful) for a man to look at the body (or part
thereof! of a woman who is not within prohibited degree, whether it be
with lusty intention or without such intention.) Also, it is 'Haram' for
a woman to look at the body of a man who is not within prohibited
degree;

3. The above rules are for her whole body except the 'face' and hands
(from the wrists to the finger-tips); Note: Neck, ears and hair are not
included in face' and must remain covered.

4. So far as the face and hands (as explained above) are concerned, it
is the unanimous ruling of all the Mujtahids that it is Haram (unlawful)
to look at the face and hands of a woman, if that look is with lusty
intention;

5. The only difference of opinion is about looking at the face and
hands of a woman (who is not within prohibited degree) without any lusty
intention. Some Mujtahids say that it is allowed; others say that it is
not allowed.

The present great Mujtahids (Agha-e-Khoui, Agha-e-Milani,
Agha-e-Shahrudi and Agha-e- Shariatmadari) say that it is not Haram to
look at the face and hands of a woman who is not within prohibited
degree, without any lusty intention. But even then, they say that it is
'Ihtiyat-e-Wajib' to refrain from such looking.

Looking at non-Muslim women, who usually do not cover their bodies, is
allowed if it is without any lusty intention.

Now if someone is prepared to reach the furthest limit, he can do so
only if the womenfolk are prepared to cover their whole body from head
to foot in a proper way (not in revealing clothes). To put it in a more
clear way, a woman must cover herself as is done in Ihram, covering her
neck, hair and ears also, leaving only that part of the face open which
is washed in Wudhu.

This is the tenet of the Shia Ithna-asheri Sheriat And the Article 2,
Section 1 of the Constitution of your Institution binds it to follow
"Islam according to teachings of the Shia Jaffery Teachings".

I think it is high time for the Jamaats to make it compulsory for the
women to attend the majlises and other functions in proper Islamic
dress, even if they sit behind a partition. The Jews compel their
congregation to wear skul caps and prayer-shawls when praying in a
synagogue, and it is not considered as an undue hardship. Why our own
Jamaats and institutions cannot enforce such rules?

I know that these women do not observe purdah in their daily lives.
Someone may say that to make such women observe purdah within the
Imambara or majlises amounts to hypocrisy! But it is not so. By making
them observe the rules of sheriat every time they come to the majlis or
into imambara, we do remind them what they should be (and are not); we
make them remember how a good shia Ithna-atheri woman should dress.

This 'reminding' Is the most important factor in keeping the torch of
faith alive. By 'reminding' they will never forget their noble Islamic
heritage. Remove this restriction, and your children will not know the
difference between Muslim and non-muslim way of life.

**Q. 38: DRESS OF THE LADY-TEACHERS**

The Dar-es Salaam Ithna-asheri Union runs a Nursery School, which
employees Ithna- Asheri lady teachers. The Secretary of the Nursery
School, who is a male member, is in~charge of the overall supervision of
the smooth running of the school.

He directly deals with the Headmistress on certain matters requiring
his attention, i e. collecting fees from her for depositing in the bank,
attend to the requirement of repairs of the school whenever required and
such other matters, is the job done by him within the Sheriat?

The children are usually dropped in and collected after by their
fathers or messengers in which case the lady teachers are involved in
handing over the children to them. Also while paying fees the
Headmistress is involved in dealing with male members who come to pay
fees. In view of the above, are we allowed by Sheriat to employ
Ithna-Asheri lady teachers in the Nursery School?

A. Please read carefully the reply to the Question "Can Ladies and
Gents sit together in Majlises and Social Functions?" (given above), and
you will know the answer to your question.

I take this opportunity to emphasize the importance for Shia
Institutions of sincerely and faithfully following the rules of Sheriat
in all their affairs. I strongly advise the Union to adopt the Islamic
dress as the compulsory uniform for the teachers,

**Q 39:'PURDAH' CREATES RICKETS?**

Circumcision, indeed, prevents carcinoma but purdah (veil) predisposes
to "Rickets'. Why is it so much controversial?

A. How many Muslim women have fallen sick just because of "Purdah"? Do
you have any data to compare their rate of sickness and mortality with
those women who do not observe Purdah?
