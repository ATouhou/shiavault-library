60: Unity And Co-Operation In Imam’s Help
=========================================

There is great strength in unity even though each one of us is
personally obliged to help Imam (aj). The Almighty Allah says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And hold fast by the covenant of Allah all together and be not
disunited. (Qur’an, Surah Aale Imran 3:103)***

It is so because Imam (aj) is the connection between Allah and His
creatures in all times and this connection cannot be beneficial without
following Imam (aj) and helping him. Amirul Momineen (as) remarked in a
sermon: “O people! If you had not been deficient in supporting the truth
and lazy in deflecting falsehood, those unlike you wouldn’t have
overcome you. Those who have overpowered you would not have got the
power to do so. Because like the Bani Israel, you have lost your way.
And by my life! Your straying away will intensify because you have
discarded the truth.”

Imam az-Zaman (aj) says in the Tawqee to Shaykh Mufeed (a.r.), “If our
Shias (May Allah help them in His obedience!) had been united in
fulfillment of their covenant (regarding us) our meeting them would not
have delayed, and they would have soon met us with true and perfect
Marefat.”[^1]
