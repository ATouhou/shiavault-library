2) Fulfilment of God's Commands
===============================

No doubt, God's commands are issued for the benefit of individuals and
societies. A pious man, in order to gain these benefits, should always
obey God's commands. It is narrated from Imam Baqir(as):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اَحَبُّ الاعْمَالِ اِلى الله عَزَّوَجَلَّ مَا دَامَ عَلَيهِ العَبْدُ
وَاِن قَلَّت"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"The deeds most loved by God are those which the servant performs
continually, although they may be few."*[^1]

Of course, man, through his exercise and continuity of performing his
tasks, attains growth; or else, he would remain in one condition, which
is a complete loss. Regarding this, Imam Sadiq (as) has stated:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن اَستَوى يَومَاهُ فَهُو مَغْبُون وَمَن كَانَ آخِرُ يَومِهِ
شَرُّهُمَا فَهُوَ مَلعُون وَمَن لَم يَعرِف الزِّيَادَة في نَفسِهِ
كَانَ اِلى النُقصَانِ اَقرَبُ وَمَن كَانَ اِلى النُقصَانِ اَقرَب
فَالمَوتُ خَيرٌ لَهُ مِنَ الحَياةِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"He whose two days are the same, has suffered loss. He whose second day
is the worse of the two days, is cursed. He who does not see any
increase (in good) in himself is nearer to loss, and death is better
than life for one who is nearer to loss."*[^2]

It is on the basis of this fact that the Imam (as) orders his son and
his other spiritual sons to obey God's commands so that the spirit of
development and attaining genuine benefits and the obedience of God’s
commands are kept alive in children.
