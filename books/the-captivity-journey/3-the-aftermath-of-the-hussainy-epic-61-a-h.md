The Aftermath of the Hussainy Epic, 61 A.H.
===========================================

The Implication of the Hussainy Epic
====================================

The tragic scene of the epic is not completed yet, it is noon time of
the 10th day of Muharram, 61 A.H. as this day marked the beginning of a
new phase of striving, revolution, and the objective and conscious
exploitation of all the achievements of the Ashura Epic.

The heroes of the ongoing strive (Jihad) on the path of Karbala and its
method are different than the heroes of the battle of Karbala. As Zeinab
(O) seemed a shining star in leading the captives’ convoy while
following the orders of the Imam of her time, Imam Sajjad (Q), whom the
legitimate mandate required, in order to preserve the Imamate line, for
his stand to be the same as the stand of his grandfather, the Prince of
the believers (Q), on the day of the Dar, though he was the main
director of the course of events after the battle.

And the families of martyrs, consisting of widows and orphans, had
materialized the terminologies to perfect the Mohammedan striving scene.
That allowed history to write once again with the help of the rising
tears, the rebel cry of pain, and the stands of challenges and
confrontations in the Caliph’s castles, the Muslims’ Mosques, their
markets, homes and gathering places, as the captives’ convoy was an
inseparable part of the blessed revolution of Imam Hussain (Q)
