Kindness to Parents
===================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "The pleasure of Allah lies in the pleasure
of one's parents (in the case that it is right), and His wrath lies in
their wrath."

Mustadrak-ul-Wasa'il-ush-Shi'ah, vol. 15, p. 176

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "The best deeds are: punctual prayer, kindness
to parents, and contributing to the Holy War (against the pagans) in the
path of Allah."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 74, p. 85

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "He who wishes Allah, Almighty and Glorious, to
lighten the agonies of death, he should have regard for his kinship, and
treat his parents with goodness. Then, when a person does so, Allah will
make the agonies of death easy for him and he will not be stricken by
poverty in his life at all."

Safinat-ul-Bihar, vol. 2, p. 553

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "He who glares at his parents with wrathful
eyes, although they have been unjust to him, Allah will not accept his
prayers (unless he repents)."

Usul al-Kafi, vol. 2, p. 349

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "Do treat kindly your parents so that your
children do the same to you; and be pious unto the wives of people so
that your wives remain pious."

Al-Kafi, vol. 5, p. 554

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "Once a person came to the Prophet (S) and
asked him about good treatment to parents. Then, he (S) said 'Treat
kindly your mother, treat kindly your mother, and treat kindly your
mother; be kind to your father, be kind to your father, and be kind to
your father but begin (that kindness) with your mother before your
father'."

Al-Kafi, vol. 2, p. 162
