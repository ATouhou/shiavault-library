23. Disputing and Fighting
==========================

Article 160
-----------

“Dispute” is prohibited in the state of Ihram as it is mentioned in the
verse above, and here the purpose of “Dispute” is that swearing to Allah
from enmity and hatred of another person for proving a matter and saying
**“بَلی وَ الله”** it means that “Yes, I swear Allah that the matter is
like this”, or saying **“لا وَ الله”** which means “No, I swear Allah
that the matter is not like this” and there is no difference between
Arabic, Persian or any other languages, any expression which has this
meaning is Haraam to say in the state of Ihram.

Article 161
-----------

True or false swearing is the same in this ruling, but if it is false
then it’s atonement is one sheep at the first time, and if it is true
and it is repeated three times, then the atonement is one sheep. But
there is no atonement for saying less than three times, although it is
an illegal act and a Muhrim should ask forgiveness from Allah.

Article 162
-----------

It is better that a Muhrim abstains from any kind of dispute, debate and
enmity in the state of Ihram, although it performs without swearing
statements which has been said before, but expressing hatred and disgust
and avoidance of enemies of Islam does not only harm the Ihram, but it
is one of the duties of Muslims against infidels.

Article 163
-----------

Whenever a Muhrim says “I swear to Allah that do not perform this act”
because of kindness (not because of enmity) or says that “I swear to
Allah to let me do it for you” then this is not Haraam and has not
atonement.
