Spirit of Damascus
==================

Islam's first extension was towards Syria, where the power was centred
in the city of Damascus. Among living cities it is probably the oldest
city in the world. Its bazaars are thronged with men of all nations, and
the luxuries of all nations find ready welcome there. If you come to it
westward from the Syrian desert, as I did, the contrast is complete,
both in the country and in the people.

From the parched desert sands you come to fountains and vineyards,
orchards and the hum of traffic. From the simple, sturdy, independent,
frank Arab, you come to the soft, luxurious, sophisticated Syrian. That
contrast was forced on the Muslims when Damascus became a Muslim city.
They were in a different moral and spiritual atmosphere. Some succumbed
to the softening influences of ambition, luxury, wealth pride of race,
love of ease, and so on.

Islam stood always as the champion of the great rugged moral virtues. It
wanted no compromise with evil in any shape or form, with luxury, with
idleness, with the seductions of this world. It was a protest against
these things. And yet the representatives of that protest got softened
at Damascus. They aped the decadent princes of the world instead of
striving to be leaders of spiritual thought. Discipline was relaxed, and
governors aspired to be greater than the Khalifas. This bore bitter
fruit later.
