Chapter 11: Main causes of Rising of Imam Husayn
================================================

In these words as well as in his testament the Imam made his mission
known to the people. He said: "I am going to enjoin the people to do
good and to restrain them from evil".

What did he mean by this? Possibly most of the people who heard these
words of the Imam imagined that he wanted to go to Kufa and tell the
grocers and bakers of that city: "Do not weigh less. Do not sell bad
curd and cheese and improperly baked bread to the people".

Or that he might tell the merchants of Kufa not to charge interest. This
would be restraining from evil! Or that he might tell the residents of
Kufa: "Do not be careless about obligatory prayers. If you can afford
you must go to Makkah and perform Haj". This would be enjoining to do
good. But the Imam's object was much higher than this.

Of course this kind of enjoining to do good and restraining from evil is
something good and essential, but this task could be performed by the
ulema of Kufa and did not necessitate the Holy Imam's going there. In
fact Imam Husayn wanted to do something which none else could do.

In the conditions then prevailing it was only he, who could perform a
memorable deed whose freshness cannot fade with the passage of time, and
which cannot be effaced from the pages of the history of Islam.
