34. The creation of the Prophets and the Imams
==============================================

About the creation of the Imams and the Prophets, that is, how they were
created or the nature of their creation. Shias are not different with
others in its conception or conviction. About the creation of the
Prophet (S), the Sunni sect has a great deal of narration and
traditions. The same Sunni sources have much to say with regards to the
creation of Ali Bin Abi Talib, Imam Hasan, Imam Husayn, and Fatimah
daughter of Mohammed. As to the reason of the creation of the Prophet
(S) and the Imams the Quran gives a root***:***

***“Indeed, God has chosen you and purged you and selected you over the
men of the worlds.”***

As for the prophet Moses the Quran says:

***“And, We revealed to the mother of Moses to feed him with her milk
and if she happened to fear about him, throw him into the river and not
fear nor grieve. We shall return him back to her and make him among the
messengers.” (28:7)***

From this we infer that the mother of Moses was informed about the
return of her child back to her and that he would become a prophet of
God.

In his book Al Sifwa Zaid Bin Ali Bin Husayn describes the issue of
Ahlul Bait (members of the Prophet’s (S) House) their being chosen ones.
He lists from the Quran to support his statement. From a viewpoint of
Islamic principle and belief, the extra ordinary type of creation of the
Imams cannot be wired of taking into consideration the miracle in the
birth of Jesus Bin Maryam.
