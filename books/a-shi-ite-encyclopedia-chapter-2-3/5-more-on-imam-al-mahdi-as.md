More On Imam Al-mahdi (as)
==========================

The Shi'ite point of view of living al-Mahdi is not something that is
hard to believe if one believes in Allah (SWT) and His (SWT) Book, the
Quran. Indeed, the Shia aggressively assert that the concept of the
Mahdi (AS) being alive does NOT violate the Quran in ANY way, shape, or
form.

For the believer whose heart has been filled with the love of and
belief in Allah (SWT), there is NO hesitance whatsoever in accepting the
doctrine of al-Mahdi (AS). For we as believers in Allah (SWT), believe
in MANY hidden, unknown, miraculous, and seemingly impossible things
that are stated in the Quran. Not only are they stated in the Quran, but
a Muslim MUST submit in obedience and BELIEVE in these events.

We also believe that Allah (SWT) is capable of ANYTHING and NOTHING is
difficult or impossible for Him (SWT) to accomplish. Indeed Allah (SWT)
asserts unequivocally that if He (SWT) wanted something, all He (SWT)
has to do is to say to it: "Be! and it will be!"

Let us look at some examples of miraculous events reported in Quran.
Please take note of that NOTHING in the following verses or stories can
occur, EXCEPT by Allah's (SWT) leave.

We as Believing Muslims, believe Allah (SWT) when He (SWT) states in
the Quran that a man passed by a village and said to himself: "How can
Allah (SWT) revive this dead land?" Allah (SWT), in turn, put him to
death for one hundred years, and then brought him back to life.

Furthermore, Allah (SWT) had left the man's food INTACT for one hundred
years!!! Then Allah (SWT) told the man to look at the donkey and observe
how Allah (SWT) brings him back to life by reconstructing his bones and
enclosing them with flesh. When the man saw that, he said: "Now I know
(for certain) that Allah (SWT) is indeed All Powerful, and IS capable of
ANYTHING."

We as Believing Muslims, believe Allah (SWT) when He (SWT) states in
the Quran that the Prophet Abraham (AS) chopped up the birds into pieces
and dispersed their parts over the mountains and then called on to them
and they came flying by the leave of Allah (SWT)!!!

We as Believing Muslims, believe Allah (SWT) when He (SWT) states in
the Quran that the blazing fire prepared by the nonbelievers for the
Prophet Abraham (AS) turned cool when the Prophet Abraham (AS) was
placed in it!!! Not only did the fire turn cold, but it turned cold in
moderation to prevent the chill from killing the Prophet Abraham
(AS)!!!

We as Believing Muslims, believe Allah (SWT) when He (SWT) states in
the Quran that Jesus (AS) was born without a father by the leave of
Allah (SWT)!!! We also believe that he (AS) is not dead and that he (AS)
will return to Earth when Allah (SWT) wishes!

We as Believing Muslims, believe Allah (SWT) when He (SWT) states in
the Quran that Jesus (AS) brought the dead back to life by the leave of
Allah (SWT); and that he (AS) cured the sick, the blind, and others!!!

We as Believing Muslims, believe Allah (SWT) when He (SWT) states in
the Quran that the stick of Moses (AS) turned into a snake!!! We also
believe that the ocean was split in half to allow a safe passage for the
Jews to escape the persecution of the Pharaoh!!!

We as Believing Muslims, believe Allah (SWT) when He (SWT) states in
the Quran that the water of the Nile River was turned into blood by the
leave of Allah (SWT)!!!

We as Believing Muslims, believe Allah (SWT) when He (SWT) states in
the Quran that Solomon (AS) understood the language of the birds and
conversed with them; and with the ants; and with the Jinn; and that his
(AS) kingdom can fly up in the air; and that the kingdom of the Queen
Bilqis was brought before him (AS) in the blink of an eye, ALL by the
leave of Allah (SWT)!!!

We as Believing Muslims, believe Allah (SWT) when He (SWT) states in
the Quran that the people of the Cave (Ahl al-Kahf) were put to death
for 309 years or more or less, and then were brought back to life by the
leave of Allah (SWT)!!!

We as Believing Muslims, believe Allah (SWT) when He (SWT) states in
the Quran that al-Khidr (AS) is alive and that he (AS) has met the
Prophet Moses (AS) when they were together in a boat by the leave of
Allah (SWT)!!!

We as Believing Muslims, believe Allah (SWT) when He (SWT) states in
the Quran that Satan, the accursed, is still alive even though he was
born before Adam (AS); and that he watches us from where we cannot see
him by the leave of Allah (SWT)!!!

We as Believing Muslims, believe Allah (SWT) when He (SWT) states in
the Quran that Adam (AS) was born without a mother or a father by the
leave of Allah (SWT)!!!

We as Believing Muslims, believe that Prophet Noah (AS) lived more than
950 years. We as Believing Muslims, believe Jesus (AS) is still alive
and he is 1,994 years old now. We as Believing Muslims, believe that
al-Khidr (AS) is still alive.

All the above CANNOT be proved or disproved scientifically, logically,
or symbolically for that matter; yet, you ARE to ACCEPT it and BELIEVE
it, or you are NOT a Muslim that has TOTALLY submitted to Allah (SWT).
Why then believe all the above, but not the notion of the Mahdi (AS)?

Now, the question is: If you, as a Believing Muslim, are COMMANDED to
BELIEVE (there is no choice here) in the above issues, why is it so
strange to you when the Shia say that the Mahdi (AS) is alive and will
return when Allah (SWT) wills? Do you not believe in the Infinite Wisdom
of Allah (SWT), in that He (SWT) will bring forth the Mahdi (AS) when
the time is right? Is it not a clear promise by Allah (SWT) to grant
victory to His (SWT) religion?

Other than the concept of his being alive, there is no fundamental
difference between the Shia and the Sunni on the subject of the al-Mahdi
(AS). Since they both believe in his appearance towards the end of this
world, and that Jesus (PBUH&HF) will pray behind him in group prayer,
and that he will fill the earth with fairness and justice just like it
has been filled with injustice and unfairness, and that the Muslims will
control the whole earth in his time and that prosperity fills the earth
such that there won't be a poor person, and that all Muslims will unite
under his command.

So let's pray together to Allah that He would make that day near, since
his appearance is the victory for the nation of the Prophet Muhammad
(PBUH&HF).
