Gnosis (ma 'rifah)
==================

Â   
 The person of the gnostic ('arif) is with the people, while his heart
is with Allah. If his heart were to forget Allah for the time it takes
to blink an eye, he would die of yearning for Him. The gnostic is the
trustee over the happenings of Allah, the treasury of His secrets, the
repository of his lights, the proof of His mercy to creation, the
instrument of His sciences and the measure of His favour and justice. He
needs neither people, nor a goal, or nor this world. He has no intimate
except Allah, nor any speech, gesture or breath except by Allah, with
Allah, and from Allah, for he frequents the garden of His sanctity and
is enriched by His subtlest favours to him. Gnosis is a root whose
branch is belief.
