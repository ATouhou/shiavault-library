The Desired Success Of Ahlul Sunnat Faith
=========================================

It should be clear that the success and popularity achieved by Ahlul
Sunnat faith till this time shows a great transformation. No decrease or
increase is seen in the principles of its faith and the practical laws.
Doubtlessly, the Imams and scholars of Ahlul Sunnat have given it great
embellishments and decorations.

This religion is furnished with Quran, tradition, heritage, reports and
jurisprudence, laws etc. Presently, no sort of deficiency is seen in the
religion. However, if there is any shortage and deficiency, it is the
support to the family of the Prophet and the similarity with their views
through their words and deeds, as shown by the writer in the foregoing
pages and as shall be further explained in the following pages.

However, this matter cannot be open to objection in any way, because if
the scholars of Ahlul Sunnat had shown the same support and similar
views with the family of the Prophet as Shias scholars did, Ahlul Sunnat
faith would not have separated from Shia faith and achieved such great
success. Then in reality both the religions would have been one and the
same. In that case Ahlul Sunnat faith would have become extinct. The
aloofness of Ahlul Sunnat scholars from the Imams of Ahlul Bayt (a.s.)
was necessary for the popularity of Ahlul Sunnat faith.
