ALWAYS THANKFULTO GOD
Arthur Ashe, the legendary Wimbledon player was dying of AIDS. From
world over, he received

letters from his fans, one of which conveyed: “Why does GOD have to
select you for such a bad

disease?”

To this Arthur Ashe replied: The world over

5 Crore children start playing tennis,

50 Lakh learn to play tennis,

5 Lakh learn professional tennis,

50,000 come to the circuit,

5000 reach the grand slam,

50 reach Wimbledon,

4 to semi final,

2 to the finals,

When I was holding a cup I never asked GOD “Why me?”.

And today in pain I should not be asking GOD “Why me?”

Be thankful to GOD for 98% of good things in life.
