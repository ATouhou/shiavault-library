Good Natured-ness
=================

Good nature has been praised and ill nature has been condemned in
religion.

Allah the Most High said: ***“It is due to mercy from Allah that you
deal with them gently, and had you been rough, hard-hearted, they would
certainly have dispersed from around you.”***

The Holy Prophet Muhammad (S) said: *“The most perfect of the believers
in faith is the best of them in nature.”*

He (S) also said: *“In the balance of morality nothing weighs heavier
than good nature.”*

He (S) also said: *“Have good nature; for it necessarily guides you to
paradise. Avoid ill nature; for it necessarily guides you to hell.”*

He (S) also said: *“On the Day of Judgement nothing is more valuable
than good nature.”*

He (S) also said: *“He who has a good nature will have the reward of
those who observe fasting in the day and keep awake praying all of the
night.”*

He (S) also said: *“Ill nature corrupts deeds, in the same way that
vinegar destroys honey.”*

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) the Commander of the Faithful said: *“All of those who
repent remain faithful to it except the ill-natured people; for whenever
they abandon a sin, they indulge in another one worse than it.”*

Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (a.s.) said: *“The most perfect of human beings in
intellect is the best of them in nature.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“Ill nature corrupts faith, in the same way that
vinegar destroys honey.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“He who has a bad nature puts himself in
trouble.”*

Mentioning the standards of good nature, he (a.s.) said: *“You must be
humble, speak honourably and meet your brother cheerfully.”*
