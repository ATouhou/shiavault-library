Extract from the Preface to The First Edition
---------------------------------------------

"Sawm" or Fast is the 2nd most important "Ibadat" of Islam (after
Salat). This Unit is a collection of my five articles, dealing with
various aspects of the month of Ramadhan and Eid-ul-Fitr. Also, some
extracts from an article "Fasting" (from Readers'Digest) have been given
as Appendix.  
 I could have divided these articles into various lessons subject-wise.
But it was felt that it would lessen the impact of the articles.

Preface to the Second Edition
-----------------------------

The first edition contained no Masail (Rules of Shariat) of fast. In
this edition, important and necessary Masael have been added; these
Masael are according to the Fatwa of Agha Sayyid Abul- Qasim Al-Khuâ€™i.  
 If the reader wants more details about any rule, he may contact any
religious scholar or write to the Mission.
