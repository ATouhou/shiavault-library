Faith
=====

Definition
----------

Man's effort and movement, which are the very reasons of his existence,
have a starting point and a platform. That is called FAITH .Faith means
to accept and to believe in what man is trying for, in the way which
leads him to that aim and. finally, in his very effort and movement.

Without faith every movement or effort is evanescent and fruitless.
Without faith searchers become discouraged and mirthless and, as a
result, they become dumb, stagnant and motionless. Taking this reality
into consideration, the Qur'an emphasizes on "faith" and "the faithful"
and introduces this characteristic as the supreme value which stands at
the peak of all human characteristics.

Now let us consider the list of the most important Islamic values and on
the dignity of faith, which enjoys the highest rank among them, in the
following verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَنْ تُوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ
وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَلَٰكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ
الْآخِرِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ وَالْكِتَابِ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ وَآتَى الْمَالَ
عَلَىٰ حُبِّهِ ذَوِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينَ
وَابْنَ السَّبِيلِ وَالسَّائِلِينَ وَفِي الرِّقَابِ وَأَقَامَ
الصَّلَاةَ وَآتَى الزَّكَاةَ وَالْمُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِهِمْ إِذَا
عَاهَدُوا ۖ وَالصَّابِرِينَ فِي الْبَأْسَاءِ وَالضَّرَّاءِ وَحِينَ
الْبَأْسِ ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ
الْمُتَّقُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***It is not piety, that you turn your faces to the East and to the
West. True piety is this: To believe in God, and the Last Day, the
angels, the Book , and the prophets, to give of one's substance, however
cherished to kinsmen, and orphans, the needy, the traveler, beggars, and
to free the slave, to perform the prayer, to pay the poor-due. And they
who fulfill their covenant, when they have engaged in a coven­ ant, and
endure with fortitude, misfortune, hardship and peril. These are they
who are true in their faith. These are the truly God- fearing.
(2:177).***

In this way, in response to the believers of the Bible, who regard
Judaism or Christianity as the only way of salvation, the Quran lays
emphasis on the vast Islamic faith as the cause of man's salvation:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَقَالُوا كُونُوا هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ تَهْتَدُوا ۗ قُلْ بَلْ مِلَّةَ
إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا ۖ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ قُولُوا
آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَىٰ
إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ
وَمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَمَا أُوتِيَ النَّبِيُّونَ مِنْ
رَبِّهِمْ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ
مُسْلِمُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Say you: "We believe in God, and in that which has been sent down on
us and sent down on Abraham, Ismael, Isaac and Jacob, and the tribes,
and that which was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets, of their
Lord; we make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we
surrender. 'And if they believe in the like of that you believe in, then
they are truly guided ..(2:135- 136).***

Conscious Faith
---------------

In this regard, the following subjects are to be seen in the Qur'an:

1. Having faith in the principles and foundations of the religion is one
of the outstanding characteristics of the Prophet of God and his true
followers. It is so outstanding that the Qur'an has specifically
emphasized on it, saying:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
آمَنَ الرَّسُولُ بِمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ رَبِّهِ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ
ۚ كُلٌّ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَمَلَائِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ لَا
نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِنْ رُسُلِهِ ۚ وَقَالُوا سَمِعْنَا
وَأَطَعْنَا ۖ غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِيرُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***The Messenger believes in what was sent down to him from his Lord,
and (so do) the believers; each one believes in God and His angels, and
in His Books and His messengers; we make no distinction between anyone
of His messengers. They say, 'We hear, and obey. Our Lord, (grant us)
Thy forgiveness, our Lord! unto Thee is the homecoming'. "(2:285).***

2. Faith arises from understanding, intellect and knowledge; it is not a
blindfold and imitative belief. This very characteristic distincts faith
from other wrong devotions which are often absurd, fading and devoid of
any action.

In the following verses an evident indication of this kind of
understanding can be observed:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَاخْتِلَافِ اللَّيْلِ
وَالنَّهَارِ لَآيَاتٍ لِأُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الَّذِينَ يَذْكُرُونَ اللَّهَ قِيَامًا وَقُعُودًا وَعَلَىٰ جُنُوبِهِمْ
وَيَتَفَكَّرُونَ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ رَبَّنَا مَا
خَلَقْتَ هَٰذَا بَاطِلًا سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
رَبَّنَا إِنَّكَ مَنْ تُدْخِلِ النَّارَ فَقَدْ أَخْزَيْتَهُ ۖ وَمَا
لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنْصَارٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
رَبَّنَا إِنَّنَا سَمِعْنَا مُنَادِيًا يُنَادِي لِلْإِيمَانِ أَنْ
آمِنُوا بِرَبِّكُمْ فَآمَنَّا ۚ رَبَّنَا فَاغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا
وَكَفِّرْ عَنَّا سَيِّئَاتِنَا وَتَوَفَّنَا مَعَ الْأَبْرَارِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Surely in the creation of the heavens and earth, and in the
alteration of night and day there are signs for men possessed of minds
who remember God, standing and sitting and on their sides, and reflect
upon the creation of the heavens and the earth: 'Our Lord , Thou hast
not created this for vanity. Glory be to Thee. Guard us against the
chastisement of the Fire. Our Lord, whomsoever Thou admittest into the
Fire, Thou wilt have abased; and the evil-doers shall have no helpers.
Our Lord, we have heard a caller calling us to belief, saying, ..Believe
you in your Lord" And so we believed." (3:190-193).***

3. Only an enlightened mind can perceive this knowledge and
understanding; otherwise, faith would turn into a petrified and foolish
bigotry and the way to truth and salvation would be blocked for man.
This is why the Qur'an seriously condemns the bigoted and imitative
faith of pagans. Let us consider the rebuking and meaningful tone of the
following verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْا إِلَىٰ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ وَإِلَى
الرَّسُولِ قَالُوا حَسْبُنَا مَا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ آبَاءَنَا ۚ
أَوَلَوْ كَانَ آبَاؤُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَهْتَدُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***··And when it is said to them. 'Come now to what God has sent down,
and the Messenger, they say. Enough for us is what we found our fathers
doing. · What even if their fathers had knowledge of naught and were nor
guided?" (5:104).***

Dynamic Faith together with Action
----------------------------------

Does faith mean just an abstract belief or thought? Is faith worthy of
consideration as far as it is dynamic and decisive in shaping our life?

The Qur'an always associates faith with action and regards it a
motivation for crossing the way to the desired destination. In many
verses of the Qur'an rewards of this and the next world are dependent
upon the faith together with action. Listen to the Qur'an and think
about what it says here:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ارْكَعُوا وَاسْجُدُوا وَاعْبُدُوا
رَبَّكُمْ وَافْعَلُوا الْخَيْرَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَجَاهِدُوا فِي اللَّهِ حَقَّ جِهَادِهِ ۚ هُوَ اجْتَبَاكُمْ وَمَا
جَعَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ ۚ مِلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ
إِبْرَاهِيمَ ۚ هُوَ سَمَّاكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِنْ قَبْلُ وَفِي هَٰذَا
لِيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ شَهِيدًا عَلَيْكُمْ وَتَكُونُوا شُهَدَاءَ عَلَى
النَّاسِ ۚ فَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ وَاعْتَصِمُوا
بِاللَّهِ هُوَ مَوْلَاكُمْ ۖ فَنِعْمَ الْمَوْلَىٰ وَنِعْمَ النَّصِيرُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***O believers, bow down and prostrate yourselves, and worship your
Lord, and do good; haply so you shall prosper; and struggle for God as
is His due, for He has chosen you, and has laid on you no impediment in
your religion, being the creed of your father Abraham; He named you
Muslims aforetime and in this, that the Messenger might be a witness
against you and that you may be witnesses against mankind. So perform
the prayer and pay the poor-due, and hold you fast to God; He is your
protector an excellent protector, an excellent Helper. (22:77-78)***

In the above verses the most important peculiarities of religious
belief, which are victory, success, superiority, leadership of human
beings and, finally, the support of God, are dependent upon the dynamic
faith together with action. The following verse reminds us of actions
resulting from faith and specifies the role of dynamic faith in an
Islamic society.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَهَاجَرُوا وَجَاهَدُوا بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ
وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَالَّذِينَ آوَوْا وَنَصَرُوا
أُولَٰئِكَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءُ بَعْضٍ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَلَمْ
يُهَاجِرُوا مَا لَكُمْ مِنْ وَلَايَتِهِمْ مِنْ شَيْءٍ حَتَّىٰ
يُهَاجِرُوا ۚ وَإِنِ اسْتَنْصَرُوكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ فَعَلَيْكُمُ
النَّصْرُ إِلَّا عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُمْ مِيثَاقٌ ۗ
وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Those who believe, and have emigrated and struggled with their
possessions and their souls in the way of God, and those who have given
refuge and help those are friends of each other. And those who believe,
but have not emigrated-you have no duty of friendship towards them till
they emigrate; (8:72).***

Faith and Its Responsibilities
------------------------------

According to the verses mentioned previously true faith is inseparable
from action. Profiteers do not consider the responsibilities of faith as
an obligatory promise. They accept these responsibilities as far as they
are in harmony with their personal interests. Otherwise, they would not
take care of these responsibilities at all.

In the culture of the Qur'an these people, who may have some sincere
faith in their hearts, stored for the days of distress, are called
faithless and disbelievers. The Quran promises salvation, prosperity,
victory, superiority, to the faithful who, under all conditions, are
attentive to the responsibilities of faith.

The following verses are the clear voice of the Quran in this regard.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَقَدْ أَنْزَلْنَا آيَاتٍ مُبَيِّنَاتٍ ۚ وَاللَّهُ يَهْدِي مَنْ
يَشَاءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ وَيَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ
وَبِالرَّسُولِ وَأَطَعْنَا ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّىٰ فَرِيقٌ مِنْهُمْ مِنْ
بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ ۚ وَمَا أُولَٰئِكَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَإِذَا دُعُوا
إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِنْهُمْ
مُعْرِضُونَ وَإِنْ يَكُنْ لَهُمُ الْحَقُّ يَأْتُوا إِلَيْهِ
مُذْعِنِينَ أَفِي قُلُوبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ أَمِ ارْتَابُوا أَمْ يَخَافُونَ
أَنْ يَحِيفَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَرَسُولُهُ ۚ بَلْ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ
الظَّالِمُونَ إِنَّمَا كَانَ قَوْلَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذَا دُعُوا إِلَى
اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ أَنْ يَقُولُوا سَمِعْنَا
وَأَطَعْنَا ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ وَمَنْ يُطِعِ اللَّهَ
وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَخْشَ اللَّهَ وَيَتَّقْهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ
الْفَائِزُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Now We have sent down signs making all clear; God guides whomsoever
He willed to a straight path. They say, we believe in God and the
Messenger, and we obey.' Then after that a party of them turn away;
those-they are not believers. When they are called to God and His
Messenger that he may judge between them, lo, a party of them are
swerving aside. But if they are in the right, they will come to him
submissively. What, is there sickness in their hearts, or are they in
doubt, or do they fear that God and His Messenger may be unjust towards
them? Nay, but those- they are the evil-doers. All that the believers
say, when they are called to God and His Messenger to judge between
them, is that they say, ·we hear, and we obey, those­ they are the
prospers. He who obeys Allah and His Messenger, and fears God, and keeps
duty (unto Him); such indeed are the victorious (24:46- 52).***

And finally in the following two verses, the Qur'an gives the pleasing
promise of establishing the Divine government and ideal Islamic society
over the world to those true believers when deeds arc decent and tied
with faith.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مِنْكُمْ وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ
لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ كَمَا اسْتَخْلَفَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ
قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَيُمَكِّنَنَّ لَهُمْ دِينَهُمُ الَّذِي ارْتَضَىٰ لَهُمْ
وَلَيُبَدِّلَنَّهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ خَوْفِهِمْ أَمْنًا ۚ يَعْبُدُونَنِي
لَا يُشْرِكُونَ بِي شَيْئًا ۚ وَمَنْ كَفَرَ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ
فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***'"God has promised those of you who believe and do righteous deeds
that He will surely make them successors in the land, even as He made
those who were before them successors, and that He will surely establish
their religion for them that He has approved for them, and will give
them in exchange, after their fear, security: 'They shall serve Me, not
associating with Me anything ... "'(24:55).***

Promises (1)
------------

What does man need in order to obtain perfect prosperity?

1. He needs to know the aim and the right road to achieve it (guidance).

2. The veils of ignorance, ambition, fancy and every other thing which
cast a cloud over man’s vision and his power of thinking should be
removed. Instead, the light of truth should penetrate into his heart
(light).

3. In his long way towards prosperity he should get rid of confusion and
anxiety which are internal hindrances and are much more difficult than
external ones to overcome (tranquility and security).

4. He should consider his struggle fruitful and hope for an agreeable
conclusion.

5. His faults and guilt should be compensable and forgivable
(forgiveness and pity).

6. At any time he should enjoy a reliable and firm hold.

7. When confronting the enemies, he should enjoy the fruits of a power
superior to human being's power.

8. He should be superior to the opposite rank.

9. He should overcome the enemies of his aim and way who are the
obstacles to progress.

10. Finally, he should get rid of all the difficulties, hindrances,
bondages in order to accomplish his aim (success and prosperity).

11. In every situation he should enjoy what ha; been ready for man in
this world. At last, after the exhaustion of the span of life and
finishing all the struggle"- he should face a decent reward and response
in the convenient heaven.

Now let us consider the verses of the Qur'an which promise all these to
those believers whose faith is accompanied with responsibility and
action.

### Guidance

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ يَهْدِيهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ
بِإِيمَانِهِمْ ۖ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهِمُ الْأَنْهَارُ فِي جَنَّاتِ
النَّعِيمِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Surely those who believe, and do deed, of righteousness, their Lord
will guide them by their belief ...;" (10:9).***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

بِاللَّهِ وَاعْتَصَمُوا بِهِ فَسَيُدْخِلُهُمْ فِي رَحْمَةٍ مِنْهُ
وَفَضْلٍ وَيَهْدِيهِمْ إِلَيْهِ صِرَاطًا مُسْتَقِيمًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***··o men, a proof has now come to you from your Lord, We have sent
down to you a manifest light. As for those who believe in God, and hold
fast to Him. He will surely admit them to mercy from Him, and bounty,
and will guide them to Him on a straight path. (4:174-175)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

  </p>
</blockquote>

***"But those who struggle in Our cause, surely We shall guide them in
Our ways; and God is with the good-doers."(29:69).***

***"God is the Guardian of the believers; He brings them forth from the
darkness into the light. And the unbelievers-their patrons are idols
that bring them forth from the light into the dark ness; those are the
inhabitants of the Fire. There in dwelling forever. (2:257)***

***"O believer, remember God oft, and glorify Him at the dawn and in the
evening. It is He who blesses you, and His angels (bless you), to bring
you forth from the darkness into the light ... "(33:-41-43)***

</blockquote>

***·o believers, fear God, and believe in His Messenger, and He will
give you twofold portion of His mercy, and He will appoint for you a
light whereby you shall walk....(57:28)***

Promises (2)
------------

### Tranquility and Security

To get rid of confusion and anxiety is one of the most important
characteristics of the faithful. The Qur'an promises to provide the
faithful with this valuable spiritual state.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُمْ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ ۗ أَلَا
بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا
الصَّالِحَاتِ طُوبَىٰ لَهُمْ وَحُسْنُ مَآبٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Those who believe, their hearts being at rest in God's remembrance
in God's remembrance are at rest the hearts of those who believe and do
righteous deeds, theirs is blessedness and a fair resort. "
(13:28-29)***

Abraham (P.B.U. H.) explained this reality to the wandering pagans of
his time who did not enjoy internal tranquility and peace due to the
lack of any definite and logical ideology. He spoke about his inner ease
and security the origin of which was his solid faith.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَحَاجَّهُ قَوْمُهُ ۚ قَالَ أَتُحَاجُّونِّي فِي اللَّهِ وَقَدْ هَدَانِ
ۚ وَلَا أَخَافُ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ بِهِ إِلَّا أَنْ يَشَاءَ رَبِّي
شَيْئًا ۗ وَسِعَ رَبِّي كُلَّ شَيْءٍ عِلْمًا ۗ أَفَلَا تَتَذَكَّرُونَ
وَكَيْفَ أَخَافُ مَا أَشْرَكْتُمْ وَلَا تَخَافُونَ أَنَّكُمْ
أَشْرَكْتُمْ بِاللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ عَلَيْكُمْ سُلْطَانًا ۚ
فَأَيُّ الْفَرِيقَيْنِ أَحَقُّ بِالْأَمْنِ ۖ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ
الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَلَمْ يَلْبِسُوا إِيمَانَهُمْ بِظُلْمٍ أُولَٰئِكَ
لَهُمُ الْأَمْنُ وَهُمْ مُهْتَدُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"His people disputed with him. He said. 'Do you dispute with me
concerning God, and He has guided me'.' I fear not what you associate
with Him, except my Lord will my Lord embraces all things in His
knowledge; will you not remember? How should I fear what you have
associated with God that whereon He has not sent down on you any
authority:' Which of the two parties has better title to security, if
you have any knowledge? Those who believe. and have not confounded their
belief with evildoing-to them belongs the true .security; they are
rightly guided . "(6:80-82)***

### Fruitfulness

The faithful person knows that each step he takes makes him nearer to
his aim. He knows that his efforts and activities are generally fruitful
and none of them will be in vain.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الْقِبْلَةَ الَّتِي كُنْتَ عَلَيْهَا إِلَّا لِنَعْلَمَ
مَنْ يَتَّبِعُ الرَّسُولَ مِمَّنْ يَنْقَلِبُ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ ۚ
وَإِنْ كَانَتْ لَكَبِيرَةً إِلَّا عَلَى الَّذِينَ هَدَى اللَّهُ ۗ
وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَانَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِالنَّاسِ
لَرَءُوفٌ رَحِيمٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And We appointed the qiblah which ye formerly observed only that We
might know him who followeth the messenger, from him who turneth on his
heels. In truth it was a hard (test) save for those whom Allah guided.
But it was not Allah's purpose that your faith should be in vain, for
Allah is Full of Pity, Merciful toward mankind. (2:143)***
