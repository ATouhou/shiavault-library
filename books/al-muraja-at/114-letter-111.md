Letter 111
==========

Conviction
----------

**Jamadi al-Ula 1, 1330**

I bear witness that you, in the roots and branches of the faith, are
followers of the Imams from the Messenger's progeny. You have clarified
this matter and rendered it obvious, unveiled whatever was obscure
thereof; so, to doubt you is madness, and to mistrust you is
misguidance. I have scrutinized your letter and found it very pleasing.
I verified it and was able to inhale its divine fragrance which
nourished me with its sweet scent.

Before knowing you, I used to be confused about your beliefs due to what
I hear of allegations from scandal-mongers; now I have found it to be a
lantern that dispels the darkness, and I am leaving you victorious,
successful; so, how great is the blessing which Allah has bestowed upon
me, and how great your benefit unto me! Praise to Allah, Lord of the
Worlds, Wassalamo Alaikom.

Sincerely,

*S*
