19. Discrepancy in the date of birth of Mahdi
=============================================

The difference in the date of birth of the twelfth Imam is of very
little variance comparing to that of the other Imams. Some narration
says the date of Mahdi’s birth is at parity with the number of letters
in the word Noor that is light according to the ‘Abjad’ calculations.
The more acceptable statement is that of Mr. Fazl Bin Shazan, coeval
with Imam Hasan Askari, who indicates 255.

The 12th Imam birth was surrounded by conditions not usual or normal.
His absence was more than his appearance. His father, Imam Askari
allowed only a few chosen associates of his own to see his son and
become blest by his appearance. His short absence commenced as soon as
he became Imam. In his absence he appointed deputies who were his
agents. This was immediately after the death of his father Imam Hasan
Askari.
