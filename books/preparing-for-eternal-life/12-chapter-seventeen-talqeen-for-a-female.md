**Translation Into English**

(Listen, understand, listen, understand. Listen, understand O
(pronounce the name of the deceased and her father [according to another
source, her Mother]).

Are you on the pledge on which you left us by way of testimony that
there is no god except Allah, the One, there being no partner for Him
and that Muhammad, Allah may send blessings on him and on his Progeny,
and also salutation, is His servant and His Messenger and the chief of
the Prophets and the last of the Messengers;

And that Ali is the commander of the faithful and chief of the
vicegerents and the Imam whose obedience Allah has made obligatory on
the worlds; And that Hassan and Hussain and Ali son of Hussain and
Muhammad son of Ali son of Hussain and Muhammad son of Ali, And Jafar
son of Muhammad and Moosa son of Jafar and Ali son of Moosa and Muhammad
son of Ali and Ali son of Muhammad and Hassan son of Ali and the
existing Guide, the Mahdi, Allah's blessings be on them are the Imams of
the Faithful;

And the pleas of Allah over the entire creation;

And your Imams, the Guides, the virtuous (pronounce the name of the
deceased and her father [according to another source, her Mother]) when
come to you the two angels of high position and messengers from Allah
the High, and Exalted, And question you about your Sustainer, and about
your Prophet; And about your religion, and about your Book;

And about your Qibla and about your Imams;

Then do not fear and do not grieve and say in their reply that Allah,
His Glory be Heightened is my Sustainer and Muhammad, Allah may send
blessings on him and his Progeny and also salutation, is my Prophet, and
Islam is my religion;

And the Quoran is my Book;
And Ka'aba is my Qibla;
And the Commander of the Faithful Ali son of Abu Talib is my Imam;

All these, Allah's blessings be on them all, are my Imams and my
masters and my leaders and my intercessors.

To them I bear love and from their enemies I seek aloofness in this
world and the Next one.

Then know O (pronounce the name of the deceased and her father
[according to another source, her Mother]) that Allah the High and the
Exalted is the Best Sustainer;

And that Muhammad, Allah may send blessings on him and his Progeny and
also salutation, is the best Messenger; and that Ameerul Momineen Ali
son of Abu Talib and his sons, the eleven Imams, are the best Imams;

And that whatever was bought by Muhammad, Allah may send blessings on
him and his Progeny and also salutation, is True; And that death is
true;

And the questioning by Munkar and Nakeer in the grave is true;

And Resurrection is true, and that Revival is true;

And Sirat is true, and the Scale is true;

And the coming down of Scriptures is true;

And Paradise is true; and Hell is true;

And that Day of Judgement is to come, there being no doubt in it; and
that Allah would raise up those in the graves.

Did you comprehend O (pronounce the name of the deceased and her father
[according to another source, her Mother]) Allah may keep you firm in
firm talk Allah may guide you towards the Right Path.

Allah may create mutual knowledge between you and your friends in the
abode of His Mercy.

O Allah expand the earth from her two sides and take up her soul to
Yourself and grant her from Yourself a Plea.

O Allah, Your forgiveness;

Your forgiveness.

Talqeen should be recited in the deceased own language also.

**Procedure after Talqeen**

When the recitation of the Talqeen is completed, the grave should be
covered with wooden planks or stone slabs, and the grave filled with
soil. It is Makrooh for blood relatives to throw dust onto the grave
thrice with the back of the right hand.

The grave, when covered, should not sit higher than four fingers
breadth above the ground. If the grave sinks at a later date, more soil
is to be added to bring the level up to the height described.

The upper surface of the grave should be sprinkled with water from the
head to the feet continuously, with the person who is doing so, facing
Qibla. All the believers present should then sit on the ground and put
their fingers of their right hand into the moistened dirt and recite
Surah Al-Humd once and Surah Al-Ikhlas thrice. Bismillah should be
recited each time and Salawat (praying Allah's peace be upon the Holy
Prophet [S.W.S.] and his Progeny [A.S.]) said and the blessings awarded
to the deceased by stating their name.

The Talqeen should be recited again by the same individual leading
prayer, as all the people depart from the grave site.

N.B. A permanent construction of the grave, such as brick, cement,
stone, mortar etc. is Makrooh. Digging up the grave and constructing it
again is not allowed. [Sayyid, Hadi Husayn (1988).]


**Chapter Eighteen : Acts to Assist the Deceased in the Grave**

Sayyid ibn Tawoos narrates from the Holy prophet [S.W.S] that the first
night is the most difficult and fearful for the deceased. It is
recommended to give 'Sadqa' for the deceased, but is there is nothing to
give as 'Sadqa', then perform a two unit Rak'at (Namaz) .

In the first Rak'at, after Surah Al-Humd, recite Surah at-Tawheed
twice.

In the second Rak'at after Surah Al-Humd, recite Surah at-Takasur ten
times.

After finishing the Namaz, recite the following dua:

"Allaahumma s'ale a'laa Muh'ammadin wa aalw Muh'ammadinw wab-a'th
thawaabaha ilaa qabre d'aalekal mayyate fulan bin fulan" (here say the
name of the deceased person)

The Heir's Responsibilities to the Deceased The Holy prophet [S.W.S.]
is quoted as having said:

"There comes no night but that the angel of death calls to the dead in
the graves and inquires what they regret for today when that have
vividly seen (and known) this (the next life). Then the dead will say:
'Verily, we regret and envy the believers who are in their mosques and
they are praying while we are not, they give alms and we do not, that
fast during Ramadan but we do not; they donate in charity what they have
more than the need of their family members while we do not;..."

[Ayatullah Sayyid Kamal Faghih (1998), pg. 53.]

Islam commands the children of the deceased to discharge, on behalf of
the deceased, duties that they could not do so for themselves. Duties
such as Haj, Zakat, Fasting in the Month of Ramadan etc.

It is recommended that in holding a Majalis for the remembrance of the
deceased, to read Qu'oran and give Zakat on behalf of the
deceased.....It is of great benefit to them [Sayyid, Hadi Husayn (1988),
pg. 171].

The soul of the deceased is completely reliant on the living to do good
deeds and acts as they can no longer do so. Giving Fatihah to the
deceased is also highly recommended.
