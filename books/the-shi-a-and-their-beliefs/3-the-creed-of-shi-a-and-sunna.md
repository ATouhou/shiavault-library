The Creed of Shi!a and Sunna
============================

The world’s Muslims are divided into two groups – the Sh:!a who number
more than 500 millions, and the Sunnis who make up the rest of the
Muslims. There is no difference between the two groups regarding the
three fundamentals of the religion which are:

1. Belief in monotheism (taw9:d).
2. Belief in prophethood (nubuwwah).
3. Belief in the resurrection (ma!"d).
All Muslims believe in the existence of the one diety who is eternal
and everlasting, all-knowing and all powerful, ever living and self
subsisting, having no partner, and having all the beautiful
attributes.

All Muslims also believe that Alla\>h sent rightly guided prophets to
mankind as guides to direct them to the truth and to happiness in this
world and the next, and that Mu9ammad ibn !Abdull"h (N) is the ‘seal’ or
last of the prophets and that there is no prophet to come after him.
Similarly, all Muslims believe that when a person dies and his/her body
perishes his/her soul (or spirit) remains and he/she will be brought
back to life on the day of resurrection. Whoever has done good in the
earthly life will be of the people of the garden of heaven and bliss,
and whoever has done ill in the earthly life will be of the people of
punishment and hellfire.

As for divine justice (!adl)15, the Sh:!a believe that Almighty Alla\>h
is just and does not wrong anyone and does not act without purpose.

And as for Imamate, the Sh:!a believe also that the Prophet of Islam
Mu9ammad (N) appointed twelve successors and said: ‘The successors
(khulaf"’) after me will be twelve.’16 He (N) also said: ‘Whoever dies
without knowing the Imam (leader) of his time has died the death of the
age of ignorance.’17 These twelve successors were named18 by the
messenger of Alla\>h (N) himself and they are, in order:

1. Imam !Al: ibn AbY ھ"lib (Amir al-Mo’mineen) (a.s.).
2. Imam .asan ibn !Al:. (al-Mujtab") (a.s.).
3. Imam .usayn ibn !Al: (Sayyid al-Shuhada\>’) (a.s.).
4. Imam !Al: ibn .usayn (al-Sajj"d) (a.s.).
5. Imam Mu9ammad ibn !Al: (al-B"qir) (a.s.).
6. Imam Ja!far ibn Mu9ammad (al-£"diq) (a.s.).
7. Imam MYs" ibn Ja!far (al-K"dim) (a.s.).
8. Imam !Al: ibn MYs" (al-Ri+") (a.s.).
9. Imam Mu9ammad ibn !Al: (al-Jaw"d) (a.s.).
10. Imam !Al: ibn Mu9ammad (al-H"d:) (a.s.).
11. Imam .asan ibn !Al: (al-!Askar:) (a.s.).
12. Imam Muh}ammad ibn .asan (al-Muntadar al-Mahd:) (a.s.).

The last of the successors of these pure people is the Imam who is
Muntadar (the awaited) Mahd: (rightly guided Imam) who is alive in this
world but hidden from sight and who will appear at the end of time when
Alla\>h grants him permission so that he can fill the earth with justice
and equity after it having been filled with wrongdoing and oppression.
Then the servants of Alla\>h will unite under his banner in a single
Islamic government which will flourish by the will of Alla\>h. There are
widespread traditions about him reported from the Prophet Mu9ammad
(N).19 The Sh:!a have brought forward proofs and evidences for these two
fundamentals of religion (os}ool al-deen) – divine justice and Imamate –
from both rational and traditional sources. As for the ‘branches’ of
Islam (furu\>‘ al-deen) meaning the acts of worship and social contracts
and all other laws and rulings of Islam, Sh:!a Muslims have stated that
the sources for them are four:

1. The Holy Qur’"n. This is the book which is in the hands of the
Muslims today. It has neither been added to or subtracted from.

2. The Purified Traditions (the sunnah) reported from the Prophet (N)
and his pure family (a.s.).

3. The consensus (ijm"!) of the Muslims.

4. Reason.

They have also said that the door to independent legal judgement
(ijtih"d) is open, so whoever derives - according to the proper
conditions - a ruling from these four sources may act upon it.
Introducing the Shi!a The word ‘sh:!a’ is derived from an Arabic word
meaning ‘following’. The word sh:!a is applied in the Holy Qur’"n to the
followers of Noah (a.s.) as Almighty Alla\>h says: eAnd indeed amongst
his followers (sh:!a) was Abrahamf20 The Prophet (N) applied the name
sh:!a to the followers of Imam !Al: (a.s.) and named them with this
name, and it is related by historians and traditionalists of the Sh:!a
and the Sunni schools alike in their books that the Prophet (N) said: ‘O
!Al:, you and your sh:!a (followers) are the ones who will triumph.’21
Thus the followers of Imam !Al: (a.s.) were known by this name from the
days of the Messenger of Alla\>h (N) who was the first to apply this
name to them. And since the speech of the Messenger (N) is revelation
from Almighty Alla\>h who has said in the Holy Qur’"n [referring to the
Prophet]: eAnd he does not speak of his own desire, it is nought but
revelation revealed to himf22 it follows that naming the Sh:!a this name
is nothing but revelation from Almighty Allah.

The Sh:!a are those Muslims who follow Amir al-Mo’mineen (Commander of
the Believers) Imam !Al: ibn AbY ھ"lib (a.s.) and his pure sons (a.s.)
after the Messenger of Alla\>h (N); and this is following the order of
the Noble Messenger (N) who said before his death: ‘I am soon to be
called and will answer, and I am leaving with you the two weighty things
(thaqalayn). As long as you adhere to these two you will never go astray
after me ever; the book of Alla\>h and my family; the people of my
house.’23 The Messenger of Alla\>h (N) also said: ‘!Al: is with the
truth and the truth is with !Al:.’24

He (N) also said: ‘There will occur dissension after me. When this
happens then align yourselves with !Al: ibn AbY ھ"lib for he is the
first who will see me and the first who will shake my hand on the day of
resurrection and he will be with me in the highest heaven and he is the
criterion (al-f"rYq) between truth and falsehood.’25 He (N) also said:
‘There will occur dissension after me. When this happens then align
yourselves with !Al: ibn AbY ھ"lib for he is the criterion (al-f"rYq)
between truth and falsehood.’26 He (N) also said: ‘Amongst the people
there will occur schism and difference but this man (meaning !Al:
[a.s.]) and his companions are in the right.’27

The Sh:!a are also named the ‘Imamites (im"m:yah)’ as they believe in
the imamate of !Al:, Amir al-Mo’mineen (Commander of the Believers), and
his eleven sons and grandsons (a.s.).

They are also named the ‘Ja!farites (ja!far:yah)’ since they follow the
Imams of the people of the prophet’s house (the Ahl al-Bayt) in matters
of what is lawful and unlawful since these Imams are most knowledgeable
of the book of Alla\>h and what the Messenger of Alla\>h (N) said. The
sixth of these Imams is Ja!far ibn Mu9ammad (known as ‘al-£"diq’, ‘the
truthful’). He was able to propagate Islamic teachings – the
fundamentals (os}ool al-deen), branches (furu‘ al-deen), etiquettes
(adab) and ethics (akhla\>q) - in a more comprehensive and complete
manner, something which conditions did not permit the rest of the Imams
to do in such a complete way. The Sh:!a took from Imam Ja!far most of
the features of their religion and for this reason they are related to
him. The other Imams did not have as much opportunity to do this as they
met with troubles as in the time of !Al: and his sons .asan and .usayn
(a.s.), or with oppression and terror from the Umayyad and Abbasid
Caliphs. However, Imam £"diq (a.s.) lived during a period in which the
Umayyad dynasty was in decline and the Abbasid dynasty was in ascendance
and he took the opportunity to spread the realities of Islam on a wide
scale. The Sh:!a are also named the ‘Twelvers (ithn" !ashar:yah)’ as
they believe in the Imamate of the twelve Imams of the Prophet’s house,
the prophet having said: ‘The successors after me will be twelve in
number.’28

The Sh:!ite sect, then, is a practical form of Islam as the Prophet (N)
and his pure household put forward. The other Islamic sects are
practical forms of Islam as put forward by these particular sects’
leaders.
