The Final Hours of the Day of Ashura
====================================

All the women of Imam Hussain (Q) along with his daughters and children
had gathered under the captivity of the enemies, while occupied by
sadness, distress and weeping. That day had ended while they were in so
much sorrow and grieve that no heart can bear. They spent that night
having lost their men and protectors, strangers where ever they reside
or travel. Yet, the enemies exaggerate in abandoning them and staying
away from them, aiming for the consent of the hypocrite Omar Bin Saad
who had wounded the hearts and caused for the children of the Messenger
of Allah (P) to become orphans. Also, they wanted to become closer to
the libertine, Obayd Allah Bin Ziad, who was appointed by the infidel,
Yazeed Bin Muawiya, the head of obstinacy and disbelieving.
