Lesson Four: Role of The Pen
============================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"ما رَأَيْتٌ باكِياً اَحْسَنَ تَبَسُّماً مِنَ القَلَمِ!”
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

I have not seen any weeper nicely smiling like a pen. [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The pen divulges the feelings and interprets the wisdom of man.

The pen is founder of civilizations and rotates the wheels of society.
The pen conveys the worries and pain of man through its continuous
weeping. It can at the same time brighten the landscape with its smile
when it touches upon life’s beauty and love, desire for life and its
mysteries.

But it is regretful that when this pen is in hands of an incompetent
person, its tears will change to drops of blood, and its smile is a
snicker on the utmost human credits.
