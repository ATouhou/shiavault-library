Attacking the House of Fatimah (as)
===================================

A Sunni Brother mentioned that the Caliphate of Abu Bakr is the
Consensus of scholars (Ijma'). It is incumbent upon Muslims to accept
the Ijma'.

First I would like to point out that we also believe that Ijma'a is
binding. But, my brother, how can Sunni scholars make Ijma'a on
something that the Prophet and some of his companions opposed it? This
opposition is a clear evidence to the fact that there is no Ijma'a in
that very matter.

As for the Prophet (PBUH&HF), I mentioned the authentic Sunni
traditions in the previous articles where he gave Imam Ali the position
that Haroon had to Moses. That position is explained in Quran whose
verses I mentioned. The verses show that:

1-Allah is the one who appoints the Caliph.

2-The verse also uses the word "Ukhlofni" which is exactly the verb
form of Khalif.

Moreover, I reproduced the historical reports documented by the Sunni
scholars concerning the fact that the Messenger of Allah unequivocally
announced Imam Ali (AS) as his successor in his first open preach. I
also mentioned the authentic and frequent tradition of Ghadir Khum where
the Prophet declared the leadership of Imam Ali (AS) officially.

Now, my brother, how can Ijma'a exist on this important issue when the
Messenger of Allah oppose it? This is enough for us to close the issue
of Ijma'a on this subject. However let us, now, go a little further:

Even the companions did not all agree that all these four individuals
are the legitimate successors of the Prophet (PBUH&HF). Muslims agree
that the caliphate of Abu Bakr came through election by a limited number
of people and was a surprise for all other companions.

By limited, I mean, a majority of the prominent companions of prophet
had no knowledge of this election. Ali, Ibn Abbas, Uthman, Talha,
Zubair, Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqqas, Salman al- Farsi, Abu Dhar, Ammar Ibn
Yasir, Miqdad, Abdurrahman Ibn Owf were among those who were not
consulted or even informed of.

Even Umar confessed to the fact that the election of Abu Bakr was
without consultation of Muslims. (See sahih al-Bukhari, Arabic-English,
v8, Tradition \#817)

My dear brother, we can not close our eyes to the undeniable facts
documented even by the Sunni scholars, and yet claim to have Ijma'a.
After the demise of the Prophet (PBUH&HF), those who heed what the
Messenger of Allah ordered them such as Ammar Ibn Yasir, Abu-Dhar
al-Ghafari, Miqdad, Salman al-Farsi, Ibn Abbas, and others such as
al-Abbas, Utbah Ibn Abi Lahab, Bara Ibn Azib, Ubay Ibn Ka'b, Sa'd Ibn
Abi Waqqas ... etc., all gathered in the house of Fatimah (AS).

Even Talha and al-Zubair were loyal to Imam Ali at the beginning and
joint the others in the house of Fatimah (AS). They assembled in the
house of Fatimah as a place of refuge since they were opposing the
majority of people. According to the authentic traditions in Sahih
al-Bukhari, Umar confessed that the Imam Ali (AS) and his followers
OPPOSED Abu Bakr.

Al-Bukhari narrated:

Umar said: "And no doubt after the death of the Prophet we were
informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of
Bani Sa'da. 'Ali and Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while
the emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr."

Sunni Reference: Sahih al-Bukhari, Arabic-English, v8, Tradition
\#817

Other Sunni traditionists narrated that on the day of Saqifah:

Umar said: "Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Zubair Ibn Awwam and those who were with
them separated from us (and gathered) in the house of Fatimah, the
daughter of the messenger of Allah."

Also:

They demanded confirmation of the oath, but Ali and al-Zubair stayed
away. Al-Zubair drew his sword (from the scabbard), saying, "I will not
put it back until the oath of allegiance is rendered to Ali." When this
news reached Abu Bakr and Umar, the latter said, "Hit him with a stone
and seize the sword." It is stated that Umar rushed (to the door of the
House of Fatimah) and brought them forcibly while telling them that they
must give their oath of allegiance willingly or unwillingly.

Sunni reference: History of al-Tabari, English version, v9, pp
188-189

Dear brother, let's just think a little! What kind of election was
that?! Election implies choice and freedom, and that every Muslim has
the right to elect the nominee. Whoever refuses to elect him does not
oppose God or His Messenger because neither God nor His Messenger
appointed the nominated person by people.

Election, by its nature, does not compel any Muslim to elect a specific
nominee. Otherwise, the election would be coercion. This means that the
election would lose its own nature and it would be a dictatorial
operation. It is well known that the Prophet said: "There is no validity
for any allegiance given by force."

Now let us see what Umar did on those days. Sunni historians reported
that:

When Umar came to the door of the house of Fatimah, he said:
"By Allah, I shall burn down (the house) over you unless you come out
and give the oath of allegiance (to Abu Bakr)."

Also:

Umar Ibn al-Khattab came to the house of Ali. Talha and Zubair and some
of the immigrants were also in the house. Umar cried out: "By God,
either you come out to render the oath of allegiance, or I will set the
house on fire." al-Zubair came out with his sword drawn. As he stumbled
(upon something), the sword fell from his hand so they jumped over him
and seized him."

Sunni Reference: History of Tabari, English version, v9, pp 186-187 In
the footnotes of the same page (p187) in the English version of the
History of al-Tabari the translator has commented:

Although the timing is not clear, it seems that Ali and his group came
to know about Saqifa after what had happened there. At this point, his
supporters gathered in Fatimah's house. Abu Bakr and Umar, fully aware
of Ali's claims and fearing a serious threat from his supporters,
summoned him to the mosque to swear the oath of allegiance.

Ali refused, and so the house was surrounded by an armed band led by
Abu Bakr and Umar, who threatened to set it on fire if Ali and his
supporters refused to come out and swear allegiance to Abu Bakr. The
scene grew violent and Fatimah was furious. (See Ansab Ashraf, by
al-Baladhuri in his , v1, pp 582-586; Tarikh Ya'qubi, v2, p116;
al-Imamah wal-Siyasah, by Ibn Qutaybah, v1, pp 19-20).

Abu Bakr said on the authority of an authentic report that, after the
demise of the holy Prophet when the people had paid fealty to him, Ali
and Zubair used to go to Fatimah al-Zahra, daughter of the Prophet, for
consultation. When this fact was known to Umar, he went to Fatimah and
said:

"O' daughter of the Prophet! I didn't love anyone as much as I loved
your father, nor anyone after him is more loving to me as you are. But I
swear by Allah that if these people assemble here with you, then this
love of mine would not prevent me from setting your house on fire."

Also it is reported that:

Umar said to Fatimah (who was behind the door of her house): "I know
that the Prophet of God did not love any one more than you, but this
will not stop me to carry out my decision. If these people stay in your
house, I will burn the door in front of you."

Sunni reference: Kanz al-Ummal, v3, p140

In fact Shibli Numani himself testifies the above event in the
following words:

"From Umar's irritable and peevish temperament such an action on his
part was not improbable."

Sunni reference: al-Faruq, by Shibli Numani, p44

It is also reported that:

Abu Bakr said (on his death bed): "I wish I had not searched for
Fatimah's house, and had not sent men to harass her, though it would
have caused a war if her house would have continued to be used as a
shelter."

**Sunni references:**

- History of Ya'qubi, v2, pp 115-116
- Ansab Ashraf, by al-Baladhuri, v1, pp 582,586

The historian named the following people among those who attacked the
house of Fatimah to disperse people who sheltered there:

- Umar Ibn al-Khattab
- Khalid Ibn Walid
- Abdurrahman Ibn Ouf
- Thabit Ibn Shammas
- Ziad Ibn Labid
- Muhammad Ibn Maslamah
- Salamah Ibn Salem Ibn Waqash
- Salamah Ibn Aslam
- Usaid Ibn Hozair
- Zaid Ibn Thabit


The revered Sunni scholar, Abu Mohammad Abdullah Ibn Muslim Ibn
Qutaybah Daynuri in his history of Caliphs known as "al-Imamah wa al-
Siyasah" reported:

Umar asked for wood, and told those people inside the house: "I swear
by Allah who has my soul in his hand, that if you do not come out, I
will burn the house." Someone told Umar that Fatimah was inside the
house. Umar said: "So what! It doesn't matter to me who is in the
house."

Sunni reference: al-Imamah wa al-Siyasah by Ibn Qutaybah, v1, pp
3,19-20 Another Sunni historian, al-Baladhuri, reported that:

Abu Bakr asked Ali to support him, but Ali refused, then Umar went
toward the Ali's house with a burning torch. At the door he met Fatimah
who said to him: "Do you intend to burn the door of my house?" Umar
said: "Yes, because this act will strengthen the faith brought to us by
your father."

Sunni reference: al-Ansab Ashraf, by al-Baladhuri, v1, pp 582,586 Also
Jouhari in his book said: "Umar and a few Muslims went to the house of
Fatimah to burn it down and to burn those who were in opposition." Ibn
Shahna said the same statement adding "to burn the house and
inhabitants".

Furthermore, it is reported that:

Ali and Abbas were sitting inside the house of Fatimah, Abu Bakr told
Umar: "Go and bring them; if they refuse, kill them." Umar brought fire
to burn the house. Fatimah came near the door and said: "O son of
Khattab, have you come to burn our house on me and my children?" Umar
replied: "Yes I will, by Allah, until they come out and pay allegiance
to the Prophet's Caliph."

**Sunni reference:**

- Iqd al-Fareed, by Ibn Abd Rabb, Part 3, Pg. 63
- al-Ghurar, by Ibn Khazaben, related from Zayd Ibn Aslam

Everybody came out of the house except Imam Ali (AS), who said: "I have
sworn to remain home until I collect the Quran." Umar refused but Lady
Fatimah's remonstration caused him to return. He instigated Abu Bakr to
pursue the matter, and he send Qunfuz (his slave) several times but
received a negative reply each time.

Ultimately, Umar went with a group of people to the Fatimah's house.
When she heard their voice, she cried loudly; "O father, O Messenger of
Allah, how are Umar Ibn al-Khattab and Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Quhafah treating
us after you and how do they meet us."

The Sunni scholars, Ahmad Ibn Abdul Aziz al-Jawhari in his book
'Saqifah', Abu Waleed Muhibbuddin Mohammad al-Shahnah al-Hanafi in his
book 'Rawdhat al-Manadhir Fi Akhbaar al-Awayil wal-Aawaakhir', Ibn Abil
Hadid in his book 'Sharh al-Nahj', and others have reported the events
to the same effect.

Also refer to the esteemed Sunni historian Abul Hasan, Ali Ibn
al-Husain al- Mas'udi who in his book 'Isbaat al-Wasiyyah' describes the
events in detail and reports that: "They surrounded Ali (AS) and burned
the door of his house and pulled him out against his will and pressed
the leader of all women (Hadhrat Fatimah (AS)) between the door and the
wall killing Mohsin (the male-child she was carrying in her womb for six
months)."

Salahuddin Khalil al-Safadi another Sunni scholar in his book 'Waafi
al- Wafiyyaat' under the letter 'A' while recording the view of Ibrahim
Ibn Sayyar Ibn Hani al-Basri, well-known as Nidhaam quotes him to have
said: "On the day of 'Bay'aat' (paying allegiance), Umar hit Fatimah
(AS) on the stomach such that child in her womb died."

Why do you think an 18 year old young lady was forced to walk with the
help of a walking-stick? Unbelieveable acts of cruelty and oppression
had led Hadhrat Fatimah al-Zahra (AS) to lament: "Such calamities have
visited me that had they descended on the day it would have darkened
it." She fell into bed till she was martyred as a results of these
calamities and injuries while she was just eighteen years old!

During her last days, when Abu Bakr and Umar sought the mediation of
Imam Ali (AS) to visit the ailing Hadhrat Fatimah (AS), as quoted by Ibn
Qutaybah, she tured her face to the wall when they greeted her and in
response to their plea for appeasement reminded them of the prophetic
declaration that one who displeases Fatimah (AS) has displeased the
Prophet and finally said:

"I take Allah and the angels to be my witness that you have not pleased
me; on the other hand, you have angered me. When I shall meet the
Prophet (PBUH&HF) I will complain about you two." (al-Imamah wa al-
Siyasah, by Ibn Qutaybah, v1, p14).

For the same reason, she willed that those who have hurt her should not
participate in her funeral rites and that she be buried at night. al-
Bukhari in his Sahih attests to this fact that Imam Ali (AS) complied
with the will of Lady Fatimah (AS). al-Bukhari narrated on the authority
of Aisha that:

... Fatimah became angry with Abu Bakr and kept away from him, and did
not talk to him till she died. She remained alive for six months after
the death of the Prophet. When she died, her husband 'Ali, buried her at
night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral prayer by
himself.

v5, tradition \#546, pp 381-383, also v4, Tradition \#325

Howsoever they tried, people failed to locate her grave. It was known
only to a handful of Imam Ali (AS)'s family members. And to this date,
the grave of the daughter of prophet is unknown which is another sign of
her unhappiness from some of the companions.
