Fulfillment of Pledge
=====================

Imam al-Ridha (a.s.) said, “One day Ma’mun told me: ‘O Abu al-Hasan! I
would like you to write a letter to some of your devotees in this region
who have rebelled against us. (Meaning: ‘You would ask your followers
among the rebels to give up their revolting.’)

I told him: ‘O Amir! If you fulfill the pledge by which I entered this
task – that I may not command, nor install or dismiss anyone – I will
fulfill [your request], too.

This heir apparency did not bring me any blessings; I was in Medina and
my handwriting (command) was influential in the East and West; I would
ride on my steed and pass through the alleys and no one was more
respected there than I was. No one would ask me a favor that I was able
to do, unless I would do it. Ma’mun said, ‘I will fulfill that
pledge.”[^1]
