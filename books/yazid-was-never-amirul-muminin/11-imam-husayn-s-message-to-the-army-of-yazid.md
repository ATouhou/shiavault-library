Imam Husaynâ€™s Message to the Army of Yazid
==========================================

On the day of Ashura facing the army of Yazid, Imam Husayn a.s. said:-

O Men! Verily the Messenger of Allah said: "If someone sees a cruel king
who permits those things which have been forbidden by Allah, who
disregards his duty, who opposes the way of the Messenger of Allah and
acts amongst the servants of Allah sinfully and aggressively, and that
person does not do anything, in action or speech, to change the
situation, then it would be right for Allah to place that person (on the
Day of Judgement) alongside the tyrant ruler."
