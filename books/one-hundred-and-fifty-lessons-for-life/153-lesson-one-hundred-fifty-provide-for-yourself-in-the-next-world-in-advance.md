Lesson One Hundred Fifty: Provide For Yourself In The Next World In Advance
===========================================================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ما تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ خَيْر يَبْقَ لَكَ ذُخْرُهُ وَ ما تُؤَخَّرُهُ يَكُنْ
لِغَيْرِكَ خَيْرُهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Whatsoever you send in advance shall be reserved for you, and whatsoever
you postpone, its benefit would be only for the others (and its
responsibility is your burden).[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Those who amass wealth madly, employing every means , howsoever
illegitimate or unjust, fail to understand that they can neither consume
all this wealth during their lifetime nor can they take it with them
when they die. On the contrary, they will leave it for others to enjoy
while they are left carrying a heavy responsibility and accountability
for it in the divine court. What a loss! What a contrast to those who
acquire only legitimate wealth and send it in advance as provisions for
their next world by spending it in Allah’s way.
