After Mother's Death
====================

A mother's death is an irreparable loss, but the order of Creations
according to the wisdom of God, demands that every living creature
should one day leave this world.

One should remain contented and submit to the will of God and his own
destiny. But there are certain duties that children must perform after
their mother's death if they desire their own happiness.

In other words, the right of parents does not cease with their death,
and this right must be observed by their children after the death of
their parents.

The Fifth Imam says: "An offspring may be benevolent to his parents
during their lifeÂ­ time, but he may not repay his debt to them after
they die, nor pray for their salvation, and forget them altogether. In
such a case, this offspring will be included by God in the category of
those who misbehave towards their parents"[^1]

What can be concluded from these and other Islamic narrations is that if
a father or a mother has incurred a debt, their offspring should make an
effort to repay this debt and pray for their salvation.

He should offer alms in their name, feed a needy person to gladden their
soul, take care of and caress an orphan, and perform similar charitable
acts. The reward of such deeds will be given to the parents as well as
their children and God will bless and favour them for such benevolent
and charitable deeds.[^2]
