Our Master Muhammad [s] was 8 years of age when his grandfather Abdul
Muttalib died. So, his uncle, Abu Talib took care of him.

Abu Talib's name was Abdul Munaf. His mother's name was Fatima bint
Amru. She belonged to the Bani Makhzum tribe. Abu Talib was named Shaikh
al-Bat-ha.

Our Master Muhammad [s] lived with his uncle. His uncle treated him
kindly. Fatima bint Asad, his uncle's wife, treated him kindly, too. She
preferred him to all of her sons. So, our Master Muhammad [s] grew with
a good family.

Abu Talib's love for his nephew increased day by day because of his good
manners and great politeness.

For example, when the food was ready, the orphan boy reached it
politely. He said:

*In the Name of Allah!*

When he finished, he said:

*Thank Allah!*

One day, Abu Talib missed his nephew Muhammad. So, he raised his hand
from the food and said:

*“Till my son comes!”*

When Muhammad came, Abu Talib gave him a cup of yogurt. Muhammad drank
out of the cup. Abu Talib's sons drank out of it one by one, too. They
were all full. The uncle admired that. So, he said to his nephew:

*“Muhammad you're blessed!”*
