Dedication
==========

To the pioneer of wisdom and social justice in the earth,

To the intellectual mind of humanity,

To the guardian of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing be upon
him), his companion and friend Amir ul-Mu’mineen, peace be on him, I
offer, with all pride and faith, this humble effort, one for which I
have had the honor of studying the life of his grandson Imam ‘Ali
al-Hadi (peace be upon him), the renovator of Islam, hoping it will be
accepted to be a provision for me on the day when I shall meet my Lord.
