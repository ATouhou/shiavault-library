The Happy Marriage
==================

Abu Talib had a big family. He spent a lot of his money on the poor. In
time, he too became poor. Our Master Muhammad [s] felt that he had to
help his uncle. So, he decided to take Khadijah's goods to Sham.

The task was successful. Our Master Muhammad [s] gave the trusts to
their owners. This made Khadijah think of him. So, she asked him to
marry her.

Abu Talib was very pleased with that suggestion. So, he, a group of Bani
Hashim, and Hamza bin Abdul Muttalib, our Master Muhammad's uncle, went
to ask for Khadijah's hand from her family. Abu-Talib said:

*“Praise be to Allah who has made us of Ibrahim's and Ismael's sons,
made a protected house and a safe sanctuary for us, and made our country
blessed.”*

Then he added:

*“My nephew Muhammad bin Abdullah is the best and greatest man of all
the Quraish. Besides, he's better than money because money's perishable.
He likes Khadijah and she likes him. By Allah, he'll be of great
importance. Khadijah's dowry is of my money.”*

Muhammad [s] and Khadijah got married.

The years passed. Allah gave Abu Talib a new baby. The baby's name was
Ali.

Our Master Muhammad [s] wanted to relieve his uncle's worries. So, he
went to his uncle's house to take Ali to his house.
