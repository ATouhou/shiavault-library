Um Salama Returns the Consignments to its Owners
================================================

When Imam Hussain (Q) went to Iraq, he had entrusted Um Salam with the
books and the will, then he brought his son, Imam Zein El-Abedeen (Q)
who was sick at that time, and entrusted him with the Great Name and the
Heirs of the Prophets and he informed him that he had given the
knowledge books, the old scripts and the weapon (the weapon of the
Prophet) to Sayyeda Um Salama and he asked her to give it all back to
him when he returns from the battle.

This is another indication of the majesty of Sayyeda Um Salama and her
great status, as she was entrusted by the Messenger of Allah (P) and his
Progeny till the last days of her life. Thus the things she kept were
those that should be with the Hujjatu Allah on earth in all times.

And when Imam Zein El-Abedeen returned to Medina, she gave back the
consignments to him.
