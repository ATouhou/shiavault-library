Dedication
==========

This book is dedicated to the loving memory of its author - the Late
Haji Hussein A. Rahim M.B.E who passed away at London on March 23, 1979
at the age of 78 years.

It was his religious zeal and sincere efforts, despite sickness and
declining age that this work was made possible. His numerous other
articles, translations and commentary works published in the LIGHT
magazine and elsewhere on important religious topics demonstrated his
deep knowledge as well as his unreserved devotion towards religion and
propagation of the valuable teachings of our Holy Prophet and his Ahlul
Bayt AS.

The Late Haji Hussein Rahim can be said to be the architect of Shia
Islamic propagation in East Africa. He first propounded the idea of
propagation of the religion in one of his articles in SALSABIL magazine
during the years 1955/56.

Late, in one of the meetings, he moved an amendment to the constitution
of the Federation of the Khoja Shia Ithnasheri Jamats to include in its
aims and objects the publications propagation and missionary work of the
Shia Faith.

May Almighty Allah reward him for all his invaluable services to the
faith and rest his soul in peace. Amen.
