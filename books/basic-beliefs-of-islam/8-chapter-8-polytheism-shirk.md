Chapter 8 : Polytheism - Shirk
==============================

The antonym of Tawhid is Polytheism. Polytheism or Shirk means to
consider anyone god other than the true God. It is the most heinous and
unforgivable crime. Imam Jafar as-Sadiq (as) has said : Among all sins,
Shirk is the most sinful act. Kinds of Shirk or Polytheism.

There are many kinds of Shirks, but the Holy Prophet (sws) has
classified them into two main categories, which are as follows.

1 - Shirk-e-Akbar. ( Major Shirk - Open and apparent Shirk )
2 - Shirk-e-Asghar. ( Minor Shirk - Concealed or hidden Shirk )

**SHIRK-E-AKBAR OR MAJOR SHIRK. [OPEN SHIRK]**

Major Shirk or Shirk-e-Akbar means explicitly open polytheism.
Definition of Major Shirk.

Major Shirk is of two kinds.


1- To associate anyone with Allah Taala as His part.
2- To associate Allah's attributes to someone as his own.

Associating Allah with someone or something as His par t means, to
believe in more than one God. i.e., two, three, and many separate gods
or two, three, or many inseparable gods. Associating Allah's attributes
to someone or something means, giving His attributes, like His knowledge
or His might, to anyone else. Or considering or por traying anyone like
Him.

He believes in many gods, separate or inseparable.
He associates anyone in anyway with God as a par t of Him.
He portrays anyone in anyway possessing supernatural powers like God.
He portrays or characterizes any Prophet or Imam or a leader as God or
like God or a part of God.

All such people are known as polytheists or mushriks. It is impor tant
to know more about all kinds of Shirk in order to refrain from them
completely.

Idol worship - Believing in many gods. It is the most apparent kind of
Shirk. All religions in which people worship many gods or idols or
anyone other than God or associate God with anyone, are polytheistic
religions. The followers of these religions are Mushriks.

There are many religions which practice idol worship.

Zoroastrians believe in two gods - god of evil (darkness) and god of
goodness (light). Buddhists do not believe in God. But Buddhists worship
the statue of Gautam Buddha as their god. So do the followers of
Jainism. They both are polytheistic religions.

In Hinduism, there are three main gods, and traditionally 33 million
other gods and goddesses. In order to call themselves monotheistic, they
say that behind all these gods, there is also a single spiritual entity
called Brahma.

Christians also believe that God is present in three forms. This is
known as trinity i.e. they believe that in one God there are three
Divine persons - the Father, the Son, and the holy Spirit or holy Ghost.
This means that Christians divide god into three par ts, Father - Son -
Holy Spirit, and unite them together to make one single god. They use
paintings, statues, and other art to depict their sacred figures and
stories from the Bible.

In Eastern Europe and the Near East, worshipers give special reverence
to icons (images of Jesus Christ or the saints).

Christians known as iconoclasts opposed the use of images because they
considered it idolatry. But other Christians argued that such images
(icons) are merely symbols to help worshippers think of God.

A dispute called the iconoclastic controversy raged between the two
sides during the AD 700's and early 800's. The iconoclasts destroyed the
pictures and statues in many churches. A similar disagreement over the
use of images broke out between Protestants and Roman Catholics during
the 1500's in which Protestant destroyed many statues and images which
were being worshipped by the Catholics.

The ancient Greeks and Romans had polytheistic religions. They assumed
sky, stars, sun, planets, moon, and many other things as gods and used
to worship them. They named each day of the week and month by their god
such as Sunday (sun), Monday (moon).

The ancient Egyptian people considered their kings ( Pharaohs ) to be
living gods. In the Shinto religion of Japan, gods are thought to reside
in par ticular trees, rocks and streams.

Before World War 11 ( 1935-1945 ), the Japanese people honored their
emperor as god. On September 2, 1945 Emperor Hirohito who was considered
and worshipped by Japanese as their god, officially surrendered and
announced his defeat. Thousand of Japanese were weeping seeing their god
in such a humiliated condition. On Jan. 1, 1946, Emperor Hirohito
renounced all claims to the divinity (god) that for merly had been
claimed for him. The constitution of 1947, which he approved, changed
him from sovereign to "symbol of the state"

The Gallis or Ghullat (extremists), among Muslims, form another group
of Mushriks. They are also called Mufawwiza. They believe that Allah has
delegated His powers or entr usted all affairs to the Holy Imams.
According to them, the Imams give life and death, and they also give us
sustenance. According to all Shia Ulama, any person who has this belief
or similar views about Imams is a Mushrik.

Islam considers all such religions as polytheistic and believes in the
absolute oneness of God. Quran has rigorously condemned all these
religions and tells that the followers of these religions will be
severely punished.

Thus, all religions, except Islam, are polytheistic religions. Islam is
the only religion which strongly believes in pure monotheism (i.e.,
absolute oneness of God). Associating God with someone. Another kind of
Major Shirk is :

G to associate Allah with someone as par t of Him,
G to consider anyone like Him,
G to give Allah's attributes to anyone else,
G to include anyone in the worship of Allah.
Imam Jafer Sadiq (as) has said;

"If someone performs an action for Allah, and includes in it the
pleasure of a human being, then the doer of that action is a
Polytheist".

All Shia Ulama agree, as stated by an eminent Shia scholar of Iran,
Sultan'l-Wa'izin Shirazi, who is well-known for his monumental book, The
Right Path, also published in English with a title, Peshawar Nights,
that offering in the name of other than Allah, or to include anyone in
the offerings being made in the name of Allah, is not allowed in
Mazhab -e- Ahlal- Bayit. He further writes in the same book at page
number 40 that;

"If we make an offering not in the name of Allah, but for someone else,
whether he be dead or alive, or if we include him with the name of
Allah, even if he is an Imam or his son, the offering is not valid If
this is done knowingly then it is evident polytheism as is clear from
the verse "and not join anyone in the service of your Lord" (18:110) He
further adds,

"All Shia Jurists agree that to make an offering in the name of any
person, including Prophets or Imams, is wrong. If it is done
intentionally, it is polytheism. An offering must be made in the name of
Allah. Although, we are allowed to do it wherever and whenever we like.
For instance, if someone takes a goat to a particular place of worship
or to the tomb of an Imam and sacrifices it in the name of Allah alone,
there is no harm in it. But if pledges to make an offering in the name
of the Prophet or an Imam, or some other person, it is forbidden."

Portraying anyone like God.

The third kind of Shirk is to por tray anyone as God. This type of
Shrik is the outgrowth of inferiority complex and scantiness. Many grand
personalities, powerful kings, and great saints were worshipped as gods
by their people.

Krishna, popularly known as Lord Krishna, Ram Chanderji, Gautam Buddha,
Firaun, Namr ud, were all human beings. But people worshipped them
because they were highly impressed by their character, or wealth, or
power.

Nusairi call Hazrat Ali(as) their god because of his extraordinary
personality. Apparently it seems that they have raised the status of
Hazrat Ali (as) by calling him god. Some ignorant Shia poets also, under
this false impression, refer Hazrat Ali ibn-Abi Talib (as) as the god of
Nussairi in their poetry. But in actuality, they commit a big sin of
degrading the Holy Imam and putting his sacred name in the list of gods
( people of much lower rank )mentioned above. Thus, whenever we find any
great personality and his incredible achievements, we must appreciate
him, but we must glorify Allah, as He is the one who gave him power,
talent, energy, opportunity, and finally success.

Portraying Prophets or Imams as gods.

All Muslim scholars, Shia and Sunni, without any difference of opinion,
consider it a major Shirk [Shirk-e -Akber].

A Muslim becomes Mushrik if he por trays any of the Prophet or Imam in
any way or in any form as God or like God or part of God. In the
articles of Islamic acts, Ayatullah al-Uzma As-Sayyid Abul Qasim al -
Khui, (and all other marja as well) describes Ghulat as a kind of Shirk
and Kufr, and writes;

"Those who believe one of the holy twelve Imams to be God or say that
God has penetrated into him are Kafirs."(ar ticle 107)

Imams have cursed those people who give them Divine attributes and call
them in a way as some body is calling God.

During the time of Hazrat Imam Jafer Sadiq (as), some one attributed
some false hadith to his father, Hazrat Imam Muhammad Baqir (as), in
which various aspects of divinity were attached to the Imams, notably
Amir ul- Muminine Hazrat Ali(as). The people who were spreading these
fabricated ahadith were the followers of Mughir bin Said and those of
Abi Khattab Muhammad bin al-Assadi.

When Imam Jafar Sadiq (as) heard about this, he said; "May Allah curse
Mughira bin Said as he used to tell lies against my father, May Allah
make him taste the heat of burning iron, May Allah curse those who say
about us what we do not say ourselves, May Allah curse those who try to
make us away from the servitude of Allah, Who created us, and to Him is
our return and in His hand is our control". Rijal al-Kishi. Precisely,
according to the teaching of the Holy Prophet (sws) and his Ahlal Bayit
(as), if anyone knowingly or ignorantly commits any of the following
act, then he has committed a major Shirk.

To consider any Prophet, or Imam, or a leader as an Independent
Power.
To portray the Prophet, or any Imam as god or like a God.
To give the Prophet, Imam, or anyone, attributes of Allah or Divine
titles which make them to look like a God.
To associate anyone of them with God in His Power of Execution.

All of the above mentioned acts are just the same but different kinds
of major Shirk. Muslims must abstain from all such acts with full
determination as the Shirk is an un-forgivable crime. The Holy Prophet
of Islam and his Ahlal-bayit have taught us to believe that Allah has
created everything when nothing existed. Thus, creating, giving
sustenance, granting bounties, death, life, health, wealth, sickness,
all in all are under His control.

Amirul Mu'mineen Ali ibn Abi Talib(as) wrote a lengthy letter to his
son Imam Hassan(as) advising him to ask Allah alone in all desperate
situations. Imam Ali (as) writes:

" .... In all your affairs resign yourself to your Allah, because you
will thus be resigning yourself to a secure shelter and a strong
protector. You should ask (dua) only from your Lord because in His hand
is all the giving and depriving. Seek good (from Allah) as much as you
can...." Letter no 31 Nahjul Balagha.

Muslims should take extreme caution while praising the Prophets and
Imams. The magnitude of their greatness is certainly unimaginable and
their status is beyond our praise, but they all were human beings and we
mustn't depict them as God or like a God or give Allah's attributes to
any one of them.

Quran reflects:

"They (Christians) have taken their rabbis and monks as Lords besides
Allah, and also al- Masih, son of Maryam, though they were ordered to
serve one God only. There is no god but He, Exalted be He above those
whom they associate with Him." (9:31) The teaching of monotheism is that
their is no god but Allah, Who has no par tner. There is none like Him.
It is basically impossible that there could be anyone like Him. If
anyone is like Him then it means that there are two gods which is
impossible.

Divine Warnings to Mushriks.

Quran has explicitly warned all the inhabitants of the planet ear th
that all kinds of Mushrikeens (polytheists) will straight go to the
Hell-Fire and will remain there for ever. Allah has made His Paradise
haram for them.

"Allah has forbidden to him (mushrik) the paradise, and his abode is
the fire." (5:72) Quran has also made it very clear that The Most
Merciful Allah may forgive our other sins but will definitely not
forgive the sin of Shirk.

"Surely Allah does not forgive those who associate other gods with Him,
and forgives what is besides that to whomsoever He pleases; and whoever
associates other gods with Allah, is guilty of a heinous sin". (4:48)

Quran also informs that all prophets and wise men have condemned Shirk
and have advised their followers not to commit this heinous crime. "And
Luqman said to his son when admonishing him: My son, associate none with
Allah, for to associate others with Him is a tremendous wrong." (31:13)
Quran has announced that Mushriks have been driven out from the human
community.

Islam considers the Mushrik, the outcast of the human race. They are
officially not allowed to enter the sacred places like Makkah, Madinah
and all mosques. There are special security posts at all entry points of
Makkah and Madinah for screening.

"O Believers : Know that that the idolaters (Mushriks) are unclean. Let
them not approach the sacred mosque".....(9:28) Muslims are not allowed
to marry Mushrik man or woman.

"Do not marry Mushrik women until they become Muslims. A Muslim slave
woman is better than a Mushrik woman even though she allures you. Nor
marry (your girls) to Mushriks until they become Muslims. A Muslim slave
is better than a Mushrik, even though he allures you. Mushriks invite
you to the Hellfire. But Allah invites you by His grace to the gardens
of (BLISS) and forgiveness." (2:221)
Islam considers Mushrik, the most discarded persons.

"The adulterer should marry only an adulteress or a Mushrik and the
adulteress should marry only an adulterer or a Mushrik. Muslims are not
allowed to marry such persons." (24:3) Quran admonishes Muslims not to
socialize with Mushriks and follow their lifestyle. However, Islam
allows to have business relationships with extreme caution.

"If you were to obey them, you shall indeed become polytheist
(Mushrik)". (6:121)

The reason Quran discourages mingling with Mushriks is, because they
have been infected by Satan and will transmit the satanic germs to all
those who will freely join them. "(Satan has) no authority over those
who believe and put their trust in their Lord. He (Satan) only has power
over those who befriend him, and those who serve other gods besides
Allah (i.e., Mushriks)". (16:99-100) Three Staunch Enemies of Shirk
[Polytheism].

All the 124,000 Prophets, their successors, associates and the true
followers effectively preached Tawhid [Pure Monotheism] and exhaustively
fought Shirk [Polytheism], but THREE out of them will be remembered as
the Heroes and Men of admirable exploits in the histor y of mankind.

The three Champions are :

1- Hazrat Ibrahim (as).
2- Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa (sws)
3- Hazrat Ali (as).

Hazrat Ibrahim (as) embarked a historic war against the Shirk and
idolatry. He alone destroyed all the idols which were being worshipped
by his whole nation. Quran has quoted many of his beautiful scientific
speeches which he gave to his nation denouncing the Shirk and
idol-worship.

Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa (sws) waged a grand and heroic war against all
kinds of polytheism and taught pure and absolute monotheism, "There is
no god but Allah, Who has no partner ".

Thousands of people rejected Shirk and accepted his message of Tawhid
in his life time, and billions of people, since then, have followed his
teaching of pure monotheism. He is the Hero of the Heroes.

Hazrat Ali(as) destroyed all the 360 idols which were placed in the
Kaaba. He made the historic announcement that no Mushrik is allowed to
enter in the vicinity of sacred Kaaba. The Divine Order of Exclusion,
declared by him, are enforced till today and will remain valid until the
entire human race rejects polytheism and becomes Muslim.

One of the titles of Hazrat Ali (as) is Killer of Mushrikeens

**MINOR SHIRK OR SHIRK-E-ASGHAR. [CONCEALED SHIRK]**

The Holy Prophet and the 12 Imams have tightly sealed the Islamic faith
to leave no way for penetration of shirk. Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881), a
Scottish essayist, historian and great philosopher, writes in his famous
book, 'On Heroes and hero-worship', that Prophet Muhammad (sws) has
dismantled all man-made gods when he acquired the highest position and
claimed that he is a human being.

The Holy Prophet made extensive effor ts that Muslims should never
commit Shirk like the nations of the previous prophets. But despite his
great effor ts of crushing Shirk, he expressed his fear that his Ummah
will commit Shirk-e-Asghar. He, therefor, specifically cautioned about
the Shirk-e-Asghar. The Holy Prophet (sws) said;

"Abstain from minor Polytheism. The worst thing which I fear for you is
your hidden polytheism; so rise above it since among my followers
polytheism is more secret than the creeping of the ant on a hard stone
in the dark night."

**What is Shirk-e-Asghar ?**

Shirk-e-Asghar means hidden Shirk. A person commits Shirk-e-Asghar,
when he says in words that there is no god except Allah, but his
thoughts and action doesn't reflect his belief. The most apparent
example of Shirk-e- Asghar, as mentioned by the Holy Prophet (sws), is
Al-Riya (show-off). Riya means to do any work with the intention of the
Ibadat (i.e., to please Allah) but in actuality to show the people or to
please and gratify anyone else.

The Holy Prophet (sws) said;

"One who offers the ritual prayers in an ostentatious way is a
polytheist. One who keeps the fast, or gives alms, or performs the Hajj
to show the public his righteousness or to earn good name is a
polytheist."

**The Holy Quran warns**

"Whoever hopes to meet his Lord, he should do good deeds, and not join
anyone in the service of his Lord". (18:110) This verse shows that the
fundamental ar ticle of faith is that man should do obedience and
worship Him alone, and not include anyone in worship, or associate
anyone else with God. In other words, if a person offers prayers or
performs hajj or does any good act merely to show the public, then it is
Shirk. If anyone intends to pray to a created being, he is a polytheist.
Other examples of Shirk-e-Asghar are:

1- Lack of trust in Allah.
2- To depend on material resources.
3- To consider anyone other than Allah as his sole helper or savior.
4- To rely on secondary causes that completely divert the attention
from Allah (s.w.t).

In fact, all the above kinds of Shirk are interrelated and have emerged
due to the weak Imaan and poor knowledge. A person who has no strong
faith in Allah, will always build his hopes and fears on secondary
causes. He thinks that power lies intrinsically in secondary causes.
This is also a kind of polytheism.

Secondary causes means, the apparent source. For instance, the sun,
air, water and plants are the basic source of life. Without them, living
beings can not survive. It is a truth, which no one can deny. But if one
considers them the first cause or the original source of life, then this
is polytheism.

But if we believe that the power of the Sun and beneficial proper ties
of air, water and plants are by the Power of Allah (swt), and that they
are simply the means of life fixed by Him to enjoy His benevolence, then
this is not polytheism. It is rather a form of worship. To pay attention
to the signs of Allah (swt) is a prelude to attending to Allah (swt). A
reference has been made in the verses of the Holy Quran to the fact that
we should ponder in the creations of Allah (swt) to build up our faith
in Him.

Imam Jafar-e-Sadiq (as) has beautifully explained, how to avoid this
kind of Shirk. He said, if anyone saves your life and you feel obliged
to thank him immensely (which is also necessary) then don't say that, it
is you who have saved my life. Instead of this, Imam said, you should
say, I am indeed grateful to Allah that he saved my life through you, I
pray Allah to give you full reward of your service.

This means that we must thank the person who makes himself available to
offer help, but we must realize in the bottom of our hear t that the
real source of help is Allah Subhanahu Taala, who made him available and
capable to help me.

This is applied to all kinds of help and favors whether small or big.
Thus, whenever, we seek help from anyone, be he a Prophet or Imams, we
must bear this fact in mind that the help will come from Allah and that
the entire matter depends on Allah's will. In other case, if we ask help
from anyone, even the Prophet or Imam, which diver ts our attention from
Allah (swt), then cer tainly it is a Shirk which has been strictly
forbidden by The Holy Prophet (sws) and Imams.

All Shia ulamaa and scholars believe that if anyone considers the
Prophet or Imam as being Allah or partners in His-self, or ignorantly
portrays them like Allah, he is surely a Mushrik. Whenever we call our
Imams for help, as they are alive by the grace of All-Mighty Allah, we
consider them precisely the means of approaching Allah Taala. We seek
the help of Allah Taala through them as they are the chosen ones. We
never ask dua from them, but we ask dua from Allah through them. It is
just like as we approach a doctor for some medical assistance, knowing
that he has good knowledge and experience, but we never consider him God
or like God, who can save us by his own power. However, if anyone does
so, then he is a Mushrik, whether he does it knowingly or unknowingly.

It is very important to read the duas of our Imams who have educated us
that we should always ask help from Allah and how to seek help from
others without committing Shirk.

Amirul Mu'mineen Hazrat Ali(as) says in his sermon no - 225 in Nahjul
Balagha; "O Lord! You are the best Companion of those who love you; and
the best source of remedy for all who place reliance on you .... and if
hardship and difficulty assail them, You alone are their refuge."

**What is Shirk and What is not Shirk ?**

Some Muslims accuse Shias of committing Shirk, and call them Mushrik.
They charge Shias on the grounds that they portray Imams as god. Of
course if anyone does so then he is definitely a Mushrik. But this is
definitely not true that Shia madhab portrays Imams as gods. They do a
basic mistake in analyzing the Shia mazhab. They have formed their
opinion about Shia mazhab from their observation of some Shia practices
and not from the authentic books which truly describe basic faith of
Shia madhab.

If one wishes to determine the faith of a community, he should not rely
on uninformed people of that community or unconfirmed reports or
unreliable books.

For example, a vast majority of Muslims in the world are uneducated,
and many educated Muslims are not practicing Muslims. An ignorant
non-Muslim can form a wrong opinion about Islam from this surface
observation. He can wrongly conclude that Islam does not give importance
to education. But the truth is just opposite. Islam considers education
as the basic requirement of being a Muslim, but Muslims have not
fulfilled this prerequisite condition, and it is their unforgivable sin,
for which Islam can never be blamed.

Similarly, if Sunnis wish to know about Shi'ism, they should not end up
their research on their surface observation. Sunnis must know that if
they see any ignorant Shia doing something against the basic teachings
of Quran, then it can not be the teaching of Shia mazhab or learned
Ulema. The Shia mazhab can not be blamed for someone's performance who
just claims that he is Shia. Also Sunnis should not just believe what
they hear from unreliable people about Shia mazhab. The Quran clearly
warns on this issue:

"O you who believe! if an evil-doer comes to you with a report, look
carefully into it, lest you harm a person in ignorance, then feel sorry
for what you have done." (49:6) Now let us analyze the allegation which
says that Shias por tray Imams as gods. Can any normal person get
confused if someone por trays Imams as gods, when Imams have made
themselves an open book which everyone can read without any problem.

All our Imams have left for us a treasure of sermons, Duas, and hadiths
which are more than enough to guide us and to keep us on the straight
path. Only those can go astray who deliberately ignore the teachings of
the Imams and do exactly what Imam has advised not to do.

No one can show any hadith or statement of Imam which says that Imams
have advised their followers to ask dua's from them in a manner as one
asks dua from God, or to praise them as one glorifies God.

Imams knew their noble position and status and for this reason they
left a large number of duas so that no body should confuse the Imams
with God due to their greatness. Here are some of the Duas of Imams
which clearly show that Imams have left no room for the penetration of
Shirk.

**Munajat of Imam Ali (as)**

All Shia and Sunni must read this dua of Hazrat Ali (as) in which Imam
Ali(as) has made it very clear that, it is Allah alone and none other
then Him, Who deserves to be worshipped, and all including the Prophets
and the Imams approach Him for anything and ever ything, they need in
this world and hereafter.

Translation of the Munajat of Imam Ali(as)

1- O Allah, I am asking for your protection against the day when
nothing like wealth or children will be of use and only that person will
benefit who will come with a pure hear t.

2- And I am asking for your protection against the day when a wrongdoer
will be biting the back of his hand in regret and will be saying, 'Oh, I
wish I had chosen the way shown by the Prophet of Allah.

3- And I am asking for your protection against the day when sinners
will be known by their faces, and will be taken by their hair and
feet.

4- And I am asking for your protection against the Day when a father
will not ser ve instead of his son nor will a son be punished instead of
his father for anything, since Allah has promised thus and His promise
is true.

5- And I am asking for your protection against the Day when apologizing
of the wrongdoers will not do them any good and because of that they
will be cursed and will be put in the evil abode (of Jahannum)

6- And I am asking You for your protection against the day when nobody
will have control over anybody and the power will belong to Allah
(alone) that day.

After reading these duas of Ameer ul mumineen Hazrat Ali (as), no one
but a mad man can call him god. Imam, who is the greatest and the most
perfect man, has shown the depth of his humbleness and submission to
Allah Subhanahu taala. He has beautifully demonstrated the truth that
his greatness lies in his servitude to Allah.

All Muslims without any difference of opinion consider Shirk a major
sin. But there is a serious controversy among the Muslims over the issue
of identifying the Shirk. There are many things which some Muslims
consider Shirk while they are not Shirk. It is a pity that Muslims do
not settle their differences rationally and honestly in the light of the
Holy Quran. Let's discuss some of these controversies and misconceptions
about Shirk which have caused a serious tension among the Muslims.

**Is touching and kissing of the sacred objects a Shirk ?**

Is it Shirk to touch and kiss the iron bars and walls of the shrine of
the Holy Prophet(sws), or the doors and walls of the shrines of Holy
Imams, and the Taboot, Alum, and Tazia, of Imam Hussain ? Some Muslims
consider the above acts as Shirk and do not allow the Muslims to do that
in places which are under their control. Other Muslims consider such
acts as an expression of deep love, respect and commitment.

Let us analyze it rationally in the light of the Holy Quran.
There are certain specific acts such as Sijda, Ruku, and Dua, which we
solely do in front of Allah, to show our total submission to Him, and to
seek all kinds of help from Him. Of course, all such acts have been
strictly prohibited by the Holy Prophet (sws) and Holy Imams (as) to do
for anyone other than Allah.

But touching and kissing are the common ways of showing love and
affection for a thing or a person. We kiss and touch the Holy Quran and
Hajar al Aswad. We kiss the hands of our parents. We kiss our children
and others we love. No one says that it is a Shirk. Then, why is kissing
and touching of the sacred objects being interpreted as Shirk? In fact,
kissing and touching are the actions which are exclusively for the
humans or material things and definitely not for Allah as He has no
body, and He is not confined to any particular place.

Thus, kissing and touching the sacred material objects with emotional
feelings is not Shirk. We very greatly love The Holy Prophet (sws) and
the Holy Imams (as) but find no way to express our feelings, as they are
not physically present among us. Hence, we kiss and touch with warm
feelings of reverence to anything linked to them.

Thus, kissing of or touching Alam, Taboot, Tazia, and walls and doors
of the mausoleum and Holy shrines of the Prophet and his Ahlal-bayait
(as), is an expression of love and respect and definitely not shirk.

However, if anyone does not express his love for Imams in tradiditional
manner as many Shias do, there is nothing wrong in it. The most impor
tant thing is the true love with commitment of following the footsteps
of the Holy Prophet (sws) and the Holy Imams(as) and the real
understanding that they are the staunch suppor ters of Tawhid and the
mighty enemies of the Shirk.

**Is visiting the Graves of Imams a Shirk ?**

Some Sunni Muslim brothers unknowingly charge Shias of committing Shirk
when they visit the graves (Roza-e-Muqaddas) of the Holy Imams. The word
Ziarat-e-Rauzai-Muqaddus of Imams, itself significantly shows that this
par ticular act can not be a Shirk as the Rauza belongs to a person who
is buried there. Ever yone knows that a person who is buried, can never
be a God but definitely a human being. Allah is free from birth and
death and anything concerning birth and death solely belongs to a
creature and not the creator.

Thus, Ziarat or visits to the graves of Imams is a strong proof in
itself that we do not consider Imams as gods or a part of God.

Apart from this, if Sunni brothers sincerely and honestly read the
whole procedure of Ziarat, they will not find any trace of Shirk but
will witness the declaration and affirmation of Tawhid at each and every
step of the Ziarat.

The prescribed instructions for a person doing Ziarat are as follows;

G When the pilgrim reaches the ditch of Kufa, he stands there and
recites the following: Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, the
possessor of Greatness, Sublimity, and Eminence. Allah is most great,
the possessor of Greatness, Holiness, Glory and Grace. Allah is Most
Great above that which I fear. Allah is Most Great. He is my suppor t,
on Him do I rely and in Him lies my hopes, and toward Him I return.

When the pilgrim reaches the Gate of Najaf, he should recites:

Praise be to Allah, Who guided us to this. We would not have been
guided if Allah had not guided us.

When the pilgrim reaches the Gate of the sacred Courtyard, he should
recite, after praising Allah: I bear witness that there is no god except
Allah, the One. He has no par tner. I also bear witness that Muhammad is
His Servant and His Prophet. He brought us truth from Allah. I also bear
witness that Ali is a servant of Allah and brother of the Prophet of
Allah.

Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great. There is
no god except Allah, and Allah is Most Great. All praise is due to Him
for His Guidance and His suppor t to respond to what He has revealed on
the way to Him.

When the pilgrim reaches the gate of the mausoleum, he should recite:

I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, the One. He has no par
tner with Him....... When, after having asked permission of Allah, the
Prophet, and the Imams, the pilgrim reaches the inside of the mausoleum,
recites various Ziarats which contain salutations to the Holy Prophet
and the Commander of the Faithful. After Ziarat, he offers six rak'ats
of ritual prayers, two rak'at for the Commander of the Faithful and two
rak'ats each for the Prophets Adam and Nooh, who are buried in the same
precincts.

People must know that this salat is like another salat in which each
and every action is solely for Allah Taala. This salat also is a mere
confirmation that we believe in none other than Allah as the creator of
the universe and everything and everyone.

This is the whole description of the visits of the sacred places which
Shias perform solely for the pleasure of Allah Taala. Is there any
element of Shirk in the whole performance of this great ibadat? Every
honest Muslim will acknowledge that it is a pure Ibadat of Allah as from
the time a pilgrim sets his foot on the soil of Najaf until after he
offers his Namaz-e-Ziarat, he is constantly busy in the remembrance of
Allah.

How to prove the oneness of God at school level. If there are two gods,
then there should be two different types of major systems gover ning the
mechanism of creation in the universe.

If there are three gods then there should be three different kinds of
systems. And if there are many gods then we should find plenty of
systems. But scientists have confirmed that they have seen only one
system throughout the universe. Let us analyze the working mechanism of
the creation.

Atom is the smallest indivisible and invisible par ticle of matter. It
is a unit of matter. Scientists took 400 years just to know the secrets
locked inside the atom. Still a lot of secrets are not yet disclosed and
scientists are trying day and night to know them. Every atom in the
universe is a complete sign of Divine creation. They all have a great
organization, beauty and purpose in them.

Now we know that everything is made up of atoms. All objects consist of
atoms. The billions of things we see around, natural or man-made, living
or non-living, visible or invisible are made up of atoms. They differ
widely from one another only because they are made up of different kinds
of atoms or they have different arrangements of atoms.

Scientists have arranged the known atoms (elements) in the periodic
table according to their atomic numbers. The atomic number is the number
of protons in the nucleus of the atom. It is a religious belief of all
the scientists, that all atoms, which constitute billions of different
kinds of natural and synthetic compounds, have the same basic structure.
i.e., all atoms have one thing in common - they all have electrons
(negatively charged par ticles) that whirl around the nucleus and
protons (positively charged par ticles) and neutrons in the nucleus
(core of the atom). They all follow the same rule of chemical
combination to form billions of different kinds of substances.

Thus, when all atoms in the universe which are the basic raw material
of ever ything that exist in the universe, have only one kind of
machinery i.e., common working mechanism, it convincingly proves that
they all have one and only one origin of creation. This scientific
observation which is not disputed by any atheist scientist is a clear
proof of oneness of God.

Thus Tawhid is a scientific belief of all scientists, when they are in
their experimental labs, be they Christians in their Churches, Jews in
their Synagogues, Hindus in their temples and atheists or polytheist in
their imagination.

Quran also gives a very strong proof that why there should be only one
God.

"Had there been other gods in heavens or earth besides Allah, there
would have been confusion in both". (21:22)

Thus, a beautiful harmony in Nature and a perfect orderliness in the
universe acknowledged by all scientists of the world is a strong proof
of absolute oneness of God. "Say: I only call upon my Lord, and I do not
associate anyone with Him". (72:20)
