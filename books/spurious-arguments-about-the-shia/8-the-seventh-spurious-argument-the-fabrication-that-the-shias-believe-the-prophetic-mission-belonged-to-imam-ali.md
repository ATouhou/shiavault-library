The Seventh Spurious Argument: The Fabrication that the Shias believe the prophetic mission belonged to Imam Ali
================================================================================================================

There is a widespread spurious argument that the Shias believe
that -Allah forbid- the prophecy had been intended for Imam Ali, and the
Archangel Gabriel (a) had given it to the Prophet Muhammad (s) by
mistake! They also fabricate a lie that the Shias say after their daily
prayers, The loyal (Gabriel) had betrayed, (khanal ameen)‚Äù three times
raising their hands in disapproval.

The Answer
----------

This is a great slander against the Shias and an insult to the Keeper of
Divine Revelation, Allah the Most High. It was a fabrication attributed
to the Shia for it is not possible for a Muslim to say such a thing.
Perhaps it had appeared among some of the extremists in religion whom
the Shia have ruled to be unbelievers.

The truth of the matter is that the Shia say Allahu Akbar (Allah is
greater) three times after their prayers raising their hands when they
say it. This is established in their books. They believe that the best
recital after prayers is to say Allahu Akbar three times then to recite
what Fatima (a) recited after her prayers, which is to glorify Allah one
hundred times; saying Allahu Akbar thirty four times, Subhan Allah
(Glory be to Allah) thirty-three times and saying al Hamdu lillah
(Praise be to Allah) thirty-three times.
