These Prophecies were first published as a section of the book,
*Prophethood*, in 1970, by Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania,
Dar-es-Salaam. Since then it was reprinted several times in
Dar-es-Salaam and Mombasa.

Then The World Islamic Network (WIN) of Bombay, published this section
as an independent booklet, under the title, *Prophecies About The Holy
Prophet Of Islam In* *Hindu, Christian & Jewish Scripture.*

Now the Bilal Muslim Mission wants to reprint it, and I have thoroughly
revised the material for this edition, and added the prophecies from the
Parsi scriptures.

I hope it will be even more popular than before.
