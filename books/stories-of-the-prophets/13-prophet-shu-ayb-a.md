Prophet Shu'ayb (a)
===================

The Prophet Shu'ayb

was a descendent

of the Prophet Ibrahim.

He was sent to Midian and the

Dwellers of the wood to give

them Allah's message.

The Midianite people

committed many sins.

They gave short measures

and weights,

they robbed people and

caused mischief but most

seriously they tried to stop

people from

worshipping Allah.

Shu'ayb tried to make

them change but they

would not listen to him.

They wanted to throw

him out and all the

people who had

listened to his words.

Then Allah sent an

earthquake and all

the evil people were

destroyed because they

would not obey the

word of Allah.
