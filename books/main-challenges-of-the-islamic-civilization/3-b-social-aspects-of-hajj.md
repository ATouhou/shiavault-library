B) Social Aspects of Hajj
=========================

**Hajj, the Manifestation of Unity of Islamic Ummah**

In the opinions of Imam Khomeini and Ayatollah Khamenei, Hajj is a
manifestation of consolidation of Islamic unity and an expression of
integrity of the Islamic ummah. Commenting on the issue, Imam Khomeini
states:

"One of the most important pillars of the philosophy of Hajj is
creation of understanding and consolidation of fraternity among the
Muslims." 36

Elsewhere, the Imam states: "We should bear in mind that one of the
significant reasons for gathering of [all Muslims] from across the world
in the this sacred place is solidarity of the Muslims of the world,
consolidation of unity among the followers of the holy Prophet of Islam
and the holy Quran against the illegitimate rulers of the world." 37

Commenting on the same issue, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution,
Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei says:

"Hajj is the manifestation of unity and solidarity of the Muslims. Now
the Almighty God calls all the Muslims and those who are able [to
travel] to this particular point, at a particular time and assembles
them besides each other during certain nights and days to participate in
certain rites and practices which are the manifestation of coexistence,
discipline and coordination. Its first manifest impact is injection of
the feeling of unity and congregation in each of them and demonstration
of the glory and splendor of the congregation of Muslims to them as well
as nourishing their mind with the feeling of grandeur." 38

**Hajj, a Platform for Solving the Problems of the Muslims**

Imam Khomeini and Ayatollah Khamenei consider Hajj occasion as an
opportunity for proximity among the world Muslims as well as an occasion
for discussing the problems and shortcomings of various Islamic
societies and an occasion for reaching a consensus to solve these
problems. Imam Khomeini states:

"Now that it is the occasion of House of God and the Muslims from
across the world have gone on pilgrimage to the House of God, it is
necessary that during the performance of Hajj ceremonies they pay
attention to one of the greatest reasons for this great assembly, that
is, paying attention to the sociopolitical conditions of the Islamic
countries and becoming aware of the problems of their brother-in-faith
and try to solve them in accordance to their Islamic, humane duties.
Paying attention to the affairs of the Muslims is among the important
obligations." 39

**C) Political Dimension of Hajj

Propagation and Awakening**

The founder of the Islamic Republic, Imam Khomeini, who was the
political, cultural leader of the Islamic society, considered the Hajj
occasion as an appropriate time for enhancing the awareness of the
Muslims and awakening of the Islamic ummah. In this regard, he laid
emphasis on the role of the ulema, thinkers and writers of the Islamic
world:

"O speakers and writers, during the great congregations in Arafat, holy
Mecca, etc. describe the social and political problems of your regions
for your brothers-in-faith and seek each otherâ€™s assistance. O pilgrims
of the House of God, explain the plots of the plundering, aggressive US
and criminal Israel for the world people and realize the crimes of these
criminals and beseech God for the improvement of the condition of
Muslims and severance of the hands of the criminals." 40

Addressing all the Muslims, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, lays
emphasis on spreading information and enhancing awareness about the
international issues during the Hajj ceremonies: "During great
congregations, particularly that of Hajj, the Muslims must discuss the
problems of the world of Islam."

Imam Khomeini also underlines the political aspect of Hajj, "One of the
great philosophies of Hajj is its political dimension." 41

Elsewhere, the Imam says: "political dimension of Hajj is very
significant." 42

Ayatollah Khamenei too lays emphasis on the political dimension of
Hajj: "Anybody who tries to segregate the political identity of Hajj
from these ceremonies is either ignorant or biased; God will not forgive
those who are prepared to achieve their own impure, trifle objectives by
depriving the Islamic Ummah of their greatest weapon against the global
infidelity and arrogance." 43


**Chapter 2 : Arrogance: Greatest Challenge of the Islamic World**

**Introduction**

The political history of Islam is replete with incessant struggles of
veracious followers of Islam and true believers against the tyrannical
rulers, power-wielders, infidels, and all manifestations of illegitimate
rule and arrogance.

The struggles and holy wars of the holy Prophet (PBUH) and his
companions against the symbols of infidelity and polytheism, ignorance,
reactionary forces, oppressors, and power-wielders, on the one hand and
all-out protection of the sanctities of the liberating religion of
Islam, rights of the disinherited and downtrodden of the society, as
well as righteous struggles of the Imams and great leaders of Islam and
the sufferings they endured in this way, on the other, are the strongest
evidence in this regard. In fact the history of Islam is full of
struggles, campaigns, self-sacrifices and martyrdoms.

In contemporary political history of Islam, intolerable struggles,
continuous campaigns to enhance the awareness of the Muslims, and
sagacious leadership of a descendent of the righteous people led to the
revival of genuine ideas of Islam (genuine Mohammedan Islam), revival of
Islamic life, and reverberation of the voice of Islamic unity in the
world of Islam.

Relying on the religious teachings and the power of faith of the Muslim
ummah, the founder of the Islamic Republic launched a struggle against
all manifestations of ignorance, tyranny and arrogance and tried to
purify Islam from the dust coated on the religious concepts and rites by
the joint effort of the enemies of religion and the ossified figures who
had transacted religion with the worldly gains. The Imam tried to
represent religion to the seekers of truth and justice as the Prophet
(PBUH) of Islam had depicted it.

The efforts and struggles and resistance of Imam against various plots
of the camp of arrogance finally led to the victory of the Islamic
Revolution of Iran and establishment of a religious government in the
Iranian society. The Iranian revolution was undoubtedly unique with
regard to its popularity and its impact on the ideas and outlook of the
peoples of the world as well as from the viewpoint of its impact on the
political literature and equations of the world.

The victory of the Islamic revolution and the establishment of the
religious government which was naturally in contradiction and
confrontation with the interests and avarice of the global arrogance was
the beginning of a new round of struggles and confrontations with the
plots, aggressions, colonialism and exploitation of the camp of
arrogance. The global arrogance and the sworn enemies of the Islamic
system found it a threat to their illegitimate interests and considered
their survival subject to the destruction of the religious government.
Hence they did not spare any effort to overthrow the popular, sacred
Islamic government and do not spare any effort now.

Their efforts encompassed a range of activities including military
invasion, full-fledge war, economic sanctions, and terrorist acts. But
the honorable resistance of the Islamic government " with the least
available equipments and with reliance on the weapon of faith " against
all the plots hatched by the camp of arrogance, not only led to the
victory of the Islamic system, but also could demonstrate the grandeur
and magnificence of Islam and the capabilities of the Islamic culture
and religious political thought particularly for the disinherited and
downtrodden.

Today, the righteous successor of Imam Khomeini " Ayatollah Seyed Ali
Khamenei " is at the held of the leadership of the Islamic system.
Through his sagacious leadership he is strongly leading the society
against the plots and mischief of the arrogant powers. Through his
leadership the Islamic Republic is performing its mission of protection
of the rights of the oppressed, spread and export of the Islamic
revolution, and rejection of inequity, ignorance and arrogance.

Commenting on the plots of the global arrogance against Islam
particularly the Islamic government, Ayatollah Khamenei states:

"Today one of the main issues of the Islamic world is the frantic,
vengeful animosity of satanic front, particularly the Great Satan,
against Islam and Islamic concepts and beliefs. Although the planned,
all-out animosity against Islam has its roots in the early years of
emergence of colonialism, and colonialists during the recent decades
have the turned the Islamic countries into an arena for their plunder,
robbing, massacre, and aggression, they considered Islam a hurdle and a
strong bastion against their plots and hence launched their political,

cultural attacks against it. They implemented some plans to separate
the Muslims from Islam and Quran and through their diabolic tricks,
including spread of moral corruption, promiscuity, and licentiousness,
they try to achieve their goals, but ever since the volcano of the
Islamic Revolution dashed their hopes to the ground, raised hopes in the
hearts of the Muslims, and heralded the revival of Islam in the world,

the arrogant powers launched an all-out, hurried, frantic attack
against Islam and of course it was not far from expectation that the
divine traditions would be definitely realized, leading to their defeat
and fiasco." 44

**Palestine, Main Challenge of Islamic World**

"The most clear image one may depict of the Zionist regime is a
combination of savageries, atrocities, racism, apartheid and unbridled
political aggressions under the pretext of legal defense and struggle
for existence. Invasion and occupation of an Islamic territory, the
savageries of the occupiers by resort to the most sophisticated weapons
and instruments and clever resort to widespread false propaganda to
project themselves innocent and distort the facts, as well as the
oppression of the Muslims of the occupied territories, their depravation
of the least defensive facilities and amenities of life would indeed
injure the feelings of every Muslim." 45

Without any doubt, since the formation of the usurper Zionist regime,
the religious ulema and Muslim thinkers of the Islamic societies have
considered the issue of Palestine a great challenge in the way of
safeguarding the perimeters of the Islamic territories, preservation of
the dignity and honor of the Muslims of the world, and protection of the
rights of the oppressed, particularly the oppressed Muslims. They have
therefore considered the Zionist regime and its main supporter, the
United States (the leader of the arrogant camp), as the main enemy of
Islam and stress on the need to confront the enemy until the complete
elimination of Israel from the international arena.

The issue of Palestine in the viewpoint of Imam Khomeini was so
significant that from the very beginning of his social-political
struggles against the tyrannical monarchical system, he paid attention
to he issue of Palestine and laid stress on the necessity of struggle
against the arrogant powers until the total destruction of the Zionist
regime. The Imam states:

"I have frequently invited the Islamic governments to unity and
fraternity against the aliens and their agents, I have repeatedly warned
the governments, particularly the government of Iran against Israel and
its dangerous agents. This source of corruption which has been created
in the heart of the Islamic countries with the support of the great
powers and whose corrupt roots regularly threaten the Islamic countries,
should be uprooted with the efforts of the Islamic countries and great
Muslim nations.

Israel has waged an armed uprising against the Islamic countries; it is
the duty of the Islamic governments and nations to exterminate it.
Assistance to Israel " either sale of arms or explosive materials, or
oil " is unlawful and is against Islam. Relations with Israel and its
agents, either commercial or political, are unlawful and are against
Islam. The Muslims must refrain from using Israeli goods." 46

Also in the midst of his struggles against the monarchical regime and
on the threshold of the victory of the Islamic Revolution, the Imam
categorically announced his stance on Israel:

"Bait-ul-Muqaddas [Jerusalem] must be returned to the Muslims, the
Israelis are usurpers." 47

The Imam did not stop his support of the rights of the oppressed
Palestinians until the end of his blissful life and through his
incessant efforts tried to perform his divine duty of illuminating the
Muslims and awakening of the Muslim Ummah. He states:

"Defending the Muslim people, defending the Islamic territories and
defending all aspects of life of the Muslims is an obligatory issue and
we should prepare ourselves for the defense of divine objectives and
defending the Muslims. Particularly, under the circumstances when true
children of Islamic Palestineâ€¦ and revolutionary Muslims of the usurped
territories through sacrificing their bloods and lives are crying "O
Muslims". We should stand against Israel and the aggressors with all our
spiritual and material power and should resist all those atrocities and
brutalities and should assist them [the Palestinian fighters] ." 48

The Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, like
the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, has categorically hoisted
the flag of struggle against occupiers of the Qods. He is a harbinger of
campaign for introducing the rights of the oppressed Palestinians to the
world and is a pioneer in exposing the atrocities and savageries of the
Zionist regime. The Leader clearly considers the Palestinian issue as
the first problem and most significant challenge of the World of
Islam:

"Palestine is the top issue of the World of Islam; besides political,
economic and security aspects, the issue is a religious, Islamic duty
and above all it is a divine issue." 49

In the viewpoint of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, the only
proper way to confront the occupying regime of the Qods is struggle and
holy war until the total destruction of Israel from the international
arena. In line with Imam Khomeiniâ€™s stance, the Ayatollah Khamenei
states:

"The slogan of the elimination of the cancerous gland of Israel which
was put forth by the honorable Imam and the great leader of Islam, Imam
Khomeini (PBUH), regardless of the viewpoint of the compromising
political actors, should be forwarded with strength and should be
converted into the public voice of the Muslims during the Hajj
ceremonies." 50

The Leader also insists on his stance emphasizing no the necessity of
total destruction of Israel:

"Regarding the issue of Palestine, the objective is total destruction
of Israel and there are no differences between the territories occupied
before 1967 and after that. Every speck of the Palestinian territory is
a speck of the house of Muslims and any ruling system except the
sovereignty of Islam and the Palestinian people is a usurper regime."
51

The Leader of the Islamic Revolution also forwards a practical solution
to the Palestinian problem, that is, a practical, comprehensive,
goal-oriented solution in line with the dispatch of assistance by all
Islamic countries to equip the Palestinian fighters and oppressed
Palestinian people. Moreover, the Leader believes that there should be
comprehensiveness, unity, and coordination of efforts under the
supervision of experts, scholars and policymakers and planners of the
Islamic countries in order to achieve the goals with regard to the
Palestinian issue.

Commenting on this issue, the Leader states:

"The duty [of Islamic governments towards Palestine] includes
assistance in various forms, political, financial, and international
assistance. This [issue] must be decided by he officials and influential
figures of the Islamic world. If the rulers of the Islamic countries do
not decide, then the Muslim nations will feel that it is their direct
duty." 52

Having full trust in the power of faith of the Muslim masses and
Muslims societies, the Leader states: "All Muslim nations from bottom of
their hearts support the liberation of Palestine, the intellectuals of
the world of Islam, the ulema of the world of Islam, the distinguished
figures, as well as a number of politicians, heads and officials of the
Islamic world think so." 53
