Satisfaction and obedience of Allah:
====================================

Fatima (peace be upon her) is Allah’s real follower, and her exalted
purpose and ambition are to satisfy Him and seeks for a way to achieve
to this end without any shadow of doubt.

This is Fatima’s viewpoint that Allah has superiority over all things
and everyone. Thus, she has accepted His bondage of servitude. She is
seeking for Allah and His satisfaction in her speech, action, and all
her life. This is pride that the Prophet (peace be upon him and his
descendants) knows her satisfaction His satisfaction and her way as the
way of God, the Almighty.
