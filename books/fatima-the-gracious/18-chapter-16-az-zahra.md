Chapter 16:  Az-Zahra
=====================

As it was reported in v. 10 of Bihar al-Anwar, Ibn Abbas narrated that
Allah's Messenger said:

"Surely my daughter Fatima is: The Mistress of all women from the
beginning to the end. She is part of me, and the light of my eyes, She
is the f lower of my heart, and is my soul, (Fatima) is a human huri,
who whenever she stands in prayers in the presence of Her Lord (Exalted
is His Name), her light illuminates the skies for the angels, like stars
shine to people on Earth."

This narration clarifies the reason for which Fatima az-Zahra (sa) was
given the name Zahra. There are other narrations, which mention that she
had a bright and splendid face.

Lady Fatima az-Zahra (sa) had other titles, and each one of them
reflected a virtue of noble trait which she enjoyed. Among those titles
were: Al-Batoul, Al-Adhra (The Virgin), and

Al-Hania (The Affectionate one to her children).

Fatimaâ€™s (sa) favorite title was "Umm Abiha" meaning her father's
mother.
