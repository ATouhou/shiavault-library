Namaaz (prayer)
===============

Let us start from the fundamental Hadeeth. AL IHTIJAJ AL TABARSI - VOL
1 P230

So came the order from the Imam Ja'far Al Sadiq (a.s.): 'Whoever says -
There is no God but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah must
immediately say Ali is the Commander of the Faithful'.

As you can clearly see that this is an all encompassing Hadeeth where
NO restrictions are mentioned. The third testimony simply has to be
borne, Period!

QUESTIONS

Why does this action of ours only include two testimonies? Why is this
action of ours the exception when it comes to bearing the third
testimony?

Has this been prohibited in the Book of Allah (s.w.t.)? The answer is
obviously - NO!

Has this been prohibited in any Hadeeth? - The answer is obviously -
NO! Why has a prohibition order been issued by some Mujtahids? What is
their authorisation for this prohibition which is neither found in the
Book of Allah (s.w.t.) nor in the Noble Sunnah?

WASAAIL US SHIA - VOL 6 CH 19 H 7997 So said the Holy Imam Al Sadiq
(a.s.): 'Everything is permissible unless there is a prohibition order
for it.'

TASHAHHUD (BEARING TESTIMONIES)

And this is what the Mujtahids have concluded for the bearing of
testimonies. TAWZEEH UL MASAAIL - SYED ALI AL SISTANI - RULE 1109

In the second unit of all obligatory prayers, and in the third unit of
Maghrib prayers and in the fourth unit of Zuhr, Asr and Isha prayers,
one should sit after the second prostration with a tranquil body, and
recite tashahhud thus: "Ash hadu an la ilaha illal lahu wahdahu la
sharika lah, wa ash hadu anna Muhammadan 'Abduhu wa Rasuluh, Alla humma
salli 'ala Muhammadin wa Ali Muhammad". And it will be sufficient if one
recited the tashahhud this way: Ash hadu an la ilaha illal lahu was ash
hadu anna Muhammadan Sallal lahu Alayhi Wa Aalihi Abduhu Wa rasuluh.

Two testimonies everywhere! Well! Well! Well! Now, it is proven from
the Book of Allah (s.w.t.) that the hypocrites are on two testimonies.

[Shakir 63:1] When the hypocrites come to you, they say: We bear
witness that you are most surely Allah's Messenger; and Allah knows that
you are most surely His Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the
hypocrites are surely liars.

It is also proven from the Book of Allah (s.w.t.) that the believers
are on more than two testimonies.

[Shakir 70:33-4] And those who are upright in their testimonies; and
those who keep a guard on their prayer, The term used here is
'Shahadaat' (Plural). There is no Shahadatain (Dual) here. Is this the
reason why Allah (s.w.t.) has lamented on the people who do pray
Namaaz?

[Shakir 107:4-5] So woe to the praying ones, who are unmindful of their
prayers, Should not woe be on those who do not pray Namaaz?

What kind of Namaaz are these people praying that there should be woe
unto them? The point to ponder over is that, since the hypocrites are on
two testimonies and the believers are on at least three, we now have to
look at our own Namaaz to see which Namaaz we are reciting, the woeful
one of the hypocrites or the honourable one of the believers?

On top of the woe on the praying ones we have this Hadeeth where curses
are being sent on them.

ILLUL AL SHARAIE - VOL 2 P602

It is related from the above chain of narrators that the Holy Imam Ali
(a.s.) said: 'Surely Allah (s.w.t.), at the time of every Prayer that
this creation (these people) prays, sends curses on them'. So I asked:
'May I be your sacrifice, How comes?' He (a.s.) said: 'They fought
against our right and falsified us.'

The worth of their Namaaz has been evaluated in this Hadeeth. AL KAFI -
VOL 8 - H 162

It is narrated from a number of narrators from Suhail Ibn Ziyad, from
Ibn Fadhaal from Ibn Hannan, from the Holy Imam Ja'far Al Sadiq (a.s.)
said: 'It makes no difference whether the Nasibi prays Namaaz or commits
adultery.' Can you clearly see the value of the Namaaz which is prayed
without the Wilayah of the Holy Ahl Ul Bayt (a.s.)? Let us see what the
Holy Imam (a.s.) has said about this matter. AL KAFI - H 1115, CH. 108,
H 38

Ali ibn Muhammad has narrated from Sahl ibn Ziyad from 'Isma'il ibn
Mihran from al- Hassan al-Qummi from Idris ibn 'Abd Allah who has said
the following: "Once I asked abu 'Abd Allah, recipient of divine supreme
covenant, about the interpretation of this verse of the Holy Quran,
'What has led you to Saqar' (a place in hell)?

They will reply, 'We did not pray.' (74:43) "The Imam said, 'Such
people will be those who did not believe in 'A'immah (Leaders with
Divine Authority) about whom Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has
said, "The foremost ones will be the nearest ones to Allah." (56:11)
Have you not noticed that people call the one second to the lead in
horseracing 'Al-Musalli' (also means the praying)? This is what is meant
therein. "We did not pray" (74:43), means 'We did not follow the
lead.'"

As you can see without the Wilayah of the Holy Infallibles (a.s.), all
actions are futile. One thing is for certain. If any of the Holy
Infallibles (a.s.) used to pray with bearing of the third testimony,
then that should put an end to all arguments.


**Tashahhud Of The Holy Prophet (S.A.W.)**

[Shakir 17:110] Say: Call upon Allah or call upon, the Beneficent
Allah; whichever you call upon, He has the best names; and do not utter
your prayer with a raised voice nor be silent with regard to it, and
seek a way between these.

It is written in Tafseer Ayyashi that Abu Hamza Al Thumali has narrated
from the Holy Imam Muhammad Al Baqir (a.s.) that the words, 'and do not
utter your prayer with a raised voice nor be silent with regard to it,
and seek a way between these', the Tafseer (explanation) of this is that
'Do not say the Wilayah of Ali (a.s) with a raised voice until an Order
comes to you regarding it; and do not be silent with regard to it,
meaning, do not conceal it, and I Know about its honourable status.'

This has also been quoted in many other thousand year old commentaries
like Tafseer Al Safi, Burhan, Noor Us Thaqalayn, Basaair U Darajaat etc.
A congregational Prayer took place in the Heavens above by the Prophets
led by their Master the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.).

AL YAQEEN - SYED IBN TAWOOS - 589 TO 684 AH

Imam Ali the Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) has related that the Holy
Prophet (s.a.w.) prayed with the prophets of the night of the Ascension
(Me'raaj) by the Order of Allah (s.w.t.). They asked him: 'How shall we
bear the testimonies?' He (s.a.w.) turned towards them and said: 'How
shall you bear the testimonies? Say - 'We testify that there is no God
but Allah the One without any partner, and you are the Messenger of
Allah and Ali is the Commander of the faithful and your Trustee. These
testimonies were taken as covenant from them'.

TASHAHHUD OF THE HOLY IMAM JA'FAR AL SADIQ (A.S.)

Abu Baseer has narrated from the Holy Imam Al Sadiq (a.s.)
(tashahhud) - 'In the Name of Allah (s.w.t.) and with Allah (s.w.t.) and
(All) Praise is for Allah (s.w.t.) and all of His (s.w.t.) Names as
Good; I bear witness that there is no God except Allah (s.w.t.) Who is
One without any partner; and I bear witness that Muhammad (s.a.w.) is
His (s.w.t.) Servant and His (s.w.t.) Messenger (s.a.w.);

He (s.w.t.) sent him (s.a.w.) with the Truth as a Bearer of good news
and as a Warner; and I bear witness that my Nourisher (s.w.t.) is the
best Nourisher (s.w.t.), and Muhammad (s.a.w.) is the best Messenger and
Ali (a.s.) is the best Trustee and the best Imam; O Allah (s.w.t.) send
blessings on Muhammad (s.a.w.) and his progeny (a.s.) and accept his
(s.a.w.) intercession in the Ummah and elevate his (s.a.w.) station; All
Praise is for Allah (s.w.t.).
