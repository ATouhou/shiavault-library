90: [this] Countryside (balad)
==============================

These 20 early Meccan verses were revealed after (The Letter) Qaf (or Q)
50 and before The Nightcomer 86; they are composed in rhymed prose. A
clear statement concerning free will or the choice which is offered
Muslims is made here.

Reciting it brings us spiritual blessings, especially on Fridays.

The term AL-Ba!ad contained in the title is difficult to translate, for
its meaning ranges from the idea of' city \`to' country \`, and includes
that of district, home town, municipality, community, or land. Various
versions use most of these English terms. It here means the sacred
surroundings of Mecca.
