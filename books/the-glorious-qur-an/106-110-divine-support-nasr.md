110: [divine] Support (nasr)
============================

These 3 verses were revealed at Mina on the eastern outskirts of Mecca
during the Farewell Pilgrimage, and they, as well as V.281 in The Cow 2
and V.3 in The Table 5, are dated after the chapter on Repentance 9.

They might thus be considered to date chronologically from the late
Madinese period, even thoughÂ  the geographical location is the vicinity
of Mecca. These verses thus form the very last chapter to be revealed to
the prophet. It is one of the shortest chapters (along with Plenty 108,
which likewise consists of three verses).
The message assures Muhammad that Islam will ultimately be successful.
The word support \` exists as both a noun and verb and is thus more
effective in rendering such meanings or situations, so I use it in
preference to "victory" (which I have retained for the word fath as in
Chapter 48).
