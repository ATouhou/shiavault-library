Question 11
-----------

**What is the meaning of the last paragraph of as-Sayid ar-Radi quoted
before?**

He has eluded here to the best way of *taqiyyah*, which is called
*tawriyah*.

Sometimes a sentence or phrase may be used in such a way that the hearer
takes it to conform with his own ideas, while the speaker takes it to
mean a quite different thing. A good example of *tawriyah* is found in a
talk of the "believer from the family of Pharaoh".

Islamic traditions say that he was a cousin of Pharaoh. When his
partiality towards Prophet Musa (as) became known, some courtiers of
Pharaoh told him that his cousin was a secret follower of Musa and did
not believe in divinity of Pharaoh.

Pharaoh was naturally furious, and asked his cousin to explain it. The
court was full.  
 "The believer from the family of Pharaoh" asked them:  
*The Believer*: Tell me who is your Lord?

*Courtiers*: Pharaoh.  
*The Believer*: Who is your Creator?  
*Courtiers*: Pharaoh.  
*The Believer*: Who is your sustainer, who guarantees your livelihood
and removes your troubles?  
*Courtiers*: Pharaoh.

Then the Believer declared: "O King! I keep you and all these present as
my witness that their Lord is my Lord, and their Sustainer is my
Sustainer; and the One , who looks after their lives and livelihood is
the One who looks after my life and livelihood. I have no Lord or
Creator except their Lord, Creator and Sustainer..."

Pharaoh's anxiety vanished and the backbiters were severely tortured and
put to death. [^1]  
 But, in spite of the joy of Pharaoh on this declaration, the real
intention of "The Believer" is quite clear.

Also two examples from New Testament come here to mind.

### Tawriyah of Jesus Christ

St. Matthews reports,

Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him
(Jesus) in his talk.

And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying:
Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in
truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the
person of men.

Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto
Caesar, or not? But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why
tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Show me the tribute money. And they brought
unto him a penny.

And he saith unto them, whose is this image and superscription?

They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore
unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that
are God's.

When they had heard these words, they marveled, and left him, and went
their way.[^2]

### Taqiyyah of St. Paul

St. Paul was brought before a gathering of the Jews who wanted to punish
him for his faith in Christianity Now read the accounts from the
\`Acts':

But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other
Pharisees, he cried out in the council, men and brethren, I am a
Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; to the hope and resurrection of the
dead I am called in question.

And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between . the
Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.  
 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor
spirit: but the Pharisee, confess both.

And there arose a great cry: and the Scribes that were of the Pharisees'
part arose, and stroveâ€žsaying, We find no evil in this man.[^3]

Many examples of this kind of *taqiyyah* could be quoted from Shi'a
sources. But, as many of them entail explanations of Arabic grammar, I
prefer not to write them here. However, one is given here to complete
this topic.  
 A preacher was asked during his sermon: "Who was the supreme most after
the Holy Prophet? Abu Bakr or 'Ali?" He replied:

It may be interpreted as "He whose daughter was in his (i.e., Prophet's)
house." i.e.; Abu Bakr.

And may as easily mean "He that his (Prophet's) daughter was in his
house". i.e. 'Ali.
