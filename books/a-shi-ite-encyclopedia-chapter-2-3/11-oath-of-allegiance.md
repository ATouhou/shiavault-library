Oath of Allegiance
==================

After his speech, the Messenger of Allah asked every body to give the
oath of allegiance to Ali (AS) and congratulate him. Among those who
gave him the oath were Umar, Abu Bakr, and Uthman. It is narrated that
Umar and Abu Bakr said:

"Well done Ibn Abi Talib! Today you became the leader (Mawla) of all
believing men and women."

**The Number of People in Ghadir Khum**

It was Allah's will that an increased popularity is associated with
this tradition via the tongs of narrators and over the times. So that
there is a standing proof for the guiding Imam (peace be upon him).
Allah ordered His Prophet (PBUH&HF) to notify people at a time of
crowded populous so that all become the narrators of the tradition,
while they exceeded a hundred thousand.

Narrated by Zaid Ibn Arqam: Abu al-Tufail said: "I heard it from the
Messenger of Allah, and there was no one (there) unless he saw him with
his eyes and heard him with his ears."

"There were with the Messenger (PBUH) from the companions, Arabs,
residents around Mecca and Medina one hundred and twenty thousand
(120,000) and they are those who were present in the Farewell Pilgrimage
and heard this speech."

**Revelation of Verse 70:1-3**

Some Sunni commentators further claim that the first three verse of the
chapter of al-Ma'arij (70:1-3) was revealed when a dispute arose after
Prophet reached Medina. It is recorded that:

On the day of Ghadir the Messenger of Allah summoned the people toward
Ali and said: "Ali is the MAWLA of whom I am MAWLA." The news spread
quickly all over urban and rural areas.

When Harith Ibn Nu'man al- Fahri (or Nadhr Ibn Harith according to
another tradition) came to know of it, he rode his camel and came to
Medina and went to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HF) and said to him:
"You commanded us to testify that there is no deity but Allah and that
you are the Messenger of Allah. We obeyed you. You ordered us to perform
the prayers five times a day and we obeyed. You ordered us to observe
fasts during the month of Ramadhan and we obeyed. Then you commanded us
to offer pilgrimage to Mecca and we obeyed.

But you are not satisfied with all this and you raised your cousin by
your hand and imposed him upon us as our master by saying \`Ali is the
MAWLA of whom I am MAWLA.' Is this imposition from Allah or from You?"
The Prophet (PBUH&HF) said : "By Allah who is the only deity! This is
from Allah, the Mighty and the Glorious."

On hearing this Harith turned back and proceeded towards his she-camel
saying: "O Allah! If what Muhammad said is correct then fling on us a
stone from the sky and subject us to severe pain and torture." He had
not reached his she-camel when Allah, who is above all defects flung at
him a stone which struck him on his head, penetrated his body and passed
out through his lower body and left him dead. It was on this occasion
that Allah, the exalted, caused to descend the following verses:

"A questioner questioned about the punishment to fall. For the
disbelievers there is nothing to avert it, from Allah the Lord of the
Ascent." (70:1-3)

**The events that Imam Ali (AS) reminded the Tradition**

Imam Ali (AS), in person, reminded others who witnessed the event of
Ghadir and the tradition of the Messenger of Allah; these are some of
the events:

- On the day of Shura (Election Day for Uthman)
- During the days of Uthman's rule
- The Day of Rahbah (year 35) where 24 companions stood up and swore
that they attended and heard the tradition of the Prophet (PBUH) first
hand, twelve of whom were the warriors of Badr.
- The Day of Jamal (the War of Camel, year 36) where he reminded
Talha.
- The Day of the Riders where 9 witnesses testified.

About the Battle of Camel, al-Hakim and Ahmad Ibn Hanbal and others
recorded that:

We were in the camp of Ali on the day of Battle of Camel, where Ali
sent for Talha to talk to him (before the beginning of war). Talha came
forward, and Ali told him: I adjure you by Allah! Didn't you hear the
Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HF) when he said: \`Whoever I am his MAWLA,
this Ali is his MAWLA. O God, love whoever loves him, and be hostile to
whoever is hostile to him'?" Talha replied: "Yes." Ali said: "Then why
do you want to fight me?"

- Muruj al-Dhahab, by al-Mas'udi, v4, p321
- Majma' al-Zawa'id, by al-Haythami, v9, p107

Ahmad Ibn Hanbal recorded in his Musnad that:

Abu Tufayl narrated that He (Ali) gathered the people in the plain of
Rahbah (on year 35 AH) and adjured in the name of Allah every Muslim
male present there who had heard the proclamation of al-Ghadir from the
Messenger of Allah (PBUH) to stand up and testify what they had heard
from the Messenger on the Day of Ghadir. Thereupon thirty (30) men stood
up and gave evidence that the Prophet grasped Ali's hand and said to the
audience: "He (Ali) has superior authority over those who believe me to
have superiority over their lives.

O Allah! Love him who loves him and hate him who hates him." Abu Tufayl
says that it was in a state of great mental agitation that he left the
plain of Rahbah, for the Muslim masses had not complied with the
tradition. He therefore called on Zaid Ibn Arqam and told him what he
heard from Ali. Zaid told him not to entertain any doubt about it for he
himself had heard the Messenger of Allah uttering those words.

Sunni reference: Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, v4, p370

also:

Abd al-Rahman Ibn Abu Laylah said: I witnessed Ali administering an
oath to the people in the plain of Rahbah. Ali said: "I adjure those of
you in the name of Allah who heard the Messenger of Allah on the day of
Ghadir saying \`Ali is the Mawla of whom I am Mawla' to stand up and to
testify. He who was not an eyewitness doesn't need to stand up."
Thereupon twelve (12) such companions who had participated in the Battle
of Badr stood up. The occasion is still fresh in my memory.

**Sunni references:**

- Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, v1, p119, see also v5, p366
- Khasa'is, by al-Nisa'i, pp 21,103, narrated similar to above on the
authority of three others: Umayah Ibn Sa'd, Zaid Ibn yathigh, and Sa'id
Ibn Wahab.

It is also recorded that:

When Ali said to Anas: "Why don't you stand up and testify what you
heard from the Messenger of Allah on the day of Ghadir?" He answered, "O
Amir al-Mumineen! I have grown old and do not remember." Thereupon Ali
said: "May Allah mark you with a white spot (of leprosy; Alphosis)
unconcealable with your turban, if you are intentionally withholding the
truth." And before Anas got up from his place he bore a large white spot
on his face, Thereafter Anas used to say, "I am under the curse of the
righteous servant of Allah."

disabled persons.

anecdote, as he says : "All stood up except three persons who came under

**A more detailed speech of Prophet at the Pond of Khum**

Messenger of Allah said:

"Praise belongs to Allah. We ask Him for help, and we believe in Him,
and to Him we trust. We seek refuge to Him from the evil of our souls
and the sins of our deeds. Verily there is no guide for the one whom
Allah leaves in stray, and there is non who leads astray the one whom
Allah has guided."

"O People! Know that Gabriel came down to me several times bringing me
an order from the Lord, the Merciful, that I should stop at this place
and inform you. Behold! It is as if the time approached when I shall be
called away (by Allah) and I shall answer that call."

"O Folk! Don't you witness that there is no deity but Allah, Muhammad
is His servant and His Apostle, Paradise is truth, Hell is truth, death
is truth, resurrection is truth, and that the Hour shall certainly
arrive, and Allah shall raise people from the graves?" People replied:
"Yes, we believe in them."

He continued: "O People! Do you hear my voice (clearly)?" They said:
"Yes". The Prophet said: "Behold! I am leaving among you two precious
and weighty Symbols that if you adhere to both of them, you shall never
go astray after me. Each of these two surpasses the other in its
grandeur."

A person asked: "O Messenger of Allah, what are those two precious
things?"

The Prophet replied: "One of them is the Book of Allah and the other
one is my select progeny (Itrat), that is family (Ahlul-Bayt). Beware of
how you behave them when I am gone from amongst you, for Allah, the
Merciful, has informed me that these two (i.e., Quran and Ahlul-Bayt)
shall never separate from each other until they reach me in Heaven at
the Pool (of al-Kawthar). I remind you, in the name of Allah, about my
Ahlul-Bayt. I remind you, in the name of Allah, about my Ahlul-Bayt.
Once more! I remind you, in the name of Allah, about my Ahlul-Bayt."

"Behold! I am your predecessor at the Pool (of Paradise) and I shall be
a witness against you. Thus be careful how you treat these two precious
things after me. Do not precede these two for you will perish, and do
not stay away from them for you will perish."

"O People! Don't you know that I have more authority upon you than
yourself?" People cried and said: "Yes, O Messenger of Allah." Then
prophet repeated: "O Folk! Do I not have more right over the believers
than what they have over themselves?" People said again "Yes, O
Messenger of Allah." Then Prophet said: "O People! Surely God is my
Master, and I am the master of all believers." Then he grasped the hand
of Ali and raised it and said:

"WHOEVER I AM HIS MASTER, ALI IS HIS MASTER (repeating three times). O
God! Love those who love him. Be hostile to those who are hostile to
him. Help those who help him. Forsake those who forsake him. And keep
the truth with him wherever he turns (i.e., make him the axis of the
truth)."

"Ali, the son of Abu Talib, is my brother, my executor (Wasi), and my
successor (Caliph), and the leader (Imam) after me. His position to me
is the same as the position of Haroon (Aaron) to Moses, except that
there shall be no prophet after me. He is your master after Allah and
His Messenger."

"O Folk! Verily Allah has appointed him to be your Imam and ruler.
Obedience of him is obligatory for all Immigrants (Muhajirin) and
Helpers (Ansar) and those who follow them in virtue, and on the dwellers
of the cities and the nomads, the Arabs and the non-Arabs, the freeman
and the slave, the young and the old, the great and the small, the white
and the black."

"His commands should be obeyed, and his word is binding and his order
is obligatory on everyone who believes in one God. Cursed is the man who
disobeys him, and blessed is the one who follows him, and he who
believes in him is a true believer. His WILAYAH (belief in his mastery)
has been made obligatory by Allah, the Powerful, the Exalted."

"O Folk! Study the Quran. Reflect on its clear verses and do not
presume the meaning of the ambiguous verses. For, by Allah, nobody can
properly explain them to you its warnings and its meanings except me and
this man (i.e., Ali) whose hand I am lifting up in front of myself."

"O People! This is the last time that I shall stand in this assembly.
Therefore listen to me and obey and submit to the command of Lord.
Verily Allah, He is your Lord and God. After Him, His prophet, Muhammad
who is addressing you, is your master. Then after me, this Ali is your
master and your leader (Imam) according to Allah's command. Then after
him leadership will continue through some selected individuals in my
descendants till the day you meet Allah and His Prophet."

"Behold! Certainly you shall meet your Lord and He will ask you about
your deeds. Beware! Do not become infidels after me by striking the
necks of one another. Lo! It is incumbent upon those who are present to
inform what I said to those who are absent for perhaps the informed one
might comprehend it (understand it) better than some of the present
audience. Behold! Haven't I conveyed the Message of Allah to you?
Behold! Haven't I conveyed the Message of Allah to you?" People replied:
"Yes." The Prophet said: "O God! Bear witness."
