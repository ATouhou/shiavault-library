Heroism of the Women
====================

There were women: for example, Zainab the sister of the Imam, Sakina his
little daughter, and Shahr-i-Banu, his wife, at Karbalaâ€™. A great deal
of poetic literature has sprung up in Muslim languages, describing the
touching scenes in which they figure. Even in their grief and their
tears they are heroic.

They lament the tragedy in simple, loving, human terms. But they are
also conscious of the noble dignity of their nearness to a life of truth
reaching its goal in the precious crown of martyrdom. One of the
best-known poets of this kind is the Urdu poet Anis, who lived in
Lucknow, and died in 1874.
