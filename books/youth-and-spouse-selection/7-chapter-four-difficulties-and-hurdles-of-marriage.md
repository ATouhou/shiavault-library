Chapter Four: Difficulties and Hurdles of Marriage
==================================================

Whenever it is said to a youth “Marry”, he instantly presents the
problems, difficulties, and hurdles of marriage and the first difficulty
that he discusses is the economical and financial matters. He then
counts the other problems one by one.

It is a fact that there are really lots of difficulties on the way to
marriage, which cannot be neglected. In this chapter, by the will of
Allah, we shall consider these difficulties, impediments and obstacles
and contemplate the solutions to them.

Difficulties: Real Or Artificial?
---------------------------------

Alas, our society still remains a far distance from the true and pure
Mohammadan Islam. Ah! Still its face is hidden behind the curtain of
many problems. And the curtains of ignorance, false habits and customs,
selfishness, polytheism and egoism have hindered the radiant sun of
Islam, depriving society of its

life‑giving glare.

Had Islam been the standard and criterion in marriage and spouse
choosing, most or all of these difficulties would not have existed. But
which Islam? According to Imam Khomeini (r.a) pure Mohammadan Islam, not
American Islam.

Pure Islam is the same as the Prophet (a.s) originated. Have we not read
and heard about the glorious Prophet (a.s)? That he executed all the
stages of marriage, i.e. engagement, fixation of dowry, and recitation
of marriage service, in the span of a few minutes, and handed the
husband and wife to each other and sent them to their home? These are
not myths, not even miracles. Still the pure Mohammadan Islam is the
same and has the same strength and quality, but it is we who are not
pure Muslims (all our shortcomings are due to “our” Muslimhood, not to
Islam).

### What To Do Now?

In any case, difficulties and hindrances do exist, and their solutions
and remedies must be found. These remedies and solutions are of two
kinds: one is long term and the other is short term. The long term ones
are mostly related to the intelligentsia, the rulers, reformers, think
tanks and the trainers of the nation and society, who should seek
solutions for the entire society and its welfare. And the short term
ones are mostly connected to the youth and their parents themselves, who
must seek the immediate solution as to what must be done in these
circumstances and conditions.

At the moment, we are not going to talk about the long-term solutions.
They may be discussed independently at another time. Our main discussion
pertains to the short term planning, i.e. what might be done right now?
So now we take up the real and actual difficulties.

First Difficulty  
 Economic And Monetary Difficulty
---------------------------------

The major part of this difficulty is formed from the intricacies created
by society, which is not the actual difficulty of marriage. Had our life
been based upon the foundations of Islam and human nature, these
external difficulties would not have existed, or would have been
extremely minimized, and there would have been no youth who could not
marry due to such things. Anyway, these things presently exist and our
society has brought them into being, and a solution must be sought for
them.

### Solutions:  
 1. Allah’s Supports

Allah and the leaders of Islam have given a lot of good news and hope in
this regard, which can be very hopeful and trusting supports for the
youth. It is obligatory and binding upon us to have complete
satisfaction about these promises and news. Their promises and
commitments are true. There could be no more hope ‑ giving and
enthusiasm ‑ creating thing than this support for the youth who intend
to marry but find the economical difficulties a hurdle and hindrance on
their way. Faith in this support brings

about a great courage and valour in a man. Now we consider a few of
those.

Allah promises:

**﴿وَأَنكِحُوا الْأَيَامَى مِنْكُمْ وَالصَّالِحِينَ مِنْ عِبَادِكُمْ
وَإِمَائِكُمْ إِنْ يَكُونُوا فُقَرَاءَ يُغْنِهِمْ اللَّهُ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ
وَاللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ﴾**

“And marry those among you who are single and those who are fit among
your male slaves and your female slaves; if they are needy, Allah will
make them free from want out of His grace; and Allah is Ample-giving,
Knowing. (24: 32)”

This is a clear, distinct and conspicuous promise of Allah; and which
promise can be more trusting than Allah’s?

Young brother and sister, be satisfied and absolutely sure about this
promise of Allah, then you will see the definite and bright result of
it, inshallah.

I have personally seen and observed and touched this in many cases among
my friends and acquaintances who did not have a house or wealth at the
time of their marriage, but later on became house owners and wealthy.
Very rarely have I seen people possessing a house and material sources
before marriage. I know only two of these cases where some people were
provided with a house and money before marriage, but interestingly, they
too were confronted with a cold, spiritless, and purposeless life due to
them putting off and delaying their marriage for the procurement of
house and money; since they wasted the spring of marriage that is the
valuable period of youth till the

“autumn of life” appeared.

### The Good News Given By The Leaders Of Islam

The Prophet (s.a) who is the trustee of Allah’s mysteries and secrets
spoke about Allah’s help to the youth as follows:

**زَوِّجُوا أياماكم فإنّ اللهَ يُحسِّنُ لَهم في أخْلاقِهِم ويُوَسِّع
لهُم في أرزاقِهِم ويَزيدُهُم في مُرُوَّاتهم.**

“Give spouses to your single ones, because Allah makes their morality
better (improves it) (under the shadow of marriage) and expands their
sustenance and increases their generosity (human values).”**[1]**

Yet again he says:

**مَن تَرَكَ التَّزوِيجَ مَخافَةَ العِيلَةِ فَقَد سَاءَ الظَّنَّ باللهِ.
إنَّ اللهَ يَقولُ: إِنْ يَكُونُوا فُقَرَاءَ يُغْنِهِمْ اللَّهُ مِنْ
فَضْلِهِ.**

“The one who forsakes and drops marriage for fear of poverty and
adversity, indeed he has a bad (negative) opinion and thought about
Allah. Verily Allah said: ‘If they are poor, Allah will turn them
needless by His grace.’“**[2]**

Again that magnanimous one says to the youth:

**إتَّخِذوا الأهْلَ فإنَّهُ أرْزَقُ لَكُم.**

“Get spouses, as that increases your sustenance.”**[3]**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[1]** Nawadir al-Rawandi, p 36.  
 **[2]** Wasail al-Shia, Vol 3, p5.  
 **[3]** Wasail al-Shia, Vol. 3 p7.

**الرِّزْقُ مَع النِّساءِ وَالعِيالِ.**

“Sustenance is with wives and family.”**[1]**

### A Beautiful Example

A young man who was extremely poor and penniless came into the presence
of the holy Prophet (a.s) and complained to him about his poverty and
adversity, and requested his guidance, saying: “Oh

Prophet of Allah, what must I do to get out of this condition of extreme
poverty and apprehension?”

The Prophet said: “Do marry!”

The young man was surprised and said to himself, “How can I, who do not
have enough means to run my own life’s expenses, marry and shoulder the
responsibility and expenses of wife and myself together?”

However, since he was completely sure about the correctness of the
saying of the Prophet (a.s) and believed in its truth, did get married
and his life gradually and economically improved. He came out of the
state of poverty and misery.

Deep attention to this good news and true promises projects sureness
about Allah’s aid and help in the human heart, so that one marries and
is not afraid of the difficulties, hardships and hindrances.

And it is taken for granted that when a youth marries for the pleasure
of Allah, implementation of His

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[1]** Noor al-Thaqalain, Vol. 3 p 599.

command and remaining safe and secure from the corruptions and spiritual
and physical ailments, and also for the sake of progress, completion and
prosperity, Allah’s beneficence and kindness would overwhelm him, and
His help would come to make him reach his sacred aim.

### 2. New Horizons

After marriage, new horizons and vistas open up before one, which did
not exist before; since the individual, as a result of marriage, feels
more responsibility and sees oneself responsible to manage the new life,
to procure the livelihood and save the family’s honour. Thereby, he
utilizes all his potential capabilities and hidden talents. Fresh
springs sprout up from his interior. Talents that he was unaware of rise
up and premarital sleeping energies gush out. He finds a new and
energetic personality inside himself. His dependence and trust upon
Allah increases. And all of a sudden “new broad horizons” open up and
are made apparent before his intellect, mind and soul.

On the other side, under the shadow of marriage and resting beside a
kind, intimate and sympathetic life partner, all the problems,
pressures, agonies of single life, loneliness, feelings of scornfulness
and shortcomings are forgotten, and as a consequence, the human soul
blossoms and the keenness and eagerness towards progress and completion
blooms in him, and man flies up towards the height of completion and
prosperity.

What a large number of people have been seen who,

after marrying a suitable spouse, have found for themselves new
personalities, become new persons, and their journey towards all ends
picked up acceleration and speed.

This progress and development of new horizons contains and consists of
economic affairs as well and the youth explores new ways and means of
livelihood and procuring income. He becomes brave and dauntless in his
economical matters, expansion of his job and business. As a result, his
income is boosted and increases by these activities. Economical problems
and hardships are removed one by one.

Every success has many other successes following it and every new
victory brings other victories.

### 3. Job Facilities And Allowances

In a lot of organizations, job institutions and offices married
employees are given such facilities, allowances and benefits, which are
not given to the unmarried. For example, when teachers get married, they
are provided with plots, loans and other benefits and allowances that
have a great effect upon the betterment of their economical conditions.

Just as it has been previously stated, 90% of my friends and
acquaintances became house owners and wealthy after being married. Most
of them were teachers and preceptors who, when married, even after their
simple engagement, acquired access to pieces of land and loans,
constructed houses, and even their marriage expenses were met by the
same money. Of course, we

must be attentive to the fact that in all these cases “Allah’s help” is
effective.

### 4. Attaining Status And More Reverence

In society, married people are usually more respected and given higher
status than single ones. The banks and financial institutions that
provide loans, and the businessmen and institutions providing
commodities on instalments trust and value married people more. This
trust and economical honour has its effect upon removing the financial
hardships of life and improving its elegance and splendour.

### 5. Special Marriage Loans

Special funds and bank loans for this essential matter must be
established everywhere. This seems to be one of the long-term solutions
we have decided not to discuss. We, at present, do not have any concern
with the long term ones, but the youth themselves and the residents of
each street can perform it, and the mosques are suitable places for this
work. It may not necessarily be a large one; it can be a small unit in
each street and area, and can announce that everyone can bring in any
amount of money and give it as a loan for marriage expenditures and
expenses for Allah’s pleasure.

Unfortunately, some of the loan funds, which at the beginning were meant
for meeting the needs of needy people, have now turned into ’business
shops’. Anyone who has more money or works more with the fund gets more
loans! (Glory be to the Creator! Is this the

meaning of a loan?!)

We are not concerned with such funds. Of course, there are some funds
concordant with their preliminary aims and objectives and young men can,
by trusting in Allah and with their high morale, courage, fortitude and
the help of sincere and pious men raise and establish special marriage
funds.

### 6. Decreasing The Ceremonies And Additional Expenses

Most of the ceremonies regarding marriage are against Islam, reason and
human nature.

We must again regret that our society has become so immersed in habits,
rites and customs of ignorance. A lot has been said and is being said
over this topic. Reformers admonish. Writers write. The religious
scholars and clergymen describe the traditions and the mode of life and
morale of the infallibles. But alas, it has a little effect upon
hardened hearts, which are contaminated with the customs of ignorance.

Why have we become so? Why have we, who claim piety and culture, flung
ourselves far from piety and civilization and the lofty Islamic culture?

Why do we bind ourselves by such chains of imprisonment?

Why is our society moving fast towards decline, retro gradation and
retrogression and the fall of moral values? Why is it that after the
revolution it was expected that the mean rites of ignorance would go,
but actually we see them on the increase? This is most

certainly not the fault of the revolution, it is ours.

The dower sums and wedding gifts are going up each day. Dowries are
increasing. The expenses and expenditures are swelling. Ceremonies are
boosting up in number. Emulation and rivalry is increasing and avarice
and jealousy is intensifying.

O Allah! What has gone wrong with us?

Oh dear fathers and mothers, be mindful not to sacrifice your children
upon your greed and avarice. Be mindful not to destroy their prosperity.
Do you know that if you hinder the marriage of your son with a suitable
spouse, its harm and loss will reach you before and more than everybody
else? Take lesson from all the corruption that has taken place due to
delays in marriages for the sake of ceremonies and rites.

If your dear daughter becomes corrupt, you will lose your honour, which
will make you bow down your head.

If you receive the news that your daughter has made friends with
indecent boys, and God forbid, she has become immodest and immoral, then
this stain will remain upon your face forever.

If, God forbid, your son becomes immoral, characterless, and corrupt and
involved in feeding his eyes with prohibited sights, sexual deviation,
indulgence, and dirty sexual activities, this would bring a black spot
of eternal disgrace to you.

If your son or daughter is confronted with depression, apprehension or
physical and spiritual diseases due to

sexual strains, solitude and loneliness, or masturbation and sexual
deviations, their loss, apprehension and grief will also be shared by
you.

Why have we become negligent and heedless to the facts? Did the Prophet
(a.s) not say the daughter who is not married in time is like a fruit
that is not plucked in time and becomes rotten and stale? Did Islam not
reveal: “If the marriage of the son is delayed due to the parents and he
is deviated (with sin), that sin will be shared by the father and the
mother as well”?

Even if we are not Muslims, why must we not take lesson from the
experiences of society?

Oh dear father and mother, oh sisters and brothers, do for sure that
most difficulties are our own creations, and we have ourselves loaded
these problems and nuisances upon ourselves.

When the parents, and even the boys and girls, are talked to and guided
about decreasing and diminishing the expenditures and ceremonies, and an
ample number of arguments are given in this connection, they reply: “All
that you say is correct, but, we have honour and prestige It would be
stepping down from the height of honour if we do not take such and such
an amount as dower sum, have simple ceremonies, the girls’ dowry may not
contain a colour TV, furniture, freezer and carpet, certain types of
jewellery may not

be there, and the right milk price**[1]** may not be received. We are
honourable and must remain honourable and respectable and raise our head
(with honour) among both families.”

The answer is: Is our honour and reverence more than that of the Prophet
(a.s), Ali (a.s) and Fatima (a.s).

If holding simple marriage ceremonies, short of rites, is a disgrace and
causes dishonour, then how come these great personalities did that? All
of us know that they were the most honourable of humanity in the whole
of the universe. And no one reaches their status in connection with
honour, respect, nobility and position.

Nevertheless, all of us are aware that the marriage of Hazrat Zahra
(s.a) and Hazrat Ali (a.s) was held in the most simple form, and that
all the expenditure of the dower sum, dowry and household effects and
marriage expenses were procured from the sale of Hazrat Ali’s armoured
jacket. The total expenses totalled nearly thirty thousand Tomans today
(nearly 60 dollars)!!!

Yes, it is true that we do not have the strength to lead a life similar
to those magnanimous ones. But at least we must resemble them and our
life style should have some resemblance with theirs; otherwise, what
does following and taking example mean? If we claim to be their
followers, but our life conduct and morality does

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[1]** Milk price is a certain amount of money taken from the
bridegroom on behalf of the mother's feeding milk to her daughter
(bride) during the bride's infancy.

not have any resemblance with theirs, then the claim would be a lie and
it is a form of hypocrisy.

And likewise, it is true that the form and pattern of life has changed,
e standards of living have gone up and the age has changed. But the
Islamic and human standards and values have definitely not changed at
all and will never change. That is to say, not spending extravagantly,
simplicity in life, not having rivalry and the invalidity of fables and
ceremonies shall always stand; let the society go to any height of
standard.

“All that Mohammad (a.s) made lawful shall be lawful to the resurrection
day, and all that Mohammad (a.s) declared unlawful and illegal shall
remain so to the resurrection day.”

Regretfully, these false ceremonies and wrong rites are a social and
cultural disease, which has affected all of us; and we all are
responsible for it.

O’ fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers! We must believe for sure that
the rites and ceremonies are like the spider’s web, the more they grow,
the more we would become entangled in them, to the extent that they
suffocate, choke and destroy us. The lesser their number, the more
comfortable and at ease would man be.

### A Beautiful Specimen Of Simple Living

Once in the era of Salman’s (r.a) governorship and rule in Madayen, a
flood came and the water gushed into people’s houses, so they rushed to
the mountains and the heights to seek shelter and refuge. Those who had

more luggages to carry were faced with a lot of trouble in taking them
up the heights; so that a few even lost their lives carrying their
household effects.

Hazrat Salman’s (r.a) personal effects were small, including a volume of
the Quran, a sword, a water pot, and a goat skin which was his carpet.
He took them and climbed up the hill without any difficulty. Then he
said: “Such is the way that those who are light gain salvation and those
with a heavy load (of sin) are annihilated and perish.”

For the sake of God, what is the difference if you own a rug instead of
a precious and expensive carpet? What difference would it make if your
house does not have decorations? What stops us from having a simple meal
instead of various costly foods? If honour is in these formalities, then
these personalities are artificial, unimpressive and worthless.

Compare the simple mud house of Ali (who is the chief of the believers
and leader of all human beings - a universal personality) and Fatima
(the chief of the free and honourable women of human history). A house
where Hassan (a.s), Hussain (a.s) and Zainab Kubra (s.a) were brought
up, to the green palace of Moawiyah (Allah’s curse be upon him). Which
one do you love more?

And compare the various and numerous palaces of the shah of Iran
(Allah’s curse be upon him) with the simple, small, rented house of Imam
Khomeini (r.a) (Allah bless him). Which one is dearer, worthier and more
sublime in your view?

“Refer to your souls and address them.”**[1]**

Economic difficulties are decreasing the formalities and ceremonies,
rites and additional expenditures.

“Oh Allah, help the youth in this important matter.”

Second Difficulty:  
 Continuation Of Education
--------------------------

It is quite fortunate that the majority of our youth wish to continue
their studies and do not content themselves with a low level education.
But it should be borne in mind that this positive and lovely practice
may not be followed by negative, disagreeable and displeasing points.
Unfortunately, this nice and pleasing practice has raised disagreeable,
damaging and sometimes tragic problems in our society. This is not due
to the actual matter ‑ that is, continuing education ‑ but it is the
consequence and result of our own faults and wrong styles. It is we
ourselves that have deviated from the useful and sublime phenomenon of
science and education.

### The Real Problem:

To reach higher education, it is necessary for boys and girls to seek
education up to the age of 25 or even beyond. Receiving an education is
considered a constraint to marriage and accepting marital responsibility
and thus is impracticable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[1]** Imam Hussian (a.s).

### Contemplating This Difficulty

Like most of the other hindrances on the way to marriage, this
difficulty or hurdle is also not a real one, rather, it is artificial
and man ‑ made. And it can very easily be removed by proper planning and
working in a calculated manner. Furthermore, marriage can be turned into
stairs and ladders to reach the aim of getting a higher education and
touching the loftier grades of knowledge.

Just as we described in the preface, men and women are the complements
of each other. There has been a capable woman beside every successful
man, and every prosperous woman has had a talented man beside her.

This principle applies to education as well. Many scholars and wise men
achieved success reaching the higher levels of education on account of
the sacrifices, co-operation and co-working of their spouses.

The Prophet (a.s) visited the house of Ali (a.s) and Fatima (s.a) after
they were married. He congratulated the bride and the bridegroom. Then
he addressed Ali (a.s) and said:

“How did you find your wife?” The bridegroom lowered his head and
replied with an innocent modesty:

**نِعْمَ العَونُ عَلى طَاعَةِ الله.**

“My wife is a good companion and helper on the way to Allah’s
obedience.”

Then he (a.s) asked Fatima (s.a) the same question; and she too gave the
same answer, which her husband had given. (Allah’s blessing and peace be
upon this noble

family).

Getting an education is among the most noble duties and services of
Allah in which spouses can help and assist each other and provoke,
stimulate and extend the warmth of hopefulness and can even be, as the
students of theology say, discussion partners of each other!

A peace, tranquillity, spiritual and mental balance is materialised in
the shadow of marriage, which has a positive effect in achieving success
in getting an education.

Some students say: ‘Let us be patient till the time we reach somewhere
in our studies and get our degree. Then we can work to become wealthy
and put our life on track before we marry”. They must take into view
this important point - that they may face spiritual and physical
inconveniences, and after crossing over all those phases, may not have
the health, freshness and fortitude to organise and establish a
prosperous life and enjoy it.

The students of Islamic teachings face this difficulty to a lesser
extent. Most students, although their economical condition is usually
lower than other students, marry nearly on time and continue their
studies as well.

The solution to this difficulty, like the economical problem has two
ways: long term and short term. The long-term solution does not concern
us now; thus let’s turn to the short term one.

Solutions To This Problem
-------------------------

### 1 ‑ To Drive The Thought Out Of One’s Mind That Education Is Not Harmonious With Marriage.

Thought is followed by practice. Thinking that marriage is not possible
whilst continuing education is our fundamental and basic problem in this
regard.

Before anything else, this wrong notion must be driven out of our minds.
If we do that, only then would a suitable solution come to our mind, and
the ground for the solution of this problem be provided.

There does not exist any logical reason or argument to support the fact
that getting education is not concordant with marriage. Instead, if a
correct and right marriage takes place and an equal, matching and
suitable spouse is selected, then it would be a good support for the
continuation of studies, which could help one reach one’s educational
aims. We have observed and experienced this in the lives of many
students of theology and a few others.

Yes, if the spouse of the student (of both sexes, and in all fields of
knowledge) is not equal and well matched, and mental and spiritual
co-ordination does not exist between them, and, they do not go well
together so to speak, undoubtedly, difficulties will come into
existence.

This problem, too, can be solved by minute attentiveness in the
selection of a spouse and observance of its standards and terms, which
shall be described later on.

### 2 ‑ The Religious And Lawful Engagement

Boy and girl students can, through simple preludes, few ceremonies and
less expenditure, lawfully, legally and officially become the spouse of
each other, delaying the ceremonial marriage. They can have mutual
visits and social contacts, and at the same time, continue their studies
and then marry at a suitable time and unite their lives.

In this way, they would remain safe and secure from the deviations and
losses of being single, and also benefit from the peace, comfort and
merits of marital life.

Some people say that when a boy and a girl get engaged, their minds
become distracted and their attentions are diverted from their studies.
This is merely an error.

Instead, if they are engaged, their minds would be more focused, since
the scattered and deviated thoughts would leave their minds. Their minds
and hearts and eyes would be detached and separated from other places
and concentrate and focus upon each other.

On the other side, the enhancement of responsibility about their future
life would make them study better and set up their lives swiftly and
shape an independent life. Of course, we assert and emphasize that the
preliminaries of engagement and marriage must not be very expense
incurring, so as to create a headache. Even if a celebration is to be
held, it must be simple and short of great expense.

Fathers and mothers and elders must be the helpers of the youth, and try
to set the life of the dear ones on track. They should try not to load
their shoulders with any burden and not create hurdles on their way, on
the pretext and with the label of “rites and ceremonies”.

### 3 ‑ Parents’ Help To The Son And The Daughter

Fathers and mothers can play a major role in the marriage of students.
They should help their sons and daughters not only in getting an
education, but also in getting married and in achieving the merits and
profits of the blessing of marriage, thereby remaining safe and secure
from the demerits, loss, damage and risks and corruption of single life.
In this way, parents must think sagaciously and put it this way “What
difference does it make if we, who are bearing the expenses of our son
and daughter, also bear the expenditure of their spouses for a few years
more until the time they complete their education, settle down and start
an independent, separate, self sufficient life? It would be better. So
our dear children would not be lonely and spouseless and become deprived
of the spring of youth and marriage or God forbid, become involved in
deviation, corruption and spiritual and physical diseases.”

If the parents think this way, they would certainly reach the required
result.

Any damage and loss faced by the children would directly affect the
parents who would be responsible for it. And any of their success,
fortune and happiness would be shared by parents. So how nice would it
be

for them to help them out in this important matter for the sake of
Allah’s pleasure and their children’s prosperity and well‑being that is
also their own.

Mothers and fathers and elders of the boys and girls should sit and talk
and reach a common decision by mutual agreement and understanding and
provide a simple respectful life for their children, thus helping and
assisting them to live together and simultaneously continue their
education. So great a reward does this have, that it cannot be put in
black and white.

### 4 ‑ Birth Control

One of the difficulties of marrying during the age of education is the
bearing of children and looking after them.

It is quite easy to solve this problem. One can put constraints upon
bearing a child until the end of one’s educational life with the other’s
consent. There are many easy methods within the scope of religion and
law to stop it. So this cannot also be a hindrance in marriage.

### 5 ‑ Contentment

“Contentment is an unending treasure”**[1]** and a strong support for
all the people, especially married students.

Students and the learned and educated ones who strive and fight to free
themselves and others from the prison and bonds of ignorance and fables
and receive an

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[1]** Nahjul Balagha, Sobhi Saleh, Wisdom 57.

education must not themselves be entangled and involved in fables,
rites, ceremonies, and senseless customs of ignorance.

Brother and sister, study the lives of the learned and successful
persons and see that most of them have been leading simple, contented,
and unceremonious, informal lives. It is not really possible that one
who is involved in extravagance, overspending and formalities make
progress in the fields of knowledge, science, research and industry.
Since, as it has been already said, formalities and rites are like the
spider’s web, which entangles man and restrains his progress and
success.

Take it easy.

### 6 ‑ Cooperation

When both the husband and the wife are students, they must perform the
housework together, not allowing it to be a burden on one person’s
shoulder. Allah has declared a big prize and reward for the husband and
wife who help each other in life’s affairs. The co ‑working enhances
mutual love and warmth of relations. Of course, the husband and the wife
busy receiving an education and knowledge can even help each other in
that field.

How sweet, enjoyable and progressive it can be when two members of a
common life, two partners who have uniformity of aim, objective and
direction, are discussion partners of each other in their studies as
well.

### A Word With Parents In This Regard

It has become a fashion these days that when there is a talk about
engagement and marriage, the parents (particularly those of the girl)
say: “Our child is still studying, her time for marriage has not yet
come!”

Dear parents, this is anti‑Islamic and against intellect and even
against the internal desire and wishes of your children. Did you forget
the time of your own youth? Did you not desire and wish for a spouse
when you were their age?

Principally, you should not have forgotten. So, now why do you oppose
the marriage of these young ones?

Are you aware that any damage done to them will directly hurt you?
Beware and bear in mind that our children, particularly the girls, are
shy to say “We want a spouse”.

They might even apparently refuse it and give a negative answer, but
inside them is a wild turmoil.

Do not put so many hindrances in their path. Do not make all these
excuses. Do not sacrifice them for your own desires. They hold you in
reverence and may say nothing, but this strictness and excuses annoy
them and cause them to pick up a grudge against you. Help them so that
they can marry when young and can achieve and reap the benefit of the
spring of their age and simultaneously study.
