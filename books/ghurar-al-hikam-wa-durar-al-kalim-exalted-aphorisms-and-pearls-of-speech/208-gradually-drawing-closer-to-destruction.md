Gradually Drawing Closer To Destruction
=======================================

**Gradually Drawing Closer to Destruction الاستدراج والمستدرج**

1. Of all people, the person who needs to be most careful is the one who
is most safe from abrupt changes [as this may be a means of gradually
being drawn to his destruction].

2. How many a person is gradually drawn to his destruction through the
good that is done to him.

> 2ـ كَمْ مِنْ مُسْتَدرَج بِالإحْسانِ إلَيهِ.
