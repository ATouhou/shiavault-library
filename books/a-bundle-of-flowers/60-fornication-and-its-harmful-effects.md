Fornication and Its Harmful Effects
===================================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "It is written in the Turah: 'I am Allah, the
killer of murderers and distractor of fornicators."

Al-Kafi, vol. 5, p. 554

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "There are six effects for a fornicator, three
of which are in this world and the other three will be in the next
world. Those that occur in this world are: taking the honour of the
person and defaming the one; causing the one to become poor; and
shortening the length of life, (i.e. hastening one's death). Then, those
which will be in the Hereafter are: the wrath of Allah, graveness in
Reckoning, and residing in Fire eternally."

Al-Kafi, vol. 5, p. 541

The Holy Prophet (S) said again from the Turah:

"O' people, do not commit fornication because your wives will do the
same, too. That which you sow, you will reap." (The same as you do will
be done to you).

Al-Kafi, vol.5, p.554

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "...He who embraces a woman who is unlawful
(haram) to him, will be bound by a chain of fire alongwith Satan and
both will be thrown into Hell."

Man La Yahduruhul Faqih, vol. 4, p. 14

Once, 'Ammar ibn Musa asked Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) about commiting sexual
intercourse with beasts or masterbation by the hand or other limbs of
one's ownself, and he (‘a) replied: "Any form of these kinds and the
like of them by which man pours forth his water, is (considered as)
fornication (and it is unlawful)."

Al-Kafi, vol. 5, p. 541

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Cursed is he, cursed is he who copulates
with beasts."

Al-Kafi, vol. 2, p. 270

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Lesbianism between themselves is (the same
as) fornication."
