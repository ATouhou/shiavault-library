Question 29 : Did Abu-talib Die As a Believer of Islam Such That the Shia Consider It an Honor To Visit His Shrine?
===================================================================================================================

Thus, the prophets household are the companions of the holy Quran and
are introduced as beacons of lights to guide the Muslims all over the
world and these are none other than the twelve holy Imams of the
prophet's household who are the firm protectors of the tradition of the
God's messenger from any fabrication, and are reagrded the bearers of
true knowledge.

The commander of the faithful, Ali bin Abi talib is also mentioned to
have been from the tribe of Bani-Hashim, pointing to another clear
witness for the correctness of the Shias speech, regarding the
recognition of this sacred household; where he said:

"The leaders (imams) from the tribe of Quraish are from the family of
Bani-hashim, others do not have the guardianship over the people and the
ruler ship of the other rulers is but unfounded!"

**Result:**

Of the sum of the mentioned narrations, the visages of both the
realities become crystal clear:


**ANSWER:**

According to the view of the Shias, AbuTalib, the Son of Abdul Muttalib
and the father of the Commander of the faithful, the uncle of the
honorable prophet of Islam is a believer in the message of God and His
prophet, and was a supporter of the Prophet during difficulties and
hardships right from the early period of Islam.

**The Family of Abu talib:**

He was born in the family of 'Abdul-Muttalib', the Prophet's
grandfather who happened to be the hero of the followers of the religion
of Prophet Ebrahim, the friend of God. Abdul-Muttalib never desisted in
worshipping Allah and supporting the truthful religion of unity, and
this is clearly noted throughout the pages of History. It all began when
Abraham came with a heavy army of elephants aiming to destroy the Holy
sanctuary of Kaaba and in the midst of their path; some of the camels of
Abdul-Muttalib were confiscated. At this juncture, Abdul-Muttalib came
and asked Abraham to restore his camels, Abraham retorted:

" Instead of asking back for your camels, why don't you ask that my
army should return back, and Allah's sanctuary, the Holy Ka'aba, not be
destroyed?"

Abdul-Muttalib answered with an overflowing spirit of faith and
reliance towards the Lord that:

"I am the owner of my camels, and this House the 'Ka'aba' has a Lord in
the same manner, for it's protection."

Then Abdul-Muttalib came towards Mecca and reached the holy Ka'aba, and
supplicated to the Lord whilst holding the loop of the door, saying,

"O my Lord, I have no hope whatsoever in anyone but Thou. O Lord!
Protect me from the evil of these enemies, the enemies of the Ka'aba who
are fighting against you, prevent them from destroying your Holy
Sanctuary."

Such eloquent utterances among other similar ones, clarify the
evidences of His worship towards Allah, and his firm faith this is why
'Yaqoobi' in his history writes the following regarding
Abdul-Muttalib:

"He refused to worship idols and was a believer in the one and only
Exalted and Glorious Lord."

Now let us now look at the opinion of Abdul-Muttalib regarding his son,
Abu-Talib:

Abu Talib from the viewpoint of Abdul-Muttalib:

Amidst the pages of History, it is evident that some of the predictors
of clear conscience informed Abdul-Muttalib of the bright future of the
Holy prophet and his prophethood.

When 'Saif bin thi Yazdan' was ruling over Abysinnia, Abdul-Muttalib
who was heading a mission came to meet him, and after presenting him
with an eloquent speech, the commander of Abyssinia gave him the glad
tidings that a dignified Prophet shall be born in his family, then added
to the following regarding the characteristics of the Prophet;

"His Name will be Muhammed (p), His father and mother shall die and
both his grandfather and uncle will take the responsibility of his
guardianship."

Later the king went on giving a detailed description of this prophet
who would come in the future adding that:

"He worships the beneficent God, prevents the Satan, puts off the fires
and destroys the idols. His speech shall be the criterion for
distinguishing right from wrong and his judgment will be based on
justice. He will not only invite the mankind to enact the lawful, but
will also practice it himself, and shall forbid the people from
committing the unlawful and will nullify it."

Then the King said to Abdul-Muttalib:

"Undoubtedly, you are his grandfather."

Abdul-Muttalib after hearing all these glad tidings, immediately went
in prostration to show his gratitude towards the Lord. He mentioned the
story of this blessed child as follows:

"I had a son whom I loved very dearly, in his youth, I arranged his
marriage with an noble lady known as 'Aminah', the daughter of Wahab bin
Abd-Manaf, she then gave birth to a boy whom I named Muhammed, His
parents after some time, died and so both his uncle and I became his
guardians."

According to the above-mentioned statement of Abdul-Muttalib, it
becomes quite evident that Abdul-Muttalib was aware of the bright future
of the orphan child and thus, he planned to assign his guardianship to
his dearest son, Abu-Talib after him and deprived the rest from this
great honor of the guardianship of the Prophet.

Therefore it was only Abu-Talib who was worthy to guard the Holy
Prophet according to the Abdul Muttalib, who was a staunch believer in
the unity of God.

For further explanation, let us go on to mention the proofs of the
faith of Abu Talib:

The Proof Of The faith of Abu-Talib.

**His Library and Scholarly works:**

The Islamic scholars and historians have mentioned beautiful poems of
Abu Talib that cover very high literary scholarly works, and disclose
his true faith. Let us mention some of these:

"Let the noble and great people know that Muhammed is a prophet as was
Prophet Musa and Jesus. He had the same heavenly light which they had;
thus all the divine prophets with God's command guide the people and
prevent them from the unlawful."

"Don't you know that we found Muhammed (p) a prophet as Moses; this was
explained in the heavenly books. People love him and no oppression
should be practiced against the one whom the Mighty Lord has put His
love in the hearts."

"The Glorious Lord has honored his Prophet Muhammed. Therefore, the
most honored creature of God is Ahmad. God had derived the Prophet's
name from His own, wanting to glorify him. Thus, God, the owner of the
throne is Mahmood (the praiseworthy), and his prophet is Ahmad (the very
much praising)"

"O God's messenger, never shall your enemies get to you, not till I
rest in my grave, so don't worry, disclose your mission, give glad
tidings and enlighten the hearts. You called me to your religion and I
know that you are only a well- wisher to me, and also sincere in your
call. I clearly realized that Muhammed's (p) religion is the best of
religions in all of the worlds.

"O God's religion witness upon me, witness to my faith in God's
messenger: Muhammed (p), if others are mislead in religion, I am
guided." Abu-Talib in his last days of his sacred life, adviced the
important figures of the tribe of Quraish to give their full support to
God's messenger and this is clearly witnessed in the following poems
(translated)

"I advice four persons to support the prophet of goodness, my son Ali,
the great man of our tribe: Abbas, God's Lion: Hamza who has always been
the protector of the honored prophet, and my son Jaffer. You-who is my
beloved and I am sacrificed for you- be as the shields towards God's
messenger, before the enemies."

Any impartial and righteous person, by witnessing all these Lovely
poems which states with perfect frankness and lucidity, explaining
Abu-Talib's faith in the Oneness of God and the honorable Prophet's
message, will realize his perfect faith; and will feel remorseful for
the baseless accusations which some writers, with special political
aims, have against the believer of Quraish, God's prophet's uncle and
the protector of the great religion in the most difficult circumstances
of early Islam.

Abu Talibs love and affection towards the Holy prophet shows his faith
in Islam:

All the well-known historians and biographers mention that his unique
devotion to God's messenger clearly states the evidence to the firm
belief that he had.

Abu Talib with the aim of protecting Islam and the Holy Prophet,
preferred three yearof seclusion besides God's messenger in the mountain
pass defile of Abu-talib, to heading Quraish. He stayed with the
Honorable Prophet will the end of the economical siege and bore all the
problems in those unendurable circumstances.

Moreover, he also called his beloved son Ali (p) to have perfect
agreement with the messenger of Allah and to accompany him in all the
difficult circumstances during the early period of Islam. Ibn
Abi-Al-Hadid Al-Mutazali in the commentary of Nahjul-Balagha mentioned
that Abu-Talib addressed his son (p) Ali, of this:

"God's messenger is only calling you to goodness, thus make sure to
always accompany him."

It is clear that all these services of Abu-talib towards the Holy
prophet and his sincere self-sacrifices in the defending of Islam are
the most evident witnesses to his faith.

Therefore, this great Muslim scholar Ibn Al-Hadid said the following
poem regarding the crucial role of Abu-Talib in protecting God's
messenger and His religion.

"If it was not for Abu-Talib and his son, the religion of Islam would
never be settled; the one gave protection to him in Mecca and the other
(his son) immersed in the maelstrom of death (in defense of God's
messenger).

Nobody can ever harm the glory of Abu-talib, neither the ignorant
idle-talker, not those who are aware, pretending of ignorance!" The
final will of Abu Talib shows his faith in that:

The well known historians of Islam such as 'Halabi Shafe-ee' in his
history and 'Muhammed Dayar-bakri' in Tareekh Al-Khamees mentioned the
last speech of Abu-Talib calling his people to the support of the
messenger of Allah saying that:

"O people of Quraish, be the lovers and followers of Muhammed and
support his party (Islam), swearing to God, that whosoever followed his
light of guidance will gain nothing but felicity. If my life would have
continued and death gave me a respite, I would have undoubtedly removed
all his hardships and difficulties. He said this and then passed away.

God's messenger in many occasions glorified his uncle-Abu-Talib- showed
his love to him, that we shall point two instances:
