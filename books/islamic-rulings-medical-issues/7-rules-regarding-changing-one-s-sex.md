Rules Regarding  Changing One’s Sex
===================================

Question 63: What ruling does changing sex from a man to a woman or a
woman to a man by surgery have?

Answer: This surgery, in itself, has no problem, but one must stay away
from forbidden actions that can happen while doing this.

Question 64: What ruling does one’s previous marriage have if a man and
woman get married and then change their sex? If the marriage becomes
invalid does the man have to pay the complete dowry to the woman?

Answer: The marriage would become void. If the couple had intercourse
then the whole dowry must be paid and the ruling of paying half of the
dowry before intercourse is not certain.

Question 65: What ruling does a marriage have if the husband and wife
change sex at the same time?

Answer: It would not be far-fetched that their marriage would remain
valid, but as a precaution they should renew their marriage contract.
