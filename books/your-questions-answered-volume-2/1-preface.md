Preface
=======

In 1972, when questions for the first volume of "Your Questions
Answered" were being edited, it was found that Mr. Dhikiri Omari Mohamed
Kiondo's correspondence with the Mission could form a separate volume of
its own. The result was this Second volume in the series, "Your
Questions Answered", which was edited at that time, though its
publication was delayed.

Mr. Dhikiri Kiondo was born in 1946, at Kwemiinu village (District
Lushoto, Tanga Region, Tanzania). His grandfather was the traditional
Chief of the Wakilindi clan of the Wasambaa tribe. His father was a
farmer and a staunch Muslim of Sunni faith. He did not like to send his
only son to any school as he was afraid that his son would be converted
to Christianity (as was common in those days). As a result he started
his education late. He was enrolled in a Native Administration School
and then was sent to a Qur'anic school, which he left in 1954 owing to
bad health; and then his father died and he could not go back to
school.

In 1955, he was enrolled in a Mission school and completed his Primary,
(1958), Middle (1962) and Secondary (1966) education at various school
run by U.M.C.A. One of his subjects was Bible knowledge. He was selected
for Teachers Training Course at Butimba T. T. College, Mwanza
(1967-68).

It was from Butimba that he wrote his first letter to us, asking 24
questions which showed that he was an intelligent youth eager to learn
the truth about Islam; and also that he was completely in darkness about
Shi'ism. I replied to him and the correspondence continued. In 1969, he
was employed as a teacher in Lushoto District, and at the end of that
year I invited him to embrace the Shia faith (letter No. 16), which he
gladly did (letter No. 19).

We first met in August, 1970, when I went to see him at National
Service camp at Oljoro. Third day he came to Arusha where he was
introduced to Haji Ali Mohamed Jaffer Sheriff and Haji Ahmad Hussein
Sheriff. He refers to this meeting in letter No. 26.

In August, 1973, he was sent by the Mission to Iran to study under the
patronage of 'A Group of Muslim Brothers', Tehran, from where he
returned in September, 1974. In February, 1975, he resigned his teaching
post to become the Administrative Secretary of this Mission. He is
married (2 wives) with 5 children.

The Mission hopes that this booklet will be received as
enthusiastically as the first volume was. The reader will be interested
to note the gradual development of Mr. Dhikiri's questions demonstrating
how he came nearer to us and found the true happiness and peace of mind
that he began searching for when he first wrote to us.

While replying. I always copied his questions in my letters; therefore,
those questions have been omitted from his letters.
