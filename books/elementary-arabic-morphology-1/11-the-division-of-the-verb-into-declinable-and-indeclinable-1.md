The Division of The Verb Into Declinable and Indeclinable 1
===========================================================

35. What do you understand about a declinable verb?

36. What verbs are declinable?

37. What kinds of cases does a verb have?

38. What is the nominative sign of verb?

39. What is the subjunctive sign of a verb?

40. What is the jussive sign of a verb?

35. The cases of a verb are determined by the changing of the end of the
verb due to its placement in a sentence.

36. The only verb that is declinable is the aorist tense. For example:
یَقرَﺃ یَکتُبُ (he is writing, he is reading)  
 37. There are three cases for declinable verbs: the nominative case,
the subjunctive case and the jussive case.

38. The principle of the nominative case is the verb having a *dummah*.

The *nūn* takes the place of the *dummah* in the aorist verbs, which are
every verb in the aorist tense that is connected to:

• the dual *alif*: **یَفعَلانِ تَفعَلانِ**

• the plural *wāw*: **یَفعَلُونَ تَفعَلُونَ**

• the you feminine pronoun (*yā'*): **تَفعَلینَ**

39. The principle of the subjunctive case is the verb having a
*fathah*.  
 The subtraction of the *nūn* takes the place of the fathah in the
aorist verbs. For example: **ﺃن یَفعَلا**

40. The sign of the jussive case in a verb is the *sakūn*.  
 The subtraction of the *nūn* takes the place of the *sakūn* in the
aorist verbs. For example: **لَم یَفعَلا**  
 The subtraction of the weak letter when it is the last root letter of a
weak verb takes the place of a *sakūn*. For example: **لَم یَرمِ** (he
did not throw)
