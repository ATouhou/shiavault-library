Imam Musa Kadhim (as)
=====================

Name: Musa bin Ja'fer.
Titles: Al-Kadhim, Faqih, Aalim, Abdus-Salih-Virtuos slave, Babul
Hawaaij.
Kuniyya: Abu Ibrahim.
Birth: 7th Safar 128 a.h. in Abwa (a place between Mecca and Madina).
Mother: Hamida Al-Barbariyya.
Father: Imam Ja'fer Sadiq (a.s.).

Death: 25th Rajab 183 a.h. Baghdad.
Buried: Kadhmain, Iraq.

**His Parents & Birth**

Mother : Umme Hamida was a slave girl who was brought to Madina and
bought by the 5th Imam for his son for 17 dirhams. The first thing that
he told her was : "You are Hamida (the praised one) in this world and
Mahmuda (praiseworthy) in the hereafter".

When the women of Madina used to come to the 6th Imam to ask masails he
used to send them to Umme Hamida saying: "Her answers will be those
given by me".

Imam Musa Al-Kadhim (a.s.) was born in Abwa (a place between Mecca and
Madina). It is here that Bibi Amina (Prophet Muhammad's (S.A.W.) mother)
is buried. Imam was born when his parents were returning from Mecca. As
soon as he was born he did Sajda reciting Kalima and bearing witness to
the Imaamate of all the other Imams including his own.

**Childhood**

He is one of the Imams whose miracles in childhood are reported
extensively. Imam Ja'fer As-Sadiq (A.S.) repeatedly pointed out Imam
Musa Al-Kadhim (a.s.) as his successor because he knew of the people who
after his death would differ.

(N.B. The Ismailis say Ismail (Imams eldest son who died whilst Imam
Ja'fer Sadiq (a.s.) was still alive) was the 7th Imam. One of the 6th
Imam's other sons - Abdullah also claimed Imaamate.)

Yaqub Al-Saraaj visited the 6th Imam once who told him to greet his son
Musa who was a week old in his cradle. Imam Musa replied to the salaam
and told Yaqub to change his daughters name (Humayra) as it was a name
not liked by Allah.

Safwan (a companion of the 6th Imam) once saw the young Imam Musa
teaching the lamb he was playing with to prostrate to Allah.

Once when Imam was 5 years old, Abu Hanifa came to visit the 6th Imam.
He asked Imam Musa (a.s.): "O son of the Prophet! What is your opinion
about the deeds of man? Does he do them on his own free will or does God
make him do them?".

The 7th Imam replied : "The doings of man can have three possibilities:
God compels a man to do them whilst he is helpless. Both God and man
share the commitment. Man does them alone. If the first is true than God
cannot punish man for sins he did not commit. If the second is true than
too God cannot punish man for he is an equal partner.

Then, we are naturally left with the third, that man is absolutely
responsible for his own doings".

**His Titles**

(These were used to avoid using Imams name as the very mention of it
would lead to arrest, torture, harassment and/or death.)

Babul Hawaaij (Door of fulfilment of needs). Even after his death
people have their needs fulfilled and do not return empty handed from
his shrine (Ask especially for cure of physical illnesses, especially
eyes).

Kadhim (One who swallows his anger). Imam Musa (a.s.) lived in an era
when the rulers were the cruellest ever. Their hatred for the Ahlul Bayt
and their followers was intense. Imam's followers were constantly
harassed and tortured. The last 19 years of his life was spent in
prison. Despite all these hardships, he was always patient spending
entire nights in the worship of Allah. His character even converted the
prison wardens towards him.

**His Life & Works (Imamate)**

When his father was martyred (poisoned by the ruler Mansur Dawanaqi),
Mansur asked the governor of Madina to behead all the trustees Imam had
left. The governor (called Sulayman) wrote back to say that the 6th Imam
had left 5 trustees of whom he (Mansur) was the first and Sulayman the
second followed by Abdullah, Umme Hamida and Imam Musa (a.s.). Mansur
kept quiet.

After the 6th Imam's death Mansur encouraged the Ismaili sect to
develop although he knew that Ismail had died 20 years before. At the
same time the 6th Imam's other son Abdullah claimed Imamate (however he
only lived 17 days after that).

Mansur was busy building Baghdad after that (although the torture and
killing of the followers of Ahlul Bayt continued) and left Imam Musa
(a.s.) for a while in which Imam had a little time to teach true Islam.
When Mansur died his son Mahdi came to power in 158 a.h. He increased
the atrocities on the family and followers of Ahlul Bayt. Imam Musa
(a.s.) advised his followers to practise Taqiyya (meaning not to show
ones faith outwardly). Mahdi called Imam to Baghdad and imprisoned him
releasing him after a while.

After Mahdi came his son Musa who assumed the title Haadi. He only
ruled for 15 months but the atrocities continued.

After the death of Haadi came his brother Harun Rashid. It was he who
introduced Backgammon, Chess and Music as Islamic culture (they are
Haraam). Harun was told of the popularity of Imam Musa (a.s.) by
Muhammad bin Ismail (Imam's nephew) and about the collection of khums.

Harun was furious and wanting to prove his relationship to the Prophet
went to the Prophets grave and greeted the Prophet addressing him as his
uncle. Imam Musa (a.s.) was there and he addressed the Prophet as his
grandfather. Imam then asked Harun that if the Prophet were to come and
ask Harun for his daughters hand in marriage would he agree? Harun said
"Yes". Imam said "That is the difference between you and me - my
daughter would be haraam for the Prophet (mahram)".

Harun had Imam arrested in the Prophet's mosque whilst Imam was
praying. He was handcuffed and shackled and sent to Basra. A similar
caravan was sent to Baghdad to fool Imam's followers. Imam was put into
prison under the custody of Isa bin Ja'fer. After a year Isa wrote to
Harun saying he could no longer imprison Imam as he could find only
piety and righteousness in him.

Harun had Imam moved to Baghdad under the custody of Fadhl bin Rabi who
too became a follower of Imam. The prisons were so small that there was
no room to stand and the food was a cup of water and two pieces of dry
bread a day. Imam remained patient.

Harun also hired people to kill Imam (It is reported that they were
from England). They too on seeing Imam cried and refused to murder him
even though they were paid to do so. Harun finally moved Imam in the
care of Sindi bin Shahak (a very cruel man). Imam remained in prison for
the last 19 years of his life.

The 19 years of imprisonment gave the Shia population a little relief
as the rulers concentrated on Imam. It enabled the Shias to disperse
from Arabia to Iran, India etc. thus spreading Islam and it was one of
the factors towards the popularity of the 8th Imam.

**Summary of his Life Works**

In a situation in which the family and followers of the Ahlul Bayt were
being murdered and tortured Imam taught the true word of Allah. Through
his character and piety he showed the meaning of tabligh living up to
the hadith of the 6th Imam:

"Acquire a true Muslim character and that shall spread Islam".

In 183 a.h. Sindi had Imam killed with poisoned dates. Another
narration says Imam was wrapped in a carpet and he was suffocated and
stamped on. His body was left on the bridge of Baghdad and an
announcement was made for all to come and see him.

N.B. It was a ploy to encourage Shias to come out in anger so they
could be identified.

When Harun Rashid's brother Sulayman heard of this he was furious and
arranged for his burial in a Quraysh cemetery outside Baghdad (the 8th
Imam gave ghusl and kafan). A town grew around the tomb of Imam called
Kadhmain (meaning the two Kadhims) since the 9th Imam is also buried
there.

His Children He had 19 sons & 18 daughters. The most famous of his sons
is his successor, Imam Ali Ar-Ridha (a.s.) and the most famous of his
daughters is Fatima Kubra known as Masuma Qum who is buried in Qum.

Imam Mohammad Taqi (as)
Name: Muhammad bin Ali.
Titles: At-Taqi, Al-Jawad.
Kuniyya: Abu Ja'fer.
Birth: 10th Rajab 195 a.h. Madina.
Mother: Sabika (also known as Khaizarun).
Father: Imam Ali Ridha (a.s.)
Death: 29th Dhulqa'da 220 a.h. Baghdad.
Buried: Kadhmain.

His Parents & BirthHe was the only son of Imam Ali Ridha (a.s.) The
Prophet (S.A.W.) had said: "My father be sacrificed on the mother of the
9th Imam who will be a pure and pious Nubian."

Imam Musa Kadhim (A.S.) had told one of his companions that his
daughter-in-law (Sabika) would be one of the most pious of women and to
give her his salaams. She came from the same tribe as the Prophet's
wife - Mary Copt who bore the Prophet his son Ibrahim (who died in
infancy).

Imam Muhammad Taqi (a.s.) was born when his father was 45 years old.
Till then Imam Ali Ridha (a.s.) had constantly been taunted that he had
no children. When the 9th Imam was born, a brother of Imam Ali Ridha
(a.s.) was angry because he would lose out in inheriting the Imam's
property and in his jealousy spread a rumour that Imam Ali Ridha (a.s.)
was not the father. He was eventually proved wrong by a person who could
tell parentage.

**Childhood**

The 9th Imam was 5 years old when his father was called to Baghdad by
Mamun Rashid to be his 'heir apparent'. When Imam Ali Ridha (a.s.) was
leaving he saw his son putting sand in his hair. He asked why and the
young Imam replied that this was what an orphan did.

**His titles, life & works**

He became an Imam at the age of 9. Mamun Rashid thought that as all the
rulers before him had oppressed the Imams and their schemes had
backfired that he would try to bribe the Imams. He tried to make the 8th
Imam his heir apparent and give him power and wealth but that also
backfired.

He now tried to use power and wealth with the 9th Imam again but from a
much younger age thinking that he would be able to influence him. His
main purpose was also to make sure that the 12th Imam (whom he knew
would bring justice to the world) would be from his progeny and
therefore intended to give his daughter Ummul Fadhl to the Imam for a
wife. Mamun still continued oppressing the family and followers of the
Ahlul-bayt (a.s.).

Mamun called the young Imam (a.s.) to Baghdad from Madina and offered
his daughter. This infuriated his family (Banu Abbas). To prove to them
the excellence of Imam even at a young age he arranged a meeting between
Imam and the most learned of men at that time - Yahya bin Athkam.

It was a grand occasion with some 900 other scholars present. Imam
(a.s.) was first asked by Yahya:

What is the compensation (kaffara) for a person in Ehraam who hunted
and killed his prey?" Imam replied that there were many more details
required before he could answer the question: Did the Muhrim (one in
Ehraam) hunt in the haram or outside?

Did the Muhrim know Sharia or not?

Did he hunt intentionally or not?

Did he hunt for the first time or was this one of many times?

Was he free or a slave?

Was his prey a bird or an animal?

Was it big or small?

Had he hunted by day or by night?

Was he baligh or not?

Was he repentant or not?

Was his ehraam for Hajj or Umra?

Yahya was stunned. He looked down and started sweating.

Mamun asked the young Imam to answer the question, which he did, and
then Imam asked Yayha a question which he could not answer. The Banu
Abbas admitted defeat and Mamun took the opportunity to offer his
daughter in marraige to Imam. Imam (a.s.) read his own Nika (the khutba
of which is used today) with the Mehr of 500 dirhams.

Imam wrote a letter to Mamun that he would also give Ummul Fadhl Mehr
from the wealth of Aakhira. This was in the form of 10 duas which were
for fulfilling any hajaat (desires) [Chain of narrators upto Prophet -
Jibrail - Allah]\* . Thus his title Al-Jawad (the generous one).

\* These duas are found in Mafatihul Jinaan (pg 447 - In margin)

Imam lived for a year in Baghdad with Ummul Fadhl. She was very
disobedient to Imam. When she found out that Imam had another wife (from
the progeny of Ammar-e-Yasir) and that there was also children she was
jealous and angry realizing that her father's plan had failed. She
complained to her father who also realized that his plan, to keep the
12th Imam in his progeny, had failed. He was enraged and in his rage he
drank heavily and went to the 9th Imam's house and attacked Imam with a
sword.

Both Ummul Fadhl and a servant saw the attack and believed Imam was
dead. Mamun on waking next morning realized the consequences of his
attack and was thinking of arranging the disposal of Imam's body when he
saw Imam well without a scratch on him. He was confused and asked Imam
who showed him an amulet which is called Hirze Jawad Imam told him it
was from his grand mother Bibi Fatima Zahra (a.s.) and kept the wearer
safe from all except the angel of death. Mamun asked Imam for it and
Imam gave him one.

Now Mamun was scared and tried a new tactic. He tried to deviate Imam
by sending him beautiful girls and musicians. When he realised nothing
was working he let Imam return to Madina.

Imam used this time to prepare the masails of Taqleed and Ijtihaad in
preparation for the 12th Imam knowing that both the 10th and the 11th
Imam would spend most of their lives in prison. He also prepared the
people of Madina teaching true Islam knowing that this would be the last
time they would be able to receive guidance directly from an Imam for a
long time.

Ummul Fadhl continuously complained of Imam to her father who sent her
letters back.

Mamun died in 218 a.h. and was succeeded by his brother Mo'tasam
Billah. He openly announced that all Shias were not Muslims. He said it
was required for people to kill and prosecute Shias, and to destroy
property belonging to Shias.

Ummul Fadhl now started complaining to her uncle who was sympathetic to
her. Mo'tasam called Imam to Baghdad. He asked Imam to pass judgement of
how to punish a thief. Imam said only fingers could be cut as the palms
were for Allah (as in Qur'an - it is one of the wajib parts to touch the
ground during sajda). As this decision was contrary to the decision of
the other 'Ulema' it strengthened the position of the Shias. The other
'Ulema' complained to Mo'tasam.

**Death & Burial**

With instigation from both the 'Ulema' and Ummul Fadhl, Mo'tasam sent
poison which Ummul Fadhl put in Imam's drink and gave it to him. Imam
died on 29th Dhulqa'ada at the age of 25 years and is buried near his
grandfather in Kadhmain. His son the 10th Imam, Imam Ali un Naqi (a.s.)
gave him ghusl and kafan.

**Summary of Imam's Work**

It is he who prepared and wrote books for the masails of Ijtihaad and
Taqleed which were essential to prepare believers for the ghaibat of the
12th Imam.

**Additional Notes**

Once when the young Imam was on his way to Baghdad he came across
Mamun's party returning from a hunting trip. All the other children on
the street ran but the Imam did not.

Mamun asked the young Imam, "Why did you not run away?" Imam said the
road was wide enough for all of them and neither had he committed a sin.
Mamun then asked him his identity.

After finding out, he asked Imam what he (Mamun) had in his hands. Imam
replied "Allah has created tiny fish in the river. These fish are hunted
by the Hawks of the kings and the descendants of the Prophets reveal the
secrets".

**Imam Al-Mahdi (as)**

Imam al-Mahdi (a.s) was born on the 15th Sha'ban 255 A.H. in Samarra,
Iraq. He became the Imam when his father was Martyred in 260 A.H. Imam
al-Mahdi (a.s) was only 5 years old when he went into ghaibat'
(concealment). The Imam's ghaibat was divided into two periods:
Ghaibat-us-Sughra and Ghaibat-ul-Kubra.

Ghaibat-us-Sughra Ghaibat-us-Sughra means the minor concealment.' Its
period was about 70 years. It began in 260 A.H. when Imam al-Mahdi (a.s)
first went into concealment, and ended in 328 A.H.

During Ghaibut-us-Sughra, the Imam appointed some agents to represent
him and the people. The Imam had four agents. After the death of the
fourth agent, the Imam went into major concealment (Ghaibut-ul-Kubra).
This was on the 10th Shawal 329 A.H.

**The Signs Heralding the Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a.s)**

Prophet Muhammed (s.a.w.) has said:

"Even if the entire duration of the world's existence has already been
exhausted and only one day is left before Doomsday, Allah will expand
that day to such length of time as to accommodate the kingdom of a
person from my Ahlul-Bayt who will be called by name. He will fill out
the earth with and justice as it will have been full of injustice and
tyranny (by then)"

From this Hadith, it is clear to every Muslim that the twelfth Imam
will reappear when this world is full of sins and injustice.

There are many signs mentioned by the Masumeen (a.s) on the
reappearance of the 12th Imam. It is reported in Biharul Anwar that
after the last pilgrimage the Prophet made, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.)
stood near the Kaaba, and called his people to listen to him. The
Prophet said: "listen to me carefully so that you transmit these words
of mine to those who are absent today." The Prophet began, "My people, a
time will come when kings and rulers will be tyrannical." The Prophet
also said that the payment of Zakat will be stopped.

According to the Masumeen (a.s), Muslim countries will seek aid from
non Muslim countries. This is already evident in a number of Muslim
countries. Another prediction that is come true is that 60 impostors
will claim to be Prophets. By their attractiveness, their persuasion,
and their personality, they will misguide the people.

58 false Prophets have already emerged since the days of the Prophet
(s.a.w.). We have only two more to witness. It is reported in
Qayamat-e-Sughra citing "Oqdatud-Durr" that Hazrat Amir (A.S) has said
that the Mahdi will not appear until one-third of the world population
will die by being killed and one-third will die as a result of
epidemics.

**The Last Signs Heralding the Appearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a.s)**

There is a Hadith from Imam Muhammed Baqir (a.s) that for three or
seven consecutive days, one will see reddish yellow fire raging in the
East.

Sufiani will emerge in Palestine, where he will start a revolt in the
month of Rajab. He will be an uncompassionate rebel and his rule will
last for eight consecutive months. He will conquer and rule Egypt for
four consecutive months. Sufiani will conquer Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco,
Jordan, and Syria. Sufiani has been specifically described by Aimma A.S.
as an ugly, blistered, green-eyed, cross-eyed person who will be an
enemy of the friends of the Ahlul-Bait.

Imam Ali (a.s) has said that Sufiani's hatred of the devotees of the
Ahlul-Bait will be such that any person named Ali, Fatema, Hassan,
Hussein, Zainab, Ruquaiya will be arrested and beheaded straight away
without further investigations. Sufiani will rip the Mimber of the Holy
Prophet (s.a.w.). The holy house of the Prophet which contains his grave
will be pulled and used as a stable. Horses will be tied in that Holy
place.

Sufiani will then decide to attack Makka. His purpose would be to
demolish the Holy Kaaba and kill the entire population of Makka.
Sufiani's army will set out via Baghdad but, as Allah would have it,
when they get between Medina and Makka, in the desert of Baida, suddenly
one night they will hear a voice from the sky which will say, "O Baida
eat up the entire army of Sufiani." It is said that the entire army
numbering 100,000 persons will be swallowed up by the earth, except for
two. The two who will be spared will suddenly encounter an angel. He
will slap both of them turning their faces right round, looking behind
instead of front.

And that will be the time when Imam al-Mahdi (a.s) will already have
reappeared in Makka. The Imam will establish his authority in the Holy
Mosque at Makka in the Haram. The angel will then order one of them
calling him Bashir. "O Bashir, go straight to Makka, into the Haram and
inform the Imam that Sufiani's army has been swallowed up by the land.
The other called Nazir will be ordered to go to Sufiani and tell him
that the Imam has already appeared. He should proceed straight to Makka
and declare allegiance to him.

Sufiani will prepare to attack the Imam but will not have enough
courage. The Imam will catch Sufiani in Jerusalem and will kill him.

Imam Ali (a.s) has said that nine definite signs will precede the
emergence of Hazrat Mahdi (a.s). These nine signs are: Dajaal will
emerge. A loud voice will be heard from the sky. Sufiani will appear and
wage a fierce war. The army of Sufiani will be swallowed by a sudden
opening of the land between Makka and Medina in the desert of Baida.

A revered wise saint will be murdered in Makka. (This saint is to be a
Hashimite descent.) A Seyyid descendant of Imam Hassan (a.s) will emerge
with his army. The army of Seyyid-e-Hassan and an image of a man will
appear in the sky opposite the sun. There will be two eclipses in the
holy month of Ramadhan contrary to the normal order and calculation and
the eclipse of the moon. On three occasions a loud voice from the sky
will be heard in the holy month of Ramadhan.

The Reappearance Hazrat Isa, Hazrat Khizr, Hazrat Ilias, and Hazrat
Idris (a.s) will give allegiance to the Imam when he reapers. Also
Jibrael will announce 313 companions of the Imam. These 313 companions
will be people of eminent piety, great knowledge and absolutely
steadfast in their determination and faith towards the Imam.

Another 1000 people will be in the army of the Imam. These people will
fight battles and kill enemies like Dajal, who will appear from India.
Dajal will have the musical tunes with him. Then the Imam will lead the
prayers, Hazrat Isa (a.s) will be behind him.

Lets all pray for the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a.s).
