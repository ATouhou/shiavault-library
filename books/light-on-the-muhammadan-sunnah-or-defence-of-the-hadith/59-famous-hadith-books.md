Famous Hadith Books
===================

I have stated earlier that sorts of hadith (al-ahad) being: sahih, hasan
(good) and da'if (weak), presenting samples of their utterances about
the sahih, as it was out of scope to mention all of their sayings due to
their abundance. And since they claim that the well-known books
containing all these sorts being: al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud,
al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasa\`i, so we should discuss briefly every one of
these books. For sake of benefit, I found it better to talk about the
book al-Muwatta' of al-Imam Malik, as it is the only book left for us
from among the books written down during the 2nd century, and his author
being of high status and having a famous school of thought. Also I shall
discuss Musnad Ahmad due to its fame and its author's having a madhhab
followed by a large number of Muslims.

I will start by discussing al-Muwatta' as it preceded all these books in
time and compilation.
