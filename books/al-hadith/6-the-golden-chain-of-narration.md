The Golden Chain of Narration
=============================

Because of being the trusted Prophet's family and the most learned, the
narrations of Ahlul Bayt were often referred to as the Golden Chain of
Narration. Ahlul Bayt's care in transmitting, and their meticulousness,
and righteousness made people flock to them for quotes of Hadith, taking
them as examples, and writing numerous books about Hadith, Fiqh,
Ah'kaam, Halal and Haram among other subjects. The Shi'a believe that
the Imams were Divinely Commissioned, therefore they were Ma'soom,
meaning safeguarded by Allah from:

\* Religious error,
\* Sin, and
\* Forgetfulness.

Therefore, to the Shi'a the narration of the Imams was binding, their
teaching binding, and the Hadith they narrated was the only one
acceptable to them. If the Hadith in the Sihaah Al-Sittah (Sunni) is
confirmed by the Hadith from one of the Imams, then that Hadith is
acceptable, otherwise it would be questionable.

Each Imam used to say: "My Hadith is the Hadith of my father, and his
is the Hadith of his father, up to Ali, who directly narrated the Hadith
from Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)."
