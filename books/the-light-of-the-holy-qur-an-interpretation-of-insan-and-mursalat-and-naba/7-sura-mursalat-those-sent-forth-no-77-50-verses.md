Sura Mursalat (those Sent Forth) No.77 (50 Verses)
==================================================

**In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful**

**Contents of the Sura:**

This Sura belongs to the early Meccan period and its name, Mursalat is
taken from the first verse. After making some oaths, the text refers to
the horrors of the Hereafter for those who reject the Truth.The refrain,
Ah woe, that Day to the Rejecters of Truth is repeated ten times in the
Sura and every time follows a new topic.

In addition to the oaths, the Sura gives some information about the
fervent Hereafter and its grievous events, and then repeats the same
refrain: Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth.

In the second stage, we learn about the woeful story of the sinners of
past generations.

In the third stage, it lets us know a little about the creation's
specialties.

In the fourth stage, we are informed of some divine Blessings on the
Earth.

In the fifth stage, there are some messages in which the rejecters are
warned of their painful penalty.

In every stage there is also a hint to an enlightening point and then
the refrain follows. Sometimes, the blessings of just men are mentioned
to show that both rewards and penalties are found, hut the former is
used for justification and the latter is for warning.

The refrain, in this Sura, has an association with the refrain in sura
Rahman, No. 55, but with the difference that: Sura Rahman speaks about
the Blessings, but Sura Mursalat describes the rejecters' punishments.

**The Virtue of Studying this Sura:**

It is narrated from the Prophet (p.b.u.h.) that: One who studies Sura
Mursalut will be registered as a non-pagan.(1)

Another narration from Imam Sadiq (p.b.u.h.) cites that: if one studies
this Sura, Allah makes him familiar to Mohammad (p.b.u.h.) ". (2)

This reward is certainly for a person who studies it, thinks it over
and acts accordingly. So, we see by a narration that some of the
Prophet's close friends told him: "Oh Mohammad, how soon you have grown
old!" He answered: "Hud, Vaqi'ah, Mursalat, and Nabaa brought old age
upon me. (3)

It is worth considering that in all these Suras the circumstances of
the Hereafter and the horrors of the Resurrection Day and Great Judgment
are illustrated; and are the very things that affected the Prophet's
(p.b.u.h.) holy soul.

Obviously, reading without thinking and acting cannot be very
fruitful.
