Absence of Grammatical Conjunction
==================================

In addition, there does not exist any grammatical conjunction (*Harf
‘Atf*, and in the Arabic language, these tools are used to connect two
sentences or phrases, or add them together; such tools include *wa,
thumma, fa*, etc.) before the purification verse which would connect it
with the statement before it. Neither do we find any indication
whatsoever that this verse is a continuation to the one before it.

For example, Allah (SWT) does not say *“And* *Allah only wants to keep
away the uncleanness from you…”* (*Wa* inama yureedh Allah leyudh-heb
‘ankom al-regs), or *“So, Allah only wants to keep the uncleanness from
you…”* (Fa inama yureedh Allah leyudh-heb ‘ankom al-regs), or “Allah
only wants by that to keep the uncleanness from you…” (Inama yureedh
Allah bedhalek leyudh-heb ‘ankom al-regs).

If Allah (SWT) stated any of that, the case would have been different
and it would have been possible for the wives to be the ones addressed
and referred to in the purification verse. But the absence of these
grammatical tools of addition and connection indicates that individuals
other than the wives are being addressed and referred to by this holy
verse.
