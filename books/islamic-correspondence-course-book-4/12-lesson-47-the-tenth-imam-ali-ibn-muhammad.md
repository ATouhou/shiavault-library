Lesson 47 : the Tenth Imam (‘ali Ibn Muhammad)
==============================================

**1. Birth & Early Years**

Imam ‘Ali an-Naqi (also known as al-Hadi), was the son of the ninth
Imam. He was born on 15th Dhil Hijja in 212/827 in Sarya, outside
Medina. At the age of eight in 220, he became the Imam. After having
seen his father’s example, the Shi’a community had no more problems in
accepting such a young Imam.

**2. Rulers of the Time**

The thirtythree years of imamate of Imam ‘Ali an-Naqi coincided with
the caliphate of the following six caliphs Mu’tasim bin Harun, Wathiq
bin Mu’tasim, Mutawakkil bin Mu’tasim, Muntasir bin Mutawakkil,
Musta’in, and Mu’tazz bin Mutawakkil. Wathiq bin Mu’tasim had a very
promiscuous lifestyle, and had no time to harass the Shi’as and the
Imams of the Ahlul Bayt.

During his caliphate, a large number of the descendants of Imam ‘Ali
(a.s.) had settled in Samarra, the ‘Abbasid capital. But the peaceful
days for the ‘Alids and the Imam did not last long. After Wathiq, his
brother Mutawakkil, came to power. Mutawakkil was the most cruel of all
the ‘Abbasid caliphs; he is comparable to Yazid bin Mu’awiyah of the
Umayyads.

Mutawakkil, on the one hand, started promoting the Shafi’i madhhab in
order to distract the masses away from the Ahlul Bayt. And, on the other
hand, he intensified harassment of the Shi’as.

He had such hatred for the Ahlul Bayt that in 236 A.H. he ordered the
grave of Imam Husayn (a.s.) be leveled to the ground, and that the
surrounding area be transformed into farmlands so that no trace of the
grave be left.

This all was done to stop the Shi’as from visiting (ziyarat) the graves
of Imam Husayn (a.s.) and the other martyrs of Karbala. But when Allah
wishes to protect His “light” no human can do anything about it!

The attempt to erase all traces of Imam Husayn’s grave angered many
Muslims; people starting writing anti-’Abbasid slogans on the walls.
Opposition poets also expressed their feelings on this issue. A famous
poem against Mutawakkil is given below:

By Allah, if the Umayyids unjustly killed
Husayn, son of the Prophet’s daughter,
his cousins9 have committed a similar crime
for I swear that Husayn’s grave has been erased.
It seems that they regret for not participating
in the massacre, so they now go after the grave!
Mutawakkil enjoyed torturing the followers of the Ahlul Bayt;

even the persons appointed by him as governor in Medina and Mecca were
instructed to prevent people from being kind and courteous towards the
Ahlul Bayt.

In 234 A.H., Mutawakkil ordered Imam ‘Ali an-Naqi (a.s.) to be brought
from Medina to Samarra where he was placed in a house next to the
caliph’s garrison. The Imam lived under constant surveillance until
Mutawakkil was murdered by his own troops at the instigation of his own
son, Muntasir.

9 That is. the ‘Abbasids who desend from ‘Abbas, the Prophet’s uncle.
Muntasir bin Mutawakkil reversed the policies of his father towards the
Ahlul Bayt (a.s.); he was kind and generous to them; he returned the
property of Fadak to the descendants of Imams Hasan and Husayn (a.s.).
Unfortunately his caliphate did not last for more than six months when
he died in 248 A.H.

Musta’in came to power after Muntasir and continued the oppressive
policies of his ancestors. But soon his own Turkish troops rebelled
against him and pledged allegiance to Mu’tazz bin Mutawakkil whom they
rescued from prison. Finally, Musta’in was killed and Mu’tazz become the
caliph.

It was during the reign of Mu’tazz bin Mutawakkil that Imam ‘Ali
an-Naqi was martyred by poisoning.

**3. Two Companions of the Imam**

One of the most distinguished of all the companions of Imam ‘Ali
an-Naqi was ‘Abdul ‘Azim al-Hasani (a descendant of Imam Hasan) whose
grave outside the city of Tehran has become a famous place for
visitation (ziyarat). ‘Abdul ‘Azim had met and heard ahadith from the
companions of the sixth, seventh and eight Imams; and he himself has
narrated many ahadith from the ninth and tenth Imams.

Abu Hammad Razi narrates that once Imam ‘Ali an-Naqi

(a.s.) told him that “whenever you have religious problems, go to
‘Abdul ‘Azim and also convey my salaams to him.”

Once ‘Abdul ‘Azim al-Hasani came to Imam ‘Ali an-Naqi (a.s.) and said,
“O son of the Prophet! I would like to describe my faith to you so that
if you agree with it then I will stay firm upon it till the last moment
of my life.” When the Imam gave his approval, ‘Abdul ‘Azim described his
faith as follows:

“I believe that God is One; there is nothing like Him; He is free from
ibtal (i.e., saying that He is ‘nothing’) and tashbih (i.e., comparing
Him to a created thing). Allah has no body or figure; neither is He
substance nor form; intead, He is the creator of body and figure, and of
substance and form. He is the creator and sustainer of everything.

“I believe that Muhammad (s.a.w.) is a servant and prophet of God, and
His last Messenger. There will be no prophet, shari’ah or religion after
him till the day of judgement.

“I believe that the Imam and successor of Prophet

Muhammad (s.a.w.) was ‘Ali bin Abi Talib (a.s.), and after him Hasan,
then Husayn, ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn, Muhammad bin ‘Ali,

Ja’far bin Muhammad, Musa bin Ja’far, ‘Ali bin Musa,

Muhammad bin ‘Ali, and then you are my master.”

Imam ‘Ali an-Naqi (a.s.) then said, “After me, my son Hasan,

will be the Imam. How do you think the people will react in regard to
Hasan’s son [i.e., the Mahdi]?”

‘Abdul ‘Azim: “O my master! How will he [i.e., Hasan’s son] be?”

Imam an-Naqi (a.s.): “He will not be seen; and mentioning his name is
not permissible until he rises and fills the earth with justice just as
it would be filled with injustice and tyranny.” ‘Abdul ‘Azim then
continued: “I testify that their [i.e., Imams] friend is God’s friend;
and their enemy is God’s enemy; obeying them is obedience to God; and
disobeying them is disobeying God.

“I believe in the mi’raj, the questioning in the grave, paradise, hell,
the path (sirat), the scale—all these are truth. I believe that the day
of judgement is sure to come without any doubt, and that God will
resurrect the dead people.

“I believe that my religious obligations after wilayah (love and
obedience to the Imams) are prayers, alms-giving, fasting, pilgrimage to
Mecca, jihad, bidding good and forbidding evil.”

Imam ‘Ali an-Naqi (a.s.) said, “O Abul Qasim! By Allah, this is the
same religion that Allah has chosen for His servants! So remain firm on
it; and may Allah keep you steadfast on this truth.” Musa bin ‘Abdullah
an-Nakha’i was another learned companion of the Imam.

Once he went to the Imam and requested him for a comprehensive ziyarat
he could use to recite whenever he visits the graves of any of the Imams
of Ahlul Bayt. This ziyarat became famous as Ziyarat-e Jami’a whose
selected parts are presented below:

“...May peace be upon you O the People of the house of prophethood, the
source of messengership, the people on whom angels descend and where
revelation used to come down; the family which is the source of mercy,

custodians of knowledge, peaks of forbearance, foundations of
generosity, leaders of nations, masters of blessings, the cream of pious
people, pillars of kindness, leaders of people...doors of iman, trustees
of the Merciful God, family of prophets and messengers, and descendants
of the best of those chosen by the Lord of the Universe...

“May peace be upon the Imams of guidance, lamps in the darkness, signs
of piety, those who possess wisdom and intelligence, the refuge for
people, the heirs of prophets, the best of examples...the proofs of God
upon the people of this world and the hereafter...

“I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, He has no partner just
as Allah has declared it Himself and so have the angels and the
knowledgeable among His servants. There is no god but He, the Powerful,
the Wise.

I bear witness that Muhammad is His chosen servant and a messenger with
whom He is pleased, and whom He has sent with guidance and the religion
of truth so that He may give victory to it over all religions even if
the polytheists dislike it.

“I bear witness that you are the rightly-guided leaders, the
infallibles, the respected ones, those who are closest to Allah, the
pious, the truthful, the chosen ones; those who are obedient to Allah,
who are firm in His command, who act according to His wish, who have
attained His respect. Allah has chosen you by His knowledge, and He has
chosen you for His [knowledge of the] unseen and His secret...

“One who turns away from you has gone out of religion; one who stays
with you reaches the religion; and one who lowers you from your status
is lost.

The truth is with you, in you, from you, towards you—you are its owners
and custodians...One who loves you, loves Allah; one who hates you,
hates Allah; one who seeks refuge with you has sought refuge with
Allah...

“O Allah! If I could find any intercessors closer to You than Muhammad
and his good progeny, the pious Imams, I would have made them my
intercessors. [But there is no one closer to you than Muhammad and his
family.]

So by the right that You have given to them over Yourself, I pray to
You to include me among those who truly know them and their rights,
among those on whom You have showered mercy through their intercession.
You are indeed the most merciful of all. And may Allah send His
blessings upon Muhammad and his pure progeny. Indeed Allah is sufficient
for us and He is the best of agents.”
