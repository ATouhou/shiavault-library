2. The Ethos Of Prophet Sheth
=============================

Introduction
------------

Sheth (Gift of Allah) was the executor of Adam’s will, who was born five
years after Abel was killed by Cain:235 years after the fall of Adam. He
was the offspring of Adam from his issue and Jafeth (Yefith) who were
brethren. Thursday afternoon, God Almighty sent a Houri for Sheth and
the next day another Houri for Jafeth. When those Houris married Sheth
and Jafeth, a son from the former and a daughter from the latter were
born. These two cousins — Sheth’s son and Jafeth’s daughter — got
married later on and thus Adam’s generation multiplied.

According to Nasekh At-Tawarikh, the marriage between brother and sister
is completely rejected.

Sheth was residing in Mecca where he constantly performed major and
minor Hajj. He founded Ka’aba with mud and stone. Getting sick, Sheth
appointed his son, Anoosh as executor of his will and eventually passed
away at the age of 912 and was buried alongside his parents in the Cave
of Abo-Ghabais.

Teaching Of Divine Injunctions
------------------------------

God appointed Sheth as Prophet and sent him fifty books containing signs
precepts, injunctions. Traditions and limits. Sheth used to live in
Mecca teaching those books to Adam’s children.

وَ نبَأَ اللّه شَيئًا وَأَنْزَلَ عَليهِ خَمسينَ صَحيفَةً فيها دلائلُ
اللّه وفَرَائضهُ وَأَحْكَامَهُ وسُنَنَهُ وشَرائِعهُ وَحدُودُهُ،
فَأَقَامَ بِمكَّةَ يَتْلُو تِلْكَ الصُّحُفِ عَلى بَني آدَمَ
وَيعلِمُها.

Piety

Getting sick, Sheth called his son, Anoosh, making his will and
enjoining him to piety (fear of Allah).
