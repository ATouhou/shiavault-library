Lineage Of Imam Mahdi (aj)
==========================

The Holy Prophet (S) said,

"Al Mahdi is from us, Ahlul Bayt."[^1]

The Holy Prophet (S) said,

"Certainly, Ali Ibne Abi Talib Alaihis salaam is the Imam of my ummat
and my vicegerant upon them after me. And of his sons is Al Qaem, Al
Montazar. One, through whom Allah will fill the earth will justice and
equity like it would have been filled with injustice and tyranny."[^2]

"Al Mahdi is from the sons of Fatima."[^3]

Huzaifa says The Holy Prophet (S) has said,

"Even if one day remains for this world (to come to an end) Allah will
prolong that day until he sends a man from my progeny (sons). His name
shall be (like) my name." Salman asked, "From which of your sons, O
Prophet of Allah?"He (S) replied, "From this son of mine", and thumped
his hands upon Husain (as)"[^4]

A Jew, named Nathal asked the Holy Prophet (S), "Inform me as to who is
your successor? Because every Prophet had a successor and our Prophet
Musa Ibne Imran (as) had designated Yusha Bin Nun as his successor."

The Holy Prophet (S) replied, "Yes my Vasi and the caliph after me is
Ali bin Abi Talib and after him my grandsons Hasan and Husain, followed
by nine of the offsprings of Husain. They are the holy Imams."

The Jew said, "O Muhammad, tell me their names."

'Yes,' said the Prophet (S), "When Husain will pass away, then his son
Ali, and after Ali his son Muhammad and after Muhammad his son Jafar and
after Jafar his son Musa and after Musa his son Ali and after Ali, his
son Muhammad and after Muhammad his son Ali after Ali his son Hasan and
after Hasan his son Hujjat Ibnul Hasan. These are the twelve Imams.
Their number is equal to the chiefs of Bani Israel"[^5]
