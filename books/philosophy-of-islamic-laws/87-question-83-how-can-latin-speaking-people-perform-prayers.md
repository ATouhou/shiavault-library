Question 83:  How Can Latin Speaking People Perform Prayers?
============================================================

**Question:** In the countries where Latin languages are spoken if the
people of those countries become Muslim and want to pray Prayers or
recite supplications, is it possible for them to learn the proper Arabic
language with the correct pronunciations?

**Answer:** As we already know most of them are literate for whom it is
not difficult to learn the Qur’an and Prayers in Arabic. They are even
interested to learn Eastern sciences and even learn Arabic in many
universities of that country. Just as when we learn their language we
try to learn their exact pronunciation and tone.

As far as their illiterate minority is concerned, they can learn Arabic
words according to their capacity and whatever they have learnt or can
learn, the Almighty Allah does not demand anything more from them.
Though it is necessary that all Muslims should learn the Qur’an and
Prayers with proper Arabic pronunciation but it is up to the personal
capacity of the people. Islam does not demand anything beyond ones
capacity.
