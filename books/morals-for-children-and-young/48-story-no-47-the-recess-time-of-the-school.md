Story no. 47: The recess-time of the school.
============================================

Saeed was playing in the garden of his school with his friends.  
 Suddenly, he saw a boy who was picking up stones from the ground and
throwing them on children.  
 Saeed, who was very angry, approached the boy and said “It is true that
the recess is for playing but not for pestering people. Besides, you
must know that pestering people is an un-favoured act and we, as
children and youngsters, should learn how to refrain from it”.  
 The other children who were listening became aware of it and the boy
also promised that he also would not pester others anymore.
