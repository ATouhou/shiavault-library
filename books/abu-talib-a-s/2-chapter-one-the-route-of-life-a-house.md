Chapter One : the Route of Life a House
=======================================

In a dark milieu and ignorant environment ... a milieu that fell under
obscurity and unenlightenment concerning the religious view where the
idols were so many that every tribe had its gods and every family had
its gods! In fact every person had his or her god that no one
participated him/her with.

In that milieu and in that environment where the feeling was inactive,
the sense was lost and the eyes were closed to see every sign showing
that God was but one and only with on participant in His rule.

In that milieu where the strong wind invaded to change the divine
religion and the true belief of Abraham to the worship of pieces of
stone and wood, which didn't hear, see or perceive and didn't benefit or
harm. Man hewed his god with his hands to be his intercessor with Allah.
In that milieu where the night covered with its darkness and from among
those message of people with their closed eyes, locked hearts and dead
senses, who lived in that darkness and that abyss of unenlightenment ...
from among thousands and thousands of people a man might break the rule
and from among millions of houses a house might be different.

Among these and those of the crowded masses of people a man might excel
to see with a new eye and a full-blown heart a ray of light, which would
light his way through that darkness ... he would read in the divine
books to quiet his heart and conscience after long doubting where he
passed by a critical stage, which was the worse stage of change and
development with all its fears and fatigues.

He read in those books to find that they brought good news about a new
prophet. He saw the nature informing of a new prophet to be sent. He
found everything around him referring to the necessity of the existence
of that prophet and confirming that his expected coming would be soon.
He found in the books what defined the land of that prophet. Was it but
Mecca, from which that light would shine? His heart frisked and his soul
became refreshed. He wished he would be one of those, who would get a
bit of that shining ray and to defend that guiding light.

And from among these and those ... and from among those houses, which
no one of them was without a piece of stone or wood that every one in
the house had to prostrate himself or herself before and to tend to
servilely. It was the last thing to be farewelled and the first thing to
be received when one was to travel. From this still god they expected
help and success. The same hands, which made this god, extended towards
it praying, begging and fearing so much. That was the utmost decline of
the intellectuality, the human values and the creative mind of man.

From among those houses there was one house that no thread of that
darkness entered and the lamp, which Prophet Abraham (s) had lit, was
still alight and no wind could put it out. This house still believed in
the true belief of Abraham. This house never doubted about the
truthfulness of the mission of Abraham, by which he had proved the
monotheism of the One and Only God.

This house, which was related to Abraham in two ways; the wasy of
progeny and fatherhood and the way of faith and monotheism, was but
continuance of the mission of Abraham (s). In this faithful house, which
neither ignorance nor polytheism had soiled ... in this honored house
Abu Talib opened his eyes towards the route of life. He saw in this
house a life different from the life he saw among people and he lived a
life different from that people lived. He saw in the chief of this
house -his father Abdul Muttalib- a man different from the other man. He
didn't see in those people save masses of fleshes and bones or dolls
without a bit of reason. He opened his eyes to see as what Di'bil (1)
later on would open his eyes to see and to cry: "I open my eyes towards
many, but I see none!"

He saw in his father, Abdul Muttalib, the obeyed leader and the
respected man, who carried out whatever he said and judged and no one
would deny his judgement. He saw so generous. He used to serve banquets
that even the rider would get his share from upon his camel. Some food
was put on the tops of the mountains that birds and beasts might eat
from until he was called (the profluent) and (the feeder of the birds of
the sky). He prayed Allah and Allah responded to his prayers. He was
pleased with by Allah in the heaven and was praised on the earth;
therefore he was called (Shaybatul Hamd; the old man of praise).

He saw in his father many excellences that no one other than his father
had. Abdul Muttalib enacted many laws that showed his guidance,
sublimity, purity of innerself and the great faith that he compiled with
what Abraham (s) had preached at. He forbade himself from

drinking wine, forbade marrying the mahrams, (1) limited the
circumambulation around the Kaaba with seven turns after it was
unlimited, forbade circumambulating around the Kaaba nakedly, ordered to
cut the stealer's hand, forbade adultery, forbade burying newborn girls
alive, forbade gambling, forbade eating from the meat of the animals
sacrificed for the idols and enacted carrying out the vow. (2) Islam
came and ratified all those rules enacted by Abdul Muttalib.

Abdul Muttalib associated with Harb bin Umayya bin Abd Shams -the
father of Mo'awiya- for some time. One of the Jews was under the
protection of Abdul Muttalib. One day this Jew spoke roughly to Harb in
one of the markets of Tehama. Harb became angry. He incited someone to
assassinate the Jew. He inherited treachery from his grandfather Abd
Shams. Treachery was a characteristic of this family along the ages.
When Abdul Muttalib knew about the doing of Harb, he deserted him for he
didn't want to associate with a treacherous man. But he didn't let Harb
get free. He forced him to pay one hundred she-camels to the killed
Jew's cousin as blood-money. (3)

Mawadda, vol.2 p.90
3 Ibid p.4 Ibnul Atheer, in his Tareekh p.209, mentioned this event in
another way. He said that the Jew was a rich merchant and that made Harb
envious and angry. He sent him someone to kill him and seize his wealth.
The author added that they prosecuted their suit to an-Najashi the king
of Abyssinia but he refused to intervene between them. Then Nufeil bin
Abdul Ozza al-Adawi judged between them. He said to Harb: "O Abu Amr! Do
you dispute with a man, who is taller than you, more handsome, stronger,
less blamable, has more sons, more generous, more able to quarrel than
you ... etc." It was mentioned in Haleef Beni Makhzoom p.27 in a way
someone different and it was mentioned in al-Bayan wet-Tebyeen, vol.1
p.293.

Besides all that Abdul Muttalib refused to lower his head to prostrate
before an idol, to worship a solid stone or a ragged piece of wood where
he was of high reason, prudence and acumen. (1)

He was the first to devote himself to God in the cave of Hara'. When
the month of Ramadan came, he went up the mountain to worship for some
nights and to think about the loftiness and the greatness of Allah.
Ebraha, the king of Yemen, came to destroy the Kaaba. He seized some
camels of Abdul Muttalib. Abu Talib saw his father when asking Ebraha
for his camels but not mentioning anything about the Kaaba, which Ebraha
had come to destroy. Abdul Muttalib was about to be lowly before his son
but he answered as a certain faithful to Allah: "I am the lord of my
camels and the Kaaba has its Lord to guard it."

Abdul Muttalib went to the Kaaba. He held the ferrule of the gate of
the Kaaba and began to talk to his god reciting:

O my God! I don't hope but you.
O God! Save Your sanctuary from them!
The enemy of the House (Kaaba) is YOur enemy,
So prevent them from destroying Your courtyard! (2)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1 Ibn Abul Heed said in his Sharh Nahjol Balagha, vol.1 p.39 when he
talked about the nation that Allah had sent Muhammad (s) as prophet for:
"Those, who didn't deny the existence of the Creator and the
resurrection among the Arabs, were very few. They were God-fearing and
pious. They refrained from committing obscenities. Among them were
Abdullah (the Prophet's father), Abdul Muttalib and his son Abu Talib
... etc."

2 Refer to al-Kamil by ibnul Atheer, vol.1 p.261, Biharul Anwar, vol.6
p.23 and Murooj ath-Thahab, vol.2 p.128.

Then he recited again in a way that he was certain about the result:

O Allah! Man strives to defend his baggage,
So defend Your possession!
Let their cross and their cunning not defeat Your cunning.
If You do, it will be a doing that You complete Your doings with
It is You, Whom we hope when oppressors come.
They will flee with disgrace or You will perish them there.
I have heard of no more obscene than them at all.
They brought all of their people and the elephant to captivate Your
people.
They intended to plot against your sanctum not heeding Your
loftiness.
If You will leave them alone with Your Kaaba, it is Your will.

Then he said: "O people of Quraysh, he can never destroy the house (the
Kaaba). It has a Lord, Who will protect it." Then he prayed Allah and
Allah sent flocks of birds throwing stones upon Ebraha and his soldiers'
heads. Those stones were quicker in killing than the atomic bombs but
they only killed the criminals without harming any innocent one not like
the atomic bombs when annihilating the innocent nations for these were
made by man while those were made by the Creator.

Abu Talib was among his nine brothers when his father Abdul Muttalib
taught them his valuable lessons, ordered them to obey the divine
orders, forbade them from committing bad doings, ordered them to avoid
injustice and oppression, encouraged them to keep to the nobilities of
character and warned them of a day where everyone would get one's reward
according to what one had done whether good or bad. Abu Talib often
heard his father saying like this: "No unjust one leaves this life
unless he is revenged on and is afflicted with punishment."

Someone defied Abdul Muttalib when an unjust man of Sham died without
facing any evil throughout his life. Abdul Muttalib answered: "By Allah,
there is another world after this world, in which the benevolent will be
rewarded for their benevolence and the evil doers will be punished for
their evil doing." (1)

Abu Talib saw his father Abdul Muttalib when he was newsed that his son
Abdullah (Abdul Muttalib's son) had begot a newborn baby ... this
newborn baby, which the universe had been waiting for to receive the
shine of its brightness. As soon as this baby faced the universe, the
grandfather was newsed. He came to the baby's mother asking her to tell
him of all what she saw during the giving birth to her baby. Then he
took the baby to the Kaaba to pray Allah and to thank Him for this great
favor. He began to recite:

Praise be to Allah, Who granted me this good boy
He masters over all the boys although he is yet in cradle
I pray Allah to protect him until I see him be a man
I pray Allah to protect him from the evil of every spiteful and every
envier. (2)

Abdul Muttalib took much care of this orphan (Muhammad) and tried his
best to bring him up. He looked at this boy with a deep inspective look
piercing through the future and seeing that this orphan would make the
earth; east or west, submit to his greatness and would make the hearts
pulse with his love and follow his mission and the tongues speak of him
and praise him with the signs of honoring constantly. A carpet was
spread for Abdul Muttalib, the respected leader, the glorified man among
Quraysh and the obeyed chief among the Arabs, around the Kaaba and he
was

surrounded by the chiefs of Quraysh but no one of them could tread on
an end of his carpet rather than to sit with him upon it. But this
orphan child came, with his ambition and determination, overstepping all
of the people to sit beside his grandfather or sometimes he might
precede and sit in his grandfather's place and when his grandfather came
and they wanted to make this orphan away from his place, Abdul Muttalib
would scold whoever dared to put this great child aside! Once he said:
"Leave him alone! He will be of great importance." Abdul Muttalib seated
this orphan child beside him and patted on his back and the signs of
cheer, contentment and happiness appeared on his face. He would never
disappoint the fresh hope in this child's heart! Once again he said to
the one, who wanted to prevent Muhammad from sitting on his
grandfather's carpet: "Let my son sit! He feels that he will be an
important man. I hope that he will reach a high glory that no one of the
Arabs had reached before him no any one will reach after him."

A third time he said: "Return my son to my seat! He forefeels of a
great rule. He will be of great importance." (1) Once he recommended Abu
Talib to take care of him: Protect him and keep to him. Be as mother to
him. Don't let anything bad happen to him." (2) Abdul Muttalib was not
of those, who spoke at random, nor would he ramble or rave with what he
didn't know. He knew well that his grandson would have a great standing
... and what a standing it would be! There were many evidences showed
that Abdul

Muttalib had predicted with his sharp insight that his grandson would
be of great importance. In fact his own life and honest conduct was one
of those evidences of the importance of his grandson. He was certain of
what he had predicted for all the surrounding and phenomena certified
his feeling.

Some people of Midlaj, (1) who knew about archeology, said to Abdul
Muttalib: "Take much care for Muhammad. We haven't seen any foot more
similar to the foot (of Abraham) in the shrine." (2) When Sayf bin This
Yazn al-Himyari became the king of Abyssinia two years after the birth
of Muhammad, the delegations of the Arabs set out to congratulate him
after restoring the rule of his ancestors. In the front was the
delegation of Quraysh, whose chief was Abdul Muttalib. Abdul Muttalib
stood up to do his speech in front of Sayf. His speech was a sign of
eloquence that made Sayf bow before this nonesuch personality and
glorified leader. Sayf welcomed them warmly and they became his
guests.

It happened that their stay lasted somehow long with Sayf as guests
until a month passed. Sayf bin Thi Yazn approximated Abdul Muttalib to
him. He wanted to tell him about an important secret thinking that Abdul
Muttalib hadn't known about it. He wanted to tell him about something
that would have the dignity of life and the virtue after death for all
of the human beings and that Abdul Muttalib would have the better share
and the best luck of it. He said to him: "If a boy is born in Tehama
having a mole between his shoulders, he will be of great importance and
you will have the leading by virtue of him until the day of punishment."
Then he added after saying something to Abdul Muttalib: "His name is
Muhammad. His father and mother die. He is adopted by

his grandfather and his uncle." Then he removed the cover and disclosed
the secret: "I swear by the House (the Kaaba) that you are his
grandfather definitely, O Abdul Muttalib!" (1)

Then Abdul Muttalib prostrated himself before his God thanking Him for
this great blessing. He raised his head happily and smilingly to tell
the king about something of the life of this great prophet: "His father
and mother died and I and his uncle have adopted him." (2) Those were
some evidences Abdul Muttalib saw besides many others that the life of
his grandson was full of. And if there was but one evidence, it would be
enough to prove that his grandson Muhammad was the very one, who would
be that expected prophet, about whom the divine Book of the previous
prophets had talked.

Some barren passed. The rain stopped and the water became rate. The
green grass yellowed and that torrential milk of the udders dried. Life
became so difficult. Grief overcame the faces. Fear of the unknown
darkened the eyes. No one was to intercede for them save Abdul Muttalib.
With his great spirit they asked him to intercede with God. The heaven
rained heavily and life refreshed again. The prayer of the intercessor
was responded by his God to revive those dying souls after the loss of
monies and the death of cattle.

A vision in the sleep had led them to this man, who was notable near
Allah, to intercede for them and that his intercession wouldn't be
denied. It was a vision that talked about honored qualities and amiable
descriptions. (1)

groups of phratries of Quraysh, kissed the corner of the Kaaba on their
wasy to the top of Mountain Abu Qubays. He took his grandson Muhammad
with him. His lips uttered with prayers coming out of a sensitive
faithful heart: "O Allah, these are your slaves and sons of your slaves
and your bondmaids and daughters of your bondmaids. You see what we are
afflicted with. The barren years exhausted us. They did away with all
the cattle and they are about to do with the selves. O Allah, take away
the barrenness and bring us rain, fertility and revival!" What a
truthful prayer it was! As soon as it ascended to the Heaven, the
Beneficent God responded to it.

As soon as they left the mountain, the sky was covered with heavy
clouds bearing fertility and revival and driving away the barrenness. It
began to rain and the valleys were filled with goodness. The lips
smiled, the hearts danced and the eyes shined with happiness ... but
nevertheless some faces frowned, some lips writhed, some hearts were
disgusted and some eyes scattered rays of grudge! The caravan was about
to reach Mecca when a sweet sound came out of one of the houses of Mecca
expressing joy and happiness after Allah had responded to the prayer of
Abdul Muttalib. It was Raqeeqa bint Abu Sayfi bin Sham, whose lips
announced her sweet verses:

By Shaybatul Hamd Allah irrigated our country
After we lost the means of life and the rain retarded much.
The valley flowed with water where cattle and trees revive.
It was a blessing of Allah and thanks to this man that Mudhar had never
newsed with better than.
What a blessed name it was that Allah made the clouds rain for the sake
of him, who had no similar among people at all. (1)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 The surname of Abdul Muttalib.

When it rained, the valleys were filled with water and the pastures
became green but the country of Qayss and Mudhar had no chance of having
a share of that. The clouds didn't water their lands.

Their chiefs and notable men met to discuss the matter. They agreed
that no one but Abdul Muttalib, whom they would resort to. It was he, to
whose prayer Allah had responded and watered Mecca from the heaven and
the earth. (2) Allah wouldn't refuse a prayer coming out of the heart of
this old man, who had a high position near Him. They said: "We have been
in such difficulty of living and barrenness. Allah has watered people
according to the prayer of Abdul Muttalib so let's go to him that he may
pray to Allah to have mercy upon us!"

They reached Mecca and went to Abdul Muttalib. He welcomed them. Their
speaker stood up to inform Abdul Muttalib of their want by saying:
"Barren years have afflicted us and we have heard about your
effectiveness and about what you have done. We have come to you that you
may intercede for us with Him, Who has responded to you and made the
clouds water your people." Next day Abdul Muttalib went to achieve his
promise

2 With reference to that when he was ordered to dig the well of Zamzam
... and when water welled from under the hoofs of his horse when he was
on his way to the judgement of Quraysh that his companions were about to
die of thirst but the people of Quraysh refused to give them even a sip
of water. Allah granted him that flowing water, from which he watered
the all even those who prevented him, and hence they submitted to him
before they reached to the rule. History repeated itself when Mo'awiya
prevented Imam Ali and his army from water but when Imam Ali controlled
the drinking fountains, he didn't prevent them from it ... and then the
same story of Yazeed with Imam Husayn!

to them. He went towards Mountain Arafat surrounded by his sons and
people. Among them was his beloved orphan grandson Muhammad. He took his
seat and his honored grandson was in his lab. He raised his hands
towards the Heaven. His eyes shone with faith; his heart pulsed with
sincerity and his tongue prayed submissively: "O Allah, the God of the
swift lighting, the God of the pealing thunder, the God of the gods and
the Solver of the difficulties! These are Qayss and Mudhar, (1) who are
the best among the peoples. Their heads are disheveled and their backs
are hunched. They complain to You their weakness and the loss of selves
and monies! O Allah, give them thundering clouds and pouring sky to make
their land smile and their damage disappear!"

As soon as he uttered these words, a thundering dark cloud was
traveling towards him, as a response for his pray, on its way towards
the barren country of those people. Then Abdul Muttalib said to them: "O
people of Qayss and Mudhar, go back! You are watered." (2)

Abu Talib began to recite:

Our father was the intercessor, by whom people were
watered by heavy thundering clouds.
Before they were about to leave the place, they saw the
rain-clouds coming with goodness.
Qayss came to us after distress and disaster ...
after it was bitten by a bad time.
They didn't leave until Allah rewarded their lands
responding to Shayba (3) Rains came to turn their lands green. (4)

The life of Abdul Muttalib went on shiningly with the signs of the
expected prophet, about whom he had read in the divine books, and when
he knew that it was his

grandson, he embraced him to his chest and became his merciful
educator. Abdul Muttalib wouldn't forget his orphan, who occupied his
heart and became more preferable even to his own sons, for a moment. He
wouldn't forget him even in the last moment of his long life, which
lasted for one hundred and twenty years according to one saying and more
than eighty-five according to another saying.

When he was dying, he turned his eyes towards his sons, who surrounded
him, to choose one among them in order to entrust him with a task that
busied his mind too much. It was not an ordinary task. He had to choose
the most suitable one for the task to die with delighted eyes. His sight
roved here and there until it met Abu Talib, whom no one was better than
to undertake this heavy task, besides that he had participated in
carrying out the task since the light of this shinning lamp had shone:

O Abd Manaf' I entrust you with this alone one after me. (2) Abu Talib
accepted this task willingly and delightfully. He recited: You don't
need to recommend me to my duty,

I have heard of the most of wonders,
from every bishop and scholar.
The monk's saying - by the virtue of Allah - became true. (3)

Abdul Muttalib said again to Abu Talib: "O Abu Talib!! Take much care
of this alone one, who had neither smelt his father's smell nor tasted
his mother's pity. Consider him as the liver to your body! I have left
all my sons to trust you with him because you are the son of his

can and to support him with your tongue, hand and money. By Allah, he
will be the master over you and he will rule as on one of my ancestors
had ever ruled. Do you accept this?" Abu Talib said: "I accept and Allah
is the witness of this." He stretched his hand and patted on his son Abu
Talib's hand. He said his last word to receive the death with
comfortable conscience after being assured about this important task:
"Now death becomes easy to me." He began to flood him with kisses of
pity and sympathy of a merciful father saying: "Witness that I have
never seen among my sons one more beautiful or more sweet-smelling than
you." (2)
