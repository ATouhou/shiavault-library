Lesson One Hundred Nineteen: Successors Of The Prophet
======================================================

The Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لا يَزَالُ هذَا الدِّينُ عَزِيزاً مَنِيعاً إِلَى إثْنى عَشَرَ
كُلُّهُمْ مِنْ قُرَيْش
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

This religion will always remain honorable and protected from the
enemies under the leadership of twelve persons , all of whom belong to
the Quraish.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Clear and explicit traditions are narrated in respect of the twelve
successors of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) in the
most creditable books of the Sunnites including ‘Sahih Bukhari’, ‘Sahih
Muslim’. ‘Aahih Tirmidhi’, ‘Sahih Abu Dawood’, ‘Masoud Ahmad’ and many
others. The total number of these traditions narrated by Shias and
Sunnites are estimated to be 271!

It is interesting to note that the profile of successors per these
traditions fits only the twelve Shia Imams. Neither the first four
caliphs nor the Umayyid or Abbasid caliphs meet the specifications of
this tradition.
