Ali the Rightful Imam and Leader
================================

**( 145 )**

The whole of Ali's person, life style and biography, his manners and his
character, his complexion and fragrance his dialect and dialogue, all
are lessons, examples, instructions inspirations and guidance.

In the same manner as his attractions are informing and corrective for
us, Ali's repulsions are also admonitory. Ordinarily in salutations to
Ali and all others we express our claim to be friends of his friends and
enemies of his enemies. The other construction of this phrase is "We are
leading to that direction, which happens to be in the sphere of 'your
attractions' and wherefrom you attract and we keep off from those points
which you repel".

The corners explored hitherto by us were the corners of Ali's attraction
and repulsion. Particularly, in the context of Ali's repulsion we were a
little brief. But whatever we have said so far makes it clear that Ali
forcefully repelled two classes.

(i) The wise hypocrites;

(ii) The foolish prayerful;

Only these two lessons are enough for the claimants of his Shiaism, so
that they open their eyes and are not deceived by the hypocrites. They
should possess sharp-vision and forget about ostentation. The Shiite
nation is presently afflicted by them both.
