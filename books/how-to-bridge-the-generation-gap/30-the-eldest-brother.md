The Eldest Brother
==================

The Father
----------

My child! In the same way as fathers are worthy of everybody's respect,
the eldest brother is ought to be honoured by all their siblings.
Furthermore, the later should regard him as their father.

Our Eighth Imam Ar-Ridha’ (as) had a saying in this regard:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الاخ الاكبر بمنزلة الاب.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Your eldest brother is like your father.”* [^1]

The Child
---------

Of course, he deserves such a high respect provided that his attitudes
towards all his siblings are as that of his father. He is to treat them
with brotherly love and compassion. Be nice rather than cruel to them at
times. In short, be like a father to them.
