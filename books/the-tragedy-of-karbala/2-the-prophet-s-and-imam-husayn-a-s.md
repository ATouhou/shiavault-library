The Prophet (S) and Imam Husayn (a.s.)
======================================

On the death of Muawiya, when Imam Husayn (a.s.) refused to pledge his
allegiance to Yazid, he went to the tomb of his grandfather, Prophet
Muhammad (S). He worshipped there for the most of the night, and also
slept there for a while. In his dream he saw the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and his cleansed progeny, surrounded by angels.

The Prophet (S) embraced him and said, “*My beloved Husayn, I foresee
you when you will be, in the very near future, covered with your blood,
slain at the land of Karbala, while thirsty, being deprived of water.
This will be done to you by people who claim that they are from my
followers.”*

Imam Husayn (a.s.) in his dream looked at his grandfather and said, “*My
grandfather, I ask you to admit me into your grave. I do not desire to
go back to the earthly world.”*

The Messenger of Allah (S) answered him, “*My beloved Husayn, there are
degrees which you will not acquire except through martyrdom.”*

Before he departed to Iraq, he uttered the following words, “*I am as
eager to join my ancestors as Jacob was eager to join Yousef. I
visualize my body being dismembered by the wolves of the desert which
shall fill from my flesh their empty abdomens and hungry stomachs. The
pleasure of God is our pleasure. We are patient at His trial and he
gives us the reward of the patient. (Men from) the flesh of the
Messenger of God will never part with him. They will join him on the Day
of Judgment, and he will be very pleased by the reunion.”*
