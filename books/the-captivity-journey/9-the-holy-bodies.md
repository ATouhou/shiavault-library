The Holy Bodies
===============

The body of Imam Hussain (Q) along with the bodies of the other martyrs
among his family and his companions out in the open while not buried, it
was blazed by the hot sun, and hit by the strong wind; while the cursed,
Omar Bin Saad, had buried his soldiers and performed the proper prayer
for leaving the body of Imam Hussain (Q) and the bodies of his
supporters.
