Some of the Sayings of Imam Husayn
==================================

The following are some of the sayings of Imam Husayn alayhis-salam on
occasions leading to the tragic event of Ashura – 10th of Muharram – 61
H,around 681 CE:‘Death with dignity is better than life with
humiliation.’

‘I do not see death except happiness and prosperity, and life with
oppressors but anguish.’

‘I swear by God, I shall not surrender as a humiliated person, and
shall not escape like slaves.’

‘I have not arisen for the purpose of exuberance, arrogance,corruption,
or oppression, but I have done so in order to seek reform in the nation
of my Grandfather [Muhammad peace be upon him]. I want to promote virtue
and prohibit vice, and I want to go down the path and tradition of my
Grandfather [Muhammad peacebe upon him], and the path of my father [Ali
ibn Abi Talib peace be upon him].’

Addressing his adversaries on the battlefield, when he was the only
fighter left alive, and they started attacking the women and children in
the tents:

‘If you do not believe in a religion, and do not fear the
hereafter,then be free (from arrogance) in your lives.’

‘O Allah! You know that all there was from us was not in competition to
seek power, nor to gain refuse of the world1, but it was nothing other
than to present the signs and essence of Your religion, and to promote
reform in Your land, (so that) oppressed members of your servants find
safety and security, and Your laws,orders and obligations are acted
upon.’

**Some of the general sayings of Imam Husayn**

‘Say not about your brother in his absence other than that which you
would like him to say about you in your absence.’

‘There are those who worship Allah out of desire (for reward), and this
is the worship of traders, and there are those who worship Allah out of
fear (of punishment), and this is the worship of slaves. Whereas certain
people worship Allah out of gratitude, and this is the worship of the
free, and this is the best of the worships.’

“(O Allah) . . .

How can You be reasoned about with that that is in need of You in its
existence?

Does anything other than You have a manifestation which You do not
have, so that it can act as manifestation for You?

When were You ever not present so that You may need a guide (evidence
or reason) to lead to You?

And when were You ever distant (from anything) so that the signs and
the effects were the lead to You?

Blind is the eye that does not see You . . . . .”

‘(O Allah) . . . What did he find he who lost You? And what did he
loose he who found You? Truly he has failed who is contended with other
than You
