====================================

عَنْ عَلِيٍّ (ع) قَالَ: لَوْ كَانَ لِي وَادِيَانِ يَسِيلاَنِ ذَهَباً
وَ فِضَّةً مَا أَهْدَيْتُ إِلـى الْكَعْبَةِ شَيْئاً لأََنَّهُ يَصِيرُ
إِلـى الْحَجْبَةِ دُونَ الْمَسَاكِينَ.

 It has been narrated from ‘Ali [Ibn Abi Talib] (peace be upon him) who
said, “If I were to possess two valleys flowing with gold and silver, I
would not donate a single thing to the Ka’bah because it would reach the
(unworthy) people who maintain the Ka’bah – and not to the poor and
deserving people.”
