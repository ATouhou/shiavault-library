Preface
=======

This book was first published in 1971 as part of the Islamic
Correspondence Course run by Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania.  
    
 The idea behind writing this book was to satisfy the needs of our new
generation - the youths and the students who are unable to study the
scholastic books written by the Muslim scholars and whose only source of
information seems to be the biased writings of orientalists presented as
"objective" and "authentic" studies.  
    
 The book became very popular. It was at once translated into Swahili
and was serialized in Islamic Affairs newsletter of Atlanta, Georgia
(U.S.A). Since then, it has been reprinted several times in
Dar-es-Salaam and Mombasa. Then I revised and expanded it in 1992. Now
Al-Haj Mulla Asgharali M.M. Jaffer (President, World Federation of K. S.
I. Muslim Communities) has kindly offered to publish it under his
supervision. It is hoped that this edition will prove even more popular
and useful.  
    
 I must acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr Athar Hussain (ex­ Secretary
to the Govt. of U.P., India) and the late Nawwab Ahmad Husain Khan of
Paryanwan (U.P, India) as well as to late 'Allamah Sayyid 'Ali Haydar
Naqavi and late 'Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husain Tabataba'i whose books,
*Prophet Muhammad and His Mission, Tarikh-e-Ahmadi, Tarikh-e-A'immah*
and *Tafsir Al-Mizan,* respectively, have provided the main structure of
this book. May Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'aIa increase their rewards.
