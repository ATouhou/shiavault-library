Now, your letter [^1] has reached me wherein you recall that Allah chose
Muhammad (S) for His religion and helped him through those companions
who helped him. Strange things about you have remained concealed (by the
irony of fate) from us, since you have started telling us of Allah's
trials for us and His bounties to us through our Prophet. In this
matter, you are like the person who carries dates to Hajar, or who
challenges his own master to a duel in archery.

You think that so - and- so are the most distinguished persons in Islam.
You have said such a thing which if it be true, you have nothing to do
with it, but if it be not so, then its defect will not affect you. And
what are you to do with the question of who is better and who is worse,
or who is the ruler and who is the ruled. What have the freed ones and
their sons to do with distinguishing between the first muhajirun and
determining their position or defining their ranks. What a pity! the
sound of an arrow is being produced by what is not a real arrow, and he
against whom the judgement is to be passed is sitting in judgement. O
man, why do you not see your own lameness and remain within bounds, and
why do not you realize the shortness of your measure and stay back where
destiny has placed you. You have no concern with the defeat of the
defeated or the victory of the victor.

You are wandering in bewilderment and straying from the right path. Do
you not realize it? I am not giving you any news: I am just recounting
Allah's bounty, namely that a number of people from among the muhajirun
(immigrants from Mecca) and ansar (helpers) fell as martyrs in the way
of Allah the Sublime, and that each of them is distinguished (on that
account), but when one of us secured martyrdom he was named the Chief of
all martyrs, and the Messenger of Allah (S) gave him the peculiar honour
of saying seventy takbir (Allahu Akbar) during his funeral prayer.

Do you not know that a number of people lost their hands in the way of
Allah, and that everyone is distinguished (on that account), but when
the same thing occurred to one of us he was given the name "the flier in
Paradise"; and "the two winged". If Allah had not forbidden self-praise,
the writer would have mentioned numerous distinctions which the believer
knows full well and which the ears of hearers do not wish to forget.

Better leave those whose arrows miss the mark. We are the direct
recipients of our Lord's favours while others receive favours from us
after that. In spite of our old established honour and our well-known
superiority over your people, we did not stay away from mixing with you
and married and got married (among you) like equals although you were
not so. And how could you be so when (the position is that) among us is
the Prophet while among you is the opposer, among us is the lion of
Allah while among you is the lion of the opposing groups, among us are
the two masters of the youth of Paradise [^2] while among you are the
children of Hell, among us is the choicest of all the women of the
worlds [^3] while among you is the bearer of firewood, and many more
distinctions on our side and shortcomings on your side.

Our Islam is well-known and our (greatness in the) pre-Islamic period
too cannot be denied. Whatever remains has been mentioned in the words
of Allah the Glorified, the Sublime:

***And blood relations have the better claim in respect of one to the
other, according to the Book of Allah...*** **(Qur'an, 33:6)**

He (Allah) the Sublime, also says:

***Verily, of men the nearest to Abraham are surely those who followed
him and this (Our) Prophet (Muhammad) and those who believe; and verily,
Allah, is the Guardian of the faithful*****. (Qur'an, 3:68)**

Thus, we are superior firstly because of kinship and secondly because of
obedience. When at Saqifah (of Banu Sa'idah) the Muhajirun contended
kinship with the Messenger of Allah (S) against the Ansar, they scored
over them. If that success was based on kinship then the right would be
ours better than yours. Otherwise, the Ansar's contention stands. You
think that I have been jealous of every caliph and have revolted against
them. Even if this be so, it is not an offence against you and therefore
no explanation is due to you.

“*This is a matter for which no blame comes to you”.*

You have said that I was dragged like a camel with a nose string to
swear allegiance (to Abu Bakr at Saqifah). By the Eternal Allah, you had
intended to revile me but you have praised me, and to humiliate me but
have yourself been humiliated. What humiliation does it mean for a
Muslim to be the victim of oppression so long as he does not entertain
any doubt in his religion, nor any misgiving in his firm belief! This

Then you have recalled my position vis-a- vis 'Uthman, and in this
matter an answer is due to you because of your kinship with him. So (now
tell me), which of us was more inimical towards 'Uthman and who did more
to bring about his killing; or who offered him his support but he made
him sit down and stopped him; or who was he whom he called for help but
who turned his face from him and drew his death near him till his fate
over took him? No, no; by Allah:

but a little.*** **(Qur'an 33:18)**

You have mentioned that for me and for my followers you have only the
sword. This makes even a weeping person laugh. Did you ever see the
descendants of 'Abd al-Muttalib running away from battle, or being
frightened by swords? "Wait a little till Hamal [^5] joins the battle"
shortly, then he whom you are seeking will seek you and he whom you
think to be far away will approach near you. I am (shortly) speeding
towards you with a force of Muhajirun and Ansar and those who follow
them in virtue. Their number will be great and their dust will spread
all round. They will be wearing their shrouds and their most coveted
desire is to meet Allah. They will be accompanied by the descendants of
those who took part in the battle of Badr, and they will have Hashimite
swords whose cut you have already seen in the case of your brother,
maternal uncle, your grandfather and your kinsmen.

[^1]: This letter of Amir al-mu'minin's is in reply to Mu'awiyah's
letter which he sent to Kufah through Abu Umamah al-Bahili, and it also
contains replies to some points which Mu'awiyah had written in the
letter sent through Abu Muslim al-Khawlani. In Abu Umamah's letter,
Mu'awiyah had mentioned the deputation of the Prophet and his ascension
to the position of revelation and wrote in such a manner as though it
was a matter not known to or not understood by Amir al-mu'minin and that
he was in need of being informed and told of it. This is just like a
stranger who may draw the map of a house for the guidance of those who
dwell in it and apprise them of things already known to them. That is
why Amir al-mu'minin has compared him to the man who carried dates to
Hajar which was itself noted for abundant growth of dates. This is a
proverb employed when someone beings to tell a person matters which he
already knows better. The basis of this proverb is that a man of Hajar,
which is a town near Bahrain (Persian Gulf), went to Basrah to sell
goods and make purchases. After finishing the sale, he looked about the
market to make his purchases and found nothing cheaper than dates. He
therefore decided to purchase dates, and when he reached Hajar with his
load of dates their plenty and cheapness there did not leave him any
alternative but to store them so as to sell them later when their price
had risen. The price however continued to fall day by day till all of
them became rotten leaving to him nothing except their stones. In short,
after referring to the Prophet's ascension to prohphethood Mu'awiyah
recounted the distinction and merits of the three Caliphs according to
his view and wrote:  The most distinguished among the companions and the
highest ranking in the view of the Muslims was the first Caliph who
collected all the Muslims under one voice, removed their disunity and
fought those who were forsaking Islam. After him is the second Caliph
who won victories, founded cities and humiliated the unbelievers. Then
comes the third Caliph who was the victim of oppression. He propagated
religion and spread the word of Allah far and wide. (Siffin, al-Minqari,
pp.86-87; al-'Iqd al-farid, vol.4, pp.334-335; Sharh Nahjul Balaghah
al-balaghah, vol.15, p.186) Mu'awiyah's purpose behind in bringing up
these pointless warblings was to injur Amir al-mu'minin's feelings and
to rouse his temper so as to make him produce such words through his
tongue or pen which would so disparage the caliphs that he would
instigate the people of Syria and Iraq against him by exploiting them.
In fact, he had already set it in the minds of these people that Amir
al-mu'minin had instigated the people against 'Uthman, had got Talhah
and az-Zubayr killed, had turned 'A'ishah out from her house and had
shed the blood of thousands of Muslims. Being unaware of the real facts
they were convinced of these beseless allegations, yet to strengthen the
opposition, he thought it advisable to make them believe that Amir
al-mu'minin did not recognize the achievements of the three caliphs and
bore enmity and malice towards them, and to produce Amir al-mu'minin's
writing in evidence, and also to use it for rousing the people of Iraq,
because their majority was much impressed with the environment created
by the caliphs and with their greatness. But Amir al-mu'minin guessed
his intention and gave him such a reply which put a knot in his tongue
and which he could not dare show to anyone. So, Amir al-mu'minin exposed
his lowness by referring to his enmity towards Islam and his accepting
subjugation under force, and advised him to keep within his bounds, and
warned him against fixing grades of distinction among those muhajirun
who were in any case superior to him in so far as they had been the
preceders in hijrah (immigration from Mecca). Whereas since Mu'awiyah
himself was only one of those whose life had been spared (on the day of
fall of Mecca), he had not the remotest connection with the muhajirun.
Consequently, in the matter under discussion Amir al-mu'minin has put
Mu'awiyah's position as that of a false arrow among real arrows. This is
a proverb which is employed when a man boasts over persons with whom he
has no connection. As regards his statement that so - and - so is
greater in distinction, Amir al-mu'minin has, by using the word "you
think", shown that it is his personal opinion which has not the remotest
connection with fact, because this word is used when a false or unreal
statement is made. After refuting this claim of being the most
distinguished, Amir al-mu'minin has referred to these qualities and
distinctions of Banu Hashim which show conspicuously the high degree of
their attainments. Thus, the people who took part in jihad with the
Prophet and secured martyrdom attained high positions but the
distinction that fell to Hamzah by virtue of his high performance was
not secured by anyone else. The Prophet gave him the title of Master of
the Martyrs and said his funeral prayer fourteen times whereby the
number of takbir (Allahu akbar) rose to seventy. Similarly, in various
battles the hands of the fighters were cut off. For example, in the
battle of Badr the hands of Khubayb ibn Isaf al-Ansari and Mu'adh ibn
Jabal and in the battle of Uhud those of 'Amr ibn al-Jamuh as-Salami and
'Ubayd ('Atik) ibn at-Tayyihan (brother of Abu'l-Haytham at-Tayyihan)
were cut off, but when in the battle of Mu'tah the hands of Ja'far ibn
Abi Talib were cut off, the Prophet singled him out by naming him "the
flier in Paradise" and the "two-winged". After recounting the peculiar
achievements of Banu Hashim, Amir al-mu'minin has referred to his own
attainments with which the histories and traditions are replete and
which could not be tarnished with doubts and misgivings. Thus,
traditionists like Ahmad ibn Hanbal (164/780-241/855), Ahmad ibn 'Ali
an-Nasa'i (215/830 - 303/915) and others say that: The number of
traditions that have been related through reliable sources in regard to
the distinctions of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib have not been related about any
other companion of the Prophet. (al-Mustadrak, vol.3, p.107; al-Isti'db,
vol.3, p.1115; Tabaqat al-hanabilah, vol.1, p.3l9; al-Kamil, vol.3,
p.399; Tahdhib at-tahdhib, vol.7, p.339; Fath al-bari, vol.7, p.57) An
important distinction out of these particular distinctions of Ahlul Bayt
(the Household of the Holy Prophet) is the one to which Amir
al-mu'-minin has referred in these words that "We are the direct
recipients of Allah's favours while others receive favours from us."
This is the height of distinction that even the highest personality
cannot reach its sublimity and every other distinction looks small
before it. Acknowledging the greatness and supremacy of this sentence,
Ibn Abi'l-Hadid writes: Amir al-mu'minin intends to convey that we are
not under obligation of any person since Allah has bestowed all
blessings on us directly, there being no intermediary between us and
Allah, while all other people are under our obligation and protection,
being the intermediary between them and Allah, the Glorified; this is a
high position indeed. Its apparent meaning is what the words show but
its real sense is that the Ahlul Bayt are the obedient servants of Allah
and the people must be their obedient followers. (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah
al-balaghah, vol.15, p.194) Now, since these people are the first
recipients of the bounties of Allah and the source of bounties for the
rest of the people, no one from among the people can be compared with
them, nor can anyone be regarded as their equal on the basis of social
contacts with them, much less than those individuals who were in direct
contrast to the attainments and characteristics of these people, and
used to oppose truth and right on every occasion. Amir al-mu'minin
places both the sides of the picture before Mu'awiyah and says: The
Prophet was from us while your father Abu Sufyan was foremost in
opposing him. Hamzah was from us and the Prophet gave him the title of
"Lion of Allah" while your maternal grandfather, 'Utbah ibn Rabi'ah was
proud of being the "lion of swearers (against the Prophet)." When in the
battle of Badr, Hamzah and 'Utbah ibn Rabi'ah came face to face, Hamzah
said, "I am Hamzah son of 'Abd al-Muttalib; I am the lion of Allah and
the lion of His Prophet," whereupon 'Utbah said, "I am the lion of
swearers (against the Prophet)." In another version, the word
"Asadu'l-ahlaf" has been recorded. The meaning is that he was the Chief
of the allying parties. The story of swearing is that when Banu 'Abd
Manaf acquired a distinct position among the Arab tribes they thought
they should take over from Banu 'Abdi'd-Dar the offices relating to the
Ka'bah and to depose them from these offices. In this connection, Banu
'Abd Manaf allied with themselves the tribes of Banu Asad ibn
'Abdi'l-'Uzza, Banu Taym, Banu Zuhrah and Banu al-Harith, and concluded
an agreement with them.In order to solemnize this agreement they
drenched their hands in tib (perfume) and swore that they would help
each other. For this reason, these tribes were called: "Tribes of sworn
chaste parties". On the other side the tribes of Banu 'Abdi'd-Dar, Banu
Makhzum, Banu Sahm and Banu 'Adi also swore that they would resist Banu
'Abd Manaf and their allies. These tribes are called the "allies".
'Utbah has deemed himself the head of the allying parties. Some
commentators have taken the word Asadu'l-ahlaf to mean Abu Sufyan,
because he made different tribes swear against the Prophet in the battle
of the Trench, while some commentators take it to mean Asad ibn
'Abdi'l-'Uzzah, but this interpretation does not carry weight because
here Amir al-mu'minin is addressing Mu'awiyah and this interpretation
does not hit Mu'awiyah since Banu 'Abd Manaf were a party to this
alliance. Then Amir al-mu'minin says, "they have among themselves the
masters of the youth of Paradise". Referring to the Prophet's saying,
"al-Hasan and al-Husayn are the masters of the youth of Paradise", while
the boys of the other side are in Hell. This reference is to the sons of
'Uqbah ibn Abi Mu'ayt, about whom the Prophet has said, "For you and
your sons is Hell". Then Amir al-mu'minin says that among them is the
chief of all the women of the worlds, namely Fatimatu'z-Zahra'
(p.b.u.h.), while in the other party is the bearer of the wood which
refers to Umm Jamil, the sister of Abu Sufyan. This woman used to spread
thorns in the path of the Prophet. She has been mentioned in the Qur'an
along with Abu Lahab, in these words:  In the Name of Allah, the
Beneficent, the Merciful May perish both the hands of Abu Lahab, may
perish (he himself); Shall avail him not his wealth nor what he earneth;
Soon shall he burn in the flaming fire; And his wife, the bearer of the
firewood; Upon her neck shall be a halter of twisted rope. (Qur'an,
111) 

[^2]: It is narrated from Amir al-mu'minin, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab,
Hudhayfah ibn Yaman, Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, Abu Hurayrah, etc., that the
Holy Prophet (may Allah bless him and his descendants) said: Verily,
Fatimah is the Supreme Lady of the women of Paradise, and al-Hasan and
al-Husayn are the two Supreme Youth of Paradise. But their father ('Ali)
is Superior to them. (al-Jami'as -sahih,at-Tirmidhi, vol.5, pp.656, 661;
al-Musnad, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, vol. 3, pp.3,62,64, 82; vol.5, pp.391, 392;

[^3]: It is narrated from 'Imran ibn al-Husayn and Abu Tha'labah
al-Khushni that the Holy Prophet (S) said to Fatimah (p.b.u.h.): "O' my
little daughter, are you not satisfied that you are verily the Supreme
Lady of all women in the worlds?" She said, "O' father, then what about
Maryam (Mary) daughter of 'Imran?" He said, "She was the Supreme Lady of
her age, and you are the Supreme Lady of your age. Truly, by Allah, I
married you to one who is the Master in this world and the hereafter. No
one hates him save a hypocrite." (Hilyah al-awliya', vol.2, p.92;
al-Isti'ab, vol.4, p. 1895; al-Isabah, vol.4, p.275) Also, A'ishah
narrated that the Holy Prophet (S) said: O' Fatimah, will you not be
satisfied to be the Supreme Lady of the women of the worlds (or) to be
the Supreme Lady of all women of this ummah (community) or of the women
believers? (as-Sahih, al-Bukhari, vol.8, p.79; as-Sahih, Muslim, vol.7,
pp. 142-l44; as-Sunan,Ibn Majah, vol.1, p.518; al-Musnad, Ahmad ibn
Hanbal, vol.6, p.282; al-Mustadrak 'ala as-sahihayn, al-Hakim, vol.3,
p.156)

[^4]: The meaning is that the person who goes too far in counselling
others will be thought to have his personal ends in so doing, even
though his counsel may well be based on sincerity of intention and
selflessness. This line is used as a proverb on such occasions. The
whole couplet runs as follows: How often a good counsel I offered you,
but sometimes the only reward a counsellor reaps is suspicion. 

[^5]: This line is of Hamal ibn Badr. The full couplet runs thus: Wait a
bit till Hamal reaches the battlefield; How pretty is death when it
comes. The story behind it is that Malik ibn Zuhayr threatened Hamal ibn
Badr with battle and in reply he recited this couplet and then attacked
Malik and killed him. When Malik's brother saw this, he killed Hamal and
his brother Hudhayfah in revenge. Then, he described this in his
following couplet: I appeased my heart by killing Hamal ibn Badr and my
sword appeased me by killing Hudhayfah.
