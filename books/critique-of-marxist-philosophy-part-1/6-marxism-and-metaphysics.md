Marxism and Metaphysics
=======================

The Marxist position regarding metaphysics is essentially similar to
that of positivism. Marxism rejects a higher philosophy above and over
the sciences and independent of them. Marxist philosophy calls itself
'scientific', yet soon trespasses into other fields to judge
metaphysical issues affirmatively or negatively. In violating its
self-set limits it contradicts itself a result of the Marxist mistake of
basing its theory of knowledge on sense experience alone.

It is in the light of the rational theory of knowledge that philosophy
and metaphysics rest on firm fundamental principles. The acceptance of
primary rational knowledge relieves philosophy of bondage to the
constantly changing theories of experimental science.

The link between philosophy and science is strong, for science
furnishes philosophy with new facts that enable philosophy to obtain new
philosophical conclusions. Yet in spite of this philosophy may at times
not need any sense experience, nor is it necessary for philosophy to
accompany the procession of science in its gradual march
