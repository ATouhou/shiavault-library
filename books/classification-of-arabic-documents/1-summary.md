Summary
=======

*Arabic language is a very rich language with complex morphology, so it
has a very different and difficult structure than other languages. So it
is important to build an Arabic Text Classifier (ATC) to deal with this
complex language. The importance of text or document classification
comes from its wide variety of application domains such as text
indexing, document sorting, text filtering, and Web page categorization.
Due to the immense amount of Arabic documents as well as the number of
internet Arabic language users, this project aims to implement an Arabic
Text-Documents Classifier (ATC).*
