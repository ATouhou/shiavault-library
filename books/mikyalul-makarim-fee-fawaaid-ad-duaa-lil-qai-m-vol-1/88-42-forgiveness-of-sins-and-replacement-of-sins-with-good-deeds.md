42. Forgiveness Of Sins And Replacement Of Sins With Good Deeds
===============================================================

This matter is proved by a tradition that Shaykh Ahmad bin Fahd Hilli
(r.a.) has quoted in his book *Oddattud Dai* from the Messenger of Allah
(S) that he said:

“No people sit in remembrance of Allah but that an angel calls out from
the heavens: Get up, as indeed your sins have been replaced with good
deeds and all your sins have been forgiven.”[^1]

The point proved by this is: *Dua* for our master, the Master of the
Time (aj) is a form of remembering Allah. Thus all those gatherings in
which a believer prays for his master, become eligible for this honor.
Evidence supporting that the remembrance of His Eminence is a form of
remembering Allah, is a tradition mentioned in *Wasailush Shia* and
*Kafi* from His Eminence, Abu Abdillah Sadiq (as) that he said:

“No people attend a gathering where there is no remembrance of Allah and
no mention about us but that this gathering would cause regret to them
on the Judgment Day.”

Then he said: Abu Ja’far (as) says: “Our remembrance is the remembrance
of Allah and remembrance of our enemies is remembrance of Shaitan.”[^2]
