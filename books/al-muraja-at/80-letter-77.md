Why Prefer Umm Salamah's Hadith to ‘Ayesha's?
---------------------------------------------

**Safar 20, 1330**

As if your preference of Umm Salamah's hadith to that of ‘Ayesha, may
Allah be pleased with them both, according to what you have stated, is
not sufficient, you went a step further to claim that the reasons for
such a preference are more than what you have already indicated. What
are these reasons? State them, may Allah have mercy on you, no matter
how many, and do not leave any, for our aim is to research and learn,
Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*S*
