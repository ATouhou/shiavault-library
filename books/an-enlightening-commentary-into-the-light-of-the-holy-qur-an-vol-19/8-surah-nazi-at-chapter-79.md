***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

The theme in this Surah, like Surah Nabaa, is about Resurrection and, on
the whole, can be divided into six parts:

1. It emphasizes on the certainty of the Great Day and lays stress on
its occurrence by emphatic statements, which relate to the Resurrection.

2. It points to one part of the frightening and dreadful incidents of
that Day.

3. It precisely mentions the story of Moses and the end of the arrogant
Pharaoh as a consolation for both the Prophet (S) and the believers, as
well as giving a warning to the unbelievers, and also contains an
indication to the fact that the denial of the Resurrection is the source
of many sins.

4. It mentions a few of the countless Powers of Allah, which exist in
the heavens and on the Earth; themselves, being evidences of the
possibility of Resurrection and the new life after death.

5. It describes another part of the horrible events, on that Great Day,
and the painful end of the unbelievers in contrast to the rewards of the
righteous.

6. At the end of the Surah, it emphasizes on the fact that no one knows
the date of that Day, however, it is certain that it is near.

The name Nazi’at is derived from the first verse of this Surah.

The Virtue in Studying this Surah
---------------------------------

It is narrated that the Prophet (S) said:

*“For he who studies Surah Nazi’at the length of his stay and his
reckoning on the Day of Judgment will last as long as the saying of a
daily prayer and, thereafter, he will come into Paradise”.* [^1]

A tradition from Imam Sadiq (as) says:

*“He who studies it (Surah Nazi’at) will not pass away but satisfied,
will not be brought into the Resurrection but satisfied, and will not
come into Paradise but satisfied”,*

(with the infinite Grace of Allah).

The shocking verses of this Surah awaken the sleeping souls and draw
their attention to their duties. Then, it is certain that only those who
spiritually put the contents of this Surah into practice will receive
these rewards; not those who content themselves with the mere reading of
its words.

***1. “By those (angels) who tear out (the souls of the wicked) with
violence;”***  
***2. “By those (angels) who gently draw out (the souls of the
Blessed);”***  
***3. “And by those who glide along (on errands of mercy),”***  
***4. “Then press forward as in a race,”***  
***5. “And those who manage the affair,”***

### By The Angels Who Try Hard

There are five important matters sworn to in the above verses and whose
aim is to settle the rightfulness and certainty of the Resurrection.

***“By those (angels) who tear out (the souls of the wicked) with
violence,”***

***“By those (angels) who gently draw out (the souls of the
blessed);”***

***“And by those who glide along (on errands of merry)”,***

***“Then press forward as in a race,”***

***“And those who manage the affair,”***

First, some particular terms used in these verses should be made clear
before we proceed with the commentary of the verses.

The word /nazi'at/ is based on /naza'a/ which means 'to pluck out', or
'to draw out some what sharply, like drawing a bow to shoot arrows'.
This word is sometimes used for spiritual matters, such as the
detachment of enmity or love from the heart.

The term /qaraqa/, according to many philologists, means 'to sink, the
act of drowning' and sometimes it has been used in the sense of 'being
entirely busy in an event or a disaster'.

Or, the term /qarq/, according to Ibn‑manzur in Lisan‑al‑Arab, is a noun
replacing the infinitive with the meaning of /iqraq /'to exaggerate'
which originally means 'to draw a bow to the extreme possible point',
hence, to exaggerate in anything.

This clearly shows that, in the above verse, the word does not mean 'to
sink, or to drown', but it means 'to do something to the extreme
end’.[^2]

The term /naŝiţat/ is derived from /naŝt/ which originally means 'to
untie the knots which are easily unfastened'. 'A shallow well', from
which the bucket can be drawn easily at one pull, is called /inŝat/’. 'A
camel which is instigated by a subtle hint and moves very fast' is
called /naŝitah/. Therefore, this word is generally used in any case
where a movement is fluently done.

The term /sabihat/ is based on /sabh/ which means 'a quick movement in
water or air'. Hence, it is applied to swimming, or a swimming motion,
or a swift gallop, or to perform a daily affair, quickly. The word
/tasbih/ 'to praise Allah' is from the same root, as if the one who
praises Allah goes quickly forward in worship of the Lord.

The term /sabiqat/ is derived from /sabqah/ which means 'to precede' and
since the action is usually impossible without full speed, this term is
sometimes used in the sense of 'speed', too.

The term /mudabbirat/ is based on /tadbir/ which means 'to mediate upon,
or consider the end of an action', and since foresight causes one to
arrange his affairs in a better manner, this word is used here in that
sense.

Now, with due attention to what was explained about the words concerning
the verses, we are going to proceed with the commentary.

To whom or to what do these five oaths refer? The oaths, at first sight,
seem rather ambiguous, while at the same time this ambiguity stimulates
us to mediate more deeply and thus causes our progressive thinking.

In this regard, commentators have given many different ideas and
commentaries, which mainly revolve around three points:

1. The oaths are aimed at 'angels' who are ordered to tear out the souls
of the wicked and the pagan, violently; those Souls who have never
assumed to submit to the Truth and to the angels who are appointed to
draw out the souls of the blessed, gently and smoothly.

Then, it refers to the angels who move fast and fluently to carry out
the Divine Command. And in so doing, they race each other to fulfill
their errands.

Finally, they arrange the affairs according to Allah’s plan.

2. The oaths refer to the 'stars', which continually set on one horizon
and rise above another.

A group of them moves slowly, but another goes swiftly, from one place
to another, with speed. They are floating above us in immense space,
taking the lead one after another.

And finally, these stars, having their own influence and effect (like
the effect of sunlight and moonlight on the Earth), arrange the affairs
according to Allah’s plan.

3. The oaths are aimed at the fighters of 'Holy War' (Jihad), or at
their horses, and who leave their own houses and cities with expressive
grief, but, then they smoothly and happily leave for the battlefield
taking the lead one after another directing and running the affairs of
war.

On occasion, some commentators have tried to combine these three ideas
by choosing one part from one commentary and another part from another
one, but the framework is the same.[^3]

There is no contrast, of course, among these commentaries and it is
possible that the above verses refer to all of them. But, on the whole,
first commentary, regarding its suitability to the main theme,
Resurrection, and with the traditions by the sinless Imams, seems to be
most fitting.

### The Resurrection Will Happen with a Single Great Blast!

The occurrence of the Resurrection, in the aforementioned verses, was
described as a certain event confirmed by five strict oaths. Now, in the
present verses, some of the signs and incidents on that Great Day are
described.

***“The Day on which everything that can be in commotion will be in
violent commotion,”***

***“Followed by another mighty convulsion".***

The term /rajifah/ is based on /rajf/ which means: 'an agitation or a
violent quake'; and seditious news is called /arajif/, because it causes
a society to become agitated.

The term /radifah/ is derived from /radf/ which means: 'a person or a
thing streaming one after another'.

Many commentators believe that /rajifah/ refers to 'the first Blast of
the trumpet' which is to precede the blast of the quake and the
destruction of the universe, and the term /radifah/ refers to the second
Blast after which the Resurrection will occur and the new life begins.

Therefore, this verse is somewhat similar to what was revealed in Surah
Zumar, No. 39, verse 68, thus:

***“And the Trumpet will (just) be sounded, when all that are in the
heavens and on earth will swoon, except such as it will please Allah (to
exempt). Then will a second one be sounded when, behold, they will be
standing and looking on!"***

Some others have also said that the term /rajifah/ refers to 'the quake
that will destroy the earth' and the term /radifah/ means: 'the quake
that will wreck the sky'. However, the first commentary seems more
appropriate.

***“Hearts that Day will be in agitation,”***

Being anxious for the Reckoning and penalty at the Judgment, the hearts
of the criminals, the sinners and the Unjust will severely tremble.

The term /wajifah/ is derived from /wajf/ which originally means 'to
move fast'; where the term /aujaf/ is used with the meaning of 'to make
a horse or camel move briskly with a bounding pace'; and since a quick
movement causes shaking and anxiety, this word is also used in the sense
of 'violent agitation'.

This inner anxiety is so violent that its effects appear in the whole
body of the sinners.

***“Cast down will be (their) eyes.”***

On that Day, the eyes will subside, coming to a stop and be dazed as if
they are blinded by fear.

Then the scope of the speech changes from the Hereafter to this world.

***“They say (now): What! shall we indeed be returned to (our) former
state?”***

The term /hafirah/ is based on /hafr/ which originally means 'to dig'
and the cavity resulting from this action is called /hufrah/ 'ditch'.
The hoof is also called /hafir/, because it is usually used to dig the
soil. In any event, the term /hafirah/ is metonymically used in the
sense of 'a beginning, or original state, or former condition’.

***“What! when we shall have become rotten bones?”***

This is the very thing that the rejecters of the Resurrection always
used to emphasize on and said that it was not believable that rotten
bones could come to life again, because they imagined that the distance
between rotten bones of dust and living creatures was too far. They had
forgotten that they had been created from that very same dust.

The term /naxirah/ is based on /naxr/ which originally means: 'a rotten
tree which is hollow and makes a whistling sound when the wind blows';
hence, a nasal sound is called /naxir/; and, so, the word has been used
for everything which is rotten and worn.

The unbelievers are not satisfied with the idea of Resurrection, so,
they ridicule it.

***“They said: That then will be a losing return”.***

Commenting on the verse, another probability can come about which is
that they expressed their view in a serious manner. If so, then, they
want to say: 'if there is a return it will be a uselessly repeated one,
which will be injurious'. If this life is good why does Allah not
continue the same one, and if it is bad why is there a return?

Regarding the term /hafirah/ which means: 'a ditch', the sentence

***"Shall we indeed be returned to (our) former state?”***

can, also, be an evidence for this commentary. But, the first is a more
well‑known commentary.

It is worth noting that in the former verses the term /yaquluna/ denoted
that they used to say their words repeatedly, but in the current verse
the word /qalu /shows that they did not always repeat the statement.

At the end of this part, the Resurrection and the occurrence of the
Hereafter is again mentioned in a decisive and shocking tone.

***“But is shall be only a single blast.”***

***“When, behold, they shall be in the awakened state."***

It means that the event of the Resurrection will not be the fruit of a
difficult and complicated action for Allah. It only depends on His
command and when the second blow of the Trumpet occurs all rotten bones,
which are scattered in the earth, will be gathered, revived and raised
from their graves.

The term /zajrah/ means 'to cry for moving', and, here, it means 'the
second blast'.

Regarding the content of the meaning of these two terms

***/zajratun ‑ waĥidah/ 'only a single blast',***

they denote that the Resurrection is a sudden happening and it is easy
for Allah’s Power that with a cry of an order by the angel of the
Trumpet, all the dead come to life again and are present in the
Hereafter for the Reckoning.

The term /sahirah/ is based on /sahar/ which means: 'to sit up at
night', and since this frightful occurrence removes the sleep of night
from the eyes and, moreover, since the land of the Hereafter is
horrible, so, the gathering place, in the Hereafter, is called
/sahirah/. The term is also used for any desert, since, all deserts are
generally frightful and it seems that this fright takes the sleep from
the eyes.

### Pharaoh Used to Say: I Am Your Lord, Most High

After a considerable description in the former verses about Resurrection
and the rejection of the unbelievers, in the following verses the
painful end of Pharaoh, one of the great arrogant blasphemers and rebels
of history, is pointed out, to show Pagan Arabs that those who were
stronger than them could not stand against Allah’s wrath and punishment,
and encourages the believers not to be afraid of the apparent strength
of their enemies, because it is easy for Him to destroy them all.

***“Has the story of Moses reached you?”***

It is interesting that it addresses the Prophet (S) and begins with a
question to attract the attention of the listener in order to make him
ready to hear this wonderful story.

***“When his Lord called to him in the holy valley of Tuwa.”***

'Tuwa' may be the name of a sacred valley just below Mount Sinai, which
was located in Sham (Damascus) between Madyan and Egypt, and where
Moses, subsequently, received, in his heart, the first light of
inspiration.

The term is also mentioned in Surah Ta‑Ha, No. 20, verse 12 where Moses
hears a voice say:

***“Verily I am thy Lord! therefore (in My presence) put off thy shoes:
thou art in the sacred valley Tuwa.”***

Or, it has a descriptive meaning derived from the term /tay/ which means
'the act of rolling up', as if the land is rolled up in holiness and
sanctity, or as Raqib cites: Moses should cover a long distance to be
prepared to receive the inspiration, but Allah rolled up the way and
made it near for Moses to reach the goal.

Then, in three short, but meaningful sentences, it refers to the message
that Allah sent to Moses in that valley where He commanded:

***“Go to Pharaoh, surely he has transgressed all bounds.”***

***“And say to him: 'Wouldst thou that thou shouldst be purified (from
sin?'”***

***"And that I guide thee to thy Lord, so thou shouldst fear (Him)?”***

And, since invitations should be accompanied by reasons, in the next
verse it says:

***“Then did (Moses) show him The Great Sign.”***

The Great Sign, whether being the 'white shining hand' or the rod that
became a 'snake active in motion' or both of them, has been one of the
Great Signs that Moses relied on in the prime of his prophetic mission.

There are some interesting points in these four verses that should be
noted:

1. It says that Moses is told to go to Pharaoh, because he has
transgressed, and this shows that one of the great missions that the
prophets had was to guide the rebels or to oppose them decisively.

2. This invitation to purity, by Moses, with those conciliatory words
and in the most benevolent terms, to Pharaoh, where Allah tells Moses to
go:

***“And say (to him) 'Wouldst thou that thou shouldst be purified (from
sin)’?”***

is similar to the sense found in Surah Ta‑Ha, No. 20, verse 44 which
says:

***“But speak to him mildly...”.***

3. This meaning has a delicate hint to the fact that the goal of the
prophecy of the prophets is to purify men and lead them to their real
purified nature.

By the way, it does not say 'I purify you', it says:

***“...Wouldst thou that thou shouldst be purified?...”,***

which indicates that purification should come about from inside and by
one's own intention; not from an imposition from an outside source.

4. The statement of 'guidance' after mentioning the sense 'to purify' is
a reason for showing that 'purification' is a preliminary step to
'guidance'.

5. The term

***/rabbika/ 'your Lord',***

indeed, is an emphasis on this fact that

***'I take you to Him Who is your master and your cherisher. Why do you
flee from the path of happiness?'.***

6.

***'Fear of Allah'***

is the fruit of guidance. Truly, those who are guided to monotheism feel
responsible before Allah, the Almighty, because fear of Allah never
appears without knowing Him.

That is why in Surah Fatir, No, 35, verse 28 it says:

***“...those truly fear Allah among His Servants, who have
knowledge...”.***

7. First, Moses appeals to Pharaoh's emotional guidance and then, he
evokes his rational and logical guidance by showing him his Great Sign,
his great miracle. The most effective way of preaching is by influencing
emotions and, then, presenting the reasons and evidences.

Now, we will deal with Pharaoh and his reaction to so much affection and
love and the beautiful, reasonable speech and the Great Sign that Moses
showed him.

The fact is that many signs were given, but Pharaoh and his men were
steeped in arrogance.

***“But (Pharaoh) rejected it and disobeyed (guidance)”.***

This shows that rejection is the primary step in transgression, as well
as faith, and admitting the truth is paramount to obedience.

Pharaoh was not satisfied with only rejecting the guidance.

***"Further, he turned his back, striving hard (against Allah)”.***

Since the miracle of Moses threatened the whole devilish unity of
Pharaoh, he sent some men to different cities to gather the sorcerers
and he also ordered to announce people to come to see the challenge
between the sorcerers and Moses.

***"Then he collected (his men) and made a proclamation”.***

Though the term /ĥaŝara/ is mentioned, here, alone, but with reference
to the term /ĥaŝirin/ in Surah Araf, No. 7, verses 111‑112 which say:

***“...and send to the cities men to collect",***

***“And bring up to thee all (our) sorcerers well‑versed”,***

and also referring to the term

***/nada/ 'made a proclamation',***

though it is absolute, it points to the invitation of Pharaoh to the
people to gather and watch the challenge; with the evidence from Surah
Shuara, No. 26, verse 39 which says:

***"And the people were told: Are you (now) assembled?”***

He did not quit with these plots and he made claims with the worst
statements.

***"And said: I am your Lord, Most High.”***

Verily, it is amazing that these arrogant transgressors, when riding on
the horse‑back of pride, know no limit for their selfishness. They are
not content with their claim of being Lord; they want to be 'Lord of
Lords'.

This statement denotes that he says,

***"If you worship idols, it is accepted, but I am the highest of all
and I am your Lord."***

And, it is interesting that Pharaoh, himself, was one of the
idol‑worshippers as Surah Araf, No. 7, verse 127 attests to:

***“...wilt thou leave Moses and his people, to spread mischief in the
land, and so to abandon thee and thy gods?”,***

but here, he claims that he is their Lord, Most High, that is, he
considered himself still higher than his own god; and this is in the
vain statements of all transgressors.

And, more astonishing than this is that in Surah Qasas, No. 28, verse 38
he claims

***“...No god do I know for you but myself...”;***

but in the current verse he goes further and says:

***“I am your Lord, Most High”***

and this is the manner of these air‑headed rebels.

He reached the ultimate point of disobedience and deserved the most
painful punishments. He and his corrupted surroundings should perish by
the order of Allah, that is why, in the next verse, it says:

***“So Allah seized him with an exemplary punishment in the Hereafter
and in this life”.***

The term /nakal/ originally means 'weakness' and 'disability', so it is
said of a person who fails to pay his debt and since the divine
chastisement makes people weak and stops others from doing sin; it is
called /nakal/.

The term /nakal‑al‑axirah/ means 'the chastisement of the Hereafter'
which will envelop Pharaoh and his people and because of its importance
it is mentioned first and the term /ula/ 'former life' which meant 'the
punishment in this world', is mentioned second and is that which
destroyed Pharaoh and all his followers in waters of the sea.

There is another commentary which says that /ula/ means 'the first word
that Pharaoh said claiming to be a deity'[^4], and /axirah/ refers to
the last word that he said in which he claimed that he was their Lord,
Most High. Then, Allah punished him for these two blasphemous
statements, even in this life.

This very idea is narrated in a tradition from Imam Baqir who added that
40 years had elapsed between the occurrence of these two statements
(meaning that Allah did not just punish him to complete the argument).
[^5]

This commentary is more fitting with the term /axatha/ which is a verb
in the past tense, and indicates that the punishment was completely
fulfilled in the present world, and also with the next verse that
considers the event to be a lesson.

***"Surely in that is a lesson for him who fears (Allah)".***

This verse clearly shows that learning a lesson from these events is
possible only for those who, more or less, fear Allah and possess a
feeling of responsibility in their hearts.

Yes, that was the destiny of Pharaoh, the blasphemer; an example to make
other pagans and chiefs of the Arab unbelievers and all those who follow
on the path of Pharaoh, in any age, understand the facts and know that
Allah’s law is always true, firm and unchangeable.

### Explanation: A Small Sample of the Elegance of Holy Qur'an

Careful attention paid to the above eleven short verses is enough to
show us the fine elegance and fluency of Qur'an; a summary of the
statements and activities concerning Moses and Pharaoh the motive of
prophet hood, its aim, the means of purification, the manner of
invitation, kinds of actions and reactions, the description of Pharaoh's
plot, some examples of his vain claims, and, finally, the painful
punishment of this arrogant blasphemer, which can, consequently, teach a
lesson to all those who have insight, are illustrated.

### A Reason For the Resurrection: Are You More Difficult to Create or the Heaven He Built?

With the story of Moses and Pharaoh as a lesson for all transgressors
and rejecters, our attention is turned to the Resurrection. Again, and
the statements are about some attributes of Allah’s infinite Power, as a
proof to the possible existence of Resurrection. These words convey the
explanation of some of the unlimited blessings of Allah endowed to man
to evoke a sense of gratitude, in the soul, which is the origin of
knowing Allah.

At first, it addresses the rejecters of the Resurrection and, in a
scorning tone, questions:

***"Is the creation of you harder or the heaven He built?”***

This statement is, in fact, a reply to their words in the former verses,
thus:

***"They say (now): What! shall we indeed be returned to (our) former
state?"***

Now, this verse says that those who have any degree of understanding
know that the creation of this lofty sky, with so many celestial
gigantic bodies and endless galaxies, is not comparable with the
creation of man. He who has this authority, how could He be unable to
return you to life again?

***"He raised its vault and regulated it”,***

The term /samk/ originally means 'height, or altitude'. It has also been
used with the meaning of 'ceiling'.

In Tafsir Kabir, a commentary by Fakhr‑ud‑din Muhammad Razi, it is said
that when we measure from the top to the bottom of something it is
called depth ('umq), and when we measure it from bottom to top it is
called height (samk).[^6]

The term /sawwaha/ is based on the term /taswiyah/ which means 'to make
level or equal, to proportion something'. It refers, here, to the
accurate regularity that dominates all the celestial bodies; and, if
/samk/ means 'ceiling' refers to the thick atmosphere which, like a hard
and safe shield, has surrounded the earth and protects it from the rush
of meteorites and fatal cosmic rays.

Some have considered the above sense to mean the globular form of the
atmosphere that covers all around of the earth. They believe that using
the term, with the sense of 'equal', refers to the equal distance
between the parts of the ceiling and its center, that is the Earth; and
this cannot exist, but only by being globular.

It is also probable that the verse points to both the height of the sky
and the extreme long distance of the celestial bodies from us, and the
safe vault around the Earth.

In any case, this verse is similar to what Surah Momin, No. 40, verse 57
says:

***"Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth is a greater
(matter) than the creation of men; yet most men understand not".***

***"And He made dark its night and brought forth its daylight."***

Each of these two has an extraordinary important role in the life of any
living creature whether animal or plant. Man cannot live without
sunlight, because all of his sustenance, his senses and movement depend
on it, as well as his life is not possible without the darkness, which
is the cause of his tranquility.

The term /aghţaŝa/ is based on /ghaţŝ/ with the sense of 'dark' but,
Raqib cites in his book, Mufradat, that its origin is /aghţaŝ/, which
means 'a person who has weak or dim eyes'.

The terms /wa duĥa/ means 'when the full brightness of the sun spreads
in the heaven and over the earth.'

***"And the earth, after that He spread it out".***

The term /duĥa/ is derived from /daĥw/ which means 'to spread, to
expand'. Some have also rendered it to mean 'to move something from its
original place'. And since these two meanings are interdependent, they
return to one root.

The objective meaning of /daĥw‑ul‑ard/ is that, at first, the surface of
the Earth was totally covered with water from the prime rainfalls, the
water of which was gradually sucked down through the holes and ditches
in the ground, and then, parts of the land appeared. It expanded little
by little, until it formed its present state. (And this happened after
the creation of heavens and the Earth.)

***“He brought forth from it its water and its pasture”.***

This idea shows that there was water stored in the layers of the earth.
Then, it appeared flowing over the ground in the form of springs and
streams and forming the seas and lakes.

The term /mar 'a/ is a place‑noun and means 'pasture'. It is originally
derived from /ra'y/ in the sense of 'animal protection' from the point
of view of foodstuff or, feeding cattle, or in other respects; then the
term /mura'at /has been used in the sense of protection and arranging
the affairs.

The known proverb:

*“Each of you all is a shepherd and responsible,”*

is, also, a reference to the necessity of people needing to be protected
by each other.

Even though different factors, such as continuous storms, gravitational
pull; caused by the sun or the moon having an effect on the surface of
the land, and earthquakes; produced from the pressure of the inner
molten lava of the earth, could disturb the peace and calmness of the
ground, it became still and peaceful due to the existence of high
mountain ranges throughout the earth.

***“And the mountains, He set them firm”***

***“For use and convenience to you and your cattle”.***

Yes, He raised the vault of the sky, and set the light and darkness
regular. He expanded the earth, and put forth water and plants from it.
He made the mountains over the face of the earth to protect it;
preparing everything for the life of man, so that all of them obey and
are at His service.

The reason is that man enjoys the bounties of life and should be
grateful to Allah, Who created them all, and obey His laws.

These affairs are, on the one hand, the kinds of power He has over the
Resurrection and, on the other hand, they refer to some reasons and
signs along the path of the existence of unity and knowing Allah.

### Those Who Restrain Their Soul From Low Desires

To continue stating the details of the Resurrection, mentioned in the
former verses, the following verses refer to the subject, again, and
explain the destiny of those who fear Allah and of those who disobey and
follow their low desires.

***"But when the great calamity comes"***

The term /ţammah/ is derived from /ţamm/ which originally means 'to
fill', and anything which is in a high state is called /ţammah/; hence,
it is used for the great and difficult events and also for the grievous,
disastrous happenings to come. Here, it refers to the Hereafter, which
is full of horrible incidents.

It is characterized by the word

***'great'***

as an emphasis on the importance of this unique event.

***"That Day man shall remember what he strove for”.***

But what is the use of this remembrance? How could it be helpful to him?
If he asks to return to this world to recompense the past, his request
will be denied and the reply will be: 'Nay!'.

If he repents for the pardoning of his evil deeds, it will be useless,
since it will be too late for it.

Then, he can do nothing, but regret and as the Qur'an says:

***"The Day that the wrongdoer will bite at his hands...”.***[^7]

It should be noted that the term /yatathakkaru/ is a verb in the future
tense, which usually expresses the constancy of an action, i.e. on that
Day man will constantly remember all his deeds because on that Day the
hearts and the souls of men will be unveiled and all the hidden facts
will be made manifest.

***"And Hell‑fire shall he manifest for him who sees”.***

Hell exists at the present time. Furthermore, according to Surah
Ankabut, No. 29, verse 54:

***“But, of a surety, Hell will encompass the rejecters of Faith!”,***

however, the curtains of this world hinder it to be seen; hence, on the
Day of Judgment, that is, the Day of the manifestation of everything,
Hell becomes apparent and the most clearly visible.

The words

***/liman yara/ ‘for him who sees'***

denote that Hell, on that Day, will be so visible that everyone who has
the ability to see, and with no exception, will see it. It will be
covert neither to the righteous nor to the evildoers, whose abode
is‑Hell.

It is, also, probable that the words refer to those who have eyes to see
with on that Day, because according to Surah Ta‑Ha, No. 20, verse 124,
some will be blind then:

***“...and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Judgment”.***

But the first meaning which is accepted by many commentators seems more
fitting, because Hell, for the evildoers, is a punishment and a doubled
penalty. That some of them will be blind, perhaps, occurs at some
definite sites in the Hereafter, not everywhere.

Then, attention is paid to the status of sinners and unbelievers in the
Hereafter and, in a few short, but meaningful sentences, both the
destiny of theirs and its causes are expressed:

***“Then as for him who transgressed”,***

***“And had preferred the life of this world,”***

***“Then surely Hell‑fire will be the Abode”.***

In the first sentence, their corrupted belief is referred to since
transgression originates from self‑complacence and self‑conceit, which,
itself, is caused by the absence of knowledge of Allah.

One who knows Allah, the Almighty, finds himself insignificant and never
rejects his servitude.

The second sentence points to their corrupted deeds, because
transgression causes man to consider the glitter of the lusts of this
scintillating world his highest values and prefers it to everything
else.

These two, in fact, are the 'cause and effect' of each other.
Transgression caused by corrupted belief is the source of corrupted
deeds and also preferring this fleeting life to all, brings about the
blazing fire of Hell.

Hazrat Ali (as) has said:

*“He who transgresses, goes astray and acts not reasonably”.*[^8]

This is because of self‑complacence in which man acknowledges his low
desires and conceives them as being valuable.

Then, through two short and extremely meaningful sentences, it
characterizes the Blessed, thus:

***“And as for him who feared his Lord's presence and restrained the
soul from the low desires...***

***“Then surely the Garden will be the Abode”.***

Yes, the first condition of being 'blessed’ is 'fear' caused by
'knowledge' knowing the presence of the Lord and being afraid of
disobeying His command. The second condition, which is, indeed, the
fruit of knowledge and fear of Allah, is restraining the soul from
rebellion, since, all the sins, corruption’s and disasters, come from
low desires which is the worst god worshipped in the world.

The means of Satan to influence in man's entity, is still 'low desire'.

It is this inner evil that opens the gate for the outer Evil to come in,
or else this case would never be possible, as Surah Al‑Hijr, No. 15,
verse 42 says:

***“For over My servants no authority shalt thou have, except such as
put themselves in the wrong and follow thee”.***

### Explanations

#### What is the meaning of “the Presence of the Lord”?

It is worthy to note that in Verse 40, of the current Surah, it says:

***"...as for him who feared his Lord's presence…”***

but it does not say: 'as for him who feared his Lord'. Then, what is
'the

***Lord's presence'?***

The following are some different commentaries to be considered:

1. It means 'the halting‑places in the Hereafter' wherein man stands in
front of the Lord for Judgment.

Therefore, 'the

***Lord's presence'***

is in the sense of 'his presence with his Lord', i.e. the standing of
man before his Lord.

2. It points to 'Allah’s knowledge and His protection' for all human
beings; as Surah Ra'd, No. 13, verse 33 says:

***“Is then He Who standeth over every soul (and knoweth) all that it
doth, (like any others)?”***

The next evidence to this commentary is the tradition that has been
narrated from Imam Sadiq who said:

***“He who knows that Allah sees him, hears what he says, knows what he
does regarding good or evil, and this consciousness keeps him away from
doing wrong, it is he who’...feared his Lord's presence and restrained
the soul from the low desires'”.***

3. It means 'His Justice' since His Holy Essence is not frightening. The
fear is for His Justice. In fact, this fear is obtained from the
comparison between our actions and His Justice. Criminals tremble when
they see the just judge, and fear when they hear the words 'court and
Judgment', while an innocent person feels no fear of any of them.

These three commentaries do not contrast with each other and all of them
may be gathered in the meaning of the verse.

#### The Relation Between the Rebels and Worldliness

In fact, the above verses clearly and in a beautiful style illustrate
the principles of both man's happiness and adversity. The adversity of
man is considered in his worldliness, and his happiness is found in his
fear of Allah and the absence of low desires; the whole of which is the
extract and essence in the teachings of all Prophets and Saints.

A tradition from Hazrat Ali (as) says:

*“O' people what I fear most about you are two things: acting according
to desires and extending of hope. As regards acting according to
desires, this prevents from truth; and as regards extending of hopes, it
makes one forget the next world.”*[^9]

Low desires put a curtain over man's mind, decorates his evil deeds to
seem good in his sight, robs him of the sense of recognition; which is
the greatest gift of Allah, is the privilege of man over animal, and
makes him preoccupied with himself.

This is the very thing that Jacob, the conscientious prophet, told his
guilty children:

***“...Nay, but your minds have made up a tale (that may pass) with
you...”***[^10]***.***

There are many things to say in this regard, but we will conclude this
subject with two traditions from Ahlul Bayt (as) containing many facts.

Imam Baqir has said:

*“Paradise is covered in pain and patience. Then he who shows patience
in suffering and toils in this life, will enjoy Heaven. Hell is covered
in (unlawful) pleasures and lusts. Then, he who leaves his soul in them,
will enter into the fire.*[^11]

Imam Sadiq has said:

*“Don't let the soul free in its low desires. Surely low desires cause
the death of the soul, and if you leave the soul free in its low
desires, it causes pain for it, and keeping it apart from its low
desires is a remedy for it"*[^12]*.*

Not only is the fire of the Next World the fruit of lusts and low
desires, but, it is also the blazing fires of this world, such as:
insecurities, chaos’s, wars, murders, conflicts, hatreds and vengeance’s
which totally originate from them.

#### There are only Two Groups

In the above verses people are categorized in only two groups: the
worldly rebels and the pious who fear Allah. The permanent abode of the
first group is Hell, and the eternal site of the second group is Heaven.

Of course, there is, here, a third group who are not mentioned in these
verses. They are those guilty believers, of minor sins, through human
frailty, who had repented and been forgiven and if they deserve it will
join the blessed, and if not, will enter Hell, but, they will not be
there for ever.

### Only Allah knows the Final Hour, the Resurrection.

In the aforementioned verses the Hereafter and the destiny of the
righteous and the wrongdoers, on that Day, is described and, now, in the
following verses the focus is on the common question of the rejecters of
the Resurrection.

It says:

***“They ask you about the Hour, When will it come to pass?”***

Answering this question, to make them understand that no one knows when
the final Great Event will take place, the Holy Qur'an addresses the
Prophet (S) and says:

***“Wherein art thou (concerned) with the declaration thereof?”***

When the date of the occurrence of the Hereafter is hidden even from the
Prophet, then the status of others is obvious. This is of the knowledge,
which is hidden and exclusively belongs to Allah. It is out of reach for
all.

It is mentioned, repeatedly, that one of the things that are veiled for
everyone is the exact time of the Hereafter whose training effect is not
possible save being secret; since, if the exact time appointed for it
were revealed and it were far away, everyone would sink deeply in
negligence; and if it were near, avoiding sin would be done confusingly
and far from free‑will and intention, both of which are worthless from
the point of training.

There have been other probabilities cited, also, and among them is that:
'you were not appointed in order to tell the time of the occurrence of
the Hereafter but, you are appointed to inform others of its existence
and that it will certainly happen.

Moreover, 'your appointment shows that the Day of Judgment is coming
nearer'.

So, the Holy Prophet (S) is reported to have said, showing his two
forefingers:

*“My appointment and the Hour are like these.”*[^13]

But the first commentary is the most appropriate.

***"With thy Lord is the limit fixed therefor”.***

It is only He Who knows the Hour. No man knows the mystery and no effort
and endeavor is useful for finding the answer.

This is the same idea that Surah Luqman, No. 31, verse 34 says:

***“Verily the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah (alone)...”***

And, again, from Surah Araf, No. 7, verse 187:

***“...Say: 'the knowledge thereof is with my Lord (alone)...”***

Some have said that the objective point of the above sentence is that
the actual occurrence of the Hereafter is under His control, and the
sentence is a statement for the cause of what is said in the previous
verse. To combine these two commentaries is possible, too.

***"You are but a Warner to him who fears."***

'Your duty is only to warn them and you are not responsible to tell them
the final Hour.'

It is worthy to note that the warning referred to, here, is only to
those who fear that Day and this is similar to what Surah Baqarah, No.
2, verse 2 says:

***"This is the Book; in it is guidance without doubt, to those who fear
Allah”.***

These kind of statements refer to the fact that when there is an absence
in the soul for seeking the right and the truth and a lack of the sense
of responsibility in front of Allah exists, then, man neither goes in
search of the heavenly books for information about the Resurrection nor
does he listen to the warnings of the Prophets and Saints.

Finally, to express that there is not a great deal of time until the Day
of Judgment, it says:

***"It shall seem to them on the day when they behold it, as though they
tarried not (in their graves) but an evening or a forenoon”.***

The length of the life, in this world, is so short and the period of the
intermediate state (Barzakh) passes so quickly, that when they rise,
again, for the Day of Judgment the whole period seems to them as if it
were only a few hours.

This idea, that the life in this world is short and fleeting, is both
practical and true and, in comparison with the Hereafter and the life of
the whole Universe, it is like a moment.

The term /'aŝiyyah/ means 'evening', and /duha/ is used for 'a period
when the sun has come up and its beam of light has spread'.

Some verses of the Qur'an indicate that on the Day of Judgment the
sinners will talk about the length of their stay in partition
(purgatory) or their life in this world, in this manner:

***“In whispers will they consult each other: 'Ye tarried not longer
than ten (days)”***[^14]***.***

But those of them who think more soundly say:

***“...their leader most eminent in conduct will say: 'Tarried not
longer than a day!”***[^15]***.***

In another sura, it narrates the sinners idea:

***"On the Day that the Hour (of reckoning) will be established, the
transgressors will swear that they tarried not but an
hour...”***[^16]***.***

The difference between these various statements is that the sinners want
to compare the shortness of this time with an approximate length of
their stay, therefore, each of them states his own feelings, and they
all have one thing in common which is that the shortness of life in this
world is compared to the life in the Hereafter. This, of course, is a
matter that shakes man, and awakens him from the sleep of negligence.

### Supplication

*O Lord! Gift us the calmness and tranquility on that Great Day' in
partition (purgatory) and in this world.*

*O Lord! No one can erase the troubles of that Great Day, but by your
Grace. Then, we seek your holy Grace.*

*O Lord! Lead us so that you put us among those who fear your presence
and restrain their soul from low desires and will reside in eternal
Heaven.*
