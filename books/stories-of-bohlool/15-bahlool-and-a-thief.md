Bahlool and a Thief
===================

One day Bahlool was wearing new shoes. He went to the mosque for
prayers. He saw a man staring at his shoes. Bahlool understood that he
wanted his new shoes. Helplessly, Bahlool stood for Salat (prayer) with
his shoes on.

The thief said, “Salat (prayer) isn't done with shoes on.”

Bahlool replied, “I won't have my Salat (prayer), but I will have my
shoes.”
