Publisher's Foreword
====================

***In the Name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful***

We express our gratitude to Allah, the most Glorified, the One Who can
grant us success in publishing this book, Contemporary Man and the
Social Problem **(** **الإنسان المعاصر و المشكلة الاجتماعية** **)**
which was written by the great scholar, martyr and Islamic thinker,
Sayyid Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr and translated by Mr. Yasin T. al-Jibouri.
This is his third book, after The Revealer, the Messenger and the
Message" **(** **المرسل و الرسول و الرسالة** **)** and *A General
Outlook at Rites* **(** **نظرة عامة في العبادات** **),** the publication
and distribution of which has been undertaken by our Organization,
W.O.F.I.S.

In the Preface to the translation of *The Revealer, The Messenger and
The Message*, we wrote a biography of the eminent author; and in the
foreword to this book—*Contemporary Man and the Social Problem*—, the
author himself discusses its subject matter. Therefore, there is no need
to repeat what we have written before about the author or what the
author himself has written (in his foreword) about this book. It is from
Allah, the Almighty, that we seek help, and we rely on Him for
accomplishment, success and support; surely He is the Lord and the best
to help.
