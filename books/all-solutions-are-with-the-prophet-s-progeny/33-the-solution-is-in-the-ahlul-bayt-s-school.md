The solution is in the Ahlul Bayt’s school
==========================================

Whoever observes the school of the Ahlul Bayt (a.s.), concerning the
Islamic education, shall find sufficient solutions that Allah the
Almighty has legislated for His people to make religion easy for them
and within the reach of everyone - young or old.

Allah the Almighty says:

***He has not laid upon you any hardship in religion.*** ***Qur'an,
22:78***

***Allah desires ease for you, and He does not desire for you
difficulty.*** ***Qur'an, 2:185***

***Allah does not impose upon any soul a duty but to the extent of its
ability***. ***Qur'an, 2:286***

To relieve from hardship
------------------------

This is the general rule in Islam; every hardship is kept away, every
difficulty is disliked, and every strait is prohibited. If it is so,
then what is the strictness there for, that which we find in the books
of jurisprudence among all Muslims?

If a Muslim reads some chapters on *wudhu’* or *ghusl* (ritual wash or
bath), he feels that jurisprudents have added difficulty to the
easiness, and imposed on man more than his capacity.

It is known in the school of the Ahlul Bayt (a.s.) through traditions
narrated by them from their grandfather the Prophet Muhammad (S) that
“*Wudhu’ is two washes and two wipes; to wash the face and the hands,
and to wipe (with the wet remaining in the hands) the head and the
feet*.”
