Ziyarah of Believers
====================

Islam highly encourages one to visit his/her Muslim brother/sister.
However, it does not emphasize on any kind of ziyarah whatsoever. It
encourages meaningful ziyarah- ziyarah with a purpose and aim. Observe
the following traditions: Imam al-Sadiq ('a) is reported to have said:

<p dir="rtl">
قَالَ تَزَاوَرُوا فَإِنَّ فِي زِيَارَتِكُمْ إِحْيَاءً لِقُلُوبِكُمْ
وَذِكْراً لأحَادِيثِنَا وَأَحَادِيثُنَا تُعَطِّفُ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَى
بَعْضٍ فَإِنْ أَخَذْتُمْ بِهَا رَشَدْتُمْ وَنَجَوْتُمْ وَإِنْ
تَرَكْتُمُوهَا ضَلَلْتُمْ وَهَلَكْتُمْ فَخُذُوا بِهَا وَأَنَا
بِنَجَاتِكُمْ زَعِيمٌ.
</p>

'Visit one another, for verily in your visitation is the revival of
your hearts, and a remembrance of our speeches; our speeches make you
harbor affection for one another; and if you act according to them, you
would be guided and saved, and if you shun them, you would go astray and
perish; therefore follow them while I guarantee your salvation.'[^21]

And Imam al-Baqir ('a) is reported to have said:

<p dir="rtl">
تَزَاوَرُوا فِي بُيُوتِكُمْ فَإِنَّ ذَلِكَ حَيَاةٌ لاَمْرِنَا رَحِمَ
اللَّهُ عَبْداً أَحْيَا أَمْرَنَا.
</p>

'Visit one another in your homes for surely in that is the life of our
affair; may Allah's Mercy be upon one who revives our affair.'[^22] It
should be noted that the revival of the affair discussed in the above
traditions is nothing but the revival of Islamic values, for the Ahl
al-Bayt ('a) are protectors of Islamic values and to remember them and
their teachings is to elevate the human spirit in reality. One should
not conjecture that there is any personal again that these infallible
leaders of truth derive from such gatherings. Rather it is their
followers who benefit.

Another important point to bear in mind is that 'the revival of their
affair' cannot be mereby achieved by thoughts and words.We must sow the
seeds of resolution in our visitations to reap the fruits of applying
the teachings of the Ahl al-Bayt ('a).

So far ziyarah has been reduced to visitation in the earthly abode. The
Islamic worldview, however, due its sharp and accurate cognition of
reality as taught by the Holy Qur'an, the Holy Prophet (s) and his
infallible successors, does not limit ziyarah to the corporeal reality.
It rather believes that human beings can communicate with those who have
transcended this limited world of matter and can listen to them as well.
In our daily prayer, we address the Holy Prophet (s) as follows:

<p dir="rtl">
السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللَّهِ
وَبَرَكَاتُهُ.
</p>

Peace be unto you O Prophet and may Allah's Mercy and Blessings be on
you.[^23]

This statement presumes the presence of the mukhatab (the addressee).
And therefore we believe that the Prophet (s) is present and can behold
our presence too.

One of the important etiquette of entering the shrine of the Holy
Prophet (s) and the infallible Imams of the Ahl al-Bayt ('a) is to read
the well-known idhn al-dukhul (recital of permission to enter). The
za'ir (visitor) adopts a very humble attitude, and appreciating the
presence of the Holy Prophet (s) seeks his permission to enter his
hospice. In this well-known recital, we say:

<p dir="rtl">
...واَعْلَمُ اَنَّ رَسُولَكَ وَخُلَفَائَكَ عَلَيْهِمُ السّلام اَحْياَء
عندك يُرزَقون، يَرونَ مَقَامِي وَيَسْمَعُوْنَ كَلاَمِي، وَيَرُدّوْنَ
سَلاَمِي... .
</p>

…and I know that Your Apostle and vicegerents (upon whom be peace) are
alive, receiving sustenance in Your neighborhood, they see where I stand
presently, and hear my speech and respond to my salutation…[^24]

Unlike those who consider the human being as an entity which perishes
after this worldly death, Islam teaches mankind that death is a
purgatory and bridge to the realm beyond. In fact, to be more accurate,
death is "tearing of some veils" from the final result of the reality of
every thing. Great people like Imam 'Ali ('a), due to their intense
purity, could boldly claim that they can behold the ultimate form of the
reality of this world while they still exist in this earthly abode. In
one of his famous dictums, Imam 'Ali ('a) is reported to have said:

<p dir="rtl">
لَوْ كُشِفَ الغطاء مَا ازْدَدْتُ يقينًا.
</p>

If the curtains were unveiled nothing would be added to my
conviction.[^25]

The tearing of veils, however, should not be considered as being
limited to the Prophets (upon whom be peace) and infallible Imams ('a).
Those human beings who are entirely submissive to the laws of Almighty
Allah and have purified their hearts can also enjoy such exalted
positions. In fact, Almighty Allah calls the human beings to appreciate
the kernel of this word in the following verse:

<p dir="rtl">
أَوَلَمْ يَنْظُرُوا فِي مَلَكُوتِ السَّماواتِ وَالارْضِ.
</p>

And do they not look into the kernel of the heavens and the
earth?[^26]

Hence there is an invitation to tear the veils that we have created for
ourselves by sinning. In other interesting dictum of the Holy Prophet
(s) we are told:

<p dir="rtl">
لَوْلا أَنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ يَحُومُونَ عَلَى قُلُوبِ بَنِي آدَمَ
لَنَظَرُوا إِلَى مَلَكُوتِ السَّمَاوَاتِ.
</p>

Was is not for the Satans circling around the hearts of the off-springs
of Adam, they would have beheld the kernel of the heavens and the
earth.[^27] Therefore, the more purity we enjoy, the better can we
communicate with those exalted spirits who have left this material
world, are alive in the real sense of the word, and due to their exalted
station of existential mediation (about which we shall soon discuss in
detail) can influence the world of contingent existence and even benefit
us in different ways. There have been ample narratives indicating how
people visited the shrines of the Ahl al-Bayt ('a) and solved very great
problems in life.

Our aim of ziyarah, however, must transcend seeking personal benefits.
It is therefore important to first define the purpose of ziyarah, and
the reason why our holy Imams ('a) would teach us particular recitals
for visiting the tomb of their grandfather Imam al-Hussein ('a). Of
course this does mean that one should not seek personal benefits from
the great personalities, but he/she must at least have realized the
ultimate purpose of ziyarah.

It is through such realization, my brothers and sisters, that rain
falls from the hearts and embraces every human being, rather every
creature beyond time and place. Such realizations tear the veils of the
past and future, and release the human being in the world of perpetual
bliss and ecstasy. Soon the reader shall understand the words of this
nondescript, for the world of Ahl al-Bayt ('a) is a world yet unknown.
Their followers have no share save appreciating the tip of the
iceberg:

Imam 'Ali ('a) is reported to have said to Abu Dharr:

<p dir="rtl">
اعْلَمْ يَا أَبَا ذَرٍّ أَنَا عَبْدُ اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ
وَخَلِيفَتُهُ عَلَى عِبَادِهِ لا تَجْعَلُونَا أَرْبَاباً وَقُولُوا فِي
فَضْلِنَا مَا شِئْتُمْ فَإِنَّكُمْ لا تَبْلُغُونَ كُنْهَ مَا فِينَا وَلا
نِهَايَتَهُ.
</p>

Know O Aba Dharr that I am [only] a slave of Allah and His vicegerent
over His servants; do not consider us as Lords and you may say whatever
you want about our merits, for you cannot appreciate the essence of our
perfection, nor its zenith…[^28]

And in another tradition he ('a) is reported to have said:

<p dir="rtl">
لا يُقَاسُ بِآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ (ص) مِنْ هَذِهِ الأمَّةِ أَحَدٌ.
</p>

...None from this Ummah can be compared with the progeny of Muhammad
(upon whom be peace)…[^29]
