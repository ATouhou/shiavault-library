***In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the most Compassionate***

***“By the token of time,***

***Verily Man is in loss,***

***Except those as have faith,***

***and do righteous deeds,***

***and join in mutual teaching of truth,***

***and of patience, and constancy.”***

***Qur’an, Surah al- ‘Asr, 103***

Like the soul longing for its Creator,  
 our work is dedicated to  
 the One and Only,  
 Allah.

I’d like to thank my husband, Hassan,  
 my children Ali, Lena, and Dena,  
 my parents,  
 and my teacher Sayyid Moustafa.

Without your patience it would not have been possible.

Thank You,  
 Fatma
