Most Reverred Zainab (‘a) Returns to Karbala Chehlum
====================================================

("Chehlum jo Karbala mein bahattar ka ho chuka")

The Chehlum[^1] for seventy two martyrs was done

And the bodies and the heads had finally become one

And Husain's slain army was remembered by all

And the children of Muhammad lamented His son

For three days and nights in the desert they mourned

Embracing His tomb as though never to be torn

Hearts lit like candles, their love for Him bloomed

Their sons, like flowers, scattered around His tomb

Remembering those killed, they cried out in grief

And clutched at their hearts and in pain swooned

" Where are those who would protect us?" they cried

"Now we wander, heads bare in broad daylight"

The air fraught with sobs as the widows wept

And the Noble Sister's face on His tomb did rest

And cried "Oh my beloved brother dear Husain

For three days and nights I've been Your guest"

"Heartbroken and forlorn is this Prophet's grandchild

For my services You didn't accept, what a plight"

"The will of the imam, I will gladly accept

But the bruises on my arms I haven't shown You yet

I am alone today, no friend in sight

Without You I am nothing, how can You forget?"

"I've lost sons and brothers and You in this war

my back is bruised with the tip of the spear"

"I cared for the orphans, the fathers lay dead

Their frail ages and captivity, the pain and the dread

To divert them from their misery, I narrated your tale

I was their mother, their aunt, or their father instead"

"And I will live on to see them suffer and die

For it is not my destiny to see beloveds thrive"

" I had imagined pilgrims surrounding Your tomb

And the throng of the angels had lifted the gloom

And in Your memorial, we would all gather here

Yet I see not a soul, I am here alone"

" By your graveside I sit my Brother, and weep

And console my heart though my pain is deep"

Saying this, Zainab inconsolable, sobbed

And the tomb of the Prince shuddered and rocked

And Basheer approached the Prince's son and said

"Oh Imam shall we leaves Your aunt is distraught"

And Abid toward His Aunt did turn

And asked "Dear Aunt shall we return."

And Zainab replied, "As you wish dear Imam"

The preparations to leave for Medina began

The tents were untied and the camels lined up

And around the graves gathered Ali's clan

Bidding farewell to those who slept in their graves

The old and the young stood around in a daze

At the thought of leaving her Brother's tomb

Distraught, Zainab cried " How can I leave You along

In this forsaken desert away from us all

This empty, desolate city now Your home"

"where nothing grows and nothing lives

Such a place You've chosen to gather and rest"

"Oh Noble Lord of Karbala, farewell

Oh the sands that cradle His shroud, farewell

Dear grave of the noble, lofty Prince, farewell

My Brother Your sister departs now, farewell"

"This Prophet's grandchild is unfortunate indeed

For You're not pleased with her deeds"

"How do I face Medina having left You herd

What if the Prophet questions, how can I bear?

If I go to Najaf, the same question I will face

\`Where is Husain?' That is all I will hear"

"You've asked me to leave, so how can I stay?

But where must I go, where must I stay?"

"won't You come, hold my hand as I alight?

Won't You shelter me from strangers' sights?

Won't Abbas or Alder come to bid me farewell?

Won't You bring Asghar for whom Banu cries?"

"You're our leader come lead us ahead

we're ready, yet You sleep, the grave Your bed"

"Although I weep and call out Your name

You do not answer Oh Prince, I'm amazed

if only You would embrace me now

I will leave for Medina, though never the same"

The Prince then answered "My dear Zainab farewell

Give my love to Soghra, my daughter who is ill"

[^1]: The word "Chehlum" or “Arba’in” in Arabic, denotes the traditional
memorial held on the 40th day after death.
