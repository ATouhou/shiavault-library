21. Day Of 15th Shaban
======================

One should prepare even more for supplications on this day than whatever
has been discussed till now because doing so would imply following in
the footsteps of Imam az-Zaman (aj). For, when he (aj) was born, he
prayed for his reappearance while he was in prostration, invoking:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اللهم أنجز لي وعدي، وأتمم لي أمري، وثبت وطأتي، واملا الأرض بي عدلا
وقسطا. 
  </p>
</blockquote>

“O Allah! Fulfill my promise for me, make my footsteps steadfast, and
fill the earth with justice and equity through me.”
