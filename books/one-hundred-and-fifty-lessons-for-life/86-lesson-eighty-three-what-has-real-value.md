Lesson Eighty Three: What Has Real Value
========================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ اللّهَ لا يَنْظُرُ إلَى صُوَرِكُمْ وَ لا إلى أَمْوالِكُمْ وَ
إنَّما يَنْظُر إلى قُلُوبِكُمْ وَ أَعْمالِكُم
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

God does not consider the faces and properties, rather he considers your
hearts and actions.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

While the criterion for evaluating dignity of individuals in most
societies is material wealth and physical privileges, in Islam such
evaluation bases are invalid and worthless. To ascertain what has real
value, we need to look for that which is considered worthy by the
Creator and this is none other than the purity of one’s heart and deeds
. Those who possess the twin treasures of pure thoughts leading to pure
actions are the ones who will be victorious in the divine court.
