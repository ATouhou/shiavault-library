Introduction
============

**In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.**

By the grace of the Almighty Allah (SWT), we indeed have been blessed
with the honour of compiling this booklet for the benefit of those going
to Umrah, Hajj and/or Ziyarat of the Fourteen Masoomeen A.S.

Our first calling for Hajj was in 1983 and since then, we have been
invited back for Hajj and Hajj Umrah over 17 times over the past sixteen
(16) years. We have also had the pleasure of serving thousands of
Momineen and Mominaat, including residents of Canada, United States,
Jamaica, Britain, Australia, Sweden and Germany.

This booklet was designed to provide you with some insight and
clarification as you embark on your spiritual journey.

We sincerely hope this booklet proves to be useful and we ask that you
pass it on to others who, Inshallah, will be fortunate enough to go
also.

We are planning, Inshallah, to reproduce the booklet periodically so you
are requested to advise us of any errors and omissions.

All rights reserved. This book is free for distribution subject to the
condition that no part thereof shall by way of trade or otherwise be
reproduced, resold or otherwise circulated in any form of binding or
cover other than what is published in, without the prior written
permission of the Hajj Assistance Committee North America.

Please remember us in your prayers.

Wa’Salaam
