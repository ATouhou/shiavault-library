The Month of Ramadan and Itikaf
-------------------------------

Imam Sadiq (A.S.) has said: The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his
progeny), initially observed the Itikaf (spiritual retreat) during the
first ten days of the month of Ramadan. Later, he observed it during the
middle ten days of the holy month and finally, he observed it during the
last 10 days of the month and then continued to do so in the last ten
days (for as long as he was alive).*Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 16, pg. 274*
