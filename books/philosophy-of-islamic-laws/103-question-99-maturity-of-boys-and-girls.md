Question 99: Maturity of Boys And Girls
=======================================

**Question:** Physiology has almost proved that there is difference
between males and females from the aspect of their physical and
intellectual capabilities. In spite of this Islam has prescribed the
completion of 9 years as maturity for girls and imposed all religious
duties on them, while for the boys the age of maturity in completion of
15 years. What is the philosophy behind this law?

**Answer:** The only fact proved by scientific research is that a woman
grows faster than man. Therefore the stage which a man reaches at 15
years is reached by a female in 9 years. And this is not confined to
only man and woman. Rather, in animals and plant kingdom also the
weakest of them reach their maturity at the earliest. For example the
Niloufer grows up faster than the Chinar tree.

The gist of this discussion is that the weaker is the creature the
faster is its growth. This is the reason that many girls of 13 or 14
years are capable of motherhood while most of the boys generally haven’t
reach puberty yet at this age.
