H - Harmalah
============

Harmalah Ibn Kahil Al-Asadi Al-Kufi, the killer of the infant of the
Imam. When the Imam had lost all hope in the enemy, he came out riding
on a camel and asked for water, not for himself, but for his small child
who was dying of thirst.

â€˜Umar gave the order and Harmalah sent a three-headed arrow flying into
the little child's neck. Imam Ali Ibn Al- Husayn prayed that Harmalah
not live after that moment. Later on, during the uprising of the
Tawabeen, Al-Mukhtar ordered to cut Harmalah's arms and legs and throw
him in the fire.
