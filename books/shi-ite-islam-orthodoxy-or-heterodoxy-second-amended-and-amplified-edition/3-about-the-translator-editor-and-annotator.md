Dr. John Andrew Morrow is Associate Professor of Languages and
Literature at Eastern New Mexico University in the United States. He has
taught at the University of Toronto, Park University and Northern State
University, and has lectured internationally on the subject of Hispanic,
Native, and Arabic-Islamic Studies.

Dr. Morrow completed his studies at the University of Toronto, where he
received an Honors B.A. in French and Spanish, as well as an M.A. and a
Ph.D. in Spanish American Literature. While Dr. Morrow was an
undergraduate student at Canada’s premiere academic institution, Dr.
Ottmar Hegyi introduced him to Islamic Spain and Aljamiado literature
and encouraged him to pursue its study. It was at the University of
Toronto that Dr. Morrow studied all periods of Spanish and Spanish
American literature, acquired expertise in linguistics, and analyzed the
Arabic influence on Spanish and French literature, as well as the
Amerindian influence on Spanish American literature. Upon completion of
his Ph.D., Dr. Morrow pursued post-doctoral studies in Arabic in Fez,
Rabat, and Bouarfa, Morocco, and at the University of Utah’s Middle East
Center.

At all stages of his studies, Dr. Morrow has combined Hispanic Studies,
Arabic-Islamic Studies, and Native Studies. Besides being trained by
Hispanists who were also Arabists and Orientalists, he has studied the
Islamic Sciences for decades, both independently, and at the hands of a
series of Sunnī, Ṣūfī, and Shī‘ite scholars. As such, he embodies the
best of both Western and Eastern education.
