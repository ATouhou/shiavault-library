**Q. 45: ON WHICH THINGS SAJDAH IS ALL0WED?**

In the book, Digest Peshawar Nights, published by Mis Peer mohamed
Etrahim Trust, Karachi, in Chapter III: (Why Do Shias Perform Sajda
(Prostration) On dust), it is said: "... according to Quranic injunction
prostration must be performed on pure earth which includes dust, stone,
sand and grass and all things that grow from earth,

provided they are not used in eating or wearing." In which Surah I can
find the ayat speaking about that subject? That is the question put by
some Sunni students studying here and I could not show them the Qur'anic
injunction.

A. I could not find here (in London) the original Persian copy of
"Shabha-e-Peshawar" (Peshawar Nights); but I am almost certain that the
mistake has been done by the English translator, not the original
writer. The law, that sajdah should be done on earth or a thing which
grows from earth and is not used in eating or wearing, is based on
ahadith, not on Qur'an. There are scores of ahadith even in Sunni books
to this effect. Some of those books are:

Sahih at-Tirmidhi
Sunan Abu Dawood
Sunan an-Nasa'i
Mustadrak-u-Sahihayn of al-Hakim
Kanzul-'Ummal
al-Musnad of Ahmad ibn Hanbal

**Q. 46.ABOUT 'QASR' PRAYER**

Here in Zanzibar, when our brothers go to a distance of 8 farsakh (= 27
miles 48 yards) or more, they offer Qasr prayer, and break their fast.
Now, the town is Zanzibar, the island is Zanzibar. Even at that distance
they are not out of Zanzibar.How can they break their fast or pray
Qasr?

A. Your brothers' action is absolutely correct. Your confusion arises
because of the sameness of the names. Now if you call the island with
its Swahili name, "Unguja", and speak of the town as "Zanzibar", there
will be no problem at all.

**Q.47. DEMOLISHING OLD MASJID TO BUILD A NEW ONE**

Is erection of a new mosque in place of the old one allowed in sheri'ah
if the old structure is still sound?

If the old mosque building in whatever circumstances has been
demolished, how should the old corrugated sheets, doors, windows, stones
and debris be disposed off? Can a Non-Muslim be employed to demolish a
mosque?

A. Masjid may be demolished if it has become weak or dangerous or if it
is necessary to enlarge the Masjid. Non-Muslim labour should not be used
for demolishing the Masjid, nor should any non-Muslim be allowed to
enter the area of old Masjid, because the site remains Masjid even when
there is no structure on it.

The building material (including stones and debris) of the old Masjid
should be used in other Masjids (even of Sunnis). If this too is not
possible, then it should be sold for use in other religious buildings of
Shi'as or Sunnis or to a Muslim who would know its sanctity. The price
thus realised should be used in new Masjid's construction.

**Q. 48: PRAYER BEHIND A SUNNI IMAM**

On salat, should we pray behind sunni? If so, what about the saying
that those who pray with their hands folded their prayer is not
accepted?

A. There are a few situations when a Shi'a may pray behind a Sunni
Imam. The most obvious case is of taqiyyah when one has to hide his
belief because of danger to his life, property or honour.

Another is the occasion when the Islamic unity has to be demonstrated.
And according to the ruling of Ayatullah al-'Uzma as-Sayyid Abul Qasim
al- Khoui, in all such cases one must recite Surah al-Fatiha and the
other surah (which he is required Not to recite behind a Shi'a Imam).

**Q49. I AM NOT WELCOME AT SUNNI MOSQUES**

From your previous correspondence, it is clear that a Shi'ite is not
prevented from joining Sunni Jamaat prayers. I also realize the emphasis
for Muslims to join Jamaat prayers. Although living near a mosque, I
hesitate in joining congregational prayers for the following reasons:-

a) When the Sunnis see me praying without folding hands, they look upon
me as one gone astray; with the majority turning their eyes on me,
making me uneasy. The same applies when I do masah on feet in ablution
instead of washing legs as they do.

b) In most daily prayers, the Imam prays too quickly for a Shi'ite to
follow him, or to keep pace with him (Imam). For example,the Imam rushes
Surahs to such an extent that he goes to Ruku before the Shi'ite has
even started the surah after surah Fateha. In general, in local Sunni
congregational prayers, there is a tendency of rushing prayers as
compared with strict Shi'ite rules for prayers.

A. In the above circumstances, you may discontinue going to that mosque
at the time of their Jamaat prayers. Please go therein after the people
have gone away. If that too creates difficulties, then stop praying in
that mosque altogether; pray in your home.
