1.0. Introduction
=================

In recent times, there has been a rise in insurgent activities by some
Muslims in various parts of the world such acts being justified as part
of an Islamic jihad. Muslims living in crisis ridden areas such as
Palestine and Iraq refer to their fight as jihad and have taken to
employing tactics not previously known to Islam in their fights. One of
such is the use of suicide bombings. As a phenomenon which is becoming
frighteningly synonymous with Islam, an attempt will be made to analyze
the legality or otherwise of suicide bombing as a tactic in Islamic
jihad and its place in the future of Islam.
