  This book originated in a series of lectures given at Najaf between
  January 21 and February 8, 1970. Three major points emerge from the
  lectures. The first is the necessity for the establishment and
  maintenance of Islamic political power for Islamic goals, precepts, and
  criteria. The second is the duty of the religious scholars (the fuqahƒÅ)
  to bring about an Islamic state. Third, a program of action for the
  establishment of an Islamic state, including various measures for
  self-reform by the religious establishment.
