The Development Of The Concept Of Human Rights
==============================================

**Ayatullah Muhammad ‘Ali Taskhiri**

To avoid any possible ambiguity, which might occur in discussing this
issue, all relevant terms should be first defined. It is evident that
the issue in question finds deeper overtones when it is discussed in
legal terms, especially if this concept is to correspond with
international criteria.

The Relation between two Philosophical and Social Issues
--------------------------------------------------------

In point of fact, for one who wishes to study the concepts of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it might seem strange to
encounter these termss repeatedly without having any explanation for the
truth of their intended meanings.

What is right? Who is this human person we are speaking of? What is the
inherent dignity of man? What is meant by human family, fraternity,
equality, friendly relationship, human morale and the likes?

This ambiguity becomes clear when we realize that this Universal
Declaration is meant to be concerned with man’s life regardless of
philosophical aspects. It is due to the impact of capitalistic
tendencies that this issue discusses social problems aside from
philosophical issues, alleging that there is no connection between these
two whereas we presume there is a logical relationship between these two
issues (social and philosophical). Ideology no matter of what nature it
is gains root in realities and man does not know what he should be
unless he figures out who has entity and what the necessities of truth
are.

This concept is recognized when we presume that man believes in the
divinity of the Almighty and agrees that Allah has sent the holy Prophet
and his manifest faith, Islam for the guidance of mankind. Having
acquired knowledge of this issue, man will face two choices: he either
embraces the Islamic ideology and organizes his affairs on a basis
prescribed by it or casts off his past thoughts after acquiring
certitude. Yes, if man conceives materialistic ideas in his mind, he
will have vicarious ideologies and different gods before him, each one
of which draws him to his own direction,

***“Indeed, We have struck for the people in this Qur’an every manner of
similitude; haply they will remember.” (Surah az-Zumar 39:27)***

Hence, he will find no justification for his inclinations towards any
ideology whatsoever. The late Ayatullah Mutahhari, the celebrated Muslim
sage, states,

“The function of ideology is to create conceptions about the world.
Ideology is practical philosophy and the conception of speculative
philosophy. And practical knowledge is based on a certain kind of
speculative philosophy.”

Martyr Sadr states:

“The social side of life is associated with the facts of life not
properly manifested, save for the time when it is laid upon a basis
which explains its existence, facts and limits; the capitalistic system
has lost this basis, resorting to tricks, deception or impatience.
Besides, the social side of life is blockaded, and the social issue is
studied in isolation.”

The study of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights shows that this
point is totally ignored while it frequently talks about the terms
mentioned above. At all events, we should first know what is right and
who is the human person so that we can recognize the changes in human
rights in a logical manner.

When we refer to the root of the word *right*, we realize that the
minimum implication of the word is that it is not liable to any change.
Hence, only the Almighty is right and knows no change. The news
corresponding with facts is right; there is no change in it. Despite the
futile claims of the relativists, this concept is realistic and there is
no place for mental considerations thereof. However, based on this, the
concept of consideration is removed and this term has taken its place.
It is used in social and individual relations. Thus, social rights
should be based on the following two elements:

I . They should emanate from realism.

2. They should have religious and common agreement so that social life
may be organised.

It may be said that the first factor is per se sufficient to prove truth
but the social reflection causes the second actor to exist. Thus, right
is a natural constant need around which consideration legally exists.

However, we cannot view man as a material being created by nature and
shaped by the environment. According to Durkheim, what gives shape to
man is nothing but social reflexes. According to Freud, man is the
product of his complexes. Marx holds that man is a socio-economic
product. According to Barkley, man is the product of mental beliefs.
Other material ideas are similar.

Considering these opinions, one cannot possibly talk about the rights of
such a man. Can we talk about the rights of iron, wood and water?
Therefore, it is necessary for us to believe that man is totally
different from other things, has his capabilities and inherent
motivations, which he seeks under ceratain circumstances. Besides, he
goes through the stages of growth and development as pre-planned. It is
only under such circumstances that one can conclude that equal rights
may be derived.

With a brief interpretation we must first believe in human innate
disposition so that we may be able to talk of the concepts of human
rights, justice, dignity, equality and human spirit. If we do not
believe in this pure Islamic concept, man’s innate disposition, it would
be meaningless to talk of self-evident concepts, morality, and
motivations.

Thus, there must exist a certain criterion about man so that he can
develop his spiritual faculty and go beyond his *Self*. Hence, the man
for whom one can consider rights is one naturally endowed with inborn
elements. These elements have a certain procedure and if man goes beyond
them, he will lose his human attributes:

***“Be not as those who forgot God, so He caused them to forget their
souls-those, they are the ungodly;” (Surah al-Hashr 59:19)***

***“They are like cattle; nay, rather, they are further astray.” (Surah
al-A’raf 7:179)***

If man is treated in a manner contrary to his essence, that treatment
will be inhumane. For example, we see that when Pharaoh weakened his
people and deprived them of their rights, he was criticised for the
injustice he did to people.

***“Thus did Pharaoh persuade his people to make light [of Moses] and
they obeyed him; verily they were a transgressing people.” (Surah
az-Zukhruf 43:54)***

Pharaoh took away the natural values and rights of people, and so their
rights were violated. With the violation of their rights, the people
become a transgressing people, a people who exceed the bounds of their
humanity.

Thus, we come to understand man and it is not possible to discuss human
rights or the issue of declarations of rights unless on the basis of the
understanding of human nature. Rights that cannot be realized through
materialistic thought.

In the light of what we have come to know by the previous discussion,
human rights may be said to be the natural conditions innately needed by
man in order to proceed on his natural course of evolution towards
perfection. On this basis, human rights go beyond what is allowed by
others who have discussed rights, so that it must include such things as
the right to worship, to be religious, the right to observe the desires
of one’s own nature as a creature of God, and the right to attach
oneself to true religions.

Rights are the basis for important religious discussion of the need for
prophets. Surely, religion has done a favor to man, and surely Allah is
the source of favor and mercy for the raising of the prophets was both
necessary and a favor.

Criteria for Recognizing Human Rights
-------------------------------------

So far such criteria as customs, reason, law, religion, corruption,
pleasure and pain, emotions and the interpretation of justice have been
discussed each of which is taken to be the source of rights or an
element of the source of rights, or of their appearance or necessary
conditions for their appearance. Before determining the proper criteria
of rights, two conditions should be mentioned.

First, what has been mentioned is the concept of man and his rights.
Second, the criteria for rights must be universal and impartial with
respect to color, race and social status or else the connection with
human development and what is essential in human nature will be broken
off. Which criteria can indicate that man’s natural and constant needs
are essential to man and will allow for this development? The only
factor we can find is the human conscience in the general sense, which
includes both conscious awareness and natural conscience.

Even if we limit ourselves to moral conscience, which is something
everyone feels, we will be able to discover the principles of human
rights without any doubt, although there may remain differences about
how they are to be implemented and applied. There are cases which the
moral conscience of man is certain. Conscience is able to uncover
detailed features of rights. On the other hand, if conscience is
ignored, we will be left with the idea of man as nothing more than his
body and will have no standards by which to discover the essence of
humanity. A body without conscience has no humanity; it is like a piece
of wood for which there can be no question of rights.

Let us then turn to the question of what conscience is. Perhaps we
cannot provide a sound proof or demonstration to convince those who
would deny its existence but it is through the conscience that we
discover the basic grounds for all knowledge. Also, it is through
conscience that we recognize good and evil accepted by all and are able
to erect the social structures founded on such recognition.

Perhaps those who have written the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
have employed the innate elements of conscience, but unconsciously
isolated the issue of rights from that of conscience. It is conscience
which emphasizes that some things are good or bad, some actions just or
unjust. Conscience affirms the right to life, the right of freedom, and
the right of human dignity and equality with regard to race or color.
These are recognized by conscience as general human rights.

Likewise, conscience is able to recognize more specific rights of
mothers, the rights of women and of men and of nations. There are two
ways to come to understand the ramifications of rights. First, one may
study and observe all human behavior in detail, so that the conscience
may make judgements where appropriate. It may be practically impossible
to carry out such a study in the detail necessary to understand the
common features of humanity, and the needs arising under specific
circumstances. Second, one may seek the guidance of religion. Religion
provides directions for the human intellect so that he may discover the
secrets of the enchanting system of being and the Absolute Perfect Being
who created this existence and guides it.

This Absolute Being innately rich and aware, extant and subtle, has
raised the prophets in accordance with His mercy to provide a religion,
to make evident the detailed features of social rights as an optimal way
to realize the development and perfection of mankind. But if someone
rejects religious beliefs or seeks to let the inner essence of man
suffice as a guide, the shortcomings that ensue will prevent him from a
logical understanding of human rights and morality.

The Historical Course of Human Rights
-------------------------------------

It is generally accepted that religion and man’s moral conscience have
had a profound impact on the course of human rights through history-even
at the level of myths.

The late Ayatullah Ja’fari has pointed out that it is obvious that the
aim of human relations is to create a practical respect for human rights
in the minds of the progressive thinkers, and this is why we see some
such expressions appear in the form of moral or legal considerations and
others as cultural factors common among different nations and races. (1)

George Sabyan states that in general, the Greeks of the fifth century BC
believed that natural rights are constant and eternal, whereas man and
his conditions are changeable; so, if we could discover this constant
and unchangeable law, and make it cohere with human life, man’s
activities would become logical and reasonable and evil and corruption
would be diminished. In the light of this view, perfection would consist
in adherence to the natural eternal law. The aim of this theory may be
summarized as a search for the eternal among the changing and for unity
among multiplicity. (2)

If we review the theories of philosophers and historians throughout
history, we will encounter numerous expressions that manifest these
features. In the same manner, Cicero emphasizes the fact that rights or
laws are not based on the imagination, but on an eternal natural justice
inherent in the human conscience. (3)

Historians and students of law have tended to ignore the influence of
Islam over a prolonged period which continued up to the eighteenth
century when the French jurists issued the Declaration of Human Rights
of 28 August, 1789 which reflected the French constitution of 3
September 1791. After that they neglected the guiding light of Islam
that provides the best­ detailed laws for man in the exalted teachings
of the holy Qur’an and the noble traditions of the holy Prophet.

The light of Islam was the basic foundation for all approaches to the
laws among the Muslims. The recent Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in
Islam is merely a well-written form of that fundamental law. The
historical and legal foundations for a proper understanding of human
rights are to be found in the verses of the Qur’an such as these:

***“And indeed, We have honored the children of Adam.”*** ***(Surah
al-Isra 17:70)***

***“O you men! Surely We have created you of a male and a female and
made you tribes and families that you may know each other; surely the
most honorable of you with Allah is the one among you most careful of
his duty.” (Surah al-Hujurat 49:30)***

***“He who murders a person it is as if he had murdered all mankind and
he who saves a human life it is as if he had saved a whole nation.”
(Surah al-Ma’idah 5:32)***

In addition to such verses, the traditions attributed to the great
prophet and His Progeny have also had a deep influence on Islamic
thought. However, if we want to study the recent course of legal
thought, we must admit that the French declaration has had a tremendous
impact although it also makes use of the British Universal Declaration
of Human Rights and the American Declaration of Independence of thirteen
colonies which had been composed thirteen years earlier.

In article one, it enunciates the right to freedom and equality, article
two, the right to freedom, ownership, security, and defence against
oppression, article three, granting people’s rights, article four,
emphasis on non-belligerent personal freedoms, article five, granting
the right to elimination inflicting injury, article six, the recognition
of the participation in formulating laws for everyone, article seven,
the right to equality before the law and impartiality of job, article
eight, the declaration of prohibition of illegal punishments, article
nine, the emphasis on justifying the convict until he is pronounced
guilty, article ten, the freedom of opinion, article eleven, the freedom
of expression, article twelve, the idea of guaranteeing the right to
form armed forces, article thirteen, the legality of demanding tax for
supporting the needs of this organization, article fourteen, the
granting of the right of the supervision of people over professions,
article sixteen, the credit of the societies that do not approve human
rights, and emphasizing the principle of separation in societies in
which there is no constitution, article seventeen, the illegality of
confiscation of properties unless it is to the benefit of the common
people.

Finally, after the Second World War, on December 17, the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights was approved by the United Nations; in
general, 48 member states accepted it and the communist countries
(Russia, White Russia, Ukrain, Chekslovakia, Yuguslavia, and Poland),
South Africa and Saudi Arabia refused to accept it.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not regard
any relation between the reality and the society while the Islamic
declaration has placed emphasis on this relation. Thus, it is logical in
itself and the principles set therein.

The Universal Declaration proposes the following principles in its
preamble:

1. The recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and
inalienable right of all people as the foundation of freedom, justice,
and peace in the world

2. The barbarous acts resulting from the official recognition of human
rights

3. The advent of a new world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom
of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want as the highest
aspiration of the people

4. The essentiality of preserving human rights so that they may not have
recourse to rebellion against aggression and tyranny.

5. The essentiality to promote the development of friendly relations
between nations and better standards of life

6. The promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights
and fundamental freedoms

7. The need for achieving a common understanding of these rights and
freedoms

What is the inherent dignity of man? Is it innate? If such is the case,
how can we propose this declaration before a world teeming with material
thoughts contrary to the theory of innateness? What are the features
distinguishing barbarous acts from human behavior? Can we come to an
optimistic criterion without believing the theory of human development?
Has there been any study on human desires to clarify that the desires
are limited to freedom of expression and opinion and freedom from want
and poverty? Is it right to limit the human desires for the freedom of
expression? Are not the surface and the deep structure mixed up? Can we
say that human desires should be derived from the necessary needs?

If such is the case, we shall say: does not man tend to come to the full
understanding of the absolute being manifested through the general study
of the history of man? Besides, is this man’s desire at stake of a
multidimensional moral system? Where has it been talked of? Does letting
individual freedoms not lead to the destruction of a large portion of
the moral system?

Thus, a researcher cannot understand the relation between the surface
structure and the deep structure concerning other principles set forth
in the universal declaration of human rights but he can understand
through other statements such as the essentiality of having recourse to
rebellion against tyranny and oppression or the necessity of promoting
friendly relations.

This declaration was proposed after the Second World War and the
domination of the world’s great powers in which the US emerged
victorious with the least material and spiritual loss while Europe was
left fatigued. Proposing its philosophical history based on
revolutionary theories, communism expanded its influence and its
ideology instigated the common people.

While the world’s enthusiasm decreased for the new order and the man’s
dream came true for the realization of his aspirations, all this
required a humanitarian motto so that the US could introduce itself as
the pioneer of peace and order in the world and extend its domination to
the far reaches of the entire world. They thought that they could
encourage people by granting them illusionary rights and freedoms. The
General Assembly of the United Nations proposes the idea of equal vote
between the United States and Burma while the domination of the
superpowers is actualized through the right of veto. Undoubtedly,
however, it was a great movement for the international confession to
human rights. It is a case which cannot be denied despite its numerous
shortcomings.

The Islamic Declaration of Human Rights
---------------------------------------

When we study the preamble, we realize that the relation between the two
issues is so logical that it enables us to conclude the following
principles easily:

1. Belief in the Almighty God and His attributes (creation, blessings,
generosity, viceroydom, granting the earth to man, and love). All these
are thoughts, which constitute the belief in the Almighty God, and human
rights, enable us to enjoy all these rights.

2. The second article of the Islamic declaration states that Islam is
the true religion for all mankind. It is the religion of breaking from
the bonds; it is a religion of equality and justice. It combats all
kinds of corruption and injustice and discrimination. The scholar should
understand these important principles(the right to cooperation, the
right of freedom, the right to rebel against tyranny)

3. Belief in the oneness of God (worshipping only the almighty God)

4. Islam protects religion, life, reason, property, decency and
children.

5. The role of the Islamic civilization is introduced as the best people
that have created a civilization for all mankind, a civilization binding
the world to the hereafter and to knowledge and religion.

6. Belief in man’s participation in protecting human rights

7. Belief in man’s increasing need to protect religion

8. Belief that fundamental rights are parts of religion and protecting
it is worship and being fanatic is considered wrong and each individual
is as well as the conununity is responsible towards it. This is the
foundation of individual and social responsibilities for the full
realization of the principles set therein.

These are the firm foundations of the rights set forth in the Islamic
Declaration of Human Rights and as we said before, these constitute the
basis of human rights.

The Shortcomings of the Islamic Declaration of Human Rights
-----------------------------------------------------------

We believe that this requires reevaluation; so we shall point out the
shortcomings in the hope that they will be removed:

1. The necessity of pointing to the divine attributes as the first
principle including knowledge, power and life and these are important
facts for understanding these rights; Islam attempts to confer these
divine attributes on Muslims and particular rights are derived thereby.

2. The third principle mentioning divine unity should be placed before
the second, which discusses Islam as a universal religion, and after the
first, which discusses divine attributes. This ordering would seem more
logical.

3. The fourth principle should be integrated within the third one and it
should be shown how these particular rights are related to divine
attributes. Islam offers a universal plan for the promotion of man: that
is, for drawing him closer to God by conferring upon him attributes
which are perfectly characterized by divinity. Hence, the program of
Islam and the rights it advances for humanity are best understood in
terms of the divine attributes.

4. The preamble to the Islamic declaration of human rights should be
supplemented by a discussion of Islamic law and morality and their
objectives.

5. It is fit to propose this declaration as truly universal for given
the Islamic understanding of the essence of man, his innate needs and
its realism about the human condition, there should be no doubt or
hesitation about the fact that Islamic rights are capable of meeting the
needs of all human beings anywhere in the world.

A Comparative Study
-------------------

Before we embark on making a comparative study of the two declarations,
we should pay attention to the principles set forth in the two
declarations. Before understanding these rights, we have to state that
the ordering of the principles is different in them. However, the
important point lies in the ordering of the principles set forth in the
Islamic declaration, which are effected in a more correct manner. This
shows how perfect it is. On the other hand, some of these rights can be
referred to particular and public cases. However, the inclusion of any
principle in the declaration should be for the sake of the importance
they attach to it.

### Common Points In The Two Declarations

We can express the common points in the following way:

Both declarations lay emphasis on the right to life, freedom, security,
rejection of torture and unjust punishment and ill treatment. They also
agree on the right to hygiene, social services, respectable life and the
prohibition of detention and exile exceeding the crime. They both
emphasize on the social position of individuals and providing them with
the best standards of life.

The two declarations stress that man is born free and cannot be held in
captivity. Everyone are equal in rights, endowed with conscience and
reason and should act in a spirit of brotherhood.

The two declarations emphasize on the equal rights of men and women in
dignity and the necessity of having a proper social status for both men
and women. Also, marriage between men and women should take place with
the full consent of both parties and that the family is the fundamental
unit of the society. Women have the right to enjoy the protection of the
government and the society. It is also necessary as implied by the two
declarations to provide the security of person, property, personality
and family at internal and international level.

Also, the two declarations place stress on the education whose goal is
to promote the personality of all the conununity members. Also, the
consent of the parents in every affair is expressed in the two
declarations.

The two declarations stress that human being is born free and no one can
put him on slavery. All persons are legally equal and possess intellect
and conscience (this is not a legal issue) and they shout cooperate on
the bases of brotherhood.

The two declarations lay stress on freedom of thought and opinion and
expression. They both claim that man has the right to enjoy the material
and spiritual interests of any literary works of which he is the author.
They have the right to choose any religion they desire. They have the
right to enjoy freedom of thought as long as it does not hurt anyone.
They have the right to a legal personality and freedom of movement and
residence. They can seek political asylum provided that they have not
committed a non-political crime.

The two declarations state that people are free to choose their own
profession and that no one has the right to impose on others what they
cannot do. The workers have equal wages and have the right to enjoy the
advantages in time of unwilled unemployment, illness, physical
mutilation, old age and celibacy.

The two declarations state that people are to be presumed innocent as
long as their crime has not been proved. Crime is a personal matter and
everyone has the right to have a just tribunal and the punishment is to
be detennined by law.

Also, the two declarations agree on the prohibition of despotism and
believe that any individual has the right to participate in the
government. Equality should be realized before the law and the people
should be allowed to take claims establish to the just courts. There is
also the right to organize charity organization.

Finally, the two declarations emphasize that every human person is
responsible to protect these rights and freedoms and must strive for
promotion ... no one has the right to interfere in the freedom of others
and cannot take advantage of them for his personal and social benefit.

### Differences Between The Two Declarations

The difference between the two declarations can be explained in the
following way:

1. The Islamic declaration makes a distinction between the dignity
(which man acquires due to his being a human) and the acquired dignity
(derived in the course of spiritual development). This is an important
point ignored in the universal declaration of human rights. Thus, we
consider it imperfect in this regard and believe that conscience makes a
distinction between a great sage like Avicenna and an ordinary person
w'ho has left nothing useful behind.

2. The Islamic declaration stresses the point that people are the
servants of the Almighty God: This shows the perfect concept of this
equality in dignity. Besides the relation of dignity in all aspects of
life, all the servants of the Almighty are close to God and are equal in
His eyes. However among the people there exists a spiritual competition
to approach God through self-making by medium of opinion, true faith,
virtuous acts effective in the realization the divine justice. However,
the universal declaration has been incapable of understanding this
relation.

3. The concept noted above may be seen in article two of the Islamic
declaration. Life is a gift granted by the Almighty and consequently,
its legal value has increased. Hence, it must be guarded and protected.

4. The human dignity must be protected even after death. For instance,
Islam claims that slaughtering dogs is unlawful. The secret of this
affair lies in moral principles.

However, there is no mention of these things in the universal
declaration and this is its major shortcoming and the world attempted to
eliminate this fault by an augmentation to the Geneva convention.

5. Article eight of the Islamic declaration places stress on the fame of
man, a point stated in the universal declaration with the difference
that in the Islamic declaration it is applicable after death as well, by
protecting his corpse and grave.

6. The two declarations stress on family as the fundamental unit and the
state and the community should defend it in every possible way, every
man and woman have the right to found a family and limitations such as
color, race and so on cannot prevent them from this. However, in this
regard, there are differences between the two declarations which may be
mentioned as follows:

A) The Islamic declaration believes that marriage is the foundation of
family whereas there is no mention of it in the universal declaration.

B) The universal declaration regards equal rights for men and women
which include alimony and divorce and such matters whereas the Islamic
declaration makes a distinction between these affairs and emphasizes
that women have certain rights which are in proportion to their duties
and responsibilities. Women have financial independence, have the right
to preserve their names and origins forever and the family expenses are
on the shoulders of husbands.

C) The Islamic declaration stresses on the social responsibilities of
the state and the elimination of impediments in the way of marriage
whereas there is no mention of it in the universal declaration.

D) Another difference is that religion is not mentioned in the universal
declaration whereas it is mentioned in the Islamic declaration. It
stresses the fact that religion is necessary for the realization of the
union between wives and husbands, otherwise all the hopes pinned on
family are nullified.

7. The Islamic declaration stresses the rights of parents and relatives.

8. In the field of education, the Islamic declaration stresses that this
is essential in all aspects of life whereas the Universal Declaration
stresses that this should be free, not compulsory but it has suggested
equal related issues for the rest of others.

9. The Islamic Declaration limits the goals of education to the
development and balance of personality, and stregthening belief in God
and respect for the necessary rights of others whereas the universal
declaration stresses the most perfect limits of personality and
strengthening of respect for the rights of others and preparing the
ground for protection of understanding and human aspirations and
sacrifice and respect for opposing views and development of kindness and
efforts for protection of peace.

10. Article 10 of the Islamic Declaration deals with the first and the
last feature of man, which is religion. As a result, it is natural that
it keeps aloof any kind of exploitation, for it means alienating man
from himself. Hence, the Islamic declaration suffices to article 10,
which prohibits exploitation. This is because Islam has a clear attitude
towards this issue stated in this article. Atheism is not only the going
from the human realm into the animal world, it is even worse than that.
On the other hand, the Universal Declaration places stress on the
freedom of religion and opinion; this shows a substantial difference in
the two declarations. We do not propose to show the right attitude of
Islam but to emphasize that the Universal Declaration distinguishes the
legal issue from the philosophical one and we are extremely opposed to
this.

11. To article 11 of the Islamic declaration, is opposed to article four
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with blatant
differences. The aforementioned article in the Islamic declaration
claims that man is born free. Hence, it obviates any sort of slavery,
oppression, and exploitation of him. It believes that freedom springs
from servitude to the Almighty and the divine servitude as imagined by
the ignorant people are not aimed at proving the divine nature and He is
needless of all. This servitude means breaking away from all kinds of
slavery towards others. However, the universal declaration only rejects
the slavery and servitude without stating the main reason or clarifying
the relation between man and God.

12. What distinguishes the Islamic declaration is the negation of all
kinds of exploitations, the placing of stress on freedom and
self-determination and the supporting of other nations. The universal
declaration has not dealt with it at all. It shows the weak points of
the universal declaration.

13. Another characteristic feature of the universal declaration is that
it does not refer to the acceptance of any particular nationality, for
it has one of the issues, which have resulted in the breaking asunder of
the nations.

14. Although the two declarations refer to the right of occupation, the
Islamic declaration demands the workers to work conscientiously as it
has demanded of the state to mete out justice to those workers whose
rights have been violated.

15. Article 14 of the Islamic Declaration emphasizes on the right of
income but it demands it to be lawful and this clearly shows the
rejected ways while it places emphasis on the prohibition of usury.
However, there is no mention of it in the universal declaration.

16. Article 15 of the Islamic Declaration places stress on the necessity
of legality of possession. It insists that possession should not hurt
others. When we study the expanse of the nature of loss which per se
involves numerous social losses, we come to realize how far the the
Islamic interpretation is exact and how far it loathes the capitalistic
misuse of this right for hurting the rights of others and economy and
looting and plundering their wealth.

17. Another feature of the Islamic declaration is considering the
morality as human right stated in articles 17. As opposed to this, the
Universal Declaration in article 29 states that morality brings about
certain limitations for individuals to enjoy freedom. Considering the
statement, within the democratic realm at the end of this article, we
conclude that morality is the freedom of others not the sublime moral
concepts. Be that as it may, this does not approve a human right
entitling man to enjoy a healthy atmosphere in which he can develop his
spiritual life.

18. The Islamic Declaration prohibits the placing of others under
scientific or medical experiments unless it is without danger.

19. Article 20 of the Islamic Declaration prohibits the torturing and
ill­treating of others. This is of considerable importance while it is
ignored in the Universal Declaration.

20. Some might think that the Universal Declaration has advantages for
it expresses absolute freedom of expression for others. However, we
believe it to be a fault, for we can never allow the statement of
issues, which might offend against the morality of people and the
society. Offense against sacred things is far worse than offense against
individuals. Hence, the limiting of it in the Cairo Declaration (using
the sentence, “in a way that is not against lawful principles”) is
closer to the human spirit. And this is clearly stated in paragraph
three of article 22.

21. Another feature of the Islamic declaration is that man has the right
to bid others to good works and enjoin others to avoid evil. And this
places stress on the responsibility the Declaration puts on all the
community members. In the Cairo Conference, many agreed on this issue
but there were some others who insisted on its elimination from the
declaration.

22. In the Islamic Declaration there is an interesting reference to the
fact that leadership is a deposit the violation of which is unlawful.
There is no such a thing in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
although we find that it was a necessity that the public situation in
which the Islamic Shari’ah belives in leadership should be pointed out.

23. Another difference between the two declarations is that the Islamic
declaration views things from an Islamic perspective while the Universal
Declaration limits all individual’s freedoms as opposed to the freedoms
of others.

24. The Islamic Declaration states that Shariah is the only source of
reference while there is no source of reference in the universal
declaration.

Albeit, there are other differences which are beyond the scope of this
article including the time when the word freedom is mentioned it
generally refers to limited responsibility or responsible freedom within
the confines of religion and this per se is a guarantee which stops
freedom from turning into a destructive force.

The Shortcomings of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
-------------------------------------------------------------

The shortcomings of the Declaration of Human Rights can be summarized as
follows:

1. The isolation of legal and social issues from philosophical ones

2. The lack of logical order between the preamble and the articles set
forth therein

3. The lack of differentiating between the human dignity and the dignity
acquired through virtue and good works

4. Ignoring some aspects of life such as fetus and respect -for corpses
and destruction of sources of humanity.

5. Ignoring morality in conflicts

6. There are some articles which have not been clearly dealt with (such
as equal rights of men and women for ever, or the changing of one’s
religion)

7. Ignoring the rights of parents

8. Ignoring the negation of exploitation

9. Ignoring the individual rights in a moral atmosphere

10. Absolute license for freely expressing one’s opinions

Human Rights in the Past and in the Present Times
-------------------------------------------------

Although this might be a minor discussion by virtue of the fact that we
have bypassed our main discussion, we deem it a basic discussion which
shows the rejection of the law itself in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam. There
is no binding guarantee predicted for the exercise of the articles
enunciated in the two declarations. Besides, none of the countries
signing them have committed themselves to exercise them.

The Universal Declaration as a sublime goal common among the nations of
the world has been agreed upon not by as a binding case. As Mrs.
Roosevelt, the president of the commission on human rights states, “The
declaration is not an international agreement and is not binding but a
collection of rights directly associated with man and the realization of
them is regarded meet throughout the world.”

Thus, the declaration turns into a set of moral rights. Sadly, the
Islamic Declaration is like this. The preamble to the Universal
Declaration begins in a way, which is binding as it is stated in the
Tehran Conference,(4) “The Member States of the Organization of Islamic
Conference do all the necessary measures set forth in this
declaration.”[^1]

However, in the nineteenth conference of foreign ministers held in
Cairo, some of the Islamic countries decided to eliminate secularism.
They had claimed that they would accept the declaration if it accorded
with the rules of their country. However, this is a big contradiction,
for Islam may not be accepted unless it is limited.

Has the Universal Declaration been effective? There is no doubt that the
Declaration has encountered many problems in putting the principles into
practice. However, the main fault lies in the formulators of this
declaration or that their power or the slogans they have chanted have
caused them to pronounce themselves as the defenders of this declaration
and the articles set forth therein; here, the western countries are in
mind.

They (the western countries) tear nations into pieces, loot and plunder
what they have and speak of human rights. That is why they consider
Israel as a democratic country whereas the countries that do not follow
the west are accused of antagonizing human rights. Talk of these things
is sad especially when we consider the right of veto and the great
countries enjoy this right and thus violate the human rights. However,
this discussion entails another field which is not our present concern.

We beseech the Almighty to give us hope and ability to step in His
cause.

Appendix 1: Universal Declaration of Human Rights [1948]
--------------------------------------------------------

### Preamble

Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and
inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation
of freedom, justice and peace in the world,

Appendix 2: The Cairo Declaration Of Human Rights In Islam
----------------------------------------------------------

***“O mankind, We have created you male and female, and appointed you
races and tribes, that may know one another. Surely the noblest among
you in the sight of God is the most godfearing of you.” (Surah
al-Hujurat 49:13)***

The Member States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference,

Reaffirming the civilizing and historical role of the Islamic Ummah
which god made the best nation that has given mankind a universal and
well-balanced civilization in which harmony is established between this
life and the hereafter and knowledge is combined with faith; and the
role that this Ummah should play to guide a humanity confused by
competing trends and ideologies and to provide solutions to the chronic
problems of this materialistic civilization.

Wishing to contribute to the effort mankind to assert human rights, to

and right to a dignified life in accordance with the Islamic
civilization.

Convinced that mankind which has reached an advanced stage in
materialistic science is still, and shall remain, in dire need of faith
to support its civilization and of a self motivating force to guard its
right;

Believing that fundamental rights and universal freedoms in Islam are an
integral part of the Islamic religion and that no one as a matter of
principle has the right to suspend them in whole or in part or violate
or ignore them in as much as they are binding divine commandments, which
are contained in the revealed books of god and were sent through the

an aboininable sin, and accordingly every person is individually
responsible for their safeguard.

Proceeding from the above-mentioned principles, declare the following:

submission to God and descent from Adam. All men are equal in terms of
