Story no. 11: Siddiqa in the gathering of guests
================================================

Siddiqa was a small, six year old girl.  
 She went to the gathering along with her mother.  
 The other children had also come with their mothers.  
 All the children did naughtiness and made the owner of the house very
unhappy indeed.  
 The other children wanted Siddiqa to play with them but she refused.  
 She said “Mother told me that children should always behave themselves
in a gathering and not make the owner unhappy”.

Bravo to those children who respect their fathers and mothers and obey
them.
