Prophet Ayyub (a)
=================

The Prophet Ayyub had

been a wealthy man.

He was a very good

man but he lost his family

and his wealth.

He became ill and had terrible

sores all over his body.

However he never gave up.

He spent his time praying.

He was very patient and

always kept his faith in Allah.

Eventually Allah showed mercy.

He told Ayyub to strike the earth

with his foot and miraculously

a fountain appeared.

He drank the water and used

it to wash his body.

All his sores were healed

and everything was returned

to him as before.

Allah had rewarded him for

keeping his faith despite the

terrible afflictions he

had tested him with.
