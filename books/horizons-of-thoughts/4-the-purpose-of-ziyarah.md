The Purpose of Ziyarah
======================

One of the fundamental requisites of understanding the purpose of
ziyarah is to have a correct worldview. If we realize the purpose of
human creation, and submit our volition to our intellectual decision,
our deeds would be directed towards our eternal salvation. The purpose
of human creation according to Qur'an and Sunnah is to worship Almighty
Allah:


<p dir="rtl">
وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالإِنْسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُوْنَ.
</p>

And I have not Created the Jinn and the Men save that they Worship Me
Alone.[^30]

And worship without knowledge carries no meaning. This is because
worship is not a mere exercise without any sense of devotion. 'Ibadah in
the literal sense is defined as:

<p dir="rtl">
العِبَادَةُ هِيَ نَصبُ الْعَبْدِ نَفْسَهُ فِي مَقَامِ المْمْلُوكِيَّة
لِرَبّهِ.
</p>

'Ibadah is when the servant places himself in the position of being a
bondsman of his Lord.[^31]

And this cannot transpire without the knowledge of the Creator. It is
by appreciating His real ownership [^32] of the entire world of creation,
His Knowledge over all things, His Omnipotence and Omnipresence that the
human being is overtaken and humbles himself down before the Allah. He
also realizes that the true Lord and Master is none but His Creator, and
thus he places himself in the station of being an obedient slave of
Almighty Allah. Imam al-Hussein ('a), underlining the clear link between
knowledge and worship is reported to have said:

<p dir="rtl">
إِنَّ اللَّهَ جَلَّ ذِكْرُهُ مَا خَلَقَ الْعِبَادَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْرِفُوهُ
فَإِذَا عَرَفُوهُ عَبَدُوهُ فَإِذَا عَبَدُوهُ اسْتَغْنَوْا بِعِبَادَتِهِ
عَنْ عِبَادَةِ مَا سِوَاهُ... .
</p>

Surely Allah ('a) did not Create His servants except for knowing Him,
and when they know him, they would worship Him, and when they worship
Him, it would suffice them from worshipping other than Him….[^33]

The worship that results from prior knowledge reaps knowledge itself.
Knowledge before worship, however, is mostly intellectual ('aqli) and
conceptual (tasawwuri). It is a the result of rationally establishing
the existence of God and His Attributes as well as the utter poverty and
dependence of the entire creation on His Infinite Existence.

Having realized this, the impartial servant worships with veneration
and awe. If such worship was out of sincerity, he is availed with a
higher form of knowledge, which is beyond the realm of intellect. It is
known in the language of traditions as 'yaqin (conviction)' and 'the
vision of the heart' which is knowledge by presence (al-'ilm al-huzuri).
The following verse of the Qur'an alludes to the close link between
worship and conviction:

<p dir="rtl">
وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ.
</p>

And worship your Lord so that conviction comes to you [^34].

In some of the ziyarat taught to us by the infallible Imams ('a) we are
taught to address the Imams declaring that they had attained the exalted
station of yaqin through sincere worship. Consider the following
examples:

1.In one of the ziyarat of the Holy Prophet (s) we are taught by Imam
'Ali ('a) to address his noble being as follows:

<p dir="rtl">
…وًأشْهَدُ أنَّكَ قَدْ نَصَحْتَ لاُمَّتِكَ، وَجَاهَدْتَ فيِ سَبِيْلِ
رَبّكَ، وَعَبَدْتَهُ حَتّى أتاكَ الْيَقٍيْنُ… .
</p>

…And I bear witness that you gave counsel to your nation and struggled
in the way of your Lord, and worshipped Him until conviction came to
you…[^35] 2. In another ziyarah we address Imam al-Hussein ('a) as
follows:

<p dir="rtl">
…يَا أبَا عَبْدِ اللهِ أشْهَدُ أنَّكَ قَدْ بَلَّغْتَ عَنِ اللهِ
عَزَّوَجَلَّ مَا اُمِرْتَ بِهِ وَلَمْ تَخْشَ أحَدًا غَيْرَهُ وَجَاهَدْتَ
فِيْ سَبِيْلِهِ وَعَبَدْتَهُ صَادِقًا حَتّى أتَاكَ الْيَقِيْنُ… .
</p>

…O Aba 'Abdillah, I bear witness that surely you conveyed what you were
ordered by Allah (the Invincible and Majestic) and other than Him you
never feared anyone, and you struggled in His way, and worshipped Him
truthfully until conviction came to you…[^36] 3. In one of the ziyarat of
Imam al-Riza ('a) we are taught to address him as follows:

<p dir="rtl">
…اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ قَدْ اَقَمْتَ الصَّلاَةَ وَآتَيْتَ الزَّكَاةَ
وَاَمَرْتَ بِالْمَعْرُوْفِ وَنَهَيْتَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَعَبَدْتَ اللهَ
مُخْلِصًا حَتّى اَتَاكَ الْيَقِيْنُ، السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكَ يَا أبَا
الْحَسَنِ… .
</p>

…I bear witness that you kept prayer upright and gave the poor tax and
invited to what was good and forbade the evil and worshipped Allah
sincerely until conviction came to you; peace be upon you O Aba
al-hasan…[^37]

Having realized this, our ziyarah should serve as a catalyst to earn
the exalted station of appreciating the truth by the vision of the
heart. And the path towards this endeavor is to be a true slave of
Almighty Allah. In other words, the ziyarah should be a means of uniting
with Abu 'Abdillah (an appellation depicting the true slave-hood of Imam
al-Hussein ('a)).

And this can easily be attained after we understand the meaning of the
ziyarah and exemplify its teachings in ourselves. If we limit the
ziyarah for our lower ambitions in life, there would be no difference
between us and the laity who have busied themselves with the world of
matter. Therefore, the za'ir should bear an exalted aspiration and aim
for a great transformation, in order to unite with the spirit of
al-Hussein ('a).

Readers do appreciate that the reason why the allies of the
contemporary formalists hamper us from expressing our sorrow near the
graves of the infallible leaders, is because they have realized the
revolution it can create in the hearts.

Imam al-Hussein ('a) is a symbol of uprising against falsehood even at
the cost of the sacrifice of every possession. Our ziyarah which is an
endeavor of unity in the real sense therefore should be a declaration of
readiness and not merely a habitual recitation.

<p dir="rtl">
السّلاَمُ عَلَيْكَ.
</p>

Assalamu 'alayka

The word al-Salam is commonly translated as "the Peace". Its literal
import, however, means:

<p dir="rtl">
التَّعَرّي مِنَ الآفَاتِ الظَّاهِرَةِ وَالْبَاطِنَةِ.
</p>

…to be free from calamities, whether apparent or hidden [^38].

Therefore we are seeking the state of freedom from every kind of
calamity for Imam al-Hussein ('a), whether that be apparent or hidden.
It should however be understood that the Imam already enjoys the state
of salam and is in fact one of the manifestations of Allah's Attribute
al-Salam. The Holy Prophet (s) in his nocturnal ascent (al-Mi'raj) came
across a group of Angels, Divine Apostles and Prophets, and it was said
to him:

<p dir="rtl">
يَا مُحَمَّدُ سَلِّمْ عَلَيْهِمْ فَقَالَ السَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ
وَرَحْمَةُ اللَّهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ فَأَوْحَى اللَّهُ إِلَيْهِ أَنَّ
السَّلامَ وَالتَّحِيَّةَ وَالرَّحْمَةَ وَالْبَرَكَاتِ أَنْتَ
وَذُرِّيَّتُكَ.
</p>

O Muhammad, send benedictions on them, and he (s) said: al-Salamu
'alaykum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh (May the peace, Mercy and
Blessings be upon you). Thereupon Allah Revealed unto him: "the Peace
and Benedictions, and Mercy and Blessings, are you and your progeny.[^39]
Hence seeking Salam for him would mean seeking higher degrees of the
state of Salam because the levels of Salam have no end. Only Almighty
Allah enjoys the Absolute State of Salam:

<p dir="rtl">
هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِي لا إِلهَ إِلا هُوَ الْمَلِكُ الْقُدُّوسُ السَّلامُ
الْمُؤْمِنُ الْمُهَيْمِنُ... .
</p>

…He is Allah, other than Whom there is no god, He alone is the
Sovereign, the Most Holy, the Peace [^40]

1. In a tradition lady Fatima Zahra ('a) is reported to have said:

<p dir="rtl">
إنَّ اللهَ هُوَ السَّلاَمُ، وَمِنْهُ السّلاَمُ، وَإِلَيْهِ السّلاَم .
</p>

Surely only Allah is the Absolute Peace and from Him alone comes peace
and unto Him alone returns Peace [^41] 2. The Holy Prophet (s) is
reported to have told Lady Khadijah ('a) once that 'This is Gabriel, who
sends his Salams unto you', wherepon she replied:

<p dir="rtl">
اَللهُ السّلاَمُ وَلِلّهِ السَّلاَمُ وَعَلىَ جِبْرَائِيل السَّلاَمُ .
</p>

Allah is the Absolute Peace and to Him alone belongs Peace and upon
Gabriel be Peace [^42] 3. We are taught in a supplication [^43] to say:

<p dir="rtl">
اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ السَّلامُ وَ مِنْكَ السَّلامُ وَ إِلَيْكَ يَرْجِعُ
السَّلام.
</p>

O Allah, You alone are the Peace, and from You Alone is Peace and unto
You alone return peace 'Allama Tabataba'i in his monumental al-Mizan,
says:

<p dir="rtl">
وَالاَصْلُ فِي مَعْنَى السَّلاَمِ على مَا ذَكَرَهُ الرَّاغِبُ فِي
المفْرَدَاتِ هُوَ التَّعَرِّي عَنِ الآفَاتِ الظَّاهِرَةِ وَالْبَاطِنَةِ،
وَاِلَيْهِ يَرْجِعُ مَعْنَاهُ فِي جَمِيعِ مُشْتَقَّاتِه... وَالسّلاَمُ
مِنْ اَسْمآئِهِ تَعَالى لانّ ذَاتَهُ المُتَعَالِية نَفْسُ الْخَيرِ
الَّذِى لاَ شَرَّ فِيْهِ ....
</p>

And the original meaning of the word al-Salam according to what
al-Raghib indicated in al-Mufradat is to be free from adversities, both
apparent as well as hidden, and unto this meaning return the import of
al-Salam in all its derivatives… And al-Salam is from the Divine
Attributes, for His Exalted Essence is good in itself, which does not
have any speck of evil.[^44]

But since 'the Absolute Peace' [^45] loves us, He laid a path open in
front of us a path towards His Absolute Perfection, and thus always
calls us towards the same:

<p dir="rtl">
وَاللَّهُ يَدْعُوا إِلى‏ دارِ السَّلامِ.
</p>

And Allah invites to the abode of Peace…[^46]

The definite article 'al' which connotes "al-ta'rif" (determination)
can be taken to allude to a specific salam- the Salam that comes from
Allah. This is because the sentence "al-Salamu 'alayka" is taken here as
an invocative statement (al-du'a'). And because no kind of perfection
comes from anyone save Allah, for He Alone is the Principal Cause, we
are only permitted to seek perfection from Him in the independent sense.
This does not however hamper us to employ the means that He has set for
us to attain the perfections. Therefore when we say: Al-Salamu 'alayka
[^47] we mean: May Allah Bestow you with the state of Peace.

'Alayka Alludes to Enveloping Peace

Another linguistic intricacy worthy of consideration is that the
preposition علي 'ala in Al-Salamu 'alayka denotes the sense of
envelopment [^48]. In other words we are asking Almighty Allah to Envelop
Imam al-Hussein ('a) with the state of Peace and freedom from every
apparent and hidden calamity that is according to his noble essence.
Therefore Al-Salamu 'alayka would mean:

May Allah Envelop you with the state of Peace Al-Salamu 'Alayka as a
Declarative Statement Sometimes however the article al is taken to
allude to the visitor (za'ir), in which situation the statement is no
more invocative, but declarative [^49]. In other words, when the za'ir
says al-Salamu 'alayka, he means:

<p dir="rtl">
سلاَمي عَلَيْكَ.
</p>

Salami 'alayka

I am [^50] at peace with you.

In other words he is trying to assure the person who is visited that
his intentions, words, and deeds would be coherent with the spirit of
peace and he would not do anything that would cause harm or disturb him.
Instead he would manifest in himself things that would be geared to seek
his protective physical as well as spiritual life.

This is one of the highly important stations for the za'ir, since he is
in fact reasserting his covenant with Almighty Allah, by informing his
beloved Imam ('a) that besides avoiding any thing that would cause harm
to him ('a), he would do those things that would manifest the spirit of
peace as well.

One of the things that does not concur with the spirit of al-Salam is
to sin. If one engages in sin, and utters the above statement, then he
has not maintained the spirit of the Salam that he has uttered, the
reason being that the fourteen infallibles ('a) have the ability to
witness the sins of their followers too. Look at the following
narrations:

1. We humbly express in the well-known ziyarat al-Jami'a al-Kabira:

<p dir="rtl">
... أَنْتُمُ الصِّرَاطُ الاَقْوَمُ وَشُهَدَاءُ دَارِ الْفَنَاءِ ... .
</p>

…You are the upright path and the Witnesses of the Abode of Extinction
[i.e. the world…][^51] 2.Imam al-Sadiq ('a) is reported to have said:

<p dir="rtl">
عَنْ أَبِي عَبْدِ اللَّهِ (ع) فِي قَوْلِهِ (وَقُلِ اعْمَلُوا فَسَيَرَى
اللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمْ وَرَسُولُهُ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ) الْمُؤْمِنُونَ هَاهُنَا
الائِمَّةُ الطَّاهِرَةُ (ع).
</p>

Believers referred to in the verse "And say, Go on working: Allah will
see your conduct, and His Apostle and the believers [as well]" are the
Immaculate Imams ('a) [^52]

Hence the Imams ('a) can behold our mistakes and wrong deeds, and when
they do so, they get upset:

1.Imam al-Sadiq ('a) is reported to have said:

<p dir="rtl">
مَا لَكُمْ تَسُوءُونَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ (ص) فَقَالَ رَجُلٌ: كَيْفَ
نَسُوؤُهُ فَقَالَ أَ مَا تَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ أَعْمَالَكُمْ تُعْرَضُ
عَلَيْهِ فَإِذَا رَأَى فِيهَا مَعْصِيَةً سَاءَهُ ذَلِكَ فَلاَ تَسُوءُوا
رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَسُرُّوهُ.
</p>

What is the matter with you? Why do you displease the Messenger of
Allah. Thereupon a man asked him: 'And how do we displease him? The Imam
('a) said: 'Don't you know that your actions are presented before him;
and when he finds a sin in them, he is displeased; therefore do not
displease the Messenger of Allah (upon whim be peace) and make him
happy.[^53]

2. Ibn Aban al-Zayyat reports:

<p dir="rtl">
قُلْتُ لِلرِّضَا (ع): ادْعُ اللَّهَ لِي وَلاَهْلِ بَيْتِي فَقَالَ: أَوَ
لَسْتُ أَفْعَلُ؟ وَاللَّهِ إِنَّ أَعْمَالَكُمْ لَتُعْرَضُ عَلَيَّ فِي
كُلِّ يَوْمٍ وَلَيْلَةٍ, قَالَ: فَاسْتَعْظَمْتُ ذَلِكَ فَقَالَ لِي أَمَا
تَقْرَأُ كِتَابَ اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: (وَقُلِ اعْمَلُوا فَسَيَرَى
اللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمْ وَرَسُولُهُ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ) قَالَ: هُوَ وَاللَّهِ
عَلِيُّ بْنُ أَبِي طَالِبٍ (ع).
</p>

I said to al-Rida ('a): Pray to Allah for me and my family, and he
said: Don't I do that? I swear by Allah surely your actions are
presented to me every day and night. "I was extremely amazed at that,"
says al-Zayyat. Then the Imam ('a) said: Do you not read the Book of
Allah, the Invincible and Majestic, Who says: (And say, Go on working:
Allah will see your conduct, and His Apostle and the faithful [as
well])? I swear by Allah 'Ali bin Abi Talib is among the 'the faithful'
mentioned in this verse.[^54]

Hence engaging in sin, being inconsistent with the spirit of Salam,
makes us violate our covenant with the Imam ('a). Those, therefore who
recite their ziyarat without considering this vital point, are either
hypocrites or weaklings who like to utter lies infront of the Imam ('a).
There is a group of sinful reciters, however, whom the self that invites
one to evil (al-nafs al-ammara) has weakened, but are nevetheless
hopeful for change.

Whenever such people recite the ziyarah, they should experience utter
humiliation, and always seek change. They must realize that in order for
one to prosper and change, he/she should perpetually seek Divine Succor
and make a firm resolve to leave all those things that are forbidden,
however minute they may seem to appear.
