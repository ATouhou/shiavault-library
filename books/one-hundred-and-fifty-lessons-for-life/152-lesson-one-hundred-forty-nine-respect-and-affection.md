Lesson One Hundred Forty Nine: Respect And Affection
====================================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَيْسَ مِنّا مَنْ لَمْيُوَفَّرْ كَبيرَنا وَ لَمْ يَرْحَمْ صَغيرَنا
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

One who does not respect the elders and does not show affection to the
children, does not belong to us.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Human societies are like an extensive caravan which is continuously
moving. The infants are born and children grow up and adults become old
and the old die and nobody is excepted from passing these stages.

The older ones are more experienced and have deeper insight . The
conscientious ones among them have contributed to society through
numerous services during their life. All this supports the argument that
they should be respected by the youth and adolescents.

And since children are at the beginning stage of their life, tender,
innocent and impressionable, they should be treated with love and
affection . Foundations of their character and prosperity should be
constructed lovingly by the adults . These are the ways and customs of a
humanitarian and progressive society.
