Account N. 3 : Ammar B. Mu`awiya
================================

From the little that has survived of Jabir's account, it is difficult
to assess his work; but what remains does call into question the account
of his contemporary, Ammar b. Mu\`awiya al-Duhni[^16].

This narrative is reported by al-Tabari, and \`Ammar claims to be
reporting on the authority of the Imam al-Baqir.

The report begins with a vivid introduction in which Ammar says that he
asked the Imam al-Baqir to tell him about the death of al-Husayn so that
it might be as if he was there himself. What follows is an account which
agrees in its basic outline with the version of Ibn al-Kalbi, while
being much shorter and briefer.

This version seemingly adds nothing to Ibn al-Kalbis narrative. It
differs only in giving a different house for the one which Muslim b.
\`Aqil stayed in when he came to Kufa; it does omit some of the things
which Ibn al-Kalbi has reported, but nothing of real substance. What,
then, is the purpose of this narrative? It is clearly put forward as the
authoritative Shi’i account. Ammar was a well known traditionalist who,
while being regarded as trustworthy by the general run of
traditionalists, was also known for his Shi’i inclinations, and as an
adherent of the Imam al-Baqir. He died in 133[^17] and is claimed to have
a book of traditions on the authority of the Imam al-Baqir.

This account might well be regarded as the official account of the Imam
al-Baqir and therefore the one which should be accepted.
