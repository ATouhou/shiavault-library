"Mumins" is Plural; Why Apply it to the Singular?
-------------------------------------------------

**Muharram 3, 1330**

It may be said in rebutting your objection that the phrase "the Mu'mins
who say their prayers and offer *zakat* (even) while prostrating (in
prayers)" is applied to the plural; so, why should it be applied to the
Imam, may Allah glorify his countenance, who is singular? What is your
answer if you are asked thus?

Sincerely,

*S*
