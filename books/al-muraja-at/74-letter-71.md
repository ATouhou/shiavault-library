Why Reject the Hadith of the Mother of Believers and the best Among the Prophet's Consorts?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Safar 10, 1330**

Why did you - may Allah forgive you - turn away from the mother of
believers and the best of the Prophet's consorts and discarded her
hadith, leaving it to oblivion, while her statement is the final and
just judgment? In spite of this, you may give us your own viewpoint to
consider,

Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*S*
