11.2. Pious Passions
====================

The best society in the world is one which has the cognizance of Allah,
and it's members are bestowed upon with the Divine Grace of mutual help
and support of each other! The Islamic society has a similar framework.
Along with economic awareness, the Holy Quran has strongly emphasized on
helping the poors and supporting the destitutes.

It is mentioned in Quran:-

"And in their wealth is the share for the weak and the
destitutes."132

And right from the beginning we need to develop in our children the
habits to help others and share their work and concerns. Safeguard them
from greed, selfishness, and apprehension. Develop in them
farsightedness and depth of vision and heart. They should have love and
affection for all, without any bias or discrimination. Moreover, by
possible means, they should be habituated to help others, so thato the
journey for goodwill continues, and pious feelings keep flourish in the
world! It is directed by Allah:-

131.Wasail ash-Shia', Vol:4, Page:15.
132.132.Surah Az'zuria't, Verse:19.

"And what so ever has been bestowed upon you by Allah, try to built
your Hereafter by it, and also do not forget to take your share of this
world. And then, the way Allah has done His favour upon you, in the
same, manner , you should also do favour upon his creation. Also do not
intent mischief; on the face of he world, because for sure Allah does
not like the mischief mongers."133

And see, what unbounded wealth, for the development of thought wisdom,
has been disseminated In this glorifying statement of the Holy
Prophet:-

One day the Holy Prophet was among his followers that he observed a
well built youth, who was busy toiling hard, right in the morning.

On observing this, those who were sitting near the Holy Prophet
commented:

"Alas! had this strength and vigour, would have been utilized in the
path of Allah!" On hearing this the Holy Prophet replied.

"Do not comment so! Because if he is toiling for his own self, to free
himself from the disgrace of extending his hand in front of others, and
be not dependent upon 'other, then you must understand that he has
worked in the way if Allah!"

"And even if he is busy, so that he may support his old parents or his
still young children, and make them independent, still this toil be
considered in the path of Allah!" "But, if he is just toiling that hard,
to make a lot of money, and then with that excessive wealth belittle
others, and boast of his grandeur over

133.Surah Qas'as, Verse:77

others, then all his efforts would be considered in the account of
Devil."134


**11.3. Justice Demanded**

Till now it is already known in detail, that "the Islamic Code or Life"
intends dynamism in every member of the society. It is essential for the
collective interest, that everyone should be steadfast and active. From
the religious view point, one finds no place for "an idle", especially
in the context of the coming generation!

If a healthy and sturdy youth used to come in the Holy Prophet's
(SAWAW) attendance, he would inquire from those who were present
there:

"Does he do some work?"

If it would be replied in affirmative, the Holy Prophet (SAWAW) would
express his delight, and if the reply would be in negation, the Prophet
of Allah (SAWAW) used to turn his face away from him! 135 lmam All
(ASWS) says:-

Lazy and sluggish people can never safe guard there rights from getting
lost.136 Further lmam Muhammad Baqar (ASWS) says:-

Hazrat Musa (AS) questioned from Allah: "Oh Allah! Which one of your
believer, you dislike most?" He was replied:

135.Bihar-ul-Anwa'r, Vol: 101, Page:9.
136.Majmua' Sheikh Warram, Vol:1, Page:59

"Who sleeps all the night, and while away his day!"137 Anyway Islam
intends that the manpower never gets frozen. Every wise and study person
should do something beneficial.

The Allah's deputed persons, left no stone unturned in unveiling the
path of action (accomplishment)! They did all sorts of work. Bore all
sorts of difficulties, and adopted all possible means for the attainment
of subsistence, so that the toil of a peasant and the labour of a worker
could be termed as a representation of spirit and resolution, and the
dignity of labour could remain flying sky high!

Well, special care and attention is called for the selection of a
profession and the location to serve. The reason being that, every
person cannot perform all tasks with success and elegance. Every
individual has his own style environment, heritage mental capabilities,
intellectual aptitudes and personal inclinations, and the all these
influencing factors have a dominal role in the success or failure in a
profession or craft!

Remember, till there is no mental satisfaction and the fulfillment of
desires, neither the craftsman can display perfection, nor the
educatlonist attain expertise, or the manager feels contended with his
task!

Therefore, it would be totally unwise, that in. quest for the
satisfaction of their desires and fulfillment of their dreams, the
parents during the education of their children, impair their future to a
terrible degree. Meaning that, they so much load their weary ideas on
them, that there Is no place left over for the tender "shoot' of
personal ideas to sprout their way out!

The old and the elderly, by their love and experience, should direct
their youngsters to recognize good and bad, distinguish benefit from
loss, and they should certainly do so, But consequently, as the
"blooming youngs' stepping into the prime of their youth, should also be
given the freedom to find on their own, the solutions for their economic
moans, by utilizing their newly flangled "knowledge and wisdom'.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
137.Safina-e-Bahah, Vol:2, Page: 624 (Zam'e Kasiat-un-Nau'm).

The location where a person gets involved in an assignment plays a
pivotal role. And only at his working place, one could expect good
performance. But for better efficiency, sincerity with profession and
judiciousness with the delegated task, is a must!

Now, if the nature of "work" is in consistency with the temperament,
then it is all fine; but if the working environment and the activities
are inconsistent with the mood, then there would neither be better
performance, nor could the desired results be achieved! and this is
against the fundamental norms of justice and integrity!

The Last Prophet (SAWAW), has said: -

"Everyone should, at his place, continue effort and work. But remember,
whomsoever is created for a task (i.e. assigned for him by nature), only
in that could he perform with ease (and success)."138

Yet, in another glorious tradition, our brains are being so
enlightened: -

"May Allah be gracious upon the person, whose task displays elegance
and perfection."139 And the Leader of the pious (ASWS), says:-

"The person who does not fulfill his task completely remains involved
in grief and sorrow."140 Moreover, at another location, he has guided us
on the same topic, as:-

"A dependable, hardworking manager (worker), is also liked by
Allah."141

Page:113.

And in the end, we quote a saying of the seventh Guide of the genealogy
of the Prophet, Hazrat lmam Musa Kazim (ASWS). The Bab-ul-Hawa'ij,
says:-

The work which is beyond ones capabilities, if he intentionally tries
to perform it, his efforts would go in vain and due to spoilage of work,
would also loose all his expectations."142


**11.4. Approach and Style**

After knowing that, it is a demand of the Islamic code of life
(Shari'ah), that every responsible person is duty bound to find out "the
economic means" for his livelihood and for his family, and also for the
fulfillment of the needs of others, and to the extent possible, to help
resolve their financial difficulties. It has also been known that
whatsoever type of task he may perform, he is obliged to do so,
elegantly and diligently.

Moreover, it is necessary to impress upon the minds of our children,
that whatsoever, profession they may adopt, or business they may choose,
or service they may select, should be approved and permissible (muba'h),
in the Islamic codes (shar'ah)! Because the religion has forbidden or
disapproved (makruh) certain means of earnings for the maintenance of
purity in thought and conscience, protection of the common interest, and
due to their effect on certain psychological factors.

Therefore, if a certain field of activity is considered forbidden, then
the earning drawn from it are also ill legal, along with the associated
benefits derived, like wages, salary, commission, allowance, bonus, and
awards etc. All are considered Suhut i.e. as forbidden (ha'ram).
While mentioning the evil deeds of the Jews, the Holy Quran
mentions: -


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
142. "Hayat al-Imam Musa bin Jaffer", by Baqar Sharief al-Qarashi,
Vol:1, Page:276.

"They heed to lies, and eat from the forbidden stock."143

The renowned philosopher, Allama Taba'taba'i, while enumerating the
words of this verse, states: All the goods earned through illegal means,
is termed as "su'hut".144 And in this regards Hazrat Ali (ASWS),
says:-

"The flesh developed from forbidden wealth (goods i.e. su'hut), is a
part of Hell."145 Therefore, the real Guide, Hazrat Muhammad (SAWAW)
wants; that every member of Ummah, should spend his life by legitimate
means (ri'zq-e-hala'l), because this Allah's approved approach, would
also be beneficial in the Hereafter.

The Holy Prophet (SAWAW), says:-

"That person is exceptionally lucky, whose earnings is clean and
clear."146 At another instance the Grace for the Universe Holy Prophet
(SAWAW), says:- "Praying is spread over seventy sections (parts). The
best of all section is, the legitimate subsistence (ha'lal ri'zq). And
there is a saying of Hazrat Au Murtaza (ASWS):-

"What a luck! what to say of a person, who considers himself petty
(insignificant), whose income is legitimate, whose personality is "147

pleasing, and who supports others from his savings. "148 It is quote
through the pious student of Imam Jaffar Sadiq (ASWS), Abu Ba'seer
that: - Sadiq-e-Ale Muhammad used to say:-

"I used to work so laboriously on my fields, that I would be quenched
in sweat, from head to toe!" While enumerating this, Hazrat said:-

"So that Almighty Allah may know this reality that, "I am desirous of
legitimate subsistence (ri'zq-e-ha'la-l) "149


**11.5. Organization and Method**

In the events of life, neither excess nor deficiency can be termed as
suitable! What so ever task does one undertake, one has to work for it,
while remaining with in the (prescribed) limits. For the provision of
the means of subsistence, a balanced attitude is necessary. Experience
show that, even quite reasonable persons, once getting settled in their
business, make "earnings" as their ultimate goal! and due to this
attitude, are neither able to give time to other obligation, nor could
they pay heed to their other responsibilities! And ultimately get
isolated from the normal life, and besides this have nothing left over
for their Hereafter!

It is really nice to play a significant role in economic uplift and
financial prosperity, but this does not mean that, a man turns to robot!
Sadiq-e-Ale Muhammad Hazrat lmam Jaffar Sadiq (ASWS) says:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
148.Nahaj-uI-Balagah. Commentry and footnotes by Dr. Sabhi Saleh,
Page:490. \`published in Beruit.
149.Wasail ash-Shia', Vol:6, Page:23. Farou'-e-Kafi, Vol:5, Page:77

"Do not strive so much that you do not find time to relax, and neither
be so idle, that if you sit, it is even difficult for you to rise. Both
these states are the basis of all the evils.

Remember! if one is lethargic, he can not do justice to his work, and
one who, is extra ordinary swift, would even surpass the designated
benchmarks, erected by "faith."150 The objective is, that the "work"
should be in accordance with some standard. It may be physical labour,
service, agriculture, trade, industry or art, the man has to fulfill his
responsibilities in accordance with a set system and a predetermined
procedure.

Another guidance from the Sixth representative of the school of Divine
revelation, Hazrat Imam Jaffar Sadiq (ASWS), regarding the organization
of pre-occupations and engagements is:-

In the context of work and income, on one side you are required to
perform better than the lazy and idle, while on the other, you need to
have a totally different attitude from that greedy person, who remains
contented, even after squandering away everything on this world.151
Therefore, it is obligatory upon the parents, that right form the very
start, they should teach moderation to their children. Safeguard them
from greed and veracity. Adore their brains with the Islamic concepts of
contentment and keep on stress upon them, that along with the economic
progress, it is necessary to fulfill some other significant tasks.

In a message addressed to his obedient son, Imam Hasan (ASWS), Imam Ali
(ASWS), invited the attention of the human intellect towards this
reality, that for a successful life it is imminent upon a person, to
draw his "time table".

Narrator (Mohad'dis) Tu'si (may Allah bestow His favour upon him). with
the source of Abu Ham'za Sa'di, says:-

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Wasail ash-Shia', Vol: 2, Page: 39.
Majmua'e Warram, 'Jol:1, Page:13.

While advising his elder son, he says:

"Oh son! a wise person, should constantly keep on evaluating himself,
keep his tongue under control, and be aware of the event and happenings
occurring around him." lmam Ali (ASWS) has specially stressed on this
point that while fixing and distributing time, the following three
important obligations should not only be given preference, but they are
of primary importance, He says:-

"It is obligatory upon a believer (mo'min) that he should organize his
"daily" routine, in such a way that he should give some specific time
for "presenting his yearnings (aspirations, desires)", "prayer and
supplication" In Allah's Grace; and duration of time to took after his
affairs of earning and economy; and a portion of his time should be
devoted for his legitimate and personal entertainments. "152
