Freedom of Private Enterprise and its Limits
============================================

Capitalism permits individuals to manipulate their wealth in all ways
and means, regardless of their possible consequences on the society. It
is believed that the society's interests are served by the individual's
motives and enterprise. Hence, there is no conflict economically between
private and society interests as it is viewed by Capitalism.

For example, a bus company is providing social service, but it is
private enterprise. Other public services, like education, railways,
roads, etc., used to be considered as private enterprises, which furnish
social services.

Socialism denies individuals economic freedom. The State or Government
steps in, plan and administer the bulk of the country's economy with no
regard to people's incentives.

Islam recognises people's freedom and right of possession, but defines
its boundaries and limits. The boundaries are located by the following
items:

(a) Indirect influence of the Islamic education
-----------------------------------------------

It should be taken for granted that one of the main tasks of the Islamic
State is education; education which carries the Islamic image and
spirit. It is important to note that no means of propagation and
education will be spared, when the Islamic State re-emerges again. This
is a natural measure since education moulds people's thoughts,
sentiments, and their general attitudes towards life.

Then, when the Islamic moral code is prevailing in the society the fear
of violating the laws will be considerably less. This is a logical
conclusion for there will be, in every person, an inner motive for
safe-guarding the law. Hence the danger of capital inflation and
monopoly are considerably reduced when Islamic laws are applied.

(b) Direct Interference of the State
------------------------------------

Islamic State can intervene on two levels.

(i) Protection of the permanent fundamental Islamic legislations. This
field includes the following sectors:

1. Taking the permanent tax (Zakat) which ranges between 2.5-10% of the
stored possession (which is not essential for one's living), in every
year.

خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ صَدَقَةً تُطَهِّرُهُمْ وَتُزَكِّيهِمْ بِهَا
وَصَلِّ عَلَيْهِمْ ۖ إِنَّ صَلَاتَكَ سَكَنٌ لَهُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ
عَلِيمٌ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Of their goods take alms, that so thou mightiest purify and sanctify
them; and pray on their behalf . Verily thy prayer is a source of
security f or them: and God is One heareth and knoweth. " (Qur'an,
9:103)***

Khums is another revenue of taxation. It is one fifth of the annual
excess of one's profit to be taken by the Islamic Government.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا غَنِمْتُمْ مِنْ شَيْءٍ فَأَنَّ لِلَّهِ خُمُسَهُ
وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينِ
وَابْنِ السَّبِيلِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And k now that out of all the booty that y e may acquire (in war) a
fifth share is assigned to God, and the Apostle, and to near relatives,
orphans, the needy , and the wayfarer. " (Qur'an,***  
***8:41)***

2. To prevent capital interest or usury.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ الرِّبَا لَا يَقُومُونَ إِلَّا كَمَا يَقُومُ
الَّذِي يَتَخَبَّطُهُ الشَّيْطَانُ مِنَ الْمَسِّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ
قَالُوا إِنَّمَا الْبَيْعُ مِثْلُ الرِّبَا ۗ وَأَحَلَّ اللَّهُ
الْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ الرِّبَا ۚ فَمَنْ جَاءَهُ مَوْعِظَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِ

فَأُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Those who devour usury w ill not stand except as stands one whom the
Evil One by his touch has driven to madness. That is because they say:
"Trade is like usury, "but God hath permitted trade and forbidden usury.
Those who after receiving direction from their Lord, shall be pardoned f
or the past; their case is f or God (to judge): but those who repeat
(the offence) are companions of the Fire: they will abide therein
(forever). "( Qur'an, 2:275)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَذَرُوا مَا بَقِيَ

فَأْذَنُوا بِحَرْبٍ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ۖ وَإِنْ تُبْتُمْ
فَلَكُمْ رُءُوسُ أَمْوَالِكُمْ لَا تَظْلِمُونَ وَلَا تُظْلَمُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"O ye who believe fear God, and give up what remains of your demand f
or usury, if ye are indeed believers. If y e do it not, take notice of
war from God and His Apostle: but if ye turn back , ye shall have y our
Capital sums: deal not unjustly, and ye shall not be dealt with
unjustly." ( Qur'an, 2:278-9)***

3. Seizing lands and national resources which are not under exploitation
by their owners. There is a well-known Islamic rule in this respect:
"Land is for whoever cultivates it."[^1]

4. Preventing accumulation and storage of money which is not utilised in
the national production.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَالَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ الذَّهَبَ وَالْفِضَّةَ وَلَا يُنْفِقُونَهَا
فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَبَشِّرْهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And there are those w ho bury gold and silver and spend it not in
the way of God: announce unto them a most grievous penalty ."***[^2]
***(Qur'an, 9:34)***

5. Protecting the hereditary laws which help in distributing the
person's wealth among his relatives, which is a big action against
capital inflation.

7. Administering and utilising the national production by using the
collective possession field.

8. To prevent gambling, cheating, monopoly, etc.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

</blockquote>

***"O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling (dedication of) stones,
and arrows, are an abomination, of Satan's handiwork : eschew such
(abomination), that ye may prosper."(Qur'an, 5:90)***

The Prophet (p.b.u.h.a.h.f.) said: "No one indulges in monopoly but a
sinful."

Imam \`Ali (peace be on him) wrote in his letter to Malik al-Ashtar
(governor of Egypt at the time): "Prohibit monopoly for the Messenger of
God had forbidden it. Therefore, if anyone who indulges in monopoly
after being warned, should be punished and penalised with no excess."

The Prophet (p.b.u.h.a.h.f.) said: "He who cheats us is not one of us."

(ii) There is a special right for the Islamic Government to nationalise
or seize part of the possessions of affluent people. This right is
practised during national crisis such as wars, etc.

In Imam \`Ali's letter to Malik al-Ashtar, were orders which fixed
prices. He wrote: "Let selling be with just balances, and prices should
cause no injustice for the seller or the buyer." Tirmidhi narrated, his
source was, Rafi\` bin Khadij, that a letter read: (The Messenger of God
has forbidden us from something which was useful to us; when one of us
had a piece of land we used to rent it for some of its products or
money. The Prophet (p.b.u.h.a.h.f.) said: "If any of you has a land, let
him offer it to his brother (in Islam) or he should cultivate it").

Ibn Taymiyyah wrote in his book al-His-bah' ; "The head of State has the
right to force people to sell what they possess, in return of its
equivalence at the time, when people are in desperate need of it. When
somebody has food which he does not need, while people are starving, he
should be forced to sell in return of its equivalent price, and for this
reason jurists said: \`Those who are in need of food which is possessed
by others, can obtain the food without consent of their owners provided
the equivalent value is paid. In the case of demanding a higher price
than the normal one, their claim does not hold' "
