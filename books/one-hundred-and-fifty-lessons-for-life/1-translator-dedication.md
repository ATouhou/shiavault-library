Translator Dedication
=====================

I dedicate this work sincerely to my parents, Zahra and Abolfazl, who
did not spare any effort to help me succeed.

I also thank my husband, Ar-Ridhaâ€™ Muhammad Husayni, who provided
encouragement and help in all stages of my work.

I appreciate the valuable assistance of Mr. Ruin Naddaf in reviewing and
editing this translation.

It is my earnest wish that this book would serve as a good reference for
clarifying Islam's perspectives towards different issues in this world
and the hereafter.

All success comes from Allah (S.w.T.).
