13: To Stand Up With Respect At The Mention Of Imam’s Name
==========================================================

Whenever one utters the name or title of Imam (as) one should stand up
in respect, as had been the practice of the Twelver Shias. The textual
proof can be cited from the report regarding Imam Sadiq (as) as quoted
in the book *Najmus Thaqib*. The report says that one day the name of
Imam az-Zaman (aj) was mentioned in assembly of Imam Sadiq (as). When
the name was uttered, Imam Sadiq (as) stood up in respect.[^1]

That standing up in respect is recommended (Mustahab) is proved from
this above tradition, but there are some occasions when it is obligatory
to do so. For example, when the name of Imam (as) is uttered and all the
people stand up. Anyone who continues to sit without any valid excuse
has disrespected Imam (as). And there is no doubt that disrespect
towards Imam (as) is haraam, because it tantamount to disrespect of
Allah.
