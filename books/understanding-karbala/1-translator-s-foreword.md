Translator’s Foreword
=====================

***In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful***

Praise is due to Allah Whose worth cannot be described by speakers,
whose bounties cannot be counted by calculators and whose claim (to
obedience) cannot be satisfied by those who attempt to do so.[^1]

By the Grace of the Almighty, the English translation of *Karbala’
Shinasi* is in your hands.

The late author, Allamah Sayyid Sa’eed Akhtar Rizvi (q.s.) in yet
another of his masterpieces has skillfully analyzed and explained the
different aspects of the Karbala’ Tragedy.

It is basically a collection of articles published in different
periodicals over the years and a radio speech. But they were arranged by
the author himself in this present book form and published in Urdu. It
was much appreciated by the community in India and Pakistan and had been
reprinted a number of times.

We are all aware of the malicious propaganda of the enemies of Islam and
humanity to target the Muharram ceremonies and the conspiracy to
belittle the Great Sacrifice of Imam Husayn (a.s). This book is a
refutation of all objections raised in this connection.

The author, in his typical style has refuted all the allegations in a
scholarly manner but at the same time made the text readable and
interesting even for laymen.

Translation of Urdu and Persian terms is given in brackets and
frequently used terms are also defined in the “Glossary of Islamic
Terms” at the end of the book for readers not familiar with Islamic
terminology.

*Wassalaam*
