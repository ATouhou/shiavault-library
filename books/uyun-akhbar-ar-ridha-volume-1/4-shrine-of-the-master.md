Shrine Of The Master
====================

O The Shrine of the Master!

No one else existed like the Master

Guidance perished after him

Death followed it

O his shrine!

May not Godâ€™s blessings upon you ever stop

Every evening and every dawn

Like a breeze

To us he was like a rain full of mercy

From which we were nourished

To us he was like a bright star

With whose light we could find our way

**Ibn Moshaya**
