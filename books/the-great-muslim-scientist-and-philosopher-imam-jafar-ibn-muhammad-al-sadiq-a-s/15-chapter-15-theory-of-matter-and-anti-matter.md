Chapter 15: Theory of Matter and Anti-Matter
============================================

One of the unique theories of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq (A.S) is that
everything except Allah has its opposites, but this does not result in a
conflict, otherwise the whole universe would be destroyed. This is the
theory of matter and anti-matter. The difference between matter and
anti-matter is that in matter the electrons are negatively charged and
protons are positively charged. But in anti-matter, the electrons are
positively charged and protons are negatively charged. Scientists have
concluded that if one kilogram of matter collides with one kilogram of
anti-matter, so much energy will be released that the whole world will
be destroyed.

Professor Alfven is of the opinion that there is no other source in the
universe, which can generate so much energy as quasars, except explosion
of matter with anti-matter.

Just as uranium was used for exploding an atomic bomb, helium would be
used for exploding matter with anti-matter. Russian scientists have
already obtained anti-matter of helium.
