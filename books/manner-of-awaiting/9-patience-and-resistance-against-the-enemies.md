Patience and Resistance Against the Enemies
===========================================

Considering that the period of occultation has stretched too far, the
enemies take undue advantage of the situation and taunt and vex the
followers of Imam az-Zaman (a.t.f.s.). Some say: He has not been born.
Another group writes: He has come and left! Yet, some consider the Shias
to be liars and label them as superstitious and ignorant people!

As we truly know and conceive that Imam az-Zaman (a.t.f.s.) is alive and
present, we should adopt patience and not allow the least doubt to enter
our hearts.

Imam Husain (a.s.) says:

*“From us are the twelve guided ones. The first of them is Amir-ul-
Mu’minin, Ali-ibn-Abi Talib and the last of them is the ninth from my
progeny who is the Imam establishing the truth. Through him, the
Almighty Allah will make alive the earth after its death and will make
the righteous religion to prevail over all religions, though the enemies
may averse. For him is the ‘ghaibah’ (occultation), due to which a group
will forsake religion while another group would remain steadfast and
consequently vexed. They would be scorned and sarcastically addressed:
‘If you tell the truth, then when will this promise turn out true?’*[^1]

*Know that anyone who forbears and tolerates the teasing of the enemies
during occultation is like one who participates in the holy Jihad
accompanying the Prophet (s.a.w.a.).”*[^2]
