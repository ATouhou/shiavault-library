Lesson Fourteen: Source of Wealth
=================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اُطْلُبُوا الرِّزْقَ في خَبايَا الأرْضِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Seek for your sustenance in the depths of the Earth.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

This instruction was issued by the Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon
him and his progeny) at a time when the importance of mines and other
resources underneath the earth was not known.

Such instructions illustrate the richness of knowledge imparted to us by
Islam as well as its emphasis on making efforts to search far and wide
so as to exploit for our benefit the abundant natural resources
including the ones hidden in the depths of the earth.
