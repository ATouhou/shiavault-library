The Idealistic theory of Rights:
================================

The Idealistic theory of Rights is also known as personality theory of
Rights. This theory insists on the inner developments of man, on the
development of his full potentiality. Hence, it treats rights of
personality as a supreme and absolute right. According to this theory
all other rights have been denied from right of personality and are
conditioned by it[^12] .
