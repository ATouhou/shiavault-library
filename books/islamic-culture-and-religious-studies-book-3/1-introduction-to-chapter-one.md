Introduction To Chapter One
===========================

In The Name Of Allah (S.W.T.), the Beneficent, the Merciful


**TAWHEED Monotheism**

In the past two books, we have studied the need for a God to be
accountable to and spoken of the importance of believing in the Oneness
of God, which is the foundation stone of our faith.

In this first chapter of our third book, we will begin our study by
looking into the concept of 'Cause and Effect'. After this, we will
discuss how to prove the existence of God.

These are extremely important topics that cannot be taken lightly. We
should keep in mind that in order to make any progress in gaining the
pleasure and nearness of Allah (S.W.T.), we must first be willing to put
the effort towards achieving this aim. We must open our hearts as well
as our minds to receive this information and only then will we be able
to convert Imaan (faith) into Yaqeen (Conviction).


**Munaajat Sing to the Lord**

O my Merciful Lord! Whose sweet name all tongues mention, The entire
world is warm and bright because of Your warmth and wonderful lights.

We need only to glance at the mountains, jungles, deserts and oceans,
To find You more visible than visibility itself! You are hidden from our
eyes, but our eyes have gained sight from You. I sacrifice my life, my
self, to You O Lord, who is hidden and invisible. In the heavens above
and the earth, O Lord, how can I describe the beauty that you have
created?

Birds came to being because of You, colored flowers and beautiful
gardens came into existence at Your command. The universe enjoys the
sounds of waterfalls and You are the spring of it The world accepts
orders from You alone, because You are the continuous Cherisher of our
needs.

You are ever generous, independent, merciful,
One who solves every soul's problems and caretaker of us all.
You are the most kind; You are the Best of all bests; You give company
to every heart, and every spirit derives its purity from You.
You are Ever-Forgiving and Merciful.
O Lord, enlighten my spirit through Your divine light, make my tongue
busy with Your dhikr (remembrance)
O my Lord, free my inner spirit and make my heart anxious to meet You!

**Lesson 1 : Cause and Effect**

You walk past a tree and see the leaves on its branches gently stirring
as the wind kisses them. Your eyes appreciate the beautiful scene but
consider this - what about the underlying message of this simple natural
phenomenon? Looking at the same event through an angle other than that
of visual appreciation, we can see that when we see leaves moving we
immediately register that this movement is a result of the wind blowing
against them.

Therefore, it would be correct to say that the wind is the Cause of the
stirring of the leaves i.e. if the wind did not blow, then it would not
Result in the leaves moving.

Thus, we can call the actual movement of the leaves - Ma'lool (Effect)
and the wind itself - Ellat (Cause) Let us look at another example that
has been made famous in scientific history. We all know the story of the
famous philosopher/scientist who sat under an apple tree. As he
pondered, one apple suddenly dropped to the ground.

He picked it up, looked at it, smelt it and then wondered to himself
'Why did the apple fall down?' From this simple and obvious question,
the man went on to discover the force of gravity, which is today one of
the most important aspects of physical science. Here we can say that the
falling down of the apple was the Ma'lool and the gravity of the earth
was the Ellat.

Let us look at a third example to make things even clearer. Imagine
that you have sat down in a room with your back to a wall. Strangely, as
you lean back, you feel heat emanating from the wall and wonder to
yourself what the cause of the heat can be. Seeking your answer, you
leave the room and try to search for what is on the other side of that
particular wall.

When you reach there, you see a heater attached to it and everything
falls into place! Now you understand what the cause of the heat is and
the hot wall is no longer a mystery. In such a case, the heater is the
Cause and the warm wall is the Effect. If there had not been a heater
then the wall would not have been warm.

All this shows us that cause and effect are two halves of a complete
relationship. Without a particular cause, its effect would no longer
exist. Therefore we can conclude that in our world full of existence,
there is an underlying system based on the theory of cause and effect.

**The Non-Physical State**

Cause and effect do not always manifest themselves in the visual or
physical world as in the examples above. Sometimes we can see only the
cause and sense the effect, at others it may be the opposite i.e. we
sense the cause and see the effect.

For example, move your hand. This movement of the hand is the effect of
your willing the action to happen. If you did not want your hand to move
then it would have remained stationary. Thus, your will becomes the
unseen cause.

The same would be with look at something. The looking is an action,
which can be classified as an effect. You are the cause of it. If you
did not initiate it, then the looking could not have been.

You listen to what your teacher is saying. This listening is an action
based on you. Your listening exists only because you do. It is an effect
of your existence - which is the cause in this case. From these
examples, we can further see that the effect is based on and related to
the cause.

You look after your friend and take care of him. The caring that you
show is related to your self. If you are not there, your kindness to him
will not be there. Similarly, your knowledge is related to your
existence. If you are not there, your knowledge and any actions
resulting from it will also cease to be.

There is a special connection between your knowledge, your kindness,
your Iraada (Willingness) and your self. All these qualities are related
to and in need of you. This special relationship is called Eliyyat
(Cause and Effect).

Your actions are related to you and their existence is from your own
existence. You are the one who moves, who writes, who walks, who talks,
who thinks, who understands, who shows love, who knows and decides. All
these actions are effects and you are the cause of them all. Because of
you, they exist.

In his life, man will always consciously or subconsciously work with
the knowledge he has of causes and their effects. When he finds himself
thirsty, he looks for water to quench his thirst. When he feels the
pangs of hunger, he eats. When he feels cold, he lights a fire. He does
all this because experience has taught him that water is the cause of
removing thirst, food is the cause of appeasing hunger and fire is the
cause of bringing warmth.

Even in our daily lives, we react by searching for causes e.g. when we
hear an noise, we look around for its source (cause) because we know
that it could not exist without one; when we enter a dark room, we
immediately search for the switch to turn on the lights.

Doctors study the causes of diseases in order to find cures to them. To
explain to others what you have in mind, you have to speak. Cause and
effect is a common sense that is part and parcel of our lives. Every
human being is aware of this issue and he understands, accepts and he
bases his life on it naturally.

If a human being is not able to understand this issue or does not
accept it, then life for him would be impossible. Insaan (human being),
by nature, looks for the cause of all that he sees. He constantly asks
himself: Why are the leaves moving? Why did the apple drop down? Why is
the wall is warm? Why this? Why On the other hand, from this same
theory, a human being expects something to happen (effect) from every
occurrence (cause) in life. He expects the sunrise to bring light, the
fire to give heat, the water and the food to remove his thirst and
hunger.

Seeing that even the simplest of all structures in this world survives
on the Law of Eliyyat (Cause and Effect) we find ourselves wondering
about the larger order.

We ask ourselves: If even a passing noise or a feeling requires a cause
to exist then what of the universe and everything in it? What is the
cause of the heavens and earth, the stars and the sun? What brought
human life and its complexities into existence?

From these questions, it is a simple step to understanding and
accepting that the cause of such a fantastically complicated system as
our universe must be an entity that possesses flawless Intellect and
limitless Power.

This Cause would have to be able to bring into being all the forms of
animated and unanimated matter and arrange them in a logical form within
a self-supporting structure. This Entity would have to possess qualities
far above and beyond those of the most powerful creation that resulted
from Its Will.

Such an Entity would then not fall into the worldly category of cause
but would be better defined as Creator. This Creator is Allah (S.W.T.).
All-Knowing, All-Powerful, Independent, Eternal. He encompasses
everything and all things need and rely on him to be. Just as our simple
qualities rely on our existence to be, our entire selves rely on Him to
exist. We are at His Mercy.

When we realize exactly how helpless we are in front of Him, we then
can appreciate His kindness and generosity to us. Despite having the
power to destroy us if He so wishes, Allah (S.W.T.) looks upon us with
patience, love and forgiveness.

Thus, He is worthy of being Master and we should be proud to call
ourselves His slaves for even this is a status far above that which we
deserve. Only when we understand this unique relationship, will our
souls truly humble themselves before him in gratitude for His countless
favors and take His guidance as a way of life with which to live.

A Holy Verse
"Surely Allah upholds the heaven and the earth lest they come to the
knot. If they should come to the knot, there is none who can uphold
them..." Sura Fatir, Verse 41

**SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT…**

1. There is a special connection between all things that exist in this
world. That connection is called Elliyat - the cause and the effect.

2. The universe is a huge collection of existences each of which has a
cause.

3. The existing universe and everything in it is referred to as Adillat
(proofs) of the existence of Allah (S.W.T.) Who, Himself, is needless of
a cause.

**Think And Answer**

1. What is the connection between cause and effect?
2. What is the specific term used for the theory of cause and effect?
3. Mention a few things that rely on you for their existence and you
are the cause of them. Do not use the examples given in the text.
4. Mention few natural reactions that prove that human beings
understand how the theory of cause and effect works. Try to use examples
from your daily life that have not been mentioned above.
5. What do we mean when we say the role of cause and effect is a
universal phenomenon? Explain two proofs to support your answer.
