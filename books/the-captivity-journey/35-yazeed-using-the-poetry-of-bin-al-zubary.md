Yazeed Using the Poetry of Bin Al-Zubary
========================================

Most of the narrations had confirmed that Yazeed Bin Muawiya had recited
the poetry of Al-Zubary during his public assembly, Al-Zubary is a poet
from Quraish at the time of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic stage) who was very
tough on Muslims:

I wish my old chiefs at Badr could witness

Al-Khazraj’s fearing of the impact of rush

They would have cheered and shouted happily,

Then they would have said, good job O Yazeed

I shall not be from the Khandaf if I do not avenge,

From the family of Ahmad for what he had done

Hashim had manipulated the Reign

So, neither news arrived nor revelations happened

Thus, Yazeed had added to these verses what shows his disbelief and his
bad intention; it also exposes what is in his heart from disbelief and
hatred towards the Messenger of Allah (P) and his progeny R:

I shall not be from the Utbata if I do not avenge,

From the family of Ahmad for what he had done

Thus Sayyeda Zeinab (O) did refer to Yazeed’s reciting of these verses
during the public assembly by saying: "It did not take him long to show
his hatred to us, Ahlu El-Bayt …, as he was happily announcing the
killing of his son and the captivation of his pedigree, without regrets
or any guilt: (I wish my grandparents)..."

Thus one of the companions told Yazeed after having said these verses:
"O prince of believers, you have renounced your Islam!"

Yazeed said: "Yes indeed, I do repent to Allah…"

So the companion replied: "I swear to God, I shall never be with you in
the same place!" then he got up and left.

And this was a confession from Yazeed that what he had said does imply
disbelieving and the renouncing of one’s religion. Nevertheless, after
Yazeed had batted the mouth of Imam Hussain (Q), he ordered them to hang
it, so it was hung up for three days at the door of the mosque in
Damascus.
