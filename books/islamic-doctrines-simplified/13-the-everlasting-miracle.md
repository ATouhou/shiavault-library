The Everlasting Miracle
=======================

All the prophets' miracles, which they brought to their people, were
immediate examples. They were temporary for certain people, except the
miracle of the Holy Qur'an, which remains perpetual and everlasting for
all. It can neither disappear nor be altered. It is protected by Allah's
permission. The Holy Qur'an will remain safe till the end of mankind.
Allah, the Almighty, says:

***“Surely We have sent down the Reminder (Qur'an) and We will most
surely be its guardian.” Holy Qur'an (15:9)***

Allah, the Most Exalted, preserves it and no one can change it by
bringing any chapters or verses, attempting to alter Allah's words. It
was brought through Prophet Muhammad until eternity for all mankind.

As Prophet Muhammad [s] is the Seal of all prophets and no prophet will
come after him, his message perfected all previous messages. It is
everlasting for all mankind, with its principles for everyone to learn
from its goodness and righteousness, to know the right path and believe
and worship Allah alone, associating no one with Him.
