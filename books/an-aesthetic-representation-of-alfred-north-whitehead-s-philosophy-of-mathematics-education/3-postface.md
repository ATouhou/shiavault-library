*Ali’s in the World of Heavens* is an aesthetic learning experience that
depicts Alfred North Whitehead’s philosophy of education as it was
described in his books (Whitehead, 1910; 1911; 1929; 1934; 1938a; 1938b;
1938c; 1938d; 1985) and by other analyses (Ernest, 2000). Process
philosophy implicitly guides much of the discussion throughout this
paper. Many of the concepts are explained in the endnotes to help
readers see hypothesized connections. In short, this narrative uses a
familiar style to explain*becoming* as it belongs to the temporal world,
compared to*being,* which is characterized by an eternal non-changing
world. This short story demonstrates how all*becoming* s are moving to a
destination to fulfill their potential - thus becoming*important being*
s rather than remaining simply*expression* s.
