Elimination of Kharijites
=========================

**( 110 )**

This faction emerged towards the end of the fourth decade of the first
Hijra Century as a consequence of the Formidable Fraud. They did not
remain in field for more than one and a half centuries. Because of their
recklessness and desperation they were victimised by the Caliphs, and
this brought themselves and their religion to elimination and
liquidation. They were totally eliminated in the initial period of the
Abbasid rule. Their dry and lifeless logic, their aridity and harshness
of manners, the divergence of their ways from life and last of all their
courage which shunned dissimulation even in its true logical sense,
wrought their elimination. The Kharijites school was not a school which
ought to have survived. However, it has left its imprints. Their
thoughts and their ideas have influenced all Islamic denominations. Even
now-a-days many 'Nahrwanis' are available. Exactly, as it was in days
and time of Ali, they are the internal, and the most dangerous, enemies
of Islam. As the Mo'awiyahs and Amr bin 'Ases had been and are always
present, they exploit, to their own benefit, the existence of the
Nahrwanis though they are considered to be their enemies.
