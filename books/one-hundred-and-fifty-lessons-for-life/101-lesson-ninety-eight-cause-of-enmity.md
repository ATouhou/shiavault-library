Lesson Ninety Eight: Cause Of Enmity
====================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلنَّاسُ أَعْداءُ مآ جَهِلُوا
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

People are enemies of things which they do not know ( or understand
).[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

We see some people who deny a lot of truths and rise against them while
not being able to find any cause for it save ignorance and unawareness.
This wise saying is specially true in religious matters. Take the case
of people who are well versed professionals in other sciences but oppose
and disbelieve when it comes to religious matters. If we analyze this,
we find that they have not really understood the depth and philosophy of
religion.
