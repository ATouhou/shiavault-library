102. The Active Participle  إسمُ الفاعِل
========================================

In general, the meaning of the active participle is "performing/having
performed" the action indicated by the verb. The English equivalent is
commonly (a) an adjective ending in -ing, as in:

** ** (a)  **النـِّساءُ السَّاکناتُ في هذِهِ الشـَّقـَّةِ طالِباتٌ**

The women living in this apartment are students.

In addition, a great many Active Participles have taken on specific
concrete meanings and are used as (b) ordinary nouns such as:

(b)  **کاتِبٌ ، عامِلٌ ، طالِبٌ ، حاکِمٌ ، باحِثٌ ، ساکِنٌ**

The third possible use of the active participle is what the Arab
Grammarians call**the circumstantial or Haal Construction.**

<p dir="rtl">
**حَضَرَتِ الطالبَة ُ إلی الصَّفِّ** حامِلـَة ً کَتـُبَها **.**
</p>

The student (f) came to class carrying her book.
