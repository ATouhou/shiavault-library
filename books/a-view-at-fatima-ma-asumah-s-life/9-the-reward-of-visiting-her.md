The Reward of Visiting Her
==========================

"10"

1- Sa'd bin Abdullah said:

“I asked Abal-Hassan Ar-Ridha “a.s.” about Fatima the daughter of Musa
bin Jafar “a.s.” so he answered:

“who ever visited her, he would win paradise”. [^1]

2- The son of Ar-Ridha “a.s.” said:

“whoever visited the holy shrine of my aunt in Qom, he would gain
paradise.” [^2]

3- As-Saadiq “a.s.” said:

“Allah “s.w.” surely has a holy house, which is Macca, and the
Messenger of God surely had holy house, that is Al-Madeena, and the
Prince of the believers Ali “a.s.” has a holy house, which is Kufa,
while we a holy house and that is just Qom, in which a woman from my
progeny shall be buried, who is called Fatima, and whoever visited her,
he should be rewarded by winning paradise. [^3]

4- And from him it was also narrated that he said:

“The visit of Fatima Al-Ma'sooma equals the paradise.” [^4]

5- From Sa'ad, from Ali bin Musa Ar-Ridha “a.s.”, who said: “O, Sa'ad,
do you have a grave?”

I said: I may be sacrificed for you, yes the grave of Fatima, the
daughter of Musa bin Ja'far “a.s.”.

Thus Imam “a.s.” said: “Ok. Whoever visited her, knowing her stance, he
should win the paradise, and you came on the grave, you should stand at
her head direction towards kibla, and say thirty-four times “Allahu
Akbar, thirty-three times subhan Allah and say “Al-Hamdulil-Lah
thirty-three times, then you say:

Thus I ask Allah to show us the happiness and to release us by you, and
to join us and you with your grandfather Muhammad’s company, and not to
divest us from your familiarity, since thy is the All lover, All

I approach to Allah by the friendship of you, and by the disassociation
against your enemies, and by admitting to Allah that I accepted and
satisfied in Him not denying nor priding, and satisfied, while we
forseek your way, O’ Allah, and your satisfaction, and the hereafter
world.

O, Fatima intercede with us, as you have a great stance with Allah.

Allah, I ask Thee to make my ending happy, and not take away what you
have given me. There is neither might nor power but with Allah the High,
the Great. May you comply with our supplication and accept it with Thy
Generosity, They Mercy, and Thy Bounteousness. Allah bless Muhammad, and
His Pious and pure progeny and give them abundant peace! O, the most
Merciful of the Merciful. [^5]

\`Thus our last message is that praise be towards the lord of the
worlds.
