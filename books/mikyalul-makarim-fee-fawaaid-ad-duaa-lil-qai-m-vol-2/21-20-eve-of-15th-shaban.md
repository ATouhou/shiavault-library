20. Eve Of 15th Shaban
======================

Since this night heralds the birth of our Master, Saahebuz Zamaan (aj),
it is appropriate that the believers are busy in praying for him. It has
come in traditions that supplications are accepted in this night.

I say: Previously we had mentioned that this Dua is most important in
view of scholars and therefore it is appropriate that we should give it
precedence at every occasion of recitation; and that which supports our
point is that the writer of Jamaalus Saliheen has quoted a very valuable
Dua from our master for this night. This supplication begins as follows:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اللهم صل على محمد سيد المرسلين، وخاتم النبيين...
  </p>
</blockquote>

O Allah, bless Muhammad, the chief of the messengers and the seal of the
prophets…

We shall present this Dua at the beginning of Part Seven and also
discuss its importance there.

And also that which supports our contention is a Dua mentioned in Iqbal,
quoting from Zaadul Maad, which begins as follows:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اللهم بحق ليلتنا هذه ومولودها...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“O Allah, for the sake of this night of ours and for the sake of the one
who was born in it…”

By this we can estimate the greatness and importance of this night, lest
we spend it inattention and carelessness, and abandon the service of His
Eminence in it. One who is not convinced about the importance of this
night must see what Imam Ja’far Sadiq (as) has said regarding this
matter. He says: “If I live till his time, I will serve him all my
life.” In addition to this, this Dua is a form of thanksgiving for a
great bounty, that is the birth of Imam Qaim (aj); and as mentioned in
some traditional reports in Mustadrakul Wasail, it is the night when
deeds are presented to the Imam (as) for inspection.

  <p>
 ولو ادركته لخدمته أيام حياتي 
  </p>
</blockquote>
