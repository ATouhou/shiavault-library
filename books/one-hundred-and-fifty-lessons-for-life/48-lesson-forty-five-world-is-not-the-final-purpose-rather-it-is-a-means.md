Lesson Forty Five: World Is Not The Final Purpose, Rather It Is A Means
=======================================================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلدُّنْيا خُلِقَتْ لِغَيْرِها وَ لَمْ تُخْلَقْ لِنَفْسِها
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

World is created for another purpose, not for itself. [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

People sometimes have difficulty comprehending the nature of this world
. They find one set of interpretations of verses and speeches commending
the world and its material tools , introducing it as a house of commerce
or farm of saints . And then they find verses and speeches blaming it
and calling it dangerous, deceptive and source of conceit .

The above tradition clarifies the issue succinctly indicating that when
the world and its material tools are used as a means of attaining human
development and justice and prosperity for all, it is to be valued and
commended. But when it is considered as an end in itself , just for
immediate and inordinate fulfillment of desires, with no higher purpose,
and causes rebellion, conceit and obstinacy, it becomes hateful and
dangerous.
