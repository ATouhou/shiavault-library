Chapter 16
==========

Sumayah decided to stop going to that particular park for some time and
visited other public gardens instead. As she was strolling through a
garden one day, she saw a woman begging for money and Sumayah gave her a
substantial amount of money. The woman was quite happy and uttered words
of gratitude as she walked away.

At that moment Sumayah heard someone say, "How generous you are,
Miss...? You should not have given the beggar that much money."

Sumayah was shocked and dismayed to see the same man who had spoken to
her on previous occasions standing nearby. She became pale and looked
around. On seeing lot of people nearby, she felt safe and said in a loud
voice, "How dare you speak to me? Why are you following me?"

Hamid stuttered, "In fact, I ..."

Sumayah told him, "You are a stranger to me, and I don't even know your
name. You are very impolite to address me."

The woman beggar was standing nearby and Hamid found it difficult to
explain his behaviour. Sumayah's anger confounded him, and he didn't
reply.

"Why don't you answer?" Sumayah asked. â€œI swear by Allah I would have
called the police, had not it been for this wedding ring on your finger.
I pity your wife."

Sumayah left the park, and Hamid saw the woman beggar pick something up
off the ground.

He grabbed her hand and shouted, "Thief!"

Then he quickly asked the waiter to follow Sumayah, since the beggar had
picked up a gold coin near where she had been sitting.  
 Sumayah returned and confirmed in front of everyone that she herself
had given the coin to the destitute woman.  
 Hamid was very embarrassed and surprised by Sumayah's behaviour.

He thought deeply about her and said to himself, 'In fact, I am not a
good person. How worthy it is to do good for others! I never thought
such virtuous girls existed.''
