Responsibility 52: Assisting the Imam Part 4
============================================

The true believers must supplicate to Allah that when Imam al-Mahdi
(ajtf) makes his advent, He places them among his companions, helpers
and those who are his attendants. In addition, this supplication will
also petition Allah for the opportunity to witness the Imam’s return!

There are various supplications which have been narrated in the books of
prayers in regards to this responsibility, such as Du’a al-Nur[^1], Du’a
al-’Ahd[^2] and others all of which are from the Ahlul Bayt (as).

In Du’a al-’Ahd, we read the following:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَاجْعَلْنِي مِنْ أَنْصَارِهِ وَ أَشْيَاعِهِ وَ الذَّابِّـينَ عَنْهُ
وَاجْعَلْنِـي مِنَ الْـمُسْتَشْهَدِينَ بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“And place me among his helpers and followers and defenders and among
those who (are blessed to) seek martyrdom in his presence.”

Therefore, the believers must pray to Allah that during the occultation,
they are given the opportunity to be with the companions and helpers of
this great personality.

Just as we yearn to be blessed with this rank during his return, even
during his occultation, we should have the same wish.
