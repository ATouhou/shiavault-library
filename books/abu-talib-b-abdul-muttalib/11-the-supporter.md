The Supporter
=============

Although Abu Talib was an old man, he strongly stood by Muhammad's
Mission. He was always protecting him from the Quraishi polytheists.

A big number of the Makkans believed in Allah's religion paying no
attention to the worship of the idols and to the threats of the Quraishi
tyrants.

One day, the Quraishi leaders came to Abu Talib though he was confined
to bed. They said angrily:

*Abu Talib! Keep your nephew from us because he's weakened our thoughts
and insulted our gods.*

Abu Talib became sad because his people did not want to listen to the
sound of truth. So, he said to them:

*Give me time to speak to him.*

Abu Talib told our Master Muhammad [s] the words of the Quraishi
leaders.

The Prophet [s] said respectfully:

*Uncle! I can't disobey my Lord's Order.*

Abu Jahal, the most spiteful man, said:

*We'll give him whatever he wants of our money. Rather, we'll make him
king over us if he wants.*

The Prophet [s] said:

*I want nothing but one word.*

Abu Jahal said:

*What's the word? We'll give you as ten times as it!*

Our Master Muhammad [s] said:

*Say there's no god but Allah.*

So, Abu Jahal was filled with anger:

*Ask another word instead!*

Allah's Apostle [s] said:

*If you brought me the sun and put it in my hand, I'd not ask a word
instead.*

There was tension*.* The polytheists stood up. They were threatening our
Master Muhammad [s].

Abu Talib said to our Master Muhammad:

*Save your soul and don't overburden me.*

The Prophets' eyes shed tears when he answered:

*Uncle, by Allah, if they put the sun in my right hand and the moon in
my left hand to leave this matter, I'd not leave it till Allah supports
it or I perish for it.*

The Prophet [s] stood up rubbing his tears. So, Abu Talib called him
kindly and said:

*Nephew draw near.*

Our Master Muhammad [s] drew near. His uncle kissed him and said:

*Nephew, go and say whatever you like. By Allah, I'll never leave you
alone.*

Then, he began chanting to confront the Quraishi might:

*By Allah, they all won't reach you.*

*Till a pillow of dust will be put under my head.*

*And till I'll be buried.*
