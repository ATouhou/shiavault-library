The Place of Salat
==================

**The place where we want to recite our Salat, must fulfill the
following conditions:**

1. The place must be Mubah, meaning that it is not stolen property.

2. The place must not have any movement; for example, we can not pray
our Salat in a car or on a train while it is moving, except in the case
of necessity (such as if the entire time of the Salat we are on a moving
object).

3. The place must not have a small roof such that we can not stand up
properly, or that we can not do our Ruku or Sujud the way it is supposed
to be performed.

4. If the place where we want to pray is Najis, it must not be so moist
that the najasat gets transferred to our body or clothing.

5. The place where we put our forehead must not be higher or lower than
four closed fingers, in relation to where our knees are.
