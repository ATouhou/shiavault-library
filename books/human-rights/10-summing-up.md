Summing Up
==========

While comparing the terms of Human Rights as embodied in the Islamic and
the Universal Declarations, we did lay stress on the relative position
taken by the two statements in relation to the philosophical question
(attitude towards life and existence) and the social question (attitude
towards the social system).

We specified the important relevant terms and the criteria for
recognizing Human Rights, which generally we called “Innate conscience",
and, particularly, "The true Faith". Thereafter, we briefly reviewed the
development of the legal perspective through the course of history.

In the succeeding part of the study we related the texts of the two
Declarations, the Islamic and the Universal, and presented a comparative
list of the rights contained therein.

Then we discussed the principle on which the rights had been based in
either Declaration. In the third part of the discussion we analyzed the
common points as well as the opposing views.

This was followed by briefly pointing out the shortcomings of the
Universal Declaration as well as some observations of the Islamic
Declarations.

Finally, we concluded the discussion by high lighting the most serious
deficiency in either Declaration that is lacking provisions to make
their decisions binding – a fact which renders them of little value,
particularly in regard to the positions held by many governments in the
present day world.
