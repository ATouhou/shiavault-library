Judges
======

**Judges-القضاة**

1. The most abominable (or divisive) thing is the injustice of judges.

> 1ـ أفْظَعُ (أقْطَعُ) شَيْء ظُلْمُ القُضاةِ.

2. The bane of judges is greed.

> 2ـ آفَةُ القُضاةِ الطَّمَعُ.

3. The worst of judges is one whose judgments are oppressive.

> 3ـ شَرُّ القُضاةِ مَنْ جارَتْ أقْضِيَتُهُ.

4. And he (‘a) said about the one whom he dispraised[^1]: He is a
dim-sighted person who frequently embarks on obscurities, an ignorant
person who frequently embarks on unintelligent arguments, an aggressor
against his own soul and an embellisher of traversing the path of the
impossible and vain trivialities for it.

> 4ـ وقالَ ـ عَلَيْهِ السّلامُ ـ في حَقِّ مَنْ ذَمَّهُ: عاش رَكّابُ
<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَشَوات، جاهِلٌ رَكّابُ جَهالات، عاد عَلى نَفْسِهِ، مُزَيِّنٌ لَها
سُلُوكَ المُحالاتِ، وباطِلَ التُّـرَّهاتِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

5. One whose judgments are oppressive, his power comes to an end.

> 5ـ مَنْ جارَتْ أقْضِيَتُهُ، زالَتْ قُدْرَتُهُ.

[^1]: In his description of one who does not deserve to be a judge.
