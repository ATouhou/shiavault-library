Yazīd ibn Hātib, the Happy and Prosperous Youth
===============================================

One of the Muslim youths who took part in the Battle of Uhud was Yazīd
ibn Hātib. While fighting, Yazīd ibn Hātib was badly wounded, so he was
removed from the battlefield to the village of Banī Zafar, to his
father’s house.

His relatives came to see him, and noticed that his condition was very
grave. Realizing that he was going to die, they gave him the good news
of heaven and said, “How fortunate you are that you are going to
heaven.”

But his father, who was one of the hypocrites, could not hide his
hypocrisy. He shouted, “What good news are you giving my son? Heaven is
nothing but Island of trees![^1] I swear by Allah that you deceived my
son into battle.”[^2]

[^1]: That Hātib has compared the Heaven with Ispand is due to the
abundance of the Ispand trees in deserts of Medina and around the Baqī‘
Cemetery at the time. Therefore, he meant that there exists no paradise
but Ispand trees under the soil of which he was to be buried.

Payāmbar-e Islām, p. 332.
