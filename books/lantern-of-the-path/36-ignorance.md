Ignorance
=========

Â   
 Ignorance is a form whose composition is of this world. When it
advances, there is darkness; when it retreats, there is light. The
bondsman vacillates with it as shadows vacillate with the sun. Have you
not looked at man? Sometimes you find that he is ignorant of his own
qualities and praises them, while he recognizes their faults in others
and criticizes them. At other times you find that a person knows his own
nature and criticizes it, while praising the same in others. He
vacillates between protection and disappointment. If he encounters
integrity and protection, he is correct. If he encounters lack of
assistance and desertion, he errs. The key to ignorance is being
satisfied with the knowledge one possesses, and placing all one's trust
in it. The key to knowledge is the desire to exchange one level of
knowledge for a higher level, together with divine grace and guidance.
The lowest quality of an ignorant man is that he lays claim to knowledge
which he does not deserve; his most common characteristic is ignorance
of his own ignorance, and the most extreme aspect of his ignorance is to
reject knowledge. There is nothing whose affirmation is the reality of
its negation other that worldly ignorance and greed. All ignorant people
are alike.
