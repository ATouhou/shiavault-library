Conclusion
==========

Ladies and Gentlemen, the essence of a meaningful dialogue between
civilizations is to find ways and means to bring the religious
communities to practice the ideals preached by the great Prophets of
God.

We have to challenge the extremists on both sides:

1.      to the Bin Ladens who hurt and kill innocent civilians while
the Prophet Muhammad taught compassion and kindness even to animals and
plants;

2.      to the fundamentalist Christians of southern US who formulated
a ‘just war’ argument soon after 9/11 and back the US war on theological
grounds while Jesus taught compassion and forgiveness by saying whoever
smites you on your one cheek, ‘turn the other too.’

The solution to contemporary problems is not less religion, the
solution is more religion in order to bring the ideal preached and the
practice implemented to one another. The Muslims should get closer to
the example of Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.) and the Christians should get
closer to the example of Prophet Jesus (a.s.)—only then we will have a
durable peace on the globe.

I end with the famous prayer taught to us by the Family of the
Prophet:


“*O Allah, You are the peace, from You emanates the peace and to You
shall the peace return.”*
