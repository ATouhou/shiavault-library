Is Jesus the Son of God?
========================

One of the fundamental beliefs in Christianity is the literal sonship of
Jesus Christ to God. This belief comes from the verse in John
3:16***“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life.”*** Also in I John 5:1***“Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth
him also that is begotten of him.”*** these verses clearly state that
Jesus is the only begotten, and born Son of God.

Let us look at other verses from the Bible to find out whether Jesus was
the only begotten son of God, or that there were more than one. Also let
us investigate whether Jesus was the only one born of God. Finally, let
us investigate whether the word begotten is to be taken literally.
