##### In the name of Allah the Merciful the Compassionate

Praise belongs to Allah, Who conveyed the Word to His servants through
an Imam after an Imam, so may they remember; and completed the religion
through His entrusted subjects and representatives, in every time and
age, for a people who believe. And blessings and greetings be unto the
one that apostles and prophets gave the happy tidings of his and his
successors, Muhammad the master of the creation, and his Household the
lights of darkness, until the Day they shall be resurrected. Divine
damnation be on their enemies so long as the heavens and the earths
endure.

Here is the thirteenth volume from the book *Bihār al-Anwār* expounding
the history of the Twelfth Imam, the Awaited Guide, the Victorious
Mahdi, the Light of Lights, the Representative of the Almighty, Hidden
from the view of the eyes, Present in the hearts of the virtuous, the
Pillar of Faith, the Remover of Sorrows, the Representative of the
All-Merciful, al-Hujja Ibn al-Hasan, the Imam of the Age, blessings of
Allah be unto him and his infallible forefathers as long as the ages
come and go, from the authorships of the servant of the traditions of
the Virtuous Imams and the dust of the threshold of narrators, Muhammad
the son of Muhammad Taqi, may Allah resurrect them both with their pure
masters and make them in their governance of their supporters and aides.
