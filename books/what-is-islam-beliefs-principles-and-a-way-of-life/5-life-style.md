**4-AN ISLAMIC LIFE-STYLE**

Question:

What is meant by an Islamic life-style?

Answer:

An Islamic life-style relates to man's various activities but, however,
concerns matters which Islam either encourages or discourages but which
are not in the category of being obligatory or forbidden.

Such a life-style or way of living is to the greater benefit of the
individual and society in this world and the next.

Question:

If these matters bring about an upward spiritual growth in man why has
not Islam made them obligatory?

Answer:

Because Islam realizes that man by nature is weak and does not want to
tire him out with a plethora of laws. Therefore it has only made
obligatory what is essential for his religion and his wellbeing in this
life and has left the non-essential matters up to him entirely. If he
wishes he can do them, and if he does not want to do them then he need
not.

Islam has issued directives concerning matters of which it approves or
disapproves so that those of strong character who seek greater advance
and well-being for themselves and for society as a whole should act upon
them.

**What is forbidden in Islam**

**5-WHAT IS FORBIDDEN IN ISLAM**

Question:

What is the meaning of something forbidden?

Answer:

Something forbidden is what Islam has prohibited and has forbidden
being done absolutely.

Question:

Why has Islam forbidden certain things?

Answer:

Because in doing them there is considerable harm.

Question:

If someone does a forbidden thing what will be his lot?

Answer:

Distress in this life and suffering in the world to come.

Question:

Give an example of distress in this life? What is it like?

Answer:

For example: gambling leads to loss of possessions, alcoholic drinks
lead to illnesses, listening to songs can cause neurasthenia, adultery
has the effect of confusing genealogy, sodomy is the source of venereal
diseases and related ailments in both partners, interest brings about
disorder in economic balance.

Question:

So why don’t we see these harmful consequences in society despite the
fact that most, if not all, of these prohibited acts are widespread?

Answer:

In fact it is the reverse:

Crime has spread throughout the length and breadth of society, the
courts are being swamped by criminals and the prisons are full.

Economic imbalance has reached its apex in that some possess millions
while others are dying of hunger. Dangerous diseases have got out of
control so that thousands of hospitals, clinics and pharmacies and the
like are of no avail in getting rid of them or even limiting their
scope. Anxiety and confusion have taken over people’s lives to an extent
never seen previously in history.

In short, revolutions and wars dominate the history books of our time
so that there is no room for anything else: wars which leave in their
wake misfortune, tears, blood and catastrophes. After all that we have
said above, can it still be claimed that forbidden acts (according to
Islam) have no bad effects?

59. Peeping into the houses of neighbours.
60. Using anything which causes excessive harm to the body and
similarly harming others ………… and other prohibitions.

You, esteemed reader, will see at a glance that the reason for most of
these prohibitions is clear and obvious, and does not require much
reflection. For example, can anyone deny the repugnance of murder,
pillaging the property of others or injuring them, spying into other
people’s houses or doing harm?

However, some of the matters do require some thought concerning the
reason for their prohibition, for instance gambling, alcoholic drinks
and women not covering their heads and their dressing immodestly. Anyone
must surely realize that gambling leads to anxiety and material loss,
alcohol causes numerous illnesses, dressing immodestly can often lead to
immorality and the breaking up of families, and so on and so on.

Is there any religion or legal system which has not formulated a list
of forbidden things? Nevertheless the question remains, does not the
fact that certain things are forbidden lead to a degree of unhealthy
repression? The answer is that anything which leads to bad things has to
be repressed or restrained in some way and legal systems, in general,
are full of attempts to do so.
