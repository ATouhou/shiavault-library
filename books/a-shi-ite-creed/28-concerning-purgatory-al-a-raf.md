Concerning Purgatory (al-A'raf)
===============================

Says the Shaykh Abu Ja'far: Our belief concerning *al-A'raf* [^1]
(Purgatory) is that it is a wall between Paradise and Hell, and upon it
there will be

***“men who will recognize all (persons) by their peculiar marks”
(Qur'an 7:46)***.

These men will be the Prophet and his *awsiya'*[^2]*.* No one will be
able to enter the Garden except he who recognizes them and him whom they
recognize. And no one will enter the Fire except he who denies them
(their rights), and him whom they (the Prophet & Imams) deny (as not
belonging to their party).

[^1]: Apparently derived from the Ethiopic, Jeffrey, 65. MB, 431 ;MC,
173. A'raf is used in a metaphorical sense in the Da'aaim; it refers to
the Imams under whose guidance the souls of men undergo purification
after death, FC, p.9.

[^2]: These awsiya' are the 12 Imams of the Ithna \`Ashariya.
