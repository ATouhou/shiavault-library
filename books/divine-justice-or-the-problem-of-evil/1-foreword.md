Foreword
========

Throughout the history of thought and action, the justice of God has
been a problem that has occupied the mind of nearly every philosopher.
The most important reason for this attention is that they have been
aware of deprivation, poverty, exploitation and tyrant, amongst human
societies. Being aware of these bitter facts, some have, been led to
doubt the justice of God, or even doubt the existence of God. Others
have tried to somehow justify this seeming contradiction between God
being just and the above-mentioned miseries.

This article is a small attempt to prove two points:

1. God's justice is a reality.

2. If God is just, it does not mean that individuals have to accept
their present social situations; but on the contrary, it will mean that
they have to change it.

In the end, I have to thank Muhammad Taqi Jaâ€™fari and Murtadha
Mutahhari, Persian philosophers, for lending me their knowledge, and
thank Myles Burnyeat, S. M. Noori and S. A. Musawi for encouraging me to
write this article.
