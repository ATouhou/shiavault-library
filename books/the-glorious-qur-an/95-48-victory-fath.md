48: Victory (fath)
==================

This chapter of 29 verses arranged in four sections was revealed in the
interval after the truce made at the tree of Hudaybiyya in the sixth
year following the Hijra, or during 628 A. D.; thus it belongs to the
Madinese period. It was revealed after Friday (or congregation) 62, when
we consider the sequence of the chapters

within the Qur'an itself.

The chapter mentions political difficulties section II, while a mob
scene is described in section III. Ultimate victory is promised the
Prophet and believers in section IV, which also contains the fable of "
The Sturdy Plant ". One great problem facing the early Muslims was how
to divide up or dispose of booty that fell to them in battle; the
Prophet did not want any followers who joined his forces merely in order
to acquire it. This chapter reinforces the Muslim's sense of duty.
