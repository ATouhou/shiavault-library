The Fights
==========

In 81 A.H., Abid al-Rahman advanced towards Iraq. Violent fights took
place there. The revolutionaries defeated al-Hajjaj's army. They freed
many cities such as Sajestan and Kirman in Iran, Basrah and Kufa in
Iraq.

Abid al-Malik sent a man to Abid al-Rahman to hold talks with him. He
accepted some conditions such as removing al-Hajjaj from office.

People rejoiced at their freedom and victory. So, they insisted on
removing Abid al-Malik from the office, for he appointed al-Hajjaj ruler
over them.

Abid al-Malik sent military supplies to support al-Hajjaj. The army in
Khurasan joined him, too.
