  <p>
إِنَّ اللَّهَ فَالِقُ الْحَبِّ وَالنَّوَىٰ ۖ يُخْرِجُ الْحَيَّ مِنَ
الْمَيِّتِ وَمُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتِ مِنَ الْحَيِّ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمُ اللَّهُ ۖ
فَأَنَّىٰ تُؤْفَكُونَ
  </p>

***Surely Allah causes the grain and the stone to germinate; He brings
forth the living from the dead and He is the bringer forth of the dead
from the living; that is Allah! how are you then turned away. (6:95)***

وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ النُّجُومَ لِتَهْتَدُوا بِهَا فِي
ظُلُمَاتِ الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ ۗ قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ
يَعْلَمُونَ

right way thereby in the darkness of the land and the sea; truly We have
made plain the communications for a people who know.*** [^4]
