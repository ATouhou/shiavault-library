Preface
=======

All praise is due to Allah (swt),[^1] Creator of the universe, and
blessings and salutations upon the Holy Prophet Muhammad (sawa) and his
Holy Progeny.

This book is about the beliefs of Ismailis. **Two major sects within the
Ismailis are the Agha Khanis, who believe in 49 Imams, and the Bohras
who believe in 21 Imams**. However both the Agha Khanis and the Bohras
believe in Ismail as an Imam, who was the son of Imam al-Sadiq (as).
They therefore reject Musa al-Kadhim s/o Imam al-Sadiq (as) as an Imam.
This book investigates the authenticity of the Ismaili/Fatimid Imams and
questions whether they were truly divine.

Some of the important sources used for this book were: The Ismaili’s
their history and doctrines, written by Dr Farhad Daftary. Dr Farhad
Daftary is the Co-Director and the head of the Department of Academic
Research and Publications at the Institute of Ismaili Studies, London.
An authority on Ismaili studies, Dr Daftary has written more than 150
articles and written and edited several acclaimed books in this field.
And other sources like Da’aimul Islam, Hamarey Ismaili Madhab Ki
Haqeeqat aur Uska Nizam, Ismailiye az Guzashte ta Hala etc were also
utilized.

Most of the translation of the verses used in this book is based upon
Sayyid Ali Quli Qarai’s translation of the Holy Qur’an.

I thank Allah (swt) for giving me the ability to complete this book. I
could not have handled this project alone and the contributions made by
others have been invaluable. My sincere and deep thanks go to my
teacher, Shaykh Kumail Rajani for his guidance and help; my cousin,
Haneef Arastu for editing and insight; Sister Nahid Hirmendi and Br
Zohair Zaidi for further editing and proof reading; Shaykh Salim
Yusufali, Shaykh Muhammed Hasnain, and Br Sher Ali Valji for their help,
valuable suggestions and being there when needed; and my wife and my
daughters for all their help, support, insight and suggestions.

Exalted
