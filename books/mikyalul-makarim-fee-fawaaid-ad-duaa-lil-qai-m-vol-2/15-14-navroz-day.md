14. Navroz Day
==============

The day of Navroz is also among the best times for praying for His
Eminence (aj) and for supplicating the Almighty Allah for his early
reappearance. The report of Mualla bin Khunais quoted in Bihar[^1] and
Zaadul Maad,[^2] proves this point. And its emphasis from different
places of the report will show that if we think upon it, Insha Allah,
the meaning will become clear to us.
