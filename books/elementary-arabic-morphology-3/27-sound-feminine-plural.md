Sound Feminine Plural
=====================

127. How is a sound feminine plural formed?

128. Are there exceptions to this rule?

129. What is a sound feminine plural attributed to?

127. The general principle of a sound feminine plural is that an *alif*
and *tā'* are added to the end of the noun without changing the singular
form of the noun, for example: **مریمات** .

128. There are three exceptions to this rule: first, words that end with
a feminine *tā'*; the *tā'* is erased and then the letters are added,
for example: **مؤمنات** which was **مؤمنة.** Second, in *maqsūr* and
*mamdūd* nouns; the same actions taken in the dual form apply in the
sound feminine plural as well, for example: **فُضلَیات و رَحَیَات و
عَصَوَات و صحراوات.** Third, triliteral nouns (non-adjectives) whose
first root letter has a *fathah*; if the second root letter is sound and
does not have a vowel sign it is given a *fathah*, for example:
**تَمَرَات** which was **تَمرَة.**

129. A sound feminine plural is attributed to female names, for example:
**هِند,** words that end in a feminine sign, for example: **جمیلة,**
infinitives if they have more than three letters, for example:
**إحسان,** masculine non-rational beings in the diminutive form, for
example: **دُرَیهِم** and as adjectives, for example: **معدود.**
