Good Tidings

Then Allah sent Muhammad, may God

Bless him and his Household,

as a witness,

a bearer of **good tidings**,

and a warner.

the best of the creation as a child,

and the most chaste amongst them

as a grown up,

the purest of the pure in conduct,

and the most generous of those

who are approached for their

generosity.

(Sermon 105)
