The Eleventh Spurious Argument: The Miracles of the Imams
=========================================================

Some people criticize the Shias of believing that the Imams had miracles
like the miracles of the Prophets.

The Answer
----------

What we mean by the miracles of the Imams is the charismata that prove
their Imamate, guardianship, and their being a proof from Allah among
mankind and the mediators between mankind and the Prophet (s).

Refer to the book titled (Ithbatul-Hudat bin-Nusus wa al- Muâ€™jizaat).
The author mentions the miracles of the Twelve Imams with well
established narrations that have been extensively narrated with
uninterrupted chains of narrators. Refer to Ihqaqul-Haq vol. 11,12, and
19, if you like to know the miracles and charismata of the Imams as
mentioned in Sunni books. It includes some of those mentioned in Sunni
books with names of the books, the number of the pages and the edition.
