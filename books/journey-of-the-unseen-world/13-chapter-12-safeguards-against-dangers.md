Chapter 12 - Safeguards Against Dangers
=======================================

Although the events after death have been described already and will
prove to be an incentive towards preparing for the Hereafter, but as
nobody can escape from this journey, I wish to list some occasions and
practices narrated by reverend personalities which will help everybody
in their preparations. Only those who are aware of the reality and facts
about the Hereafter can inform us about this and these are Mohammed
(PBUH) and his progeny who are the cause of the creation of the
Universe. And the gist of their teachings is that if anybody has to
undertake a journey, he should make preparations for it.

Therefore, daily before sleeping. Hazrat Ali used to announce from the
mosque. O People, get ready and make preparations for your journey of
the Hereafter. May God have Mercy on you. The Proclaimer of Death is
announcing 'Take heed. Be prepared for departing; you will face numerous
dangers there (Nehjul Balagha).

The first of these is the time when one experiences the pangs of death.
(Soora-e-O verse 19). This is an extremely hard time. On one side there
is the intensity of pain and illness, the tongue becomes mute and the
body refuses to respond. On the other hand, the crying and wailing
relatives and the thought of being separated from them forever, the
grief of the children's becoming orphans, separation from one's mate and
life-partner and from wealth and other worldly goods (in the collection
of which one had spent his lifetime); the agony of death, combined with
these hardships, and the thought of the forthcoming hardships to be
faced after death, all cause this time to be. painful beyond
imagination. Sheikh Sudooq has quoted Imam Jafer-e-Sadiq as saying, "If
anyone wishes to make the pangs O death easy and light, he should
maintain good relations with his relatives and should be kind and gentle
with his parents. One who behaves thusly will die easily and in his
lifetime he will not be troubled with paucity and will on the contrary
live happily." The Holy Prophet has recommended Soora-e-Yaseen and
Soora-e.wassaaifaat and reading the dua 'La Ilaha lila Allah Ul Haleem
ul Kareem.

(There is no power except God, the forbearing and gracious) to the end,
in the Qunoot as being beneficial for the time of death)

Second occasion : Adeela Indul Maut (Satanic thought in death): This is
the turning away from the Truth to the false and wrong at the time of
death. This is because Satan approaches men at the time of their death
creating and raising doubts in their minds to the extent that one's
correct faith may be completely shaken; one may even become bereft of it
and he may die an in filed or faithless. Traditions advice us that as
safeguard one should be in the habit of recalling the Usool-e- Deen with
its proof so that when he is reminded of the Usool at his death bed, and
in Talqeen, certainty of faith would prevail and doubts would cease.
Dua-e-Adeela, present in Mafateeh-ul-Jinaan is also helpful and should
be read at the death bed. Reciting the tasbeeh of Hazrat Fatima, wearing
Aqiq (cornelian) ring, reading Soora-e-Maumenoon on Fridays, reading
Bismillah.,.La Haula Wala... alter Morning and Maghrib Prayers, are all
beneficial. (Recommending of particular duas and scooras for particular
objects is because of the special meanings contained ion them, which if
understood and taken to heart, have corrective influence upon man.)

Third occasion; Wehshate Qabr (Fear and horror of the Grave). This is
more severe, and fearful than the previous occasions. When the body is
brought near the grave it should not be put into it at once. Since this
is a very fearful time, it should rather be prepared for it by breaking
the journey thrice (Manzil), because the spirit still retains interest
in the body.

The Holy Prophet has said. The most fearful time for the dead is their
first night in the grave. Help your dead in this hour of need by giving
charity on their behalf and by praying for them (Namaz-e-Wehshat)." ln
this prayer, in the first Rakaat one should read Ayat-ul-Kursi after
Soora-e-Hamd and in the second after Soora-e-Hamd Soora-e-Qadr ten
times. Alternatively, in the first Rakaat, Soora-e-Tawheed (Qul howa
Allah) is read twice and in the second, Soora-e-Takaasur ten times.

Also beneficial is reading La Ilaha lila Allah ul Malik ul Haqqul
Mubeen (There is no power except God, the king. the right, the
manifester) 100 times daily and reading Soorae-Yaseen every night before
sleeping.

Fourth occasion: Constriction in the Grave : This is also a difficult
time. The grave calls out every day "I am the rest house of the
travellers; I am a house of Horror and also of Respect." For some. the
grave will be a garden from amongst the gardens of Heaven and for others
a pit from the pits of Hell. Imam Sadiq has said that nobody can escape
this constriction, but there are practices which can prove helpful in
this regard e.g.

Hazrat Ali has said that reading Soorae-Nisa every Friday will save one
from constriction.
one who makes a habit of reading Soora-e-Zukhruf will remain safe from
the constriction and beasts in the grave.
Imam Jaffar-e-Sadiq has said that whoever dies between Thursday noon
and Friday noon will be spared constriction.
Imam Raza has informed that the habit of night prayers keeps one safe
from constriction.
The Holy Prophet has said that reciting Soora-e-Takaasur before
sleeping helps to ward off constrictions.
People buried in the sacred land of Najaf constriction.
Imam Raza has informed that the habit of night prayers keeps one safe
from constriction.
The Holy Prophet has said that reciting Soorae-Takaasur before sleeping
helps to ward oft constriction.
People buried in the sacred land of Najaf are also spared
constriction.

Fifth occasion The questioning of Munkir and Nakeer:

Imam Jafar-e-Sadiq has said that one who does not believe that
questioning will take place in the grave is not a true faithful. These
questions have been mentioned already. Reading Taiqeen twice before
burial is completed is very beneficial but especially (and maybe only if
the person had these believes and thoughts in his lifetime.

Sixth occasion: Barzakh. Barzakh has been discussed already. It is a
time of extreme helplessness. Deeds done for the dead and the benefits
arising from one's previous deeds are the only useful things at this
time.
Seventh occasion Day of Judgement: It is the harshest, severest and
most fearful day. There are fifty stations in the Day of Judgement, each
more difficult than the previous.

I hope that the readers of this book will pray for me.
