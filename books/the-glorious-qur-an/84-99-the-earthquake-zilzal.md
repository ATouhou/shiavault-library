99: the Earthquake (zilzal)
===========================

These S early Meccan (or possibly Madinese) verses were revealed after
Women 4, about the same time as The Stunning [Blow) 101 and Eventide 103
but before Iron 57. One should also SEE 22:(I) about this earthquake
which will announce Doomsday, and 7:(X)for how this happened with
Thamud. The apocalyptic

mood is conveyed through the use of assonance.
