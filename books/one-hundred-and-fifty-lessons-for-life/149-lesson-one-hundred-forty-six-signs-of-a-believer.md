Lesson One Hundred Forty Six: Signs Of A Believer
=================================================

Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اِذا سَرَّتْكَ حَسَنَتُكَ وَ سائَتْكَ سَيِّئَتُكَ فَاَنْتَ مُؤْمِنٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

When your good deed makes you happy and your bad deed disturbs you, you
are a believer.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Islam says that all men are born with a pure primordial nature, which
believes in and loves to do good. Taints and sins begin to gradually
affect his spirit and soul and change his nature and in time turn it
totally. When you see that a man is interested in goodness and hates bad
deeds, you know that the spirit of belief and first pure nature still
exist in him.

What a miserable lot are those who, instead of being disturbed by their
bad deeds, take pleasure in them , or who are resentful of their deeds
of self-sacrifice, righteousness, forgiveness and justice. They are the
unbelievers.
