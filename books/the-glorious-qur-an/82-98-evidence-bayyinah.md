98: Evidence (bayyinah)
=======================

This chapter of 8 verses was revealed after Divorce 65 and before
Banishment 59. Since it dates from the late Meccan or early Madinese
periods, the verses here are somewhat longer. It distinguishes the true
believer from those who merely play with belief and good behavior.
