Requesting Narration of Incidents Wherein They Did Not Follow the Texts of Hadith
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Rabiâ€™ul-Awwal 7, 1330**

I have received your latest letter and found it miraculous in proving
possible what we thought to be impossible, amazing in its portrayal of
imagery in the most explicit depiction; so, praised be the One Who has
simplified for you even the most complex demonstration, bestowing upon
you the reins of elucidation, till you achieved what cannot be achieved
by all means and won what cannot be won by the hopeful. We thought that
the causes are not related to what the authentic texts have implied, and
that there is no way to explicitly prove that they deviated therefrom.

Yet I wish you had recounted the incidents wherein they did not follow
the explicit texts, so that appropriateness becomes obvious, and the
path of guidance manifests itself. I request you, therefore, to
elaborate on this matter, in the light of their well-known traditions,
digesting whatever is written in the books of chronicles regarding their
way of thinking. Wassalamo Alaikom.

Sincerely,

*S*
