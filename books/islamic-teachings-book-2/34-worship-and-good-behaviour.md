Worship and Good Behaviour
==========================

***“Your Lord has commanded you not to worship anybody but Him, and you
must be kind to your parents”*** (Surah Bani Israel, 17:23).

Allah has created us and given us countless gifts so that we may live a
happy and peaceful life. It is, therefore, our duty to thank Him and
worship Him.

In the Holy Qur'an obedience to parents has been mentioned at many
places along with obedience to Allah and in some cases it has been
mentioned as the first recommendation to the children of Adam.

Our parents have done great favours to us. They have borne many
hardships to bring us up. It is, therefore, necessary for us to
appreciate the good they have done to us. We should obey their lawful
orders. We should try, our level best to recompense them for their
kindness, so that Almighty Allah may also be pleased with us.

Islam has laid great stress on the good treatment of one's parents.
Allah is pleased with those who keep their parents happy, and one
invites His wrath by annoying them.
