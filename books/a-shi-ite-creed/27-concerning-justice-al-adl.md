Concerning Justice (al-'adl)
============================

**Concerning Justice (al-'adl)**[^1]

Says the Shaykh Abu Ja'far: Verily Allah, Who is Blessed and Exalted
above all others, has commanded us to be just, while He Himself treats
us with something even better, namely, grace *(tafaddul*[^2]*).* And
that is because He, the Glorious and Mighty says:

***“Whoso bringeth a good deed will receive tenfold the like thereof;
while whoso bringeth an evil deed will be awarded the like thereof; and
they shall not be wronged” (Qur'an 6:160)***.

Justice (al-\`adl) means that He requites[^3] a good act with a good act
and an evil act with an evil act. The Prophet said: No man ever enters
Paradise by virtue of his (good) actions (alone), except by the mercy of
Allah the Glorious and Mighty.

[^1]: On God's Justice see MC, 60-63 (Fiqh Akbar II, art. 22), 195, 234;
BHA, has a very long and elaborate section on Allah's Justice, arts. 1 I
1 -151 , but this contains good and evil, free will and predestination,
taklif, etc. But see principally, nos. 149 -- 151. The Shiites lay great
stress on \`adl; not so the Sunnites. See BHA, 95, note to
no.111;Shahrastani,29;Macdonald,Development, 136; the only reference in
Taw. is on p.61. FC, no. 84.

[^2]: Compare BHA, no. 151.
