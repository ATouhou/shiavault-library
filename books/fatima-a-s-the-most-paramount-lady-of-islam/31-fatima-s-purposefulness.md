Fatimaâ€™s Purposefulness:
========================

Fatima (peace be upon her) is a noble woman with purpose, and due to
this fact she did not take any color and did not come to agreement with
injustice. Although she was young, and like other youth in youth crisis,
had got some ambitions, she never stopped her purpose and did not commit
any offence.

She tolerated the hardships to obtain her purpose even under the severe
torture of the enemy. In general, her marriage to Ali (peace be upon
him) signified her purpose, because she knew that Ali (peace be upon
him) was not a kind of man who tried to make her happy as the society
expected. She married the one, who was always in the battlefield to
achieve his mission.

Under the protection of her purpose, she was not willing to be captured
by hypocrisy and deceits, lose her sobriety and vigilance; and because
of her purpose, she was far from the adversity and did not heed the
world allurement. She was unique in her purpose, and we do not know
anybody like her in different periods of history.
