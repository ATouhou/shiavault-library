Y - Yazeed Ibn Muâ€™awiyyah
=========================

Probably one of the dirtiest and cruelest men in history. He was
responsible for the genocide in Karbala. He was born on 25 AH. He played
with dogs and monkeys and did not believe in judgment day. He was ruler
over the Muslims for three years. In the first he slaughtered Imam
Husayn; in the second he committed genocide in Madinah where he ordered
the slaying of close to 10,000 Muslims; and in the third, he attacked
and demolished the Ka'abah.
