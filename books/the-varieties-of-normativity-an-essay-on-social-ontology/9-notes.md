article draws on discussions in Leo Zaibert Five Ways Patricia can Kill
Her Husband: A Theory of Intentionality and Blame (Chicago: Open Court,
2005), and in Barry Smith,  “The Ontology of Social Reality” American

ontology we find: Michael Bratman, Faces of Intention, Cambridge:

Reality¸ New York: Free Press 1995, and his Rationality in Action,

[^3] We shall follow Searle’s lead in accepting a distinction between
social and institutional reality. According to Searle institutional
facts are a subset of social facts, characterized by the fact that they
involve the transmission, cessation, or creation of power, whereas
social facts do not directly relate to power. See John R. Searle, The
Construction of Social Reality, New York: Free Press, 1995, 38, 79 ff.
Searle rejects, however, the idea of a sharp distinction between these
two classes in 88 ff.
