A Study of Sunni and Shii Traditions Concerning Tahrif [of Holy Quran] Part 1
=============================================================================

[Introduction]
==============

A1-Raghib al-'Isfahani, in his Mufradat al-Qur'an, defines \`tahrif as a
way of interpreting a certain speech or writing so that it appears to
denote two different meanings.' According to this definition, tahrif is
not an alteration of the actual words and phrases of a text but the
alteration of its meanings.1 It is in this sense that tahrif has been
used in the following Qur'anic verse:

<p dir="rtl">
مِنَ الَّذِينَ هَادُوا يُحَرِّفُونَ الْكَلِمَ عَنْ مَوَاضِعِهِ….
</p>

***Some of the Jews pervert words (yuharrifuna) from their
meanings…(4:46)***

The verse indicates that the Jews used to alter the meanings of the
scripture while keeping its actual words. Although tahrif literally
means semantic alteration (al-tahrif al-ma\`nawi), the term has also
been in use for textual alteration (al-tahrif al-lafzi). Thus tahrif is
of two kinds: semantic and textual.
