Prophet Musa (a)
================

Israil's family decided

to stay in Egypt. For a

long time they were

happy. The family grew.

There were many people

related to Israil and they

became known as the

Bani Israil.

For some reason the

Egyptian people did not

like the Bani Israil.

A new Firawn became ruler

of Egypt. Israil's people

became slaves to the

government. They wereforced

to do many unpleasant jobs

and were treated very badly.

One night Firawn had a

dream. His high priest, Haman,

told him what he thought the

dream meant. An Israil boy would be born

and he would grow up and cause

the death of Firawn.

This made Firawn very

angry and so he thought of

a horrible plan.

All the boys born to the

Israilites would be

killed at birth.

He thought this would

stop the dream from

coming true.

Imran and his wife had two

children, a girl called Maryam

and a boy called Iram. Soon

after Firawn told of his

plan, Imran's wife found out that

she was going to have another

baby.

They were pleased but they were

also worried that if the baby was

a boy, he would be killed.

She did not tell anyone that she was

going to have a baby. She stayed at

home and kept her secret until the

baby was born.

It was a boy.

She loved the baby very much but

realised that if she kept him, he

might be killed.

She put the baby in a special

box and Maryam went with her

to the river Nile.

They carefully put the box in

the river and prayed that it

would sail to safety.

Allah was watching over the

baby. No harm would come

to him.

The box sailed into Firawn's

gardens. Some maids were there

and saw the box caught in the

bullrushes. They pulled it out

and were amazed to find a

beautiful baby inside.

They took him to Firawn's wife,

Asia, who looked at him and

knew at once that he was an Israili.

Firawn wanted to kill the

baby but Asia cried and

cried and was so upset that

eventually he said she could

keep him and even adopt him.

The baby was called Musa.

He was not happy. He cried

because he was hungry but

would not take milk from

anyone.

Maryam heard of this and she let

it be known that she knew someone

who might be able to help.

She went to her mother

and told her

what had

happened. They

went to the

palace and when

Musa was put

in her arms he

stopped crying

and took milk

from her.

With Allah's help

Musa and his

mother were reunited.

She was able to look after

Musa for a long time and

he loved her dearly.
