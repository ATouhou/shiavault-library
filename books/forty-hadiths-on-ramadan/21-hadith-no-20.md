The Month of Ramadan and Seeking Forgiveness
--------------------------------------------

Imam Ali (A.S.) said: It is incumbent upon you to seek forgiveness and
supplicate excessively in the month of Ramadan. As for the supplication,
by means of it the calamities are warded off from you, and as for the
seeking of forgiveness, it erases away your sins.*Al-Kafi, vol. 4, pg.
