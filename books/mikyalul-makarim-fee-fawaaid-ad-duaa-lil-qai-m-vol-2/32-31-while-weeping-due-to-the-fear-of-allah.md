31. While Weeping Due To The Fear Of Allah
==========================================

Surely, this is the best of times, when a person is proximate to Allah
the Almighty and prayers are accepted. Thus, it is proper for a believer
that he should remember his Imam (aj) by praying for him, thereby
fulfilling one of his (aj) rights that is obligatory on him (the
believer).

That which proves this is the report mentioned in Wasail - in the
chapters of Qawaate’ Salaat – from Muhammad Ibne Ali Ibne Husain
al-Sadooq (a.r.) who relates from his chain that Mansoor Ibne Yunus
Bazraj asked Imam Sadiq (as) concerning a person who attempts to cry in
his obligatory prayers till he actually starts crying. Imam (as)
replied: ‘By Allah, it is the coolness of the eyes (i.e. it is loved by
Allah).’ And then he (as) said, ‘When you reach to this state, remember
me.”

I say: Obviously the Imam of the time possesses some rights on the
believers. Hence, it is proper for every believing man and woman to act
on the same, relating to the Imam of his time, for in this way he will
discharge his duty towards his master with his body as well as his
tongue.
