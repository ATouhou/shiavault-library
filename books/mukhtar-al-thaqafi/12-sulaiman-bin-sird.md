Sulaiman bin Sird
=================

Sulaiman bin Sird was a good companion. He and the Kufians felt pain
because they did not support Imam Husayn at the Battle of Karbala. For
this reason, he asked them to turn to Allah in repentance.

Four thousand Muslims followed him. He formed an army. He announced his
revolution against the Umayyads, who killed Imam Husayn and captured his
family.

Although the soldiers were few in number, they were very eager to start
the fight. First, they visited Imam Husayn's tomb and wept very much.
Then they headed for Shaam.

Ubaidullah bin Ziyad formed an army of eight thousand soldiers.

The two armies met at Ain al-Warda on the borders between Iraq and Sham.

Violent fights took place.

Sulaiman bin Sird passed away during the fights. Ryfaah bin Shaddad
headed the army after Sulaiman bin Sird. Then he decided to withdraw the
army to Kufa.
