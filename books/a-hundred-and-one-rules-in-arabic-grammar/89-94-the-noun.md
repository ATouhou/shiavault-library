94. The noun  نـَفسُ 
=====================

The noun  نـَفسُ  is feminine and means "soul." If you use it before
another noun it will create Idaafa and change its meaning to "same."

**يأکلُ دائما ً في نفس ِ المطعم ِ.**
</p>

He always eats at the same restaurant.

If it follows a noun, it should carry a corresponding pronoun reference
to that noun and its case as well. Its function becomes emphatic.

**قابلتُ المُراسِلَ نـَفسَهُ.**
</p>

I met the correspondant, himself.
