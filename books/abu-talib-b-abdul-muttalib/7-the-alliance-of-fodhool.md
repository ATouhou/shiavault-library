The Alliance of Fodhool
=======================

Some people from Makkah attacked the pilgrims of Allah's House.

A man and his daughter, belonged to the tribe of Khathaam, came to visit
Allah's House. A young man from Makkah took the young girl by force.

The Khathaamian man shouted:

*“Help! Help! Help!”*

A passer-by said to him:

*“Go to The Alliance of Fodhool.”*

The man went to Abu Talib.

Abu Talib founded the Alliance of Fodhool. It was an agreement signed by
the Makkan leaders. According to the agreement they decided to help the
persecuted and to punish the unjust.

When the Khathaamian man got there and asked them for help, some men
took their swords and went to the young man's house. They threatened him
and brought back the girl to her father.

Our Master Muhammad [s] was a member of the Alliance of Fodhool.
