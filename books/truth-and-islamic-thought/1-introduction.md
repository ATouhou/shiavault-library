Introduction
============

The problem of truth was raised in medieval Islamic philosophy within
the framework of discussions starting from the question of whether our
knowledge corresponds to the "actuality of affairs." The notion of
validity thus elaborated was comprehended as a quality of knowledge
established through a comparison with "matters of fact." What was
intended is not coincidence with what is and*has existence.* Existence
(*wujud)* was generally understood in Islamic thought as one of the
attributes (*sifa* ) that a thing might or might not possess while still
being "a thing" (*shay'),* and since our knowledge embraces things
independently of their accidental attributes, the question about truth
was placed on a wider footing. Validity, from that point of view,
testifies that our knowledge conforms with reality in the immediate
meaning of the term -*thing-ness.* This notion of reality*(shayiyya)*
does not necessarily exclude Divinity, for God in Islamic sciences is
often comprehended as The Thing, although different in every respect
(except that of*thing-ness)* from all other things. The concept of
"thing" serves to introduce some thing into the current of intellectual
discourse rather than to state anything definite about it; to be a
thing - that is, fixed and established - means to enter the field of
discussion.
