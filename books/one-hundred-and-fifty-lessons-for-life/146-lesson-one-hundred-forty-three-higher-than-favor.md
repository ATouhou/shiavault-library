Lesson One Hundred Forty Three: Higher Than Favor
=================================================

Imam Hadi (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلشّاكِرُ اَسْعَدُ بالشُّكْرِ مِنْهُ بِالنِّعْمَةِ الَّتى أَوجَبَتِ
الشُّكْرَ لاَنَّ النَّعَمَ مَتاعٌ وَ الشُّكْرَ نِعَمٌ وَ عُقْبى
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

One who is grateful for a favor derives more prosperity from his
gratefulness than from the favor, because favors pertain to life in this
world whereas gratitude is the capital of this world and the other
world.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Gratitude is more than mere appreciation by tongue ; it includes actions
that demonstrate appreciation in practical terms and it involves using
each favor in a proper way. Such gratitude for a favor results in
blessings and prosperity far greater than that provided by the favor
itself. Using the favors for seeking God’s pleasure and meeting His
servants’ needs is a capital that earns honor in this world as well as
eternal prosperity in the hereafter, while a favor itself may confer
only a material blessing.

In other words, when one receives a favor, he receives something useful
for this world and if he shows gratitude for it in appropriate ways, he
then receives something additional which is even better : additional
rewards both for this world and the hereafter.
