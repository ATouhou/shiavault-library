**Thul-Qi’da 13, 1329 A.H.**

I Requesting Proofs from Statements by Allah and His Messenger
--------------------------------------------------------------

1) Bring the proofs from the statements of Allah and His Messenger
bearing witness to the mandatory allegiance to the Imams among the Ahl
al­Bayt exclusively, and leave aside the speech of anyone else in this
respect except those of Allah and His Messenger.

II Proofs from Ahl al­Bayt are Circumventive
--------------------------------------------

2) Your Imams' statements cannot serve as arguments against their
rivals, and such an argument creates a logical cycle, as you know, and
peace be with you.

Sincerely,

S
