The Seal of the Prophets
========================

Our Prophet (May Allah's blessing and peace be on him and his
descendants) was the last of all the Prophets and Apostles in the sense
that there would no more be any Prophet till the Day of Resurrection.
Allah says: Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the
Messenger of Allah and the seal of the Prophets.[^1]

[^1]: Surah al-Ahzab, 33:40
