Translation
-----------

The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said: the worst
profession is one which is mingled with usury.

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said: When God wills to perish a nation, usury
becomes manifest among them.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Despite the brisk market of usurers in the present world and special
dependence of this world on usury in different forms, it is evident that
usury destroys financial and economic system of societies and results in
the terrible consequence of accumulation of wealth in the hands of a
limited number of people and institutions.

This unfair distribution of wealth is the source of many misfortunes and
rampant moral corruption all over the world.
