Extract from the Preface to the First Edition
=============================================

With the radical changes in educational system, my community in East
Africa is steadily becoming out of contact with the Gujarati Language.

This is specially the case with the new generation. This means that the
new generation is unable to benefit from the religious literature
written in Gujarati.

The Khoja Shia Ithna-asheri Supreme Council had been aware of this
important change, and had decided to prepare text books in English for
introduction into Madresas.

This booklet is based mostly on the lessons of Maulana Sayyid Saâ€™eed
Akhtar Rizvi, though at the time of editing he has added some lessons
from the 'Book of Salat' (Majlis-ul-Muslimeen, Karachi), and 'Diniyat'
(Rah al-Najat Office, Karachi), with necessary adaptations.

Agha Syed Muhammad Mahdi has helped a great deal in its preparation. I
pray to Allah for their reward here and in the life hereafter.
