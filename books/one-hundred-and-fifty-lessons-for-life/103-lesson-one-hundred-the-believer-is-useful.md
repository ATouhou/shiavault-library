Lesson One Hundred: The Believer is Useful
==========================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَثَلُ الْمُؤْمِنِ مَثَلُ النَّخْلَةِ ما أَخذْتَ مِنْها مِنْ شَىء
نَفَعَكَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

A believer is like a palm tree, whatsoever you take away from it is
useful and profitable.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Palm tree is actually one of the very fertile trees. Its fruit is eaten
as one of the best foods and sometimes its stone is burnt. Also, things
like mats, hats, table-cloth are woven from its leaves.

Its wood is used in construction of simple buildings and also used as a
bridge for passing through streams. A fragrant and useful essence is
extracted from its blossom. In other words, there is not one part that
is discarded as useless. discarded.

The believers are the same. Their thoughts are useful, their speeches
are profitable, their meetings are educational, their religion is
reforming and they are loyal in friendship, strong in their decisions.
In short, everything about them is worthy.
