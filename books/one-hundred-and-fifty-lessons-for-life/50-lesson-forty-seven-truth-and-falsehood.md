Lesson Forty Seven: Truth and Falsehood
=======================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ الْحَقَّ ثَقِيْلٌ مَرِىءٌ، وَ إنَّ الْباطِلَ حَفِيفٌ وَبِىْءٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Truth is heavy and difficult but pleasant, and falsehood is light and
easy but painful and dangerous. [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

How eloquent and interesting is this one short sentence of Imam ‘Ali
(a.s.) to describe truth and falsehood! Usually truth has a harsh
appearance and occasionally a bitter taste but has very pleasant
results. It is easily absorbed by the body and society is strengthened
thereby.

On the other hand, falsehood comes easily and sometimes tastes very
sweet, but its effect is fatal . It is like a delicious but poisonous
food whose destructive effect on the heart, stomach, and intestines
becomes manifest when it is swallowed. The poison of falsehood also
destroys different organs of society.
