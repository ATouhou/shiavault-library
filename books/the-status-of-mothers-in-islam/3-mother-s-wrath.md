Mother's Wrath
==============

In Islam a mother's anger and dissatisfaction with an offspring are
regarded as the means of his misfortune and destruction.

In some Islamic narrations, it has been explicitly said that those who
maltreat their parents, will never even smell the perfume of heaven, nor
attain happiness.

A young companion of the prophet had fallen ill and was confined to bed.
The Prophet went to visit him and found him seriously ill and
approaching the last moments of life. The prophet said to him: "Confess
to the uniqueness of God and say 'there is no God but Allah'."

The young man stammered and could not utter the sacred phrase. The
prophet asked a woman who was present: "Has this young man a mother?"
She said: "Yes, I am his mother." The Prophet asked: "Are you
dissatisfied with him?" She said: "Yes, but I have not been on speaking
terms with him for six years." The Prophet requested her to forgive the
son's errors. She said: "O prophet of God! I will do so for your sake."
Then the Prophet turned to the young man and said: "Now utter the phrase
'there is no God but Allah." The young man now gave a free tongue to the
rightful words and uttered them.[^1]

Imam Sadiq says: "He who wishes to pass easily through the agony of
death, should act benevolently towards her kinsmen, and treat his mother
kindly. Then the agony of death will become easy for him to bear, and in
life he will not suffer from indigence."[^2]

A man asked the Prophet a point about goodness to one's parents. The
prophet repeated his recommendation three times for kindness to parents
but made a mother's right prior to a father's.[^3]
