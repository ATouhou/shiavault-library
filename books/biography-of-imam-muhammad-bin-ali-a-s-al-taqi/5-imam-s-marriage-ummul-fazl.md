Imam's Marriage Ummul Fazl
==========================

**TO MAMOON'S DAUGHTER**

After Kazi Yahya Bin Aksam's shameful defeat, Bani Abbasi had no choice
but accept Mamoon's proposal to make Imam Muhammad Taqi (A.S.) his
son-in-law.

A grand-scale marriage ceremony was arranged. First Imam Taqi (A.S.)
read the 'Nikah'. He fixed "marriage-price" (Mahar) of 500 dirhams,
following the example of the Prophet (S.A.W.W.) who had fixed 'Mahar' of
Hazrat Fatima (A.S.) at 500 dirhams.

After the "Nikah" ceremony, everybody who was present had his beard
perfumed.

Expensive gifts of gold and bags of money were given out by Mamoon in
honour of this marriage. This occasion has been described in some
details by Sheikh Mufid in Al-Irshad from where I now quote:

"… Three trays of silver were brought. On them were nuggets of musk and
kneaded saffron. N the middle of nuggets were pieces of parchment on
which was written considerable wealth, annual income and estates.

Al-Mamun ordered them to be scattered among the courtiers… Bags
containing ten thousand dirhams were put down and their contents
scattered among the military leaders and others. The people departed and
they were rich as a result of the gifts and salaries…"

**IMAM'S MARRIED LIFE**

People had expected that after his marriage to the princess of the
land, the youthful Imam would lead a life of luxury and comfort in a
palace of his own or that of Mamoon. Imam (A.S.) proved them wrong. He
rented his own apartment with meager furnishing and continued living a
simple life, like he had done before his marriage.

His way of life remained unchanged. One of his friends narrates that he
paid the Imam (A.S.) a visit after the latter's marriage. He was
surprised to see that the Imam's living habits had remained totally
unchanged although he was now the son-in-law of the Caliph.

In the meanwhile, the friend became thirstyu but he was too nervous to
ask for water. The Imam (A.S.) asked his servant to bring water. The
servant took his own time. The Imam (A.S.) went himself to bring water
and thus served his friend personally.

His wife Ummul Fazl who had been brought up as a princess found this
simple and humble life unbearable. She became a continuous source of
trouble for the Imam (A.S.).

Her anger and jealousy knew no limits when the Imam married a Nubian
slave- maid called Sumannah. Ummul Fazl went to her father Mamoon and
complained about the Imam (A.S.).

Mamoon at that time was drunk. He armed himself with a sword and
accompanied by his servants He broke into the Imam's bedroom and
attacked the sleeping Imam leaving the bedroom only after he was sure
that he had cut the Imam into pieces.

Next day, when he was informed of what he had done on (he previous
night, Mamoon was sorry for his actions and sent his special servant
Yasir to the Imam's house to inquire about the Imam's condition.

To his bewilderment, Yasir saw the imam (A.S) safe and sound, brushing
his teeth! Yasir went back informed Mamoon that the Imam was well.
Mamoon a bag containing 20,000 dinars to the Imam with Yasir.

Yasir then requested the Imam (A.S) to give him the shirt that he was
wearing! The Imam (A.S) removed his shirt for Yasir who saw that there
was not even a single scratch on the Imam's body.

Smilingly, the Imam (A.S.) asked Yasir if this was Mamoon's idea and
was linked with the previous night's event. Yasir replied that he was
now acting on his own and that Mamoon was truly sorry for what he had
done the previous night.

In the meantime, Mamoon, too, came to Imam (A.S.) to apologise for his
misbehaviour He gave the Imam (A.S) as a gift the sword that he had used
against the Imam (A.S.) and the horse on which he rode to go to the
Imam's house to kill him. On the other hand the Imam (A.S.) made Mamoon
promise never to use liquor again.

Mamoon then warned his daughter never to complain to him about the Imam
(A.S.) or else he would never see or talk with her.

A year after his marriage to Ummul Fazl, Imam (A.S.) returned to
Medina. Ummul-Fazle came with him but kept on writing letters to her
father complaining that the Imam (.A.S.) had married another woman.

Mamoon's reply was, "I did not give you in marriage to Abu Jaffer so
that ! should make for him Haram (Forbidden) what Allah has made Halal
(Legitimate)."

In Medina, Imam's main job was to serve Islam, One of" his greatest
achievements was to weaken the Waqifia Movement which had been formed on
the death of Imam Musa Kazim (A.S ) and which had been a cause of
serious trouble to Imam Reza (A.S.). Because of Imam Taqi's efforts
Waqifia Movement was no more a threat to Islam.

Scholars from all over the world would come to learn from in various
branches of knowledge such as philosophy, literature and jurisprudence
and then go back to their countries to benefit others with what they had
learnt from the Imam (A.S,).

Imam Taqi (A..S.) continued services to Islam came to a sudden end in
217 A H when Mamoon died at a town near Tarsus in Cilicia where he was
on an expedition against the Byzantine Roman Emperor.

Mamoon's brother Muttasim became the successor of Mamoon and the new
Caliph of the Muslims. He was known for his hatred towards Imam Reza
(A.S.) and he equally Imam Muhammad Taqi (A S.) He wrote instructions to
the governor of Medina to send Imam Taqi (A.S.) Ummul Fazil to Baghdad
immediately.

This was in AH 218. When in Baghdad the Imam was put under house
arrest. Ummul-Fazl's complaints against the gave Mutassim a good excuse
to harass the Imam.

Life for the Imam (A.S) became so difficult that in the last days of
his life, on every Friday when he came back from the he would pray to
Allah saying, "O my Lord! If my salvation from the oppression of this
world lies in my death, then hasten it from this very moment."

The Imam (A.S.) finally left this world on 29 Zilqaad AH 220 after
being poisoned by Ummul-Fazl through the instigation of Muttasim, her
uncle and the Caliph of the time.

"From Allah do we come and to him shall we return."
