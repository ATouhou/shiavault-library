Rights of Subjects
==================

18) The Rights of Subjects through Authority
--------------------------------------------

The right of your subjects through authority is that you should know
that they have been made subjects through their weakness and your
strength. Hence it is incumbent upon you to act with justice toward them
and to be like a compassionate father toward them. You should forgive
them their ignorance and not hurry them to punishment and you should
thank God for the power over them which He has given to you.

فأَمَّا حُقُوقُ رَعِيَّتِكَ بالسُّلْطَانِ فَأَنْ تَعْلَمَ أنهم صاروا
رعيتك لضعفهم قوتك فيجب أن تعدل فيهم وتكون لهم كالوالد الرحيم، وتغفر
لهم جهلهم، ولا تعاجلهم بالعقوبة، وتشكر الله عز وجل على ما آتاك من
القوة عليهم.

19) The Rights of Subjects through Knowledge
--------------------------------------------

The right of your subjects through knowledge is that you should know
that God made you a caretaker over them only through the knowledge He
has given you and His storehouses which He has opened up to you. If you
do well in teaching the people, not treating them roughly or annoying
them, then God will increase His bounty toward you. But if you withhold
your knowledge from people or treat them roughly when they seek
knowledge from you, then it will be God's right to deprive you of
knowledge and its splendour and to make you fall from your place in
people's hearts.

> 19. حق الرعية بالعلم

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وأمَّا حَقُّ رَعِيَّتِكَ بالعِلْمِ فَأَنْ تَعْلَمَ أن الله عز وجل إنما
جعلك قيما لهم فيما آتاك من العلم وفتح لك من خزائنه فان أحسنت في تعليم
الناس، ولم تخرق بهم، ولم تضجر عليهم، زادك الله من فضله، وإن أنت منعت
الناس علمك أو خرقت بهم عند طلبهم العلم منك كان حقا على الله عز وجل أن
يسلبك العلم وبهاءه ويسقط من القلوب محلك.

20) The Right of the Wife
-------------------------

The right of your wife (*zawja*) is that you know that God has made her
a repose and a comfort for you; you should know that she is God's favour
toward you, so you should honour her and treat her gently. Though her
right toward you is more incumbent, you must treat her with compassion,
since she is your prisoner (*asir*) whom you feed and clothe. If she is
ignorant, you should pardon her.

> 20. حق الزوجة

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وأما حق الزوجة فأن تعلم أن الله عز وجل جعلها لك سكنا وأنسا فتعلم أن
ذلك نعمة من الله عليك فتكرمها وترفق بها، وإن كان حقك عليها أوجب فان
لها عليك أن ترحمها لأنها أسيرك وتطعمها وتكسوها وإذا جهلت عفوت عنها.
  </p>
</blockquote>

21) The Right of the Slave
--------------------------

The right of your slave (mamluk) is that you should know that he is the
creature of your Lord, the son of your father and mother, and your flesh
and blood. You own him, but you did- not make him; God made him. You did
not create any one of his limbs, nor do you provide him with his
sustenance; on the contrary, God gives you the sufficiency for that.

Then He subjugated him to you, entrusted him to you, and deposited him
with you so that you may be safeguarded by the good you give to him. So
act well toward him, just as God has acted well toward you. If you
dislike him, replace him, but do not torment a creature of God. And
there is no strength save in God.[^1]

> 21. حق الرعية بملك اليمين

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وأما حق مملوكك فأن تعلم أنه خلق ربك وابن أبيك وأمك ولحمك ودمك تملكه،لا
أنت صنعته من دون الله ولا خلقت شيئا من جوارحه، ولا أخرجت له رزقا ولكن
الله عز وجل كفاك ذلك ثم سخره لك وائتمنك عليه واستودعك إياه، ليحفظ لك
ما تأتيه من خير إليه فأحسن إليه كما أحسن الله إليك، وإن كرهته استبدلت
به، ولم تعذب خلق الله عز وجل ولا قوة إلا بالله.

[^1]: At this period in Islamic history, slavery was still common
because of wars at the frontiers (slaves were invariably captured in
battle; cf. Supplication 27, ‘For the People of the Frontiers’). The
sources indicate that the Imam often had slaves, most likely because
people gave them to him as part of their alms (the family of the Prophet
being entitled to these) and also because he used to purchase them in
order to free them. It is said that he would never beat his slaves, but
rather write down their misdeeds. Then, at the end of the month of
Ramadan, he would call them together and list their misdeeds, asking
them to pray to God to forgive him, just as he had forgiven them. Then
he would free them with generous gifts. If he owned a slave at the
beginning or middle of the year, he would free him on the eve of the
Feast of Fast-breaking and then buy another slave. (A’yan al-shi’a, IV,
193-4). Once the Imam called his slave twice, but he did not respond.
When he answered the third time, he said: ‘Did you not hear my voice?’
The slave answered: ‘Yes, I did.’ The Imam asked: ‘Then why did you not
answer me?’ He replied: ‘Because I am safe from you.’ The Imam said:
‘Praise belongs to God, who made my slave safe from me!’ (A’yan
al-shi’a, IV, 200; Bihar, XLVI, 56). Once a slave girl poured water for
the Imam while he was making the ablution for prayer. Suddenly the pot
dropped from her hand and struck him in the face, cutting him. He turned
towards her and the slave girl said: ‘God says: Those who restrain their
rage.’ He said: ‘I have restrained my rage.’ She said: ‘And pardon the
people.’ He said: ‘God has pardoned you.’ She said: ‘And God loves the
good-doers’ (3:134). He said: ‘Go. You are a free woman.’ (Bihar, XLVI,
68; cf.96).
