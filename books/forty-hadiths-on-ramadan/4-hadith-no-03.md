Ramadan: The Month of Revelation of the Holy Quran
--------------------------------------------------

Imam Reza (A.S.) has said: If one asks, "Why is it that the fasts were
made obligatory exclusively in the month of Ramadan and not in the other
months?

it would be said, "(this is) because the month of Ramadan is the month
in which Allah, the Exalted, had revealed the Holy Quran."
