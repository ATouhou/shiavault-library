Z - Zayd Ibn Al-Arqam
=====================

One of the companions of the Prophet (pbuh&hf) who fought with him in
some of his battles. At the time of Ashuraâ€™ he was a very old man. It is
said that when Imam Husayn's head was brought into Dar Al-Imarah, Ibn
Zyad started hitting the head with a cane. Zayd got up and said to Ibn
Zyad: Stop hitting those lips, by God which there is no God but him I
have seen the Prophet (pbuh&hf) kissing those very lips. He then got up
and ran home crying. He died in Kufa on 68 AH.
