Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION
=======================

This book is a translation of "Maghze Mutafakkir Jehan Shia", the famous
Persian book, which has been published four times in Tehran, Iran. The
Persian book is itself a translation from a French thesis published by
The Research Committee of Strasbourg, France, about the contribution
made by Imam Jafar al-Sadiq (A.S.) to science, philosophy, literature
and irfan (gnosticism).

'Kaukab Ali Mirza' did the English translation from Persian

Members of the Research Committee have done a wonderful job and deserve
thanks and gratitude from all those who love the Imam. However, it must
be pointed out that when the learned scholars, who were engaged in
research, failed to find worldly sources of the Imam IS knowledge, they
indulged in wild speculations and guesswork and were even guilty of
misrepresenting historical facts to prove that Imam Mohammed al-Baqar
and Jafar al-Sadiq (A.S.) had acquired their knowledge through the
following sources:

a. The Great Library of Alexandria.

b. Coptic Scholars of Egypt.

c. Books of Greek Philosophers

d. Persian Physicians.
