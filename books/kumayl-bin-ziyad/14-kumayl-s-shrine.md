Kumayl's Shrine
===============

Nowadays, the visitor sees Kumayl's shrine on a hill at Wadi al-Salam in
the holy city of Najaf.

On Thursday nights, sweet words fly high in the sky full of stars. The
words remind people of that great martyr whose name is connected with
the supplication. So, his name will be immortal.
