IV. The spread of Islamic culture into Europe.
==============================================

The Islamicisation of intellectual culture in Spain as early as the
ninth century was described by Alvaro, a contemporary Cordovian bishop:
“the Christians love to read the poems and romances of the Arabs:
theologians and philosophers. Alas! All talented young Christians read
and study with enthusiasm the Arab books; they gather immense libraries
at great expense; they despise the Christian literature as unworthy of
attention. They have forgotten their language. For everyone who can
write a letter in Latin to a friend, there are a thousand who can
express themselves in Arabic with elegance, and write better poems in
this language than the Arabs themselves”. (R.W. Southern, p.21).

There have been many discussions of the relationship of Arabic and
European elements in the sphere of poetry (Sir Hamilton Gibb,The Legacy
of Islam) , notably in respect of Provençal poetry and the troubadours
(from the Arabic word mutrebeen). The popular poetry formed the
connecting link between Spain and Provence, since singers moved between
Muslim and Christian territories.

This refinement of life gradually spread northwards from Spain and
Sicily. The experiences of the Crusaders in Islamic lands doubtless
contributed something to the spread of Arab culture in Western Europe.
