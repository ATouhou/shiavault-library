Responsibility 5: Fulfilling the Rights of the Imam
===================================================

Another responsibility of the Shi’a, is to fulfill the rights which the
Imam has over us.

Without doubt, the most important right which we owe to others starts
with those which we owe to Allah, followed by the Messenger of Allah and
then the rights which we must fulfill to our Imam. Obviously, the rights
which our Imam demands from us must be carried out in the most perfect
way.

In regards to this responsibility, there are numerous traditions which
have been mentioned. Since it is not possible to narrate all of them, we
suffice with one tradition from the Infallibles which states:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا كَانَ لِلٌّهِ تَعَالـى مِنْ حَقٍّ فَهُوَ لَنَا
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Any right or privilege which belongs to Allah, the Most High, is also a
privilege that belongs to us (the Ahlul Bayt).”[^1]

314, sec. 9, no. 11 it is mentioned with a slight variation in the
wording.
