The Doctrine of Five Pillars
============================

Many Sunni theologians, instead of enumerating the Articles of Faith and
Acts of Worship separately, state that belief in God and the Prophet as
affirmed in the creed (the Kalemah), together with the foregoing four
acts of worship constitute the Five Pillars of Faith.

The Shi’as list the five Articles of Faith as the roots of religion
(Usool al-Deen) and the Acts of Worship as the branches of religion
(Furoo al-Deen).

In addition to the above acts of worship the Shi’as believe in the
following acts of worship (The sunnis regard them as mandatory acts of
piety):

1. Jihad Struggle or Striving
-----------------------------

There are two kinds of jihad, the major jihad and the minor jihad.

#### The Major Jihad: (Jihad Al-Akbar)

This is the struggle against one's inner self (nafs) to subjugate and
control one's passions and carnal desires. The base self (nafs
al-ammara) must be controlled by the conscience (nafs al-lawwama), and
only when one succeeds in this struggle does one attain the perfect
self, the self at peace with itself (nafs al-mutmainna).

To those who attain this state, the God says:

  </p>
</blockquote>

***O soul that art at rest! (89:27)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ارْجِعِي إِلَىٰ رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةً مَرْضِيَّةً
  </p>
</blockquote>

*** Return to your Lord, well-pleased (with him), well-pleasing
(Him),(89:28)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَادْخُلِي فِي عِبَادِي
  </p>
</blockquote>

*** So enter among my servants, (89:29)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَادْخُلِي جَنَّتِي
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And enter into my garden. (89:30)***

#### The Minor Jihad (Jihad Al-Asghar)

This means to struggle for Islam. Not for extension of boundaries, not
for personal glory, not for the glory of any tribe, community or nation,
but for the defense of Islam and the protection of its values. Such a
struggle can take many forms, through the use of pen, through the use of
tongue or through the use of the sword. This last form is often referred
to in the Qur’an as Qitaal (warfare).

In the Shi’a theology, a general qitaal can be declared only by an
Imaam. A mujtahid has no authority to summon Muslims to a jihad
involving qitaal.

2. Amr Bi’l-Ma'Aroof (Directing Others towards Good)
----------------------------------------------------

It is an act of worship for a Muslim to advise and direct others to the
doing of good deeds for the pleasure of Allah.

3. Nahy 'An Al Munkir (Directing Others Away From Evil).
--------------------------------------------------------

Similarly it is the duty of every Muslim to advise others against
committing sins.

3. Khums (The One-Fifth Tax)
----------------------------

Only the Shi’as believe in this additional tax and they regard it as a
major obligation of every Shi’a Muslim. It was instituted by God as a
token of regard for the Prophet and his family.

***And those who made their abode in the city and in the faith before
them love those who have fled to them, and do not find in their hearts a

niggardliness of his soul, these it is that are the successful ones.

It is a 20% tax on all earnings after deduction of house-hold and
commercial expenses.

Khums is paid to the mujtahid and is divided into two equal portions.
One half of all receipts of khums by the mujtahid is the portion
belonging to the Imaam in occultation and the mujtahid spends this
portion in educational, social and economic projects for the betterment
of the Shi’a community.

First priority is accorded to the community from which the khums was
received. The second half is distributed amongst the poor and deserving
descendants of the Prophet (the sayyids) each of whom may receive only
up to a year's subsistence.
