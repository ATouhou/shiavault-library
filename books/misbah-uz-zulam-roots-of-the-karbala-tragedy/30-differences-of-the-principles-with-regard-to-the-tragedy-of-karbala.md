====================================================================

Before we relate the incident of Karbala’, it is necessary to mention
some more points of differences between the Imamiyah and Ahlul Sunnat.
It is not possible to mention all the points of differences in this

differences with regard to the incident of Karbala’.

Without this, it would be impossible to describe the incident of

with the matter of Caliphate and some basic principles are related to
this problem.
