Lesson Forty Six: Man, what is your price?
==========================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّهُ لَيْسَ لاِنْفُسِكُمْ ثَمَنٌ إلاّ الْجَنَّةُ فَلا تَبِيْعُوها
إِلاَّ بِها.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

(Be aware) no price is good enough for you except everlasting prosperity
and paradise, so do not exchange it for any other price.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Usually when somebody is asked about the price of his life, he cannot
name a price . No price is high enough.

However, in reality, he exchanges this precious life gradually, day by
day , for a very small price indeed. And, lo and behold, he wakes up one
fine day towards the end of his life, to find that he has sold off this
priceless asset in exchange for a house or a car or a country villa,
which he will soon leave behind in any case … when death comes knocking
at the door !

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) says that nothing whatsoever of the material treasures
of this world is worthy enough to be exchanged with the capital of your
life. The only thing worth selling your life for is God’s satisfaction,
human and spiritual development that leads to an everlasting prosperity
in paradise. This is the thing to buy with your life ; it is worthy of
every endeavor, attempt and sacrifice one can make.
