15. What is the form for a triliteral verb?

16. What is a double-letter verb?

17. What is a verb with a glottal stop in its root?

18. How many kinds of verbs with a glottal stop in its root are there?

19. How many kinds of unsound verbs are there?

20. What is a verb that has two weak letters called?

21. When is a verb truly unsound or doubled? Or when does it truly have
a glottal stop?

15. The form of a triliteral verb is: **فَعَلَ**. The first letter is
called the first root letter, the second is called the second root
letter and the third is called the third root letter.

16. A double-letter verb is a verb that has two identical letters in its
root. For example: **فَرَّ**(he ran away).

17. A verb that has a glottal stop is a verb that has a glottal stop in
its root. For example: **أکَلَ**(he ate).

18. There are three types of verbs that have a glottal stop in their
root:

• Glottal stop of the first root letter: **أخَذَ**(he took)

• Glottal stop of the second root letter: **سَألَ**(he asked)

• Glottal stop of the third root letter: **نَشَأ**(he emerged)

19. There are three types of weak verbs:

• Quasi-sound verb: when the weak letter is in the first root letter:
**وَعَدَ** (he promised)

• Hollow verb: when the weak letter is in the second root letter:
**قَالَ**(he said)

• Defective verb: when the weak letter is in the third root letter:
**دَعَا**(he supplicated)

20. A verb that has two weak letters is called a cluster verb. There are
two kinds of cluster verbs:

• A cluster verb that has a weak letter in the first and third root
letters. For example: **وَفَی**(he completed)

• A cluster verb that has a weak letter in the second and third root
letters. For example: **شَوی**(it roasted)

21. A verb truly has a glottal stop or is truly a double-letter verb
when the glottal stop or the two identical letters are in the root of
the verb, not including added letters. So:

• **انطَلَقَ** this verb does not have a glottal stop because its root
is **طلق**.

• **قَدَّمَ** this verb is not a double-letter verb because its root is
**قدم**.

• **قاتَلَ** This verb is not an unsound verb because its root is
**قتل**.
