Consultation
============

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "If your rulers are the good doers of you,
rich ones are from the gracious ones of you, and your affairs go on
through consultation among you, then (living) on the earth is better for
you than (being) under it. But, if your rulers are the wicked ones of
you, your rich ones from the misers of you, and your affairs go on
without consultation among you, then (being) under the ground is better
for you than (living) on it."

Manhaj-us-Sadiqeen, commentary, vol. 2, p. 373

Imam Amir ul Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) said: "He who consults with the wise,
seeks for the lights of intelligence to be enlightened with", (and will
