The Fourteen Attributes of Imam ‘Ali's Son
==========================================

After counting seven attributes for himself, Imam ‘Ali (as) mentions the
following fourteen attributes for his son's self-improvement:

To a son who hopes for what is unattainable
-------------------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
“الى المَولُود المؤمِّل ما لا يُدْرَك”
  </p>
</blockquote>

God has equipped man with instincts and desires to be able to sustain
life. If these instincts and desires are employed in the right
situations, they will add up to our vigor and satisfaction.  
 Our wishes, too, are among these means:  
 If man lacked these wishes, life would be impossible.  
 Regarding this, the Great Prophet (S) has stated:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"الأمَلُ رَحمَةٌ لأمَّتي وَلَولا الأمَلِ مَا رَضَّعَت وَالِدَةٌ
وَلَدَها وَلا غَرَسَ غَارِسٌ شَجَراً"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Hope is a mercy for my people. If hope did not exist no mother would
ever breastfeed her child and no gardener would ever plant a tree."*[^1]

In a tradition, it is stated, "Jesus Christ (as) saw an old man plowing
the ground. Jesus asked God to take his desire away from him. Then,
Jesus saw that the old man threw the spade on the ground and lay on the
ground, resting.

Then Jesus asked God to give him back his desires. He saw the old man
stand up and start working. Jesus asked the old man the secret behind
this. The old man answered. "When I was working, I told myself: How long
do you have to work when you are so old. Then I threw the spade down and
started resting. Then I told myself: I swear to God that as long as I am
alive, I need life equipments. Then I rose and started working."[^2]  
 These two traditions clearly show the dynamic role of wishes in our
lives. But, as it was stated earlier, wishes are good if they are
fulfilled with care or else they will destroy the community if they go
on extremes.

Imam ‘Ali (as) in the sermon 42 of Nahj al-Balaghah states:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اَيُّها النّاسُ اِنَّ اَخوَفَ مَا اَخافُ عَلَيكُم اِثنَانِ: اتِّبَاعُ
الهَوَى وَطُولُ الأمَلِ فامَّا اتِّبَاعُ الهَوَى فَيَصُدُّ عَنِ
الحَقِّ وَامَّا طُولُ الأمَلِ فَيُنسِي الآخِرَةَ. اَلا واِنَّ
الدُّنيَا قَد وَلَّت حذّاءُ فلم يبق منها الا صبابة كصبابة الاناء
اصطبَّها صابّها الا وان الآخرة قد اقبلت ولكل منهما بنون فكونوا من
ابناء الآخرة ولا تكونوا من ابناء الدنيا فان كل ولد سيلحق بأمه يوم
القيامة وان اليوم عمل ولا حساب وغدا حساب ولا عمل"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“O people! The greatest things that I fear for you are two: following
(your) desires and farfetched hopes.*  
*Following desires prevents the attainment of the truth, and far-fetched
hopes cause forgetfulness of the Hereafter.*  
*Indeed, the world has passed swiftly by, and only a small portion of it
remains like the remnants poured out of a water vessel; and indeed, the
Hereafter has approached. Each of them (the world and the Hereafter) has
their children. Therefore, be of the children of the Hereafter, and do
not be of the children of this world, for every child will be attached
to his mother on the Day of Judgment. Today is (the day of) action and
no accounting, and tomorrow is (the day of) accounting and no
action.”*[^3]

As you will notice, in this sermon, Imam ‘Ali (as), not only mentions
the hazards of far-fetched hopes, which is to forget about the
Hereafter, but also shows us how to struggle against these hopes by
paying attention to the Hereafter. He states that the results of our
wrong-doings beget dangerous consequences in the other world, and there
will be no way to compensate for them at that time.  
 Of course, we should be aware that not all our hopes can be
fulfilled.  
 By drawing a square on the ground and by passing a line in the middle
of it the Great Prophet (S) depicted this fact.[^4]

Imam ‘Ali (as) mentions the same idea in the expression he uses
**"المؤمِّل ما لا يدرك"** (hoping for what is unattainable). He warns us
not to follow all of our desires; he says this is impossible.[^5]  
 Thus, it is better for us to limit our hopes and only make use of them
rationally, Imam ‘Ali (as) has said in this regard:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن اَيقَنَ انَّهُ يُفارِقُ الأحبَابَ وَيَسكُنُ التُرابَ وَيواجِهُ
الحِسَابَ وَيَستَغنِي عَمَّا خَلَّفَ وَيَفتَقِرُ اِلى مَا قَدَّمَ
كَانَ حَريّاً بِقُصرِ الأمَلِ وَطُولِ العَمَلِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"It is appropriate for a person who is certain that he will part from
loved ones, dwell within the earth, confront the reckoning, and have no
need of what he has left behind while being in need of what he has sent
forward, to curtail his hopes and add to his (good) deeds"*[^6]  
 But for the Gnostics the ultimate for their desires is Allah; they only
think about God’s consent.

2. The Follower of the path of those who have perished
------------------------------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"السالك سبيل من قد هلك"
  </p>
</blockquote>

What is meant by this expression is that the child from the day it is
born is on the scale of growth and it develops: It finishes infancy and
then arrives at the youth and then reaches old age and finally passes
away. This process includes everybody: both our ancestors and our
descendants.  
 Thus, my son! You, too, are going to go through this stage. Never
remain ignorant of this fact, or else, the Satan will mislead you.  
 The above expression might convey the following concept depicted in the
following piece of poetry:  
 These roads on the desert,  
 Are drawn by pen in the past by Friends;  
 The transcripts on the graves are unopened letters,  
 Which have come to us from the people of the Hereafter.  
 This means that the road on which you and I are walking is the road
prepared by people in the past. Be aware, we too are preparing the road
for future walkers!!

3. Prey to Illnesses
--------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
“ غرض الاسقام”
  </p>
</blockquote>

Material life entails complexities and clashes. If one is weaker, these
clashes take on a strong side.  
 Man is no exception to this universal rule. He is always struggling
against different agents and destructive factors. He is at the mercy of
all sorts of diseases, calamities, disasters and hardships. Every moment
he might get disintegrated: a stroke, cancer, TB, smallpox, ulcers, and
the like.  
 Imam ‘Ali (as), in the sermon 217 of Nahj al-Balaghah, concerning this,
states:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"دَارٌ بِالبَلاء مَحفُوفَةٌ وَبِالغَدْرِ مَعْرُوفَةٌ لا تَدُومُ
اَحوَالهُا وَلا تَسْلَمُ نُزّالُها، اَحوَالٌ مُختَلِفَةٌ وَتَارَاتٌ
مُتَصَرِّفَةٌ، العَيشُ فِيهَا مَذمُومٌ وَالأمَانُ مِِنهَا مَعدُومٌ
وَاِنَّما اَهلُهَا فِِيهَا اَغرَاضٌ مُستَهدَفَةٌ تَرمِيهِم
بِسِهَامِهَا وَتَفنِيهِم بِحِِمَامِها"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"(The world is) a house surrounded by affliction, known for its
treachery. Its states do not last and its inhabitants do not remain
sound. Its states vary and its times change. Life in it is reprehensible
and safety is non-existent. Its inhabitants are only targets; it strikes
them with its arrows and destroys them with death”.*  
 Thus, man is subject to both diseases and disasters and misfortunes.
Man struggles with these till he passes away and gets to safety.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا الْإِنسَانَ فِي كَبَدٍ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Certainly we have created man to be in distress”.***[^7]

The poet says:  
 Thus more bitter than poison the world will pass,  
 Once again there will be a day as sweet as sugar.

4. A pawn in the hands of time
------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
“ورهينة الايام”
  </p>
</blockquote>

As the property is mortgaged to the mortgagee during the mortgage time
and when the time comes, it goes back to its genuine owner, man is also
pawned to the world and its differing events. It seems as if man does
not have any freedom whatsoever.

And it is assumed that it is the world which brings about either
prosperity or misery, youth or age, power or feebleness, wealth or
poverty, health or sickness, happiness or sorrow. When the time comes,
his mortgage time is over and it will be turned over to his real
owner.  
 Thus, man is extremely miserable and vulnerable. With this amount of
misery and vulnerability, he should not be left ignorant and proud. The
Imam (as) guides us in the following manner:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَا لأبْنِ آدَمَ وَالفَخْرِ: اَوَّلُه نُطْفَةٌ، وَآخِرُهُ جِيفَةٌ، لا
يَرْزُقُ نَفَسَه وَلا يَدْفَعُ حَتفَهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“What does the son of Adam have to do with pride? His beginning was a
drop and his end is a corpse. He can neither provide sustenance for
himself nor can he drive away his death”.*[^8]

5. The target of misfortunes
----------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
“ورمية المصائب”
  </p>
</blockquote>

This phrase, like the third phrase (prey to illnesses) shows that man is
always subject to all sorts of diseases and hardships. The difference
lies in the fact that No 5 refers to mental and spiritual afflictions,
whereas No 3 refers to bodily afflictions.

6. A Slave of the world
-----------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
“عبدَ الدنيا”
  </p>
</blockquote>

A person, who can not resist the world's transitory materialistic
manifestations and easily yields to them, is a slave to the world, to
dirhams and to dinars and to social positions.  
 Many people, when confronted with material things and justice, prefer
the worldly affairs and yield to its luxuries. Imam Husayn (as),
describing such people, states:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"النّاسُ عَبِيدُ الدُّنيا وَالدِّينُ لَعِقٌ عَلى اَلسِنَتِهِم
يَحُوطُونَهُ حَيثُ مَا دَرَّت مَعَايشُهُم فَاِذَا مُحِّصُوا لِلبَلاءِ
قَلَّ الديّانُونَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"People are slaves to the world and religion is a substance on their
tongues that they sample. They take care of it as long as their
livelihood is abundant. When they are tested by affliction, there are
few pious ones.*[^9]

It has repeatedly been noted, however, that these adjectives and
attributes refer to an ordinary person, and not to Imams who are
infallible.

7. A Trader in vanities
-----------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
“وتاجر الغرور”
  </p>
</blockquote>

As we have previously mentioned, the world is a house of trade. Most
people sell their precious lives for a provision of vanity. They would
sell their Hereafter for this world:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"أُوْلَئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوْا الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا بِالْآخِرَةِ
فَلَا يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ الْعَذَابُ وَلَا هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ "
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“These are they who buy the life of this world for the Hereafter, so
their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be
helped”.***[^10]

Although these people realize that the world is nothing more than "a
provision of vanity"

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا مَتَاعُ الْغُرُورِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And the life of this world is nothing but a provision of
vanities”.***[^11]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ يَحْسَبُهُ الظَّمْآنُ مَاءً"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Their deeds are like the mirage in a desert, which the thirsty man
deems to be water”.***[^12]

They prefer this world to the Hereafter. They give precedence to
possessions, positions, children and desires before God's pleasure and
the Hereafter. They buy things on the face of them whereas

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَلا تِجَارَةٍ كَالعَمَلِ الصَّالِحِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“There is no trade like good deeds”.*[^13]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن تَاجَرَ اللهَ رَبِحَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Whoever trades with God, profits.”*[^14]

On the other hand, there are those who offer to God what they have,
including their lives, possessions, and children. What they are looking
for in this transaction is God's pleasure:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إِنَّ اللَّهَ اشْتَرَى مِنْ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَنفُسَهُمْ
وَأَمْوَالَهُمْ بِأَنَّ لَهُمْ الْجَنَّةَ يُقَاتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ
اللَّهِ فَيَقْتُلُونَ وَيُقْتَلُونَ وَعْدًا عَلَيْهِ حَقًّا فِي
التَّوْرَاةِ وَالْإِنجِيلِ وَالْقُرْآنِ وَمَنْ أَوْفَى بِعَهْدِهِ مِنْ
اللَّهِ فَاسْتَبْشِرُوا بِبَيْعِكُمْ الَّذِي بَايَعْتُمْ بِهِ وَذَلِكَ
هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Surely Allah has bought of the believers their persons and their
property for this, that they shall have the garden; they fight in
Allah's way, so they slay and are slain; a promise which is binding on
Him in the Taurat and the Ingeel and the Qur’an; and who is more
faithful to his covenant than Allah? Rejoice therefore in the pledge
which you have made; and that is the mighty achievement”.***[^15]

Thus, the most important trade is getting Allah's pleasure,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَمِنْ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَشْرِي نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَاءَ مَرْضَاةِ اللَّهِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And among men is he who sells himself to seek the pleasure of
Allah”.***[^16]

And the worst trade is selling oneself to the world and what it
contains. Regarding this, Imam (as) has stated:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَلَبِئسَ المَتْجَر أن تَرى الدُّنيَا لِنَفسِكَ ثَمَناً"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The most wretched transaction is that you consider the world to be a
price for your self!”*[^17]

8. A Debtor of Divine Decrees
-----------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
“وغريم المنايا”
  </p>
</blockquote>

"*Manaya*" is the plural for "*maniya*", meaning death or decree.  
 The reason the plural word "manaya" is used is that there are different
ways to die: one dies in accidents, the other dies by drowning, the
other one through shocks and the other one by cancer, and the like.

In this sentence, the Imam (as) compares a man to a debtor who is asked
to return his debts.  
 Divine decrees, too, are creditors who are after their credits, which
is man's departure towards the Hereafter.  
 Elsewhere, the Imam (as) refers to this fact in the following words:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِنَّ هَذا الموتَ لَطالِبٌ حَثِيثٌ لا يَفُوتُه المُقيمُ وَلا يُعجِزهُ
مَنْ هَرَبَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Indeed, this death is an eager seeker; neither does one who remains
escape it, nor does one who flees frustrate it”.*[^18]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِنَّ وراءَكَ طالِباً حثيثاً مِنَ الموتِ فلا تغفل"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Surely, behind you is an eager seeker from death; therefore, do not be
heedless".*[^19]

9. A Captive of Death
---------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
“واسير الموت”
  </p>
</blockquote>

Because man can not escape death[^20] wherever he stays, no matter what
age he is or what position he possesses, he will taste the bitterness of
death.[^21] Naturally, such a person will remain a captive in the hands
of death. Thus, the Imam (as) reckons his son, Imam Hasan, like any
other human being, a captive in the hands of death.

10. An Ally of anxieties
------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
” وحليف الهموم “
  </p>
</blockquote>

11. A Companion of sorrows
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
“ وقرين الاحزان”
  </p>
</blockquote>

12. The Aim of calamities
-------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
“ونصب الآفات”
  </p>
</blockquote>

A person is an ally of anxieties, a companion of sorrows and the aim of
calamities, if he can not fulfill his objectives, if he observes all
sorts of obstacles on the way of his growth, and if he is inflicted with
poverty, disease, age, deprivation, lack of wife, children, shelter,
food, heat and the like. There is nobody who is not subject to these
sufferings: in this case, the Holy Qur’an says:

***"Certainly we have created man to be in distress."(90:4)***

If man feels prosperous one minute, then he has to taste a cup filled
with the hemlock of disasters and calamities. Neishapuri has observed
that

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"الّلذّةُ في الدُّنيا كَالقَطْرَةِ مِنَ البَحْرِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

"If you compare the world's pleasures with the world's calamities, you
will find the ratio is one drop of water to the sea at large."[^22]  
 It is because of these facts that the Imam (as) considers his own son
like other human beings, an ally of anxieties, a companion of sorrows
and the target of calamities. He warns us that this world, with all
these hardships, cannot be the final objective for man. We should make a
provision for the other world:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَالْعَاقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And the end is for those who guard against evil".***[^23]

### Sorrows for this world or for the Hereafter?

The source for man's sorrows is sometimes materialistic and related to
this world: distresses such as poverty, the death of one's child,
suffering a loss, deprivation of wife and children.  
 But sometimes the source for these griefs might be spiritual and
related to the Hereafter, for instance, the feeling of guilt or the
observation of committing guilt by others.  
 A wise and true believer, from the viewpoint of the principle of
patience, has to make himself content and patient. He has to cope with
these sufferings or else, as the Imam (as) has stated,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"الهَمُّ يُذِيبُ الجَسَدَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Grief emaciates the body”.*[^24]

Zaynab (as) in answering ‘Ubaydullah b. Ziyad said: "We consider
martyrdom and captivity, which are given to us by Allah, as a
blessing."[^25]  
 And the Great Prophet (S) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِذَا كَثُرَت ذُنُوبُ المُؤمِنِ وَلَم يَكُن لَهُ مِنَ العَمَلِ مَا
يُكَفِّرُها اِبتَلَاهُ اللهُ بِالحُزنِ لِيكَفِّرَهَا بِهِ عَنهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"When the believer's sins increase and there is nothing from his deeds
that can expiate it, then Allah afflicts him with sorrow in order to
expiate them through it."*[^26]

As the above two statements show, sufferings will make a man improve in
life.  
 Imam as-Sadiq (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"ان الهمَّ ليَذهبُ بذنُوبِ المُسلِم"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Grief removes the sins of the Muslim"*[^27]

A true believer, by lessening the weight of his sufferings, acts as if
he were given the best God given blessings[^28] or as if he were
drinking his mother's milk.[^29] In the case of spiritual sufferings, a
wrong doer is in fact depressed. Regarding this, Imam as-Sadiq (as) has
stated:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"الحُزنُ شِعَارُ العَارِفِينَ لِكَثرَةِ وَارِدَاتِ الغَيبِ عَلى
سَرائِرِهِم وَطُولِ مُبَاهَاتِهِم تَحتَ ستر الكِبرِياء وَالْمَحْزونُ
ظَاهِرُه قَبضٌ وَبَاطِنُهُ بَسطٌ، يَعِيشُ مَعَ الخَلقِ عَيشَ المَرضَى
وَمَعَ الله عَيشَ القُرَبَاءِ، الى اَن قالَ: وَيَمِينُ الحُزْنِ
الابتِلاءُ وِشِمَالُهُ الصَّمْتُ وَالحُزنُ يَختَصُّ بِهِ العَارِفُونَ
لله تَعالى وَالتَفَكُّر مُشتَرَكُ الخَاصِّ وَالعَامِّ وَلَو حُجِبَ
الحُزنُ عَن عُيونٍ العَارٍفٍينَ سَاعَةً اِستَغاثُوا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Sorrow is the mark of the gnostics, because of the frequency of the
arrivals of the unseen into their hearts and their prolonged
glorification of God. The outer self of the sorrowful one is contraction
and his inner self is expansion. He lives with people in listlessness,
and with God in close intimacy…”.* He said: *“To the right of sorrow is
affliction and to its left is silence. Sorrow belongs exclusively to
God's gnostics and contemplation is common to both the elite and the
ordinary people. If sorrow is concealed from the gnostics for a moment,
they will call out for help..."*[^30]

He also has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"عَنِ الصَادِقِ عليه السلام قال: اَوحَى الله اِلى عِيسَى بنِ مَريَمَ
هَب لِي مِن عَينَيكَ الدُّمُوع وَمِن قَلبِكَ الخُشُوعَ وَاكْحِل
عَينَيكَ بِمَيلِ الحُزْنِ اِذَا ضَحِكَ البَاطِلُونَ وَقُم عَلى قُبُورِ
الامْواتِ فَنَادِهِم بِالصَّوتِ الرَّفِيعِ لَعَلَّكَ تَأخُذُ
مَوعِظَتَكَ مِنهُم وَقُل اِنِّي لاحِقٌ بِهِم في اللاحِقِينَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"God revealed to Jesus Christ, son of Mary (as): ‘Give me tears from
your eyes and humility from your heart, and paint your eyes with the
inclination to sorrow when the vain-doers laugh. Stand over the graves
of the dead and call out to them in a loud voice - perhaps you will take
a lesson from them- and say: I am among those who will join
them.’”*[^31]

A person, whose sorrows are for people going astray and distancing
themselves from God, is among elite of believers. His sorrows, in fact,
make him come nearer to God. Imam ‘Ali (as) has stated

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن طَالَ حُزنُهُ على نَفسِهِ في الدُّنيَا اَقَرَّ الله عَينَيهِ
يَومَ القِيَامَةِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"He who prolongs his sorrow for himself in this world, Allah will make
him happy on the Day of Judgment."*[^32]

13. Prostrated by desires
-------------------------

**“** **وصريع الشهوات** **”**

Man is a unique creature whose body consists of both intellect and
desires. There is always a struggle between these two. If intellect
wins, man is better than angels; whereas, if desires win, he is lower
than animals;[^33] the strongest people are those who defeat their
desires, and obey rightfullness and wisdom[^34]. Only these latter
receive God's blessings[^35]; others are slaves to dirhams, dinars and
their instincts.[^36]

Imam ‘Ali’s (as) addressing his son as being "prostrated by desires" is
a symbolic statement and is, in fact, the advice of a father to his
ordinary son. Satan, too, has sworn to mislead every person except the
true believers.[^37] However Imam Hasan (as) is among the Infallibles
and protected against desires.[^38]

14. A Successor of the dead
---------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
” وخليفة الاموات “
  </p>
</blockquote>

As it was said in the phrase No 5 of the Imam's letter; if a man paid
attention to the fact that other people used to live on the land that we
are now occupying, then he would not be proud and would be thinking
about gathering provisions for the Hereafter. By notifying his great
son, the Imam (as) in fact gives us all a lesson to avoid indulging in
pride. He says, on the basis of the saying:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"حُكمُ الاَمثَالِ فِيمَا يَجُوزُ وَفِيمَا لا يَجُوزُ سَواءٌ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

“This will happen to you all as well”.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اَمَّا بَعدُ فَاِنَّ فِيمَا تَبَيَّنتُ مِن اِدبَارِ الدُّنيَا عَنِّي،
وَجُمُوحِ الدَّهرِ عَليَّ وَاِقبَالِ الآخِرَةِ اِليَّ مَا يَزَعُنِي
عَن ذِكرِ مَن سِوايَ والاِهتِمَامِ بِما وَرَائِي، غَيرَ اَنِّي حَيثُ
تَفَرَّدَ بِي دُونَ هُمُومِ النّاسِ هَمُّ نَفسِي فَصَدَّقَنِي رَأيي
وَصَرَفَنِي عَن هَوائِي وَصَرَّحَ لِي مَحضُ اَمرِي فَافضَى بِي اِلى
جَدٍّ لا يَكُونُ فِيهِ لَعِبٌ وَصِدقٍ لا يَشُوبُهُ كَذِبٌ وَوَجَدتُكَ
بَعضِي بَل وَجَدتُكَ كُلِّي حَتّى كَأنَّ شَيئاً لَو اَصابَكَ اَصابَنِي
وَكَأنَّ المَوتَ لَو اَتاكَ اَتانِي فَعنَانِي مِن اَمرِكَ مَا
يُغنِينِي مِن اَمرِ نَفسِي فَكَتَبتُ اِلَيكَ كِتَابِي مُستَظْهِراً
بِهِ اِن اَنا بَقِيتُ لَكَ اَوفَنِيتُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“What has become evident to me from the world’s turning away from me,
the wilfulness of time against me and the Hereafter advancing towards
me, restrains me from remembrance of anyone other than me or concern
with what is beyond me. Although concern for myself occupied me to the
exclusion of concern for others, my judgment proved to be true and it
turned me away from my desires and the true nature of my affair became
clear to me. This led me to an earnestness devoid* *of diversion and
truth unsullied by falsehood. I found you a part of myself; rather I
found you all of myself, until it was such that if something befell you
it befell me, and if death came to you it came to me; thus whatever
concerned me about myself, concerned me about you. Therefore I have
written a treatise for you so that it may be an aid (to you) whether I
live or die”.*

Commentary
----------

There are significant points to be discussed in this letter:

**1.** After being aware that the world has turned its back on him, that
it has overcome him and that the Hereafter is approaching him, how could
Imam ‘Ali (as) have cut himself off from others and become occupied with
his own affairs when we realize that the infallible Imam (as) had always
been aware of these facts and had consistently been trying to improve
himself?

To answer this difficult question, we may add: it is a fact that the
Imam (as) has always been alert and did not have to be exposed to the
overcoming of the world to appreciate the situation. But there are
problems that we know, but not concretely. It is the passing of the time
that gives us a full appreciation of the nature of events.

After having passed over the age of sixty and having felt the signs of
old age, amassed a pack of experiences, and seen the disloyalty of
people, now Imam (as) clearly feels the approaching of death and his
departure from this world. Under these situations, a man has to leave
the others and to concentrate on himself.  
 The night is dark, the waves are frightening and the whirlpool is
horrifying; how could those on the shore realize our plight?

**2.** How is self-correction compatible with the writing of such a
treatise?  
 To answer this question, we could say:  
 The conditions under which Imam (as) was living could make him think
about nobody except God, but he himself has said that his son is a part
of him: because his son's existence depends on his existence, or his son
is the whole of him because after the father, the son will be his
substitute and an heir of his knowledge and virtues:  
 Thus the Imam's attention to his son equals his attention to himself
and damage to his son is damage to himself.

**3.** Concerning the above points, the significance of the present
treatise becomes clear. Imam was under severe conditions at the time of
writing this letter. He should have spent his time solving those
problems, but he preferred to write this treatise. This shows by not
writing this letter, Imam (as) would have thought he had not carried out
his parental and Imamate duties. Thus, under dire situations, and prior
to his arrival at the caliphate center (i.e., Kufa), Imam (as) started
writing it. This makes the task of parents and leaders in constructing
the family and society even harder.[^39]

The poet says:  
 What are you fighting for, the contenders have all gone,  
 Prepare yourself for the voyage, friends have all gone,  
 That wandering dust in the desert,

Tells you to depart, since all the jockeys have gone.  
 Alas, the story tellers have all departed;  
 Alas, all the sorrow-filled people have gone.  
 We regret that the holders of spiritual treasures,  
 They left their treasures to friends and have gone.  
 The spring's eyelashes are stained with blood for the departure of
friends.  
 They left you in front of your eyes, like the spring clouds.

Another poet says:  
 Each moment a breath passes by,  
 When I see, there is not much left of it.  
 You have been unaware even if you are fifty,  
 You have five days left; see what you can do with it.  
 Ashamed will be the man, who left without having done any good deeds,

The horn of departure was rung, but he prepared nothing.  
 The sweet sleep and the morning  
 Will hinder the walker from going.  
 Anybody who arrived on the scene built a building,  
 And then left, leaving his building to others,  
 And the other had whims of his own,  
 And this building was not ever-lasting.

Do not make friends with an unstable thing,  
 This cruel one does not deserve your friendship.  
 Every body, both good and bad, should die,  
 Blessed is he who does good deeds in the world.  
 Send in advance a record of good deeds to your grave,  
 Nobody will bring it, you send it in advance.  
 Life is short and like snow in the summer heat,  
 There is only a little left, but we are still haughty.  
 Diligently listen to Sa'di's advice,  
 The way is like this, be a man, be prepared.

*“I recommend to you* *God-wariness, my son, and the fulfillment of
God's commands, inhabiting your heart with His remembrance and adherence
to His cord. What cord is firmer than that between you and God, if you
take hold of it?*

*Enliven your heart through exhortation and cause it to die through
abstinence, strengthen it with certainty, illuminate it with wisdom and
make it submissive with the remembrance of death. Make it acknowledge
its mortality, cause it to perceive the calamities of this world, warn
it of the assault of time, and the evil inconstancy of the nights and
days.*

*Present to it the reports of the past ones, and remind it of what
befell the earlier ones before you. Travel in their lands and (among)
their remains, and see what they did, from what they have moved away,
and where they arrived at and settled. You will find them having moved
away from their loved ones and having inhabited an alien abode and (it
is) as if you will soon become like one of them. Therefore, set right
your place of rest and do not sell your next life for your world.*

*Do not talk about what you do not know or speak about what is not
required of you. Keep away from a path if you fear it will lead you
astray, for holding back from the perplexity of misguidance is better
than encountering terrifying events. Bid others to do good and you will
be one of them; reject evil with your hand and your tongue, and do your
utmost to separate from one who does evil. ‘Strive in the way of God as
is His due’ (ref.22:78) and do not let the reproach of any reproacher
have any influence on you in the path of God.*

*Plunge into hardships for the sake of truth wherever it may be, and
become learned in religion. Habituate yourself to patient endurance in
afflictions; the best of moral traits is to constrain yourself to
patience in the (path of) truth. Commit your self in all your affairs to
your God, for you will thus be committing it to a secure cave and a
mighty protector. Be sincere in your asking from* *your Lord, for in His
hand is the bestowal and refusal, and ask God frequently for the best.
Understand my testament and do not disregard it, for indeed the best
speech is that which is is beneficial. Know that there is no good in
knowledge that is not beneficial, and knowledge that is not worthy of
acquisition is not beneficial”.*

Commentary

Imam ‘Ali (as), in this treatise, has emphasized a series of commands
and methods for obeying God, and preparing piety and cleansing the heart
of impurities and filling it out with virtues and taking lessons from
the people in the past and selecting the best method of living. Each one
of these deserves a research:

word “desire” is not appropriate for an innocent Imam, relegate these
words to the caliphate. But this is not necessary. Imam (as) in this
treatise wants to depict the duties of one ordinary father and son and
not the duties of an infallible father or an infallible son (Nahj
