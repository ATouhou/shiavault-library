Conclusion
==========

This document, which deserves to be called the constitution of Islamic
polity, was prepared by the person who was the greatest scholar of
Divine law and acted upon it more than anyone else.

From the study of Amir al-mu'minin's way of governance in these pages it
can be concluded that his aim was only the enforcement of Divine law and
the improvement of social conditions, and not to disrupt public security
or to fill treasures by plunder, or to strive to extend the country's
boundaries by fair means or foul.

Worldly governments generally adopt such constitutions which cater for
their utmost benefit and try to change every law which is against that
aim or is injurious to their objective. But every article of this
constitution serves as a custodian of common interests and protector of
collective organization. Its enforcement has no touch of selfishness or
any iota of self interest.

It contains such basic principles of the fulfillment of Allah's
obligations, the protection of human rights without distinction of
religion or community, the care of the destitute and the poor and the
provision of succor to the low and the down-trodden from which full
guidance can be bad for the propagation of right and justice, the
establishment of peace and security, and the prosperity and well-being
of the people.
