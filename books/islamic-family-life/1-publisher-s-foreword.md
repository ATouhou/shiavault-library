Publisher's Foreword
====================

   
 Our Organization is now publishing *Islamic Family Life,* one of the
books of \`Allamah Sayyid Sa’eed Akhtar Rizvi, praise be to Allah, all
Power is with Him. Sayyid Rizvi is one of the most sincere preachers of
Islam and an active scholar, both when he was in Tanzania in the Bilal
Muslim Mission (an Islamic organization active in Tanzania), -and also
now that he has returned to his own country of India.

In the way of spreading Islam, he has rendered numerous services and has
been most active. Sayyid Rizvi is a successful author of many books on
various Islamic subjects, and he has the gift of being able to write in
a way which all people can easily understand. He has worked closely with
our Organization for many years, and we are proud to have published many
of his writings, not only in English, but also in many other languages
into which they have been translated.

From Allah we ask for goodness and guidance, and pray that He will keep
us far from error and mistake. For He is the best Guide and the only
Friend.
