69: Reality (haqqah)
====================

These 52 early Meccan verses were revealed after Control 67 and before
Stair cases Upward 70, the next chapter in sequence. The apocalyptic
vision is superb and now becoming clearer, for this chapter offers us a
vivid idea of how the Last Trumpet will sound on Judgment Day. It also
talks about the ancient peoples of Arabia called Thamud and Ad as well
as about Pbaraoh and Noah.
