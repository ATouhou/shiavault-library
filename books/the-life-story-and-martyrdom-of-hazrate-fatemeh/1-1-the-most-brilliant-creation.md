1. the Most Brilliant Creation!
===============================

God Almighty appeared to man a hidden gem. His Providence had decided to
create a human creature on Earth, who would be His rightful heir. So, To
show His Might and Power, and to create the most noble creature who
would be His trustful servant, and the keeper of His Knowledge, He
created the five “ Holy Ones “. Among these five Holy creatures, on the
Heavenly plane, Hazraté Fâtemeye Zahra was the most beautiful creation
among all the other creations…

In an authentic Hadis, it is said:” O Ahmad! If it weren’t for thee, I
would never have created Heavens and Earth, and if it weren’t for Ali, I
would never have created thee, and if it weren’t for Fâtemeh, I would
never have created you two…”

Yes… It is true that Fâtemeh was an Angel… A most beautiful angel, who
for a while, clothed herself with the clothes of Man. So it is not so
strange when God says:” We gave you Kowssar! So, respect your God with
your prayer, give an offering, for he who is your enemy, will not have
any progeny…” [Al-Kowssar, 1-3].

Imam Bagher has been reported to say:” This is the pure Tree of our
Prophet; and its trunk is represented by Ali, while its root are
represented by Fâtemeh, and its fruit are Fâtemeh’s Progeny, and finally
its leaves and blossoms are none others than the Shiites of Fâtemeh…”
