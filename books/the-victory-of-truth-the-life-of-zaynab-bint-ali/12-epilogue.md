Epilogue 
=========

lt was her destiny to proclaim to the world the sacrifices made by Imam
Husayn and the other members of the family of the Holy Prophet [s.a.w.]
for the cause of Islam. She exposed the evil deeds of Ibn Ziyad and
Yazid with courage and fearlessness. Had it not been for her the
sacrifice of Karbala might have faded into oblivion.

She endured physical pain and mental torture with fortitude and was a
source of strength to all around her. The sorrow and grief she expressed
was an outpouring of her intense humanity. Never did she rebel against
the destiny decreed by Allah. The strength of her submission was divine,
yet her lamentation poignantly human. 

The spirit of Zaynab [a.s.] will live forever. Her courage, forbearance,
and submission will continue to inspire those who hear her story for all
time to come.
