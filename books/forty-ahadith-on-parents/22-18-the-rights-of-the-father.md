Imam ar-Ridha (peace be upon him) narrates that a person once asked the
Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his family): “What are the
rights of the father upon the son?”  The Noble Prophet replied: “He
should not call his father by name, he should not walk ahead of him, he
should not sit until his father has seated himself and he should not do
such acts as a result of which people abuse his father.”
