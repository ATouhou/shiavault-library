THE ROPE
The night fell heavy in the heights of the mountains and the man could
not see anything. All was

black. Zero visibility, and the moon and the stars were covered by the
clouds. As he was climbing

only a few feet away from the top of the mountain, he slipped and fell
in to the air, falling at great

speed. He could only see black spots as he went down, and the terrible
sensation of being sucked by

gravity.

He kept falling, and in the moments of great fear, it came to his mind
all the good and bad episodes

of his life. He was thinking now about how close death was getting, when
all of a sudden he felt the

rope tied to his waist pull him very hard. His body was hanging in the
air.

Only the rope was holding him and in that moment of stillness he had no
other choice other to

scream: “Help me God.”

All of a sudden a deep voice coming from the sky answered, “What do you
want me to do?”

“Save me God.”

“Do you really think I can save you?”

“Of course I believe You can.”

“Then cut the rope tied to your waist.”

There was a moment of silence and the man decided to hold on to the rope
with all his strength.

The rescue team tells that the next day a climber was found dead and
frozen, his body hanging

from a rope. His hands holding tight to it. Only one foot away from the
ground.

And We? How attached we are to our rope will we let go??? Don’t ever
doubt about

the words of God. We should never say that He has forgotten us or
abandoned us.
