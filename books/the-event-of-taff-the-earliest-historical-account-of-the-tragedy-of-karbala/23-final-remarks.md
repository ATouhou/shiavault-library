Final Remarks
=============

With the mercy of Allah, the Most High, we have come to the end of the
reports about Imam al-Husayn (as) which have appeared in *Tarikh
al-Tabari*, and which [Tabari narrated] on the authority of Hisham
al-Kalbi from Abu Mikhnaf, who in turn related [these reports] from his
[chain of] narrators. We also edited the reports, bringing in our
comments and remarks. The primary source for our comments happened to
be, again, *Tarikh al-Tabari*, except for the information that we could
not find in it.

All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
