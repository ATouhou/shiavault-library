Foreword

The Laws and Regulations of Islam are divided into two major and
distinct categories – the first being those laws that deal with a human
being’s relationship to his Creator and Master. The second category is
those laws that regulate and govern our relationship with each other.
Seeing as how in the branch of Islamic Law, known is Fiqh, 90% of the
rules govern our interaction with each other, it is a requirement that
we become familiar with how we should carry ourselves when around
members of the same sex and more importantly, those of the opposite sex.
