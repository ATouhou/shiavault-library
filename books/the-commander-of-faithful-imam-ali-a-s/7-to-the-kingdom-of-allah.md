To the Kingdom of Allah
=======================

Having ended the resistence of the Mariqun, Imam Ali (a.s.) turned to
resuming the fight against the Qasitun in al-Sham, with arbitration
having failed in the second meeting.

He proclaimed mobilization for his army, and declared war against the
opposition led by Mu'awiyah. This was announced by him in a speech
delivered in Kufa, his capital of the Islamic state, where the people
were invited for Jihad (fight in the way of Allah): "Jihad! Jihad! O
creatures of Allah!" He declared: "Beware, that I am mobilizing the army
today. Whoever desires to go forward to Allah, let him come
forth!"(172)

Then Imam Ali (a.s.) started distributing banners to his leaders,
Husain, Abu Ayyub al-Ansari and Qais bin Sa'id. Yet, as he was engaged
in mobilizing his forces in order to put an end to the opposition
movement led by Mu'awiyah, there was another mean conspiracy being
covertly planned, this time to assassinate him.

A group of his enemies held a meeting in Mecca to deliberate evil
intentions, which were to end with the most horrific consequences. The
gravest decision was to murder Amir al-Mu'minin, and the task was
assigned to the willful criminal Abdul- Rahman bin Muljam al-Muradi. It
was a most critical period in the history of Islam and the Muslims, and
at a time when the nation was looking forward to a decisive victory over
the destructive elements of disunity led by Mu'awiyah bin Abi Sufyan,
that the sinful hand of al- Muradi was extended to Ali bin Abi Talib
(a.s.). He swept down with a sword on his head while the Imam was
prostrating during dawn prayers at the honorable mosque of Kufa on the
19th of the month of Ramadan of the year 40 A.H.

They assassinated Imam Ali (a.s.) at his finest time--the hour of
standing before Allah, the Exalted, during a prayer of submission, in
the best of days, while fasting during the month of Ramadan; during the
most glorious Islamic duties, while preparing to wage jihad, and in the
highest and most pure divine places, the Mosque of Kufa.

May joy be to Amir al-Mu'minin Imam Ali bin Abi Talib (a.s.) and a
blessed afterlife!

The crime of assassinating Imam Ali (a.s.) remains one of the most
cruel, brutal and hideous, because it was not committed against one man,
but against the whole rational Islamic leadership. By assassinating Imam
Ali (a.s.), they actually aimed at assassinating the message, the
history, the culture and the nation of Muslims embodied in the person of
Imam Ali bin Abi Talib (a.s.). In doing so, the Islamic nation lost its
guide of progress, and at the most wonderous opportunity in its life
after the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.).

Imam Ali (a.s.) suffered from his wound for three days, during which he
entrusted his son, Imam Hasan (a.s.) with the Imamate of guiding the
nation ideologically and socially. During those three days, as during
all his life, he never ceased remembering Allah, praising Him, and
accepting Him and His ordinance.

Likewise, he continued giving pieces of advice and directions leading
to good, pointing to the right, defining the way to guidance, explaining
the course for deliverance, calling for the observance of Allah's
ordinances, and warning against following one's ill desires and
set-backs from not carrying our the divine message. The following is one
piece of advice offered to his sons, Imams Hasan and Hussain (a.s.), as
well as to his people, the nation and coming generations:

"I advise you to fear Allah, and not to run after (the pleasure of) the
world, even if it may run after you. Do not be sorry for anything from
it which you have been denied. Say the truth and act for(Allah's)
reward. Be an enemy of the oppressor, and be a helper of the
oppressed.

"I advise you, my children, my household and all those who may receive
my message, to fear Allah, to arrange your affairs well, to maintain
good relations among yourselves, for I have heard your grandfather
(s.a.w.) saying: 'Good relations are better than prayer and fasting in
general.' "(Fear) Allah when handling matters of orphans. Do not let
them starve, nor allow them to be lost as long as you are there.

"(Fear) Allah in respect to your neighbors, for they were the truest of
your Prophet (s.a.w.). He went on asking us to take care of them, so
much that we thought he would make them heirs (of our heritage).

"(Fear) Allah in respect to the Qur'an, (take care that) no one may
excel you in following its tenets.

"(Fear) Allah in respect to prayer, as it is the pillar of your
religion.

"(Fear) Allah in respect to your Lord's House (Ka'bahh), do not forsake
it so long as you live, because if you do you will not be looked upon
with respect.

"(Fear) Allah in respect to jihad, fight with your wealth, your lives
and your tongues, in the way of Allah.

"Have mutual liaison and give-and-take. Beware of turning your faces
from, and of renouncing, one another. Do not abandon bidding good and
forbidding evil, lest vicious people may overrule you, and then in such
a case, your invocations will not be responded to (by Allah)." Then he
said: "O, Banu Abdul Muttalib, certainly I do not want you to wade
through the blood of the Muslims, crying: "Amir al-Mu'minin was
murdered. You certainly kill for me no one but my killer.

"Wait till I die by this stroke of him (bin Muljam), then strike a
single stroke against him, and do not disfigure his body, for I had
heard the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) saying: 'Avoid mayhem even with a
rabid dog'."(173)

Such was the heroic end of this great man! The loss to the Mission and
the nation was the gravest after the loss of the Messenger of Allah
(s.a.w.). By the death of Imam Ali (a.s.) the nation lost:

A heroism that had become the song of the time;
A courageous history that has never dreamt of its like;
A wisdom no one can fathom, save Allah;
A purity, the like of which was only in the prophets;
An abstinence from the pleasures of life that could be attained only by
the nearest to Allah; An eloquence such as to be the echo of Book; and A
jurisprudence, and a thorough knowledge of the laws of religion, that
made him the 'gateway of the city' of the Prophet's knowledge, and the
authority to whom the Islamic nation referred in all its affairs.

Peace be upon Amir al-Mu'minin the day he was born, the day he was
martyred on his alter, and the day he shall be raised alive.

Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds.

(s.a.w.), by some further years, to which he referred in his speech
