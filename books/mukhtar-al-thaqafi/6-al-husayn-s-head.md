Al-Husayn's Head
================

Shimr beheaded al-Husayn and gave his head to Ubaidullah bin Ziyad.

The people saw Imam Husayn's head. They felt pain because they did not
support him.

Ubaidullah bin Ziyad ordered some guards to bring Mukhtar .

Seeing al-Husayn's head, Mukhtar said with pain:

*Alas! Alas!*

Then he thought about a revolution to punish the criminals.
