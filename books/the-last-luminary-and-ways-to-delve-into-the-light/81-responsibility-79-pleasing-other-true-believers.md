Responsibility 79: Pleasing Other True Believers
================================================

Another responsibility is to please and cheer up the true believers,
friends and Shi’a of the Imam as this actually makes the Imam happy!

We can please another believer through various ways, including: removing
any difficulties from his life; helping him in his problems or worries;
fulfilling his needs; helping one in the treatment of his sickness; and
supplicating for the believer and showing respect and honour to him. One
can also help his friends and close relatives such as his immediate
family members, and children through material gifts.

Helping a true believer can be done through various means; however in
all of them, if the person helps someone else purely for the pleasure of
Imam al-Hujjah (ajtf) then without doubt, one has succeeded in attaining
the pleasure of another believer and the happiness of the Imam of the
Time!

Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad as-Sadiq (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لاَ يَرى أَحَدُكُمْ إِذَا أَدْخَلَ عَلـى مُؤْمِنٍ سُرُوراً أَنَّهُ
عَلَيْهِ أَدْخَلَهُ فَقَطْ، بَلْ وَ اللٌّهِ عَلَيْنَا، بَلْ وَ اللٌّهِ
عَلَـى رَسُولِ اللٌّهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“None of you should think that if you bring happiness to a believer that
happiness has been brought to that person alone. Rather, by Allah, it
has also brought us (the Ahlul Bayt) happiness, rather, by Allah, it has
even brought happiness to the Messenger of Allah!”[^1]

Believer,’ no. 6
