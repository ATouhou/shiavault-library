Prophet - The Model of Goodness
===============================

The behaviour and personality of Prophet Muhammad (a) are the best
examples to follow in life. A companion of his, who spent full ten years
with him, has said:

“Throughout my stay with him I never heard an indecent word from his
lips and never found him rude to anyone. He spoke very politely. He was
kind to everyone”.

Although Muhammad (a) was the Prophet of Allah and had been appointed by
Allah to guide the people, yet he was not ashamed of doing his work with
his own hands. He assisted the members of his family in household work
and performed the jobs of other deserving persons with great pleasure.
He mended his clothes and shoes. He also took part in the construction
of Masjid al-Nabi in Madina along with his companions.

His dress was always clean, though simple. He was very mindful of
cleanliness. He washed his hands and mouth before and after taking his
meals.

He was so kind and generous that he never refused a reasonable request
of any person. He often distributed edibles among others and went
without meals himself. He always helped the needy and the poor and went
to the houses of the sick to enquire after their health. As and when he
met anyone he said “Salamun Alaikum”. He always spoke with a smiling
face.

The Holy Prophet was a model of all the virtues and qualities of a
believer described in the Holy Qur'an. None can describe him better than
Allah who has said, he possessed the most noble character.

The personality of our Prophet is an excellent model to follow.
