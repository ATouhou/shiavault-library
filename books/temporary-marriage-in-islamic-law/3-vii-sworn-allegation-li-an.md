Vii. Sworn Allegation (li'an)
=============================

'Sworn allegation' is a procedure whereby a man may take his wife
before a qadi and either accuse her of infidelity or deny his fathering
her child. The man then pronounces this formula four times: 'I testify
before God that I speak the truth concerning what I say about this
woman.' The qadi will then counsel the man concerning the gravity of his
accusation. If he should repent of his words, he will receive the
punishment for false accusation (eighty lashes). If he maintains the
truth of his accusation, he must repeat a second formula four times:
'God's curse be upon me if I am a liar'.

The judge then turns to the wife. She may either face the penalty for
adultery (stoning to death) or repeat this formula four times: 'I
testify before God that he is a liar'. The judge will counsel her
concerning the gravity of falsely swearing before God. If she continues
to maintain her innocence, she must pronounce a second formula four
times: 'God's wrath be upon me if he is telling the truth '. If she
refuses to pronounce the formula, she will suffer the penalty for
adultery.

After sworn allegation, the man and woman are forbidden to each other
forever, without divorce. If the husband denies the parentage of a
child, the child is illegitimate. If the man should ever repent of his
allegation, he must suffer the penalty for false accusation. In case a
child is involved, its legitimacy will then be restored; according to
the Sunnis, in such a case the father and the child inherit from each
other, but according to the Shi'is, the father may not inherit from the
child. [^78] The woman continues to be forbidden to the man.

VIII. Inheritance (Mirath)

Husband and wife inherit from each other according to set rules. The
only condition for inheritance is a valid marriage contract, not
consummation of the marriage.

If the wife should die childless, the husband inherits one-half of her
property; if she had a child or children, he inherits one-fourth. If the
husband should die childless, the wife inherits one-fourth of her
property; if he had children, she inherits one-eighth.

If the deceased wife should have no other relatives, all property goes
to the husband. If the deceased husband should have no other relatives,
the wife will inherit one-half the property and the rest will go to the
bayt al-mal (the community treasury), except according to one of two
Shi'i opinions, which holds that she inherits all the property. [^79] If
the deceased husband had more than one wife, the wife's share is divided
among them equally.

The husband inherits from everything left by the wife. According to the
Sunni schools, the wife also inherits from everything left by the
husband; in general the Shi'is hold that if she does not have any
children from the husband, she inherits from all property except land,
though she does inherit from the value of property situated upon the
land, such as buildings, trees, implements, etc. [^80]

If a woman should be in a period of revocable divorce when she or her
husband dies, her situation is the same as that of an ordinary wife. But
when irrevocable divorce has taken place, there is no inheritance, with
the exception of divorce during illness. If the husband should be ill
and divorce his wife irrevocably, and if she should then die, he does
not inherit from her; but if the husband should die as a result of the
illness, the schools differ as to the situation. The Hanbalis hold that
the wife inherits as long as she has not remarried. The Hanafis say that
she inherits as long as she is still in her waiting period. The Malikis
hold that she inherits in any case. The Shafi'is have two opinions, one
that there is no inheritance, the other that the situation is as the
Hanafis say. The Shi'is maintain that she may inherit within one year of
the divorce provided she has not remarried. [^81]
