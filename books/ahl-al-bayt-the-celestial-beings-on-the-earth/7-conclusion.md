Conclusion
==========

A perfect recognition of the Ahl al-Bayt is beyond human capacity. With
numerous translations and interpretations of the Holy Quran throughout
centuries, every new generation realizes that there are concepts in the
Holy Quran, which have not been discussed as yet. The same thing can be
said about Ahl al-Bayt.

All throughout the past fourteen centuries, many books and dissertations
have been written on them; yet, there are still many things that have
not yet been written or said. From narrations related by Ahl al- Bayt,
we infer that getting to know Ahl al-Bayt has many stages.

The Holy Prophet has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا عَلِيُّ! مَا عَرَفَ اللَّهَ وَ أنْتَ: وَ مَا عَرَفَنِي إلأَّ
اللَّهُ وَ أنْتَ: وَمَا عَرَفَكَ إلأَّ اللَّهُ وَ أنَا.
  </p>
</blockquote>

O Ali! No one knows Allah save you and me; no one knows me save Allah
and you; no one knows you save Allah and me.[^1]

The Holy Prophet has also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ مَاتَ وَلَمْ يَعْرِفْ إمَامَ زَمَانِهِ مَاتَ مِيتَةً جَاهِلِيَّة.
  </p>
</blockquote>

One who dies and does not know his Imam has died the death of one who
lived in the era of ignorance (i.e. has not recognized Islam).[^2]

The Holy Prophet has introduced dying without knowing the Imam of the
time as dying in the pre-Islamic era of ignorance. On one hand he has
counted the knowing of Ahl al-Bayt at a very limited level and the level
of knowing Allah and Ahl al-Bayt on another.

From these narrations, we infer that human beings have different
capacities of getting to know the Ahl al-Bayt. Salman, the Persian is
quite different from Abu-Dharr in terms of knowing Ahl al-Bayt.
Abu-Dharr’s knowledge of Ahl al-Bayt is different from that of Miqdad.

Quoting his great grandfather Ali ibn Husayn, Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.) has
reported:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَاللَّهِ، لَوْ عَلِمَ أبُوذَرٍ مَا فِي قَلْبِ سَلْمَانَ لَقَتَلَهُ!
وَلَقَدْ آخِى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ بَيْنَهُمَا، فَمَا ظَنُّكُمْ بِسَائِرِ
الْخَلْقِ؟ إنَّ عِلْمَ الْعُلَمَاءِ صَعْبٌ مُسْتَصْبٌ لاَ يَحْتَمِلُهُ
إلأ نَبِيٌ مُرْسَلٌ أوْ مَلَكُ مُقَرَّبٌ أو عَبْدُ مُؤْمِنٌ إمْتَحَنَ
اللَّهُ قَلْبَهُ لِلأيمَانِ. وَإنَّمَا صَارَ سَلْمَانُ مِنَ
الْعُلَمَاءِ لأنَّهُ امْرُؤٌ مِنَّا أهْلَ الْبَيتِ فَلِذَلِكَ
نَسَبْتَهُ إلَى الْمَاءِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

By Allah (I swear), if Abu-Dharr knew what was in the heart of Salman,
he would kill him, though Allah had made a contract of brotherhood
between them. How would you then judge about other people? Surely the
scholars’ knowledge is hard to understand and burdensome! No one can
endure it but a Prophet, an archangel or a believing servant whose heart
Allah has tested with faith. Only Salman became a man of knowledge, for
he was from us, Ahl al-Bayt. That is why I attributed him to the
scholars. [^3]

On one occasion, Imam Ali (a.s.) said to Abu-Dharr:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ سَلْمَانَ لَوْ حَدَّتَكَ بِمَا يَعْلَمُ لَقُلْتَ: رَحِمَ اللَّهُ
قَاتِلَ سَلْمَانَ!
  </p>
</blockquote>

If Salman informed you of what he knew, you would say: May Allah have
mercy on Salman’s killer.[^4]

It has been reported that faith has ten ranks: Salman was in the tenth
rank, Abu-Dharr in the ninth and Miqdad in the eighth.[^5]

As it is seen, faith is based on knowledge. Therefore, ranks of faith
are deeply rooted in the ranks of knowledge.

Exaggeration - A Threat To Faith
--------------------------------

Throughout history of Shiism, exaggeration has been a potential danger
threatening the Shia faith. We can say that there has never been an
epoch in the history of Shia without exaggerators being there. There has
never been a time when the Imams of Ahl al-Bayt have not resisted
against this destructive current of exaggeration and have not condemned
it. Surprisingly, we still witness exaggerators here and there in our
time, which is the age of the technology of data and advanced sciences.

Exaggeration has its roots in two factors: lacking sufficient capacity
for learning the knowledge of Ahl al-Bayt and overflowing of emotions
and its dominance over intellect.

The Holy Prophet has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَوْلأَ أنْ يَقُولَ الضَّالُّونَ مِنْ أمَّتِي مَا قَالَتِ النَّصَارَى
فِي عِسَى بْنِ مَرْيَمَ، لَقُلْتُ فِيكَ قَوْلاً لاَ تَمُررُّ بِمَلإٍ
مِنَ النَّاسِ إلاَّ أخَددذُوا اْتُّرَابَ مِنْ تَحْتِ قَدَمَيكَ
يَسْتَشْفُونَ بِهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Were it not for fear that exaggerators of my ummah say about you what
Christians said about Jesus, son of Mary, I would say something about
you that you would not pass by any people unless they would take the
soil under you feet to be healed therewith.[^6]

A man by the name of Sa’d asked Imam al-Baqir (a.s.), “Who is an
exaggerator?” The Imam said,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
(الْغَالُونَ) قَومٌ يَقُولُونَ فِينَا مَا لاَ نَقُولُهُ فِي
أنْفُسَنَا. فَلَيسَ أُولَئِكَ مِنَّا وَلَسْنَا مِنْهُمْ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“They are people who say something about us which we do not say about
ourselves. They are not from us and we are not from them either.”[^7]

Imam al-Sadiq has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
شِيعَتُنَا مَنْ لاَ يَمْدَحُ بِنَا غَالِياً.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Our followers are those who do not eulogize us exaggeratedly.[^8]

In another narration, Imam al-Sadiq is reported as saying:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ أحِبُّوا أهْلَ بَيْتِ نَبِيِّكُمْ حُبَّاً مُقْتَصِداً وَلاَ
تَغْلُوا.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Be moderate in loving the Household of your Prophet and do not
exaggerate.[^9]

Evidently, the young generation who are the great support of every
school of thought, every society and every culture, if exposed to
exaggerators inroad, the biggest blow will be dealt to the Muslim
society, the school of thought and culture.

The Imams of Ahl al-Bayt, with their Divine insight have warned the new
generations against the blight of exaggeration. In this relation, Imam
al- Sadiq (a.s.) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إحْذَروا عَلَى شَبَابِكُمُ الغُلاَةَ لاَ يُفْسِدُوهُمْ، فَإنَّ
الغُلاَةَ شَرُّ خَلْقِ اللَّهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Beware of exaggerators who might ruin the youngsters, for exaggerators
are the worst creatures.[^10]

In another *Hadith*, after speaking about Allah’s attributes, Imam
al-Ridha says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
نَحْنُ آلَ مُحَمَّدٍ النَّمَطُ الأوْسَطُ الَّذِي لاَ يُدِكُنَا
الْغَالِي وَ لاَ يَسْبِقُنَا الْتَّالِي.
  </p>
</blockquote>

We, the family of Muhammad, are moderate people. Those who overstate our
position do not understand us. And, those who understate our position
fail to supersede us. Know that the Imams of Ahl al-Bayt have made the
right path distinct from the wrong; no excuse is accepted from anyone.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَللَّهُمَّ أحْيِنَا حَيَاةَ مُحَمَّدِ وَ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، وَ أمِتُنَا
مَمَاتَ مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، وَارْزُقَنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا
زِيَارَةَ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، وَفِي الآخِرَةِ شَفَاعَةَ
مُحَمَّدٍ وَ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، وَ لاَ تُفَرِّقْ بَيْنَنَا وَ بَيْنَ
مُحَمَّدٍ وَ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، وَ اجْعَلْنَا مِنْ شِيعَةِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ
آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

O Allah, make me live like Muhammad (S) and his household lived. And,
make me die like Muhammad (S) and his household died. And make the
visitation of the grave of Muhammad (S) and those of his household, the
intercession of Muhammad (S) and his household in the hereafter
available to us. And make no separation between us and Muhammad (S) and
his household and place us among the followers of Muhammad (S) and the
household of Muhammad (S).
