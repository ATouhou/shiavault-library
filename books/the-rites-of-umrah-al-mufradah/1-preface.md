Preface
=======

Because lots of our believer and interested people go to Bait Allah
al-Haraam (sacred house of Allah) for performing Umrah al-Mufradah every
year and it is growing day by day, also confrontation of respected
missionaries with new issues and the feeling of need to establish
comprehensive rites in this field caused us to verify all issues of
Umrah and compare the issues of Hajj with them under the supervision of
Grand Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi (m.z.a.); in order that respected Hajjis
know about all issues and rituals and acts of this great divine duty and
on the other hand stress of respected seminaries of caravans about
knowing the latest Fatwas of his highness to be removed and all people
can perform the acts of Umrah with comfortable mind and return with
handful of spirituality from this divine journey.

Features of this book can be mentioned as follows:

1- Collecting the latest jurisprudential opinions of his highness Grand
Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi about Umrah which have been mentioned in
different books accompanying the latest Fatwas of his highness.

2- Removing repetitive and unnecessary issues and replacing them with
new issues.

3- Placing the issues and Esteftas of each subject next to each other in
order to facilitate finding needed issues.

4- Placing issues in proper chapters.

5- Using todayâ€™s language and literature.

6- Removing issues that have no real life example today.
