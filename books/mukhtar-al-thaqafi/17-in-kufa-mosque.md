In Kufa Mosque
==============

Mukhtar went up the pulpit. He announced the aims of the revolution:

*I'll conform to Allah's Book and to His Apostle's sunnah. I'll take
revenge on Imam Husayn's killers. I'll fight against those who have
broken Allah's laws. I'll defend the weak* *against the strong.*

Mukhtar wanted to follow Imam Ali's just policy. So, the people were
full of happiness. The Umayyads were racists. They preferred Arabs to
non-Arabs. For this reason, Mukhtar abolished racial discrimination. He
adopted justice instead.
