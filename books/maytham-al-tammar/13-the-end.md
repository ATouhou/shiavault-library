The End
=======

Ubaidullah bin Ziyad ordered the police to bring Maytham. He said to
him:

*I've heard that you're a companion of Ali's!*

Maytham said:

*Yes.*

Ubaidullah bin Ziyad said to Maytham:

*Will you disown him?*

Maytham said:

*No, I won't!*

Ubaidullah bin Ziyad said:

*Surely, I'll kill you!*

Maytham said:

*By Allah, Imam Ali [a] has told me that you will kill me! He has told
me that you will cut my hands, legs, and tongue!*

Ibn Ziyad stormily said:

*Your Imam is a liar!*

Maytham jeered at that foolish person (Ubaidullah).

Ibn Ziyad ordered the police to tie Maytham to the date-palm trunk near
the house of Amru bin Huraith. Besides, he ordered them to cut off his
hands and legs.
