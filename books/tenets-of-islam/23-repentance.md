Repentance
==========

Repentance, means regretting about anything wrong committed in the past,
ceasing to commit it immediately and taking a firm decision not to
commit it in future. It is obligatory as so many verses of the Holy
Qur'an and the traditions of the Holy Prophet clearly indicate. common
sense also appeals that one must take steps to ward off any possible
harm.
