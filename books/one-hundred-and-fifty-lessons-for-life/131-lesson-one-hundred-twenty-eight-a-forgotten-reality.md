Lesson One Hundred Twenty Eight: A Forgotten Reality
====================================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَمْ يَخْلُقِ اللّهُ يَقِيناً لاشَكَّ فِيهِ أَشْبَهُ بِشَكٍّ لا يَقينَ
فِيهِ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ!
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

God has not created a certainty as doubt-free as death, but (going by
man’s attitude towards death) it seems as if it is a doubtful thing in
which there is never any certainty.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

What a strange phrase, and what a clear interpretation of man’s lack of
attention to the inevitable end of his life .

Man can have doubts about anything and may not believe in any religion,
but he cannot doubt the fact that sooner or later his life will end and
meet he must with death.

Yet, surprisingly, his lifestyle conveys the impression that he is
unconcerned and unaware of death as if he was immortal!

Thus, he does not prepare himself for receiving it with faith, good
deeds, purity and virtue. Let us be realistic and accept that one is
bound to die and it can happen at any time. That being the case, we must
keep ourselves pure and prepared at all times to avoid regret and shame
when death does catch up with us.
