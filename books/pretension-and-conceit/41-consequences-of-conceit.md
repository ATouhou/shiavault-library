Consequences of Conceit
=======================

There are many consequences and harms of conceit, and their list is as
follows:

1. pride

2. forgetting a sin and underestimating it

3. deprivation of the benefits of admonishment and guidance

4. indifference to people's ways of harm

5. non-belief in the mercy and favor of AllƒÅh

Any of these consequences suffices to render one's perdition and
suffering; so, what would you say about all of them combined?!
