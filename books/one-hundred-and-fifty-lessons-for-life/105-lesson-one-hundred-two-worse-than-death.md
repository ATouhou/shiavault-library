Lesson One Hundred Two: Worse Than Death
========================================

Imam Hasan Al-’Askari (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
خَيْرٌ مِنَ الْحَياةِ ما إذا فَقَدْتَهُ أَبْغَضْتَ الْحَياةَ! وَ شَرٌّ
مِنَ الْمَوْتِ مَا إِذا نَزَلَ بِكَ أَحْبَبْتَ الْمَوْتَ!
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Better than life is that which , if you lose it, you would hate life !
And worse than death is that which, if it happens to you, you would
welcome death ![^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Some people think that the highest worth is the worth of this material
life while there are a lot of things more valuable than it. There are
some moments in life in which man wishes for death, and there are truths
for which he sacrifices himself without hesitation.

The martyrs who lay down their lives for the sake of their religion and
justice and other virtues are those who understand the deep truth in the
above tradition. When they found life unpleasant and death a window to a
wider world, as well as God’s satisfaction, they bade farewell to life
and embraced death.
