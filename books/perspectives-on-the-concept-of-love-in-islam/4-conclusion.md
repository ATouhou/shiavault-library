 Thus, in Islam love plays an essential role in ethics, mysticism,
theology and even philosophy. To draw an Islamic picture of the world,
including the story of the creation of the universe and mankind and then
god's treatment of humanity one always needs to invoke the notion of
love. God Himself is love and has created the world out of love.

He treats human beings with love. Faith also starts with love, an
overwhelming love for certain truths and is required to flourish by the
nourishment of this love to the extent that one's love for God fills all
parts of one's heart and directs all aspects of one's life. One's love
for God can increase only when one reduces one's selfishness and if one
can ultimately get rid of selfishness and I‑ness one will be a perfect
man whose will and pleasure would be the will and pleasure of God.

Love for God and freedom from selfishness can be secured at first by
sacrifice and losing one's desires for the sake of God, and His people
and then by having no desire other than what He desires and no will
other than His. Then, of course, there will be no sacrifice and no pain.
Ethical rules are guidelines of this path of love, enlightened and
oriented by teachings of the intellect and prophets.
