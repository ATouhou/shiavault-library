  Discovering Shi’i Islam is a brief introduction to main issues related
  to Islam in general and Shi’i Islam in particular. Though simply and
  clearly written, it is an outcome of more than twenty years of
  involvement in Islamic studies. The text studies the origins of Shi’i
  Islam and its sources, i.e. the Qur.an, the Sunnah, the reason and
  consensus. It also studies fundamental doctrines and main practices of
  Islam. It ends with a brief account of the latest statistics about the
  present Muslim population of the world along with a breakdown of
  religious affiliations of some countries with a long history of Shi’i
  presence therein. Discovering Shi’i Islam represents a sincere
  commitment to Islamic unity and is hoped to serve as a modest step
  towards Muslim brotherhood. Indeed, this book echoes the Qur’anic call
  for unity which extends to all people of faith to unify their efforts
  and concentrate on their common ground.
