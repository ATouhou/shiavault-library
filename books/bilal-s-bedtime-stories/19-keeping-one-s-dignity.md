Keeping One's Dignity
=====================

Mufazzal lbn Quais was a good and pious man. He was very poor. He had
borrowed some money from friends. He could not repay them. Therefore he
always remained worried. He wanted to find a way that he could be free
from debts.

Once he went to the great Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq. In the presence of the
Imam he complained about his creditors and began telling a list of his
problems. In the end he said he was poor. He did not know how to
overcome poverty. He requested Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq to pray for his
welfare.

On hearing the sad story of a worried man the Imam promptly ordered his
servant to bring a purse of money. When the servant brought the money it
was given to Mufazzal. Imam said that the purse contained four hundred
dinars which would help him to solve his problem of poverty.

Mufazzal was ashamed to accept the generosity. He said that he has not
come with the aim of seeking assistance from the Imam, but only for his
blessings and prayer.

Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq replied, “Mufazzal, I shall also pray for you. More
than that, I will ask you never to speak out your hardship to others. If
you do so, the first impression people get of you is that you are not
good enough to earn bread for yourself and your family. Thus you lower
your position in the eyes of others and also loose your dignity.”

Mufazzal went away from the Imam grateful for the help and good advice.

A fool's mind is at the mercy of his tongue and a wise man's tongue is
under control of his mind”. - Imam Ali (a)
