Tawheed (oneness)
=================

You know very well every creation as a point of origin. If someone asks
you, who conceived you? You will say your parents. If he as ks again,
who conceived your parents? You will reply, their parents. This process
of question and answer will not finish until it reaches back to the
beginning of creation. You have to believe in such an essence who is the
creator of the whole universe, but has no creator.

The whole universe is dependent upon Him, but He is not dependent upon
anyone. He is unique in His oneness. He is completely unlike any of His
creation. If a single attribute of creation is found in Him, then He
will also become a creation in need of a creator which is impossible. He
cannot be compared. He is creator of all. There is no creator other than
Him. This belief is called tawheed (oneness).

Hz Ameerul Momineen (as) said, " The beginning of religion is to gain
the marifat of Allah." It means before believing in tawheed, it is
compulsory to gain the marifat of Allah. Unless and until we know who is
that essence in which we believe and worship, our beliefs based upon
ignorance are completely worthless. Believing in tawheed and worshiping
blindly is like shooting an arrow in the dark. Concerning the marifat of
Allah, ever y child is aware of the fact that every thing is recognized
through its attributes. In the same way, Allah is recognized through His
attributes. Every attribute of Allah is revealed through Masoomeen
(as).

The only way of recognizing Allah is by recognizing Masoomeen (as).
This is why Masoomeen (as) said, "Our marifat is the marifat of Allah."
Anyone who is negligent in the marifat of Muhammad (saw) wa Aal e
Muhammad (as) has not recognized Allah.

Such a person s tawheed, beliefs, iman, acts, etc will be false. It
should also be clear that mentioning any attribute of Allah other than
through Masoomeen (as) is real shirk. We call Him through different
attributes. For example, Khaliq (creator), Raziq (Sustainer), Ghaffar (
All Forgiving),

Alam (All Knowing), Qadir (Subduer). These attributes are Masoomeen
(as) which act as a wasila (source) between us and Allah. It is not
possible to believe in Allah and worship Him without recognizing the
wasila (source). As Allah Himself has ordered us in Quran,

"If you wish to consult with Allah, then you mu st find a specific
wasila (source)." If we reach at this specific wasila, then we have
reached Allah. This is the pure tawheed. W hen Masoomeen (as) were
asked,

"W hat is the meaning of Allah being All Knowing and Subduer?"
Masoomeen (as) replied," It means Allah created such essence who is All
Knowing and Subduer." Without recognizing this essence, believing Allah
is All Knowing and Subduer is absolutely worthless.

**Shirk**

Allah has promised in Quran that every sin can be forgiven except for
shirk.

So now it is wajib (compulsory) upon every momin to know what is shirk.
It is not possible to get away from shirk if you do not understand what
it is. The meaning of shirk is to include another in the attributes of
Allah.

1. Believing Allah and His creation have the same attributes is called
shirk fil safaat (shirk in attributes).
2. Believing the acts of Allah are done with the help of another is
shirk fil fail (shirk in acts).
3. Believing there is another whom we should obey or believing ther e
is another who has the same rights over us as Allah and believing their
obedienc e is wajib (compulsory) upon us is shirk fil amr (shirk in
obedience).

Now because:

1. Every attribute of Allah is revealed through Muhammad (saw) wa Aal e
Muhammad (as).
2. Every act which we associate to Allah is fulfilled through Masoomeen
(as).
3. The orders of Allah and His obedience were revealed through
Masoomeen (as). Therefore obedience to Them is the same as obedience to
Allah.

The complete explanation of shirk is this:

"Believing Muhammad (saw) wa Aal e Muhammad (as) are human like us. The
attributes, acts, and obedience of Allah can be revealed from other than
Masoomeen (as)."

We have briefly explained the truth regarding shirk. As your knowledge
and intellect grows, you will be able to look around yourself and
inshaAllah will immediately recognize those who are practically
committing shirk. I am sure in order to protect yourself from shirk you
will keep yourself far from such people and places. InshaAllah.

**Adl (justice)**

Second basic belief of Shia religion is adl. The opposite of adl is
zulm (oppression). The meaning of adl is to put everything in its
correct place. For example, a cap can be worn on the head. So the cap
will always be on one s head even if it is very ordinary. The same way
the place for shoes are one s feet. It does not matter how expensive
they are. They will always be on one s feet. If someone acts against it,
then it is called zulm (oppression). The belief of Shia is that Allah is
adil (one who does justice). He can never be an oppressor. No attribute
of oppression can be associated with Him because He is free from every
fault.

If you look around the whole universe, you will see every thing is
dependent upon adl. Allah has given every particle a particular place.

If a single particle changes its place slightly, then the whole system
of the universe will be destroyed. The foundation of beliefs and acts is
also adl. If you lower the status of Muhammad (saw) wa Aal e Muhammad
(as) and give others a higher status than Them, this is the true zulm
(oppression). If someone claims to be Shia and still does these acts,
then in reality he is destroying the Shia religion.

**Nabuwiat (prophet hood)**

Allah wants to send ever lasting blessings upon His creation, but adl
demands only those who prove to be deserving of such blessings will
receive them. One who does not deserve cannot receive such blessings
because it goes against adl. When one becomes deserving of the blessings
of Allah, only then will he fulfill his purpose of creation.

That is the love and marifat (recognition) of Ahlul Bayt (as). It is
compulsory to consistently inform the whole of humanity what is their
purpose of creation. In this way, they will not have any excuse. Allah
Himself cannot come to the creation. Therefore He created
representatives. As His representatives, They convey His message to His
creation. This process is called nabuwiat (prophet hood), and the
representatives are called prophets. We are the nation of Hz Muhammad
Mustafa (saw) bin Abdullah (as) bin Hz Abdul Muttalib (as).

**Description of Nabuwiat (prophet hood)**

Naba is an Arabic word meaning "news . The word "nabi is derived from
naba.

A prophet is one who receives messages from Allah and then conveys
those messages to the creation. Unless you understand naba, you cannot
understand nabuwiat.

What is naba?

The explanation of this word can be found in Quran, Sura Naba ayah 1-3:
Of what do they ask one another? About the great news, about which they
differ?"

1. In Usool e Kafi, Imam Jafar Sadiq (as) said, "That great news is
wilayat of Ameerul Momineen (as)."

2. Imam Muhammad Baqir (as) said, " This ayah was revealed for Ameerul
Momineen (as). Ameerul Momineen (as) use to say,"No ayah of Allah is
greater than Me. No news is greater than Me."

In or der to explain this in clearer terms, we will mention a few
hadiths . From these hadiths, you will be able to see the purpose of
establishing the process of prophet hood was only for the introduction
of Ahlul Bayt (as).

1. Imam Jafar Sadiq (as) said, "Every prophet introduced Our marifat
(recognition) and proved Our greatness over others."

2. Imam Jafar Sadiq (as) said, "Our wilayat is the wilayat of Allah.
Allah sent every prophet with the condition of Our wilayat."

3. Ameerul Momineen (as) said, "I am the one whom all the nations were
ordered to obey."

4. Imam Musa Kazim (as) said, " Allah has written in all the books of
prophets regarding the wilayat e Ali (as)."

Our greatest proof is Sura Maida ayah 67. This ayah was revealed in
Ghadir Khum. RasoolAllah (saw) fulfilled the orders of Allah by
announcing the wilayat of Moula Ali (as) in the gathering of 124.000
companions. RasoolAllah (saw) raised the hands of Moula Ali (as) and
said, " Mun kunto Moula o fahaza Aliyun Moula ". Whomsoever I am Moula
(master) to Ali (as) is also Moula (master) to.

Quran says,"O Messenger! Deliver what has been revealed to you from
your Lord; and if you do it not, then you have not delivered any of His
message".

You should remember the prophet hood of all prophets is dependent upon
the prophet hood of our Prophet (saw). Our Prophet (saw) s prophet hood
is dependent upon the wilayat of Moula Ali (as). Even though RasoolAllah
(saw) had conveyed the whole religion to the people, if He had not
announced the wilayat of Moula Ali (as), His prophet hood was in
danger.

This ayah alone is enough proof that the only purpose of prophet hood
was to introduce the wilayat of Moula Ali (as).

**Imamate**

The most important principle of Shia religion is the belief in imamate.
Because of this belief, Shia religion is recognized separately from
other religions. Imamate is the greatest designation/title from all
other designations. The wilayat of Allah is revealed from imamate.

**The difference between nabi and imam**

A prophet is one who shows the right path. Imam is one who takes you to
the right path. This is the reason on the day of judgment all of
humanity will be called with their Imams and not prophets. Allah has
mentioned this in Sura Bani Israel ayah 71: "Remember that day when all
of humanity will be called with their Imams."

It is very important people recognize that Imam which is from Allah. If
he chooses a false imam, then he will remain in jahannum for all of
eternity. This is why RasoolAllah (saw) said, " One who dies without
recognizing his Imam (who is from Allah) dies the death of jahil
(ignorant), kafir (disbeliever), and nifaq (hypocrite)."

The number of Imams (as) has been twelve from the beginning until the
end. In Arabic twelve is called ithna ashari. This is why we call
ourselves Ithna Ashari (believers of twelve Imams as). No one can
increase or decrease from the number of twelve. Anyone who does this is
out of the Shia religion.

Here are the sacred names of the twelve Imams (as). You must always
remember Them.

First imam: Ameerul Momineen Ali (as) ibn Abi Talib (as)
Second imam: Imam Hasan (as) bin Ali (as)
T hird imam: Imam Hussain (as) bin Ali (as)
Fourth imam: Imam Ali (as) bin Hussain ( as) (Zainul Abideen)
Fifth imam: Imam Muhammad (as) bin Ali (as) (Baqir)
Sixth imam: Imam Jafar (as) bin Muhammad (as) (Sadiq)
Seventh imam: Imam Musa (as) bin Jafar (as) (Kazim)
Eighth imam: Imam Ali (as) bin Musa (as) (Reza)
Ninth imam: Imam Muhammad (as) bin Ali (as) (Taqi)
Tenth imam: Imam Ali (as) bin Muhammad (as) (Naqi)
Eleventh imam: Imam Hasan (as) bin Ali (as) ( Askari)


**Twelfth Imam (ajf)**

This is the imam where the number twelve becomes complete, and the
promise of Allah is fulfilled by this Imam (ajf). As Allah says in
Quran, " Allah will complete His noor even though the kufr
(disbelievers) dislike it." This is that noor in whose waiting we are
alive. He is our Imam Zamana (ajf). His marifat is wajib (compulsory)
upon us, and on the day of judgment it is He whom we will be called
with.

Imam (ajf) s sacred name is "Meem Ha Meem Dal". Because it is not
allowed to call His name during His ghayabat (occultation), this is why
we call Him with the names of Qaim Aal e Muhammad (ajf), Baqiyatullah
(ajf), Hz Hujjat (ajf), and Hz Sahib ul Zaman (ajf). Imam (ajf) s father
is Imam Hasan Askari (as). Imam (ajf) s mother is Narjis Khatoon (as).
Imam (ajf) s noor came into this world on the 15th of Shabaan 254 Hijra.
There are some narrations which say 255 and some which say it was 256.
Because the government of that time were the worst enemies of Ahlul Bayt
( as),

they wanted to assassinate Imam Zamana (ajf). This is why His zahoor
(revealment) was kept hidden from the people. Only a few select momin
were able to see Imam Zamana (ajf). After the martyrdom of the 11th Imam
(as), Imam Zamana (ajf) went into ghayabat (occultation), but He was in
contact with some specific momineen. This period was 69 years long.

This is called Ghayabat e Sughra (lesser occultation). In 329 Hijra,
Imam (ajf) went into His full ghayabat (occultation). Imam (ajf) is not
in contact with anyone. In the last letter written by Imam (ajf), He has
pointed out those people who claim to be in contact with Him during His
ghayabat ( occultation). "Anyone who claims to see Me before the cry
from the heavens and appearance of the dajjal is the most debased liar
and accuser against Us."

This time is called the time of complete ghayabat (occultation). No one
knows when Imam Zamana (ajf) will reappear. Imam (ajf) will reappear by
the or der of Allah. He will fill this world with adl (justice) as it
was previously filled by evil and tyranny.

**Rajat (return)**

Believing in rajat (return) is one of the basic beliefs of the Shia
religion. According to the sayings of Masoom (as), one who does not
believe in the rajat (return) has nothing to do with the Shia religion.
The description of rajat is after the completion of the imamate of Imam
Zamana (ajf),

the period between the time of the prophet hood of RasoolAllah (saw)
and the appearance of Imam Zamana (ajf) will be finished. After this the
time of the day of judgment will begin. This time will be extremely
long. All of the Imams (as) one by one will return back to this earth
and rule throughout the world. W hen our Imam Zamana (ajf) will
reappear, that will be the time of His imamate, but during the time of
rajat, He will again return to rule throughout the world for an
extensive period of time.

**Belief of Infallibility**

This is a basic belief of Shia religion. Infallibility means no prophet
or imam can commit any sin or mistake. If prophets or imams had not been
infallible, then the whole religion of Allah would be suspicious. In
that case,

there would be no authenticity in the words of the prophets. He is an
example for humanity. If a prophet commits a sin, then this will become
a sunnah for their followers. It will become compulsory upon their ummah
(nation) to commit sins. Then the religion of Allah will become a joke.
It should be remembered there are two types of infallibility. One is
jabr i (forced). The other is iktiari (optional). Infallibility of the
angels is jabri (forced). They do not have the free will to decide
whether or not to obey or disobey the orders of Allah.

The infallibility of Masoomeen (as) is not jabri (forced). It is
iktiari (optional). They do not commit any sins even though They have
free will and the option to do so. This is the reason Their status is
the highest from all of the creation of Allah. Infallibility is a
compulsory aspect of nabuwiat (prophet hood) and imamate. Without
infallibility, nabuwiat and imamate become worthless.

**Special characteristics of prophets and imams**

1. Nabuwiat and imamate is from Allah. It is impossible to be a prophet
or imam simply by doing hard work.

2. A prophet and imam are prophets and imams from the beginning of
their creation. It is not as if they are prophet or imam for a short
time or after they reach a certain age they then become a prophet or
imam.

3. The forefathers of the prophets and aimmah until Hz Adam (as) can
never be kafir (disbeliever), mushrik (polytheist), or sinful.

4. Prophets and imams do not have any apparent or hidden faults.
Neither can they possess such characteristics which the people find
offensive like blindness, deafness, mute, etc.

5. They are free from all sins, faults, and mistakes.

6. Prophets and imams can perform miracles. This is their personal act
which Allah has blessed them with. The meaning of moajiza is when the
nature of a thing is changed. For example, the nature of stones is to be
silent. If a prophet or imam order s them to speak, then they will begin
to speak. This is a moajiza.

**Day of Judgment**

The word qiyamat is used on two occasions. One is the time of qiyamat
which is rajat (return). The other is the day of qiyamat when jannah and
jahannum will be distributed.
