Lesson One Hundred Thirty Nine: Mystery Of Mountains!
=====================================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ وَتَّدَ بِالصُّخُورِ مَيَدانَ اَرْضِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Shaking and movement of the Earth is prevented by mountains.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Nowadays, it has been confirmed that just as the gravity of the moon
effects the ebb and flow of seas (producing high tides twice a day,
raising the water level one meter or more and even 15 meters in some
parts) it also causes up and down movement of 30 centimeters in the
solid crust of the earth.

But solidity of earth’s crust due to existence of mountains, the roots
of which are connected to each other creating a stabilizing network
round the earth, prevents any noticeable movement.

Just imagine ! If there were no mountains and earth’s crust was not
solid, and in a state of continual flux and reflux, what would happen to
our quiet and peace on this earth?

This is just another example of Islamic leaders mentioning scientific
facts 14 centuries ago which science has discovered much later.
