240. Mohammed Bin Aslam al-Tūsi
-------------------------------

Shaykh al-Tūsi numbered him as one of the companions of Imām al-Ridā,
peace be on him.[[3]](#_ftn1216) He was one of those who narrated the
tradition better known as *al-Silsila al-Dhahabiya* (the Golden Chain).

241. Mohammed Bin Ismā'il Bin Buzaygh'
--------------------------------------

He was the retainer of Abū Ja'far al-Mansūr and was among the righteous,
trustworthy Shi'ites.[[4]](#_ftn1217) Imām al-Ridā, peace be on him,
said to him: "Surely, Allah is at the doors of the unjust. Allah
enlightens proof for (some people) and makes them powerful in the
country in order that He may, through them, repel (evil) from His
friends and set right the affairs of the Muslims. The believer seeks
refuge in them from tribulation, to them flee the possessors of needs
from among our

Shi'ites, and through them Allah drives away fear from the believer in
the land of the oppressive. They are entrusted by Allah over His earth.
It is they in whose desire there will be light on the Day of
Resurrection, and their light shines towards the inhabitants of the
heavens just as pearls shine towards the people of the earth. It is they
through whose light the Day of Resurrection will be shinning. By Allah,
they have been created for the Garden, and the Garden has been created
for them. I congratulate them (on that). If any of you wishes, he will
attain all of this."

Mohammed asked him, saying: "Through what, may Allah make me your
ransom?"

He, peace be on him, replied: "He is with them, namely with the
oppressive government. Therefore, he pleases us through pleasing the
believers from among our Shi'ites, so be one of them,
Mohammed.[[1]](#_ftn1218)"

Al-Husayn b. Khālid al-Sayrafi reported, saying: "We were with Imām
al-Ridā, peace be on him, and we were a group (of men). Mohammed b.
Ismā'il b. Buzaygh was mentioned, and the Imām, peace be on him, said to
his companions: 'I would like that there is the like of him among
you.[[2]](#_ftn1219) '"

He (i.e. Mohammed b. Ismā'il) compiled a group of books of which are the
following:

A. Kitāb Thawāb al-Hajj (the Book of Reward of Pilgrimage).

B. Kitāb al-Hajj (the Book of Pilgrimage).[[3]](#_ftn1220)

He asked Imām al-Jawād, peace be on him, to order one of his shirts to
be brought to him, that he might use it as a shroud for him. The Imām
sent him a shirt. Then Mohammed asked the Imām: "What shall I do with
the shirt?" "Remove its buttons," replied the
Imām.[[4]](#_ftn1221)"

extremism and sent someone to kill him. When they saw that he prayed,
they refrained from (killing) him. Ibn al-Ghadā'iri said: "His tradition
is pure; there is no corruption in it. I did not find any of the things
ascribed to him make soul confuse except some pages on explaining the
essence *(bātin)*, which does not befit his traditions. I think that
these (pages) were fabricated against him, and I have seen a letter
written to al-Qumays by Abū al-Hasan b. Mohammed, peace be on him,
regarding his being innocent of defamation.[[1]](#_ftn1222)"

Shaykh al-Tūsi numbered him as one of the companions of Imām al-Ridā,
peace be on him.[[2]](#_ftn1223) He (Mohammed b. Orma) wrote a large
group of books, and his books are correct, except a book attributed to

confused.[[3]](#_ftn1224)

247. Mohammed Bin Jumhūr
------------------------

Al-Najāshi said: " The traditions of Mohammed b. Jumhūr al-Qummi are
weak and his creed is corrupt. Something was said concerning him and

his traditions are corrupt. He did not write his traditions. I have seen
some of his poetry in which he has made lawful what Allah, the Great and
Almighty, had made unlawful.[[2]](#_ftn1230)"

house in Kufā. Mohammed b. Sinān went in to us and Safwān said: 'Surely
this (Mohammed) b. Sinān was about to be confused more than one time. We
related to him until he followed us.'" This is evidence for that he had
confusion and then he became free from it. He compiled books of which

He is a liar and deviated from the Truth. He lied to Imām al-Ridā, peace

"Yūnus, do you not know that Mohammed b. Furāt lies to me?" "May Allah
drive him away and make him miserable!" said Yūnus. The Imām, peace be
on him, said: "Allah has done that toward him. May Allah make him taste
the heat of the iron as He made those before him who lied to us taste
(the heat of the iron). Yūnus, I said that (bout him) that you may warn
my companions against him, order them to curse and renounce him, for
Allah has renounced him.[[3]](#_ftn1280)"

'Ali b. Ismā'il al-Maythami narrated on the authority of Imām al-Ridā,
peace be on him, who said: "Mohammed b. Furāt hurt me; may Allah hurt
him and let him taste the heat of the iron! He hurt me; may Allah hurt
him! Abū al-Khattāb, may Allah curse him, did not hurt Mohammed b.
Ja'far, peace be on him, as Mohammed b. Furāt hurt me. No Khatābi lied
to us as Mohammed b. Furāt did. By Allah, Allah makes him who lies to us
taste the heat of the iron.[[4]](#_ftn1281)"

knowledge and reverential fear, and attained the highest rank due to the

Imāmate of al-Ridā) in Kūfa, so I said to him: 'Why have you hastened?'
'I have concerning that (i.e. concerning the Imāmate of al-Ridā) a proof
and knowledge,' he replied."

Al-Husayn (b. 'Amr b. Yazid) said: "I asked Imām al-Ridā, peace be on
him: 'Have your father passed away?' 'Yes,' he replied, 'by Allah, I am
in the position where Allah's Messenger, may Allah bless him and his
family, and the Commander of the faithful, peace be on him, were. Who is
happier than me in the subsistence of my father?' Then he said: 'Allah,
the Blessed and Exalted, says*: And the foremost are the foremost, these
are they who are drawn nigh* (to Allah). Those who know the Imāmate when
the Imām appears.' Then he said: 'What has your brother done?' 'Who is
it?' I asked. 'Muqātil b. Muqātil,' he answered, 'the one with flat
face, long beard, bent nose.'

hundred times.' Then I told him about what the Imām, peace be on him,
said."

I be your ransom, by Allah, I was nicknamed with this (name) when I was
young and I am in the Book." The Imām, peace be on him, smiled at
him.[[4]](#_ftn1346)

his authority. He narrated on the authority of Imām al-Kāzim and Imām 
al-Ridā, peace be on them. He was the agent of Imām al-Ridā and among
his close companions. 'Abd al-'Aziz b. al-Muhtadi said to Imām al-Ridā,
peace be on him: "I am unable to meet you every time, so from whom shall
I take the principle features of my religion?" "Take them from Yūnus b.
'Abd al-Rahmān," replied the Imām, peace be on him.[[1]](#_ftn1362)

The narrators said: "Imām al-Ridā guaranteed Yūnus the Garden three
times.[[2]](#_ftn1363)" He, peace be on him, said concerning him: "Yūnus
b. 'Abd al-Rahmān is like Sulaymān (Solomon) in his
time.[[3]](#_ftn1364)"

Yūnus (b. 'Abd al-Rahmān) narrated, saying: "Abū al-Hasan Mūsā died and
all those who believed in his Imāmate had a lot of money, and this is
why they said that he was the Imām who would return, and that they
denied his death. (For example), Ziyād al-Qandi had seventy thousand
dinars; 'Ali b. Abū Hamza had thirty thousand dinars." He (Yūnus b. 'Abd
al-Rahmān) said: "I saw that and the truth manifested itself to me. I
was fully aware of the affairs of Abū al-Hasan, peace be on him, so I
spoke to the people and summoned them (to follow) him." He said: "They
(i.e. Ziyād al-Qandi and 'Ali b. Abū Hamza) sent for me and said to me:
'Do not summon (the people to follow) this (i.e. Abū al-Hasan). If you
want money, we will enrich you.' They guaranteed (me) ten thousand
dinars." Yūnus said: "So I said to them: 'We have been told on the
authority of the Truthful (Imāms), peace be on them, that they said: 'If
innovations appear, then it is incumbent on scholar to show his
knowledge. If he does not do this, the light of faith will be taken from
him.' I will never leave struggle *(jihād)* and Allah's command.
Accordingly, they opposed me and showed enmity toward
me.[[4]](#_ftn1365)"

Many traditions have been reported from the Imāms of guidance concerning
praising and lauding, and that he was one of those who had

abundant reverential fear and among the scholars of the family of
Mohammed, may Allah bless him and his family. Besides these accounts,
there are others in which he has been dispraised. These accounts are
either fabricated or they have been mentioned in order to decrease his
importance during that time when the Shi'ites suffered from bitter kinds
of tragedies and ordeals.

Yūnus compiled a large group of books most of which is on jurisprudence
and some of which is on interpretation of the Holy Qur'ān. He, may Allah
have mercy on him, died in Medina and was buried beside the grave of the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family. Imām al-Ridā, peace be on
him, praised him, saying: "Look at what Allah has completed for Yūnus:
His grave is in Medina by (the grave of) Allah's Messenger, may Allah
bless him and his family."

367. Yūnus Bin Ya'qūb al-Bujayli, al-Dihni
------------------------------------------

He is trustworthy. In his book *al-Risāla al-'Adadiya*, al-Shaykh
al-Mufid regarded him as one of the prominent jurists and leading
persons from whom people took the lawful, the unlawful, religious
opinions and precepts, whom none is able to impugn, and to whom there is
no way to dispraise. He narrated on the authority of Imām al-Kāzim and
Imām  al-Ridā, peace be on them.[[1]](#_ftn1366)

Yūnus died in Medina, so Abū al-Hasan al-Ridā, peace be on him, sent him
scent for embalming, a shroud, and all the necessary things. Then he
ordered his followers, those of his father, and of his grandfather to
attend his funeral, and he said to them: "This (Yūnus) was a follower of
Abū 'Abd Allah, peace be on him, and he lived in Iraq." And he said to
them: "Be present at the (cemetery of) al-Baqi'. If the Medinans said to
you that he was an Iraqi and that they would not bury him at the
(cemetery of) al-Baqi', then say to them: 'This is a follower of Abū
'Abd Allah, peace be on him, and he lived in Iraq. If you prevent us
from burying him at the (cemetery of) al-Baqi', then we will prevent you
from burying your followers at it.' He was buried

at the (cemetery of) al-Baqi'.[[1]](#_ftn1367) Imām al-Ridā, peace be on
him, ordered his grave to be showered with water for a month or forty
days.[[2]](#_ftn1368) May Allah have mercy on Yūnus, for he was
successful through his showing friendship and love toward the members of
the House *ahl al-Bayt*, peace be on them.

With him we will end our speech about some companions of Imām al-Ridā,
peace be on him. It is worth mentioning that the Imām's companions were
a group of the eminent men of his time, and that they were a group of
authors, narrators, and jurists, so they enriched the Imāmi 
jurisprudence through their recording the verdicts of Imām al-Ridā,
peace be on him.
