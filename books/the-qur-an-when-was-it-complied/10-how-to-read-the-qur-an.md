'The Qur'an descended with sadness. Therefore, if you read it then weep
and if you cannot weep then feign weeping. 139

'Beautify the Qur'an with your voices for the beautiful voice increases
the beauty of the Qur'an.' 140

'The Qur'an descended with sadness so recite it with sadness.' 142

And related from Imam al-Saadiq (a) who said:

'The Messenger of Allah (S) said: 'Recite ye the Qur'an with the voice
and tone of the Arabs and avoid the tone of those who practise foul
deeds and great sins. There will come a people after me who will sing
the Qur'an in the style of popular song or the style of the monks or as
a lamentation . . .their hearts will be tried as will those who are
enamoured by what they do.' 143

Also related from him (a):

'The Prophet (S) said: 'Everything has an adornment and the adornment
of the Qur'an is the beautiful voice.' 144

'Learn ye the Arabic language for it is the speech of Allah with which
he addressed his creation and spoke with it to the ancients.' 145

It is related that Imam al-Kaadhem (a) had a beautiful voice and that
he excelled in the recital of the Qur'an. It is related that Imam Zayn
el-Abidin (a) was reading the Qur'an and a passer by heard him he would
be astounded at the beauty of his voice.' 146

Related from Imam al-Ridha (a) who said:

'The Messenger of Allah said: 'Beautify the Qur'an with your voices for
the beautiful voice can only enhance the beauty of the Qur'an.' 147

**The Memorisation of the Qur'an**

The Messenger of Allah (S) said:

'The number of stations in the garden of Paradise corresponds to the
number of verses of the Qur'an. When someone who knows the Qur'an enters
the garden he will be told: 'Recite and for every verse ascend a
station.' There will be no station higher than he who has memorised the
entire Qur'an.' 148

Related from Imam al-Saadiq (a) who said:

'The person who has memorised the Qur'an and acts in accordance with it
will be counted among the noble and pious.' 149

He (a) also said:

'How important is the Qur'an! Each verse and each chapter of the Qur'an
will arrive on the day of resurrection and will rise one thousand
stations illuminating the garden

and will say: If only you had memorised me I would have brought you
here. 150

Also related from Imam al-Saadiq (a):

'The person who takes pains to memorise the Qur'an through his own
labours although his memory be weak will gain twice the reward.' 151

Also related from him (a):

'Whoever forgets a chapter of the Qur'an will see that chapter in the
most beautiful of aspects and the most lofty of stations in the garden.
When he sees it he will say: What are you? How beautiful you are. I wish
you were for me. The chapter will say: Do you not recognise me? I am
such and such a chapter of the Qur'an. If you had not forgotten me I
would have raised you to this station.' 152

Related from Imam Kaadhem (a):

'The stations of the garden of Paradise are the same number as the
verses of the Qur'an and it will be said: Recite and ascend. So he will
read and ascend.' 153

**Listening to the Qur'an**

The Messenger of Allah (S) said:

'The evils of this world will be repelled from one who listens to the
Qur'an and the calamity of the next world will be repelled from the
reciter of the Qur'an. Listening to a single verse of the book of Allah
is better than a great amount of gold, and reciting a verse from the
book of Allah

al-A'mal: p.129 in which is found: 'The degrees of Paradise are equal to
the number of Qur'anic verses. The reciter of the Qur'an will be told
'recite and ascend!'

is better than what is below the heavenly throne to the nether regions
of the Earth.' 154

He (S) also said:

'The reciter of the Qur'an and the one who listens are equal in their
reward.' 155

Related from Imam Zayn al-'Abidin (a) who said:

'Whoever listens to a letter from the book of Allah without reading it
will revive the reward of a good deed and an evil deed of his will be
erased and he will rise a degree in station. Whoever reads the book of
Allah while looking at it in other than during the ritual prayers, Allah
will write for him for every letter a good deed and erase an evil deed,
and raise him a degree in station. Whoever learns a letter from the book
of Allah, Allah will write in his record ten good deeds, and erase ten
evil deeds and raise him ten degrees. I do not say: For every verse but
for every letter. Whoever reads a letter while sitting in prayer, Allah
will write in his record fifty good deeds and erase fifty evil deeds and
will raise him fifty degrees. Whoever reads a letter while standing in
prayer, Allah will write in his record one-hundred good deeds and erase
one-hundred of his evil deeds and raise him one-hundred degrees in
station. Whoever completes a recitation of the book of Allah his wish
will be granted sooner or later.' 156

Imam Saadiq (a) was asked:

'Is it incumbent upon one who hears someone reciting the Qur'an to
listen and pay heed to him?' He said: 'Yes, If the Qur'an is recited
near you, you should listen to it.' 157

**Abandoning the Qur'an**

The Messenger of Allah (S) said:

'There will come a time for my nation when nothing will remain of the
Qur'an but its script.' 158

He (S) also said in his will:

'O 'Ali, In Hell there is a millstone of iron with which the heads of
the criminal reciters and scholars will be pulverised.' 159

He (S) also said:

'Many a reciter of the Qur'an and the Qur'an will curse him.' 160

He (S) also said:

'Whoever learns the Qur'an then forgets it on purpose will meet Allah
Almighty on the day of resurrection in chains and for every (forgotten)
verse there will be a serpent assigned to oversee him. Whoever learns
the Qur'an and does not act accordingly preferring to it the love of
this world and its vain ornament will deserve the contempt of Allah and
will be in the lowest level (of hell) â€¦ ..'

He (S) also said:

'Whoever reads the Qur'an desiring reputation and showing off for the
people will meet Allah on the day of resurrection with his face in
darkness with no flesh on his face. Whoever reads the Qur'an and does
not act accordingly will be brought before Allah on the day of
resurrection blind. He will say: 'O Lord, why have I been brought before
you blind when I used to see?' He will be told: 'This is the way you
approached our verses so that you forgot them, so likewise you are today
forgotten.' Then he will be ordered into the fire. Whoever reads the
Qur'an

desiring reputation, or as a way to argue with the foolish people or to
impress the scholars, or seeking through it the things of this world
will have his bones scattered by the Almighty on the day of resurrection
and no-one in the fire shall have a worse punishment than him and he
will be spared from no kind of torment because of the intensity of the
anger and contempt that Allah has for him.' 161

He (S) also said:

'The marks of a tyrant are four in number: Disobedience of the Most
Merciful, causing hurt to neighbours, hatred of the Qur'an, and nearness
to wrongdoing.' 162

Related from Imam Saadiq (a) who said:

'There are three things which complain to Allah the Almighty: A
dilapidated mosque which is not prayed in by its people, a learned
person in the midst of the ignorant, and a copy of the Qur'an left
unread on a shelf gathering dust.' 163

**The Qur'an and the People of the Prophet's** Household

The Most noble Prophet, Muhammad (S) said:

'Who loveth Allah then let him love me, and who loveth me let him love
my family. I leave behind with you the two momentous things; the book of
Allah and my family and who loveth my family then let him love the
Qur'an.' 164

He (S) also said:

' . . .they (the people of the prophet's household) are with the Qur'an
and the Qur'an is with them. They will not

deviate from it until they reach me at the sacred well (in Paradise).'
165

He (S) also said:

'Ali is with the Qur'an and the Qur'an is with him. They will never
diverge until they reach me at the sacred well.' 166

He (S) also said:

'Allah Almighty has favoured the Qur'an and the knowledge of its
interpretation and His mercy and divine favour for the allies of
Muhammad and his pure family and those who oppose their enemies.' 167

Related from Umm Salmah who said:

'I heard the Messenger of Allah (S) saying during the illness which
ended in his death and when the room was full of his companions: 'O
people, shortly I will die and I will be taken away and I have
discharged my duty that I leave with you the two momentous things: the
book of my Lord and my family my household. Then he took the hand of
'Ali (a) and said: ' 'Ali is with the Qur'an and the Qur'an is with
'Ali - two successors of insight they will never depart from one another
until they reach me at the sacred well' 168

Imam 'Ali (a) said:

'Allah Almighty purified us and restrained us from sin and made us
witnesses over his creation and his proof on the earth. He made us be
with the Qur'an and the Qur'an with us. We will never depart from it and
it will never depart from us.' 169

'We the people of the household cannot be compared to anyone. The
Qur'an was revealed amongst us and the mine of the prophetic mission is
amongst us.' 170

Imam Zayn al-'Abidin (a) said:

'Our similitude in the book of Allah is as a niche in which there is a
lamp. In the lamp there is a glass and the glass is Muhammad (S) as if
he was a pearly star lit from a blessed tree. He said: 'Ali is its oil
neither of the East nor of the West. Its oil almost illuminates although
no flame has touched it. The Qur'an is light upon light. Allah guides to
His light who He wishes, He guides to our allegiance whoever He loves.'
171

Related from Imam Baaqir (a) regarding Allah's words:

{ then ask the people of al-Dhikr if you do not know.} 172
He said: 'al-Dhikr is the Qur'an and we are its people.' 173

Also related from Imam Baaqir (a):

'The Qur'an was sent down in four quarters; a quarter about us, a
quarter about our enemies, a quarter about injunctions and laws, and a
quarter traditions and parables. We have the noble parts of the Qur'an.'
174

He (a) also said:

'The Messenger of Allah (S) said: 'I am the first to go before The
Almighty on the day of resurrection along with His book and the people
of my household. Then will come my nation, then I will ask them what
they did with the book of Allah and the people of my household.' 175

{We will settle your affairs O ye two momentous things.} 176 'The two
momentous things are the Qur'an and Us.' 177

He (a) also said:

'Allah has made our regency the axis of the Qur'an.' 178

He also said (to one of his followers):

'O Mufaddal, if our followers were to contemplate the Qur'an, they
would not doubt our virtue.' 179

He (a) also said:

'Allah has made our regency the axis of the Qur'an and that of all
books. The clear verses of the Qur'an revolve around it and through it
faith is made plain. The Messenger of Allah (S) ordered that the Qur'an
and the family of Muhammad (S) be followed saying in his final sermon:
'I leave amongst you the two momentous things - the greater and the
lesser. The greater thing is the book of my Lord and the lesser is the
people of my household so remember me through them for you will not
stray as long as you adhere to these two.' 180
