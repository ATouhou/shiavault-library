  Today's world, plagued by war and greed, and media are inundated by the
  issues pertaining to human rights. What is the position of the Islamic
  Sharia regarding The Human Rights, as they are understood
  internationally? Does the Islamic law adhere to The Human Rights? does
  it respect some of the decrees and reject others?Why? Does Islamic law
  reject The Human rights altogether? The present book does a magnificent
  job at offering a comprehensive, lengthy and thorough investigation to
  answer all the above questions.
