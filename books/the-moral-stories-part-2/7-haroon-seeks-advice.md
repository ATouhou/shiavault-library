Haroon Seeks Advice
===================

Bahlool had for a year left Baghdad and settled in Kufa. Thereafter he
returned to Baghdad and when met by Haroon, he asked him:

"Oh Bahlool! where have you been, I have been deeply keen of meeting
you?" In reply, Bahlool said: "But I have never remembered you at all."
To this Haroon responded:

"Let me hear some advice from you. Oh Bahlool." Bahlool said:

"Instead of hearing my words of advice, it would be better if you were
to look at the magnificent palaces and also to the graves in the
graveyard. Think of those palaces in which the kings of the past lived
with all the pomp and splendour. And also think of these graveyards
wherein the kings of the past are hidden beneath the earth.

One day you too are going to lie down in the grave. Therefore, fear
that day when you are going to stand before Allah and made to account
for your deeds. You would, because of your misdeeds, then look
bewildered and would cry whilst others because of their good deeds would
be smiling. Therefore, beware of your life after death." Hearing this
.Haroon wept with tears rolling down on his cheeks.

How the past rulers and kings passed away from this world unable to
defy death and leaving behind all their pomp and material possessions is
the best way of deriving moral lesson. How short was the span of their
lives during which they did what they liked irrespective of justice and
truth. Finally, they departed from this world to account for their
misdeeds.

"Where are the Amalekites and the sons of Amalekites? Where are the
Pharaohs? Where are the people of the cities of ar-Rass who killed the
prophets, destroyed the traditions of the divine messengers and revived
the traditions of the despots? Where are those who advanced with armies,
defeated thousands, mobilised forces and populated cities?"

(Nahjul Balagha sermon 182)

In his foregoina sermon. Ali b. Abi Talib (A.S.) advises us to dig into
the past history of those who ruled with arrogance and oppression and
draw lesson from their ultimate fate.

**BAHLOOL AND A TOURIST**

A tourist happened to come to Baghdad and by chance he also had an
opportunity of being present in the court of Haroon. He put forward
several questions on different topics but none of the people in the
court including the learned and the wise could give any acceptable
answer.

Haroon rather upset with this situation told his courtiers that he
would divert their belongings and wealth to that tourist if they did not
succeed in producing answers to his questions. So hearing, the courtiers
pleaded for 24 hours time which was acceded.

Oh retiring from the Royal Court, they got together to discuss how and
wherefrom to obtain the answers. One of them advised that no one would
be able to give the answers except Bahlool hence they went out to look
for him.

When found, they related to him of what had happened and told him; the
questions raised by the tourist and he agreed to come forward to the
court next day so as to face him and provide the right answers.

Next day Bahlool was present in the court and asked the tourist to
speak and raise his questions as he was prepared to answer them.

The tourist stood up and with his stick, drew a circle on the ground.
Instantly without any pause Bahlool came forward and drew a line across
dividing it into two parts.

The tourist again drew on the ground another circle and again Bahlool
immediately applied his stick and this time he drew two lines dividing
the circle into four parts, of which one part he described as a dry and
the remaining three parts as water.

Then again the tourist kept the back of his hand over the ground and
raised the fingers towards tne sky. Seeing this, Bahlool did the
opposite by keeping his fingers over the ground and raised the back of
his hand upwards towards the sky.

As a result the tourist praised Bahlool very much and told Haroon that
he needed to have such intelligent and learned people. Haroon then asked
him to explain what his aim and object was in raising the questions and
drawing the circles.

The tourist then explained that the drawing of a circle by him and line
dividing it into two by Bahlool was meant to convey that this world is
divided into two portions - the North and the South. Another circle
drawn and divided into four portions by Bahlool meant to point to
one-fourth land and remaining three-fourth of water in the world.

The placing of hand over the earth and raising the fingers upwards
meant the growing of grass and plants from earth. Bahlool by placing his
fingers down and raising the hand upwards pointed to the fact that the
plants needed rain and the rays of the sun.

Thus Bahlool proved, despite his simplicity and funny and insanely
ways, to be one of the most intelligent and learned persons of the
time.

Almighty Allah has mentioned about the people of intellect and reason
in high terms as per the following avat of the Holv Qura'n:

"He grants wisdom to whom He pleases, and whoever is granted wisdom, he
indeed is given a great good and none but men of understanding mind."
(2:269)
