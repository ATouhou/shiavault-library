Logic: A brief overview
=======================

Logic is the discipline of valid reasoning, inference and demonstration.
While many cultures have employed systems of reasoning, and logical
methods are evident in all human thought, logic descending from the
Greek tradition, particularly Aristotelian logic, impacted more on and
was further developed by Islamic logicians from the 8th till 14th
centuries.

"*Mantiq* " is the Arabic equivalent of "logic". It points to the
practice of defending the tenets of Islam through rational argument.
