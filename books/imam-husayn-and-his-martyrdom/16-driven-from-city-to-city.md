Driven from city to city
========================

Medina was the centre of Husayn's teaching. They made Medina impossible
for him. He left Medina and went to Mecca, hoping that he would be left
alone. But he was not left alone. The Syrian forces invaded Mecca. The
invasion was repelled, not by Husayn but by other people. For Husayn,
though the bravest of the brave, had no army and no worldly weapons.

His existence itself was an offence in the eyes of his enemies. His life
was in danger, and the lives of all those nearest and dearest to him. He
had friends everywhere, but they were afraid to speak out. They were not
as brave as he was. But in distant Kufa, a party grew up which said: “We
are disgusted with these events, and we must have Imam Husayn to take
asylum with us.”

So they sent and invited the Imam to leave Mecca, come to them, live in
their midst, and be their honoured teacher and guide. His father's
memory was held in reverence in Kufa. The Governor of Kufa was friendly,
and the people eager to welcome him. But alas, Kufa had neither
strength, nor courage, nor constancy. Kufa, geographically only 40 miles
from Karbala’, was the occasion of the tragedy of Karbala’. And now Kufa
is nearly gone, and Karbala’ remains as the lasting memorial of the
martyrdom.
