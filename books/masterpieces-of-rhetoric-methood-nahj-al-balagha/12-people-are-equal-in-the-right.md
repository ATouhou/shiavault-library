People Are Equal in the Right
=============================

After swearing alleginace to Imam, Talhah and Al-Zubayr complained to
him that he had not consulted them or sought their assistance in the
affairs:

You have been angry of a small matter and left aside big ones. Can you
tell me of a thing wherein you have a right of which I have deprived
you? Or a share which was due to you I have held away from you, or any
Muslim who has laid any claim before me and I have been unable to decide
it or been ignorant of it, or mistakened its category?

By Allah, I had no desire for the Caliphate nor any interest in
government, but you yourselves invited me to it. When the caliphate came
to me, I looked into the Book of Allah; I did not need your view or the
view point of anyone else, nor has I ignored any judgement so that I
ought to have consulted you or my Muslim brethren. If it were so I would
not have turned away from you or from others.

As regards to your mentioning question of equality, this is a matter in
which I have not taken a decision by my own opinion, nor have I done it
by my desire. But I have found, and you too found, that whatever the
prophet brought had been finished with. Therefor, I felt no need to turn
towards you about what Allah had been finished with its sectioning. May
Allah lead our hearts and yours towards righteousness and may He grant
us and you patience, May Allah have mercy on whom he seas a right and
helps to get it, or that who found a wrong and rejected it!
To the parties of (the Battle of) Al-Jamal

**A letter sent to Talhah, Al-Zubayer, and Aai’shah before the Battle
of Jamal**

From the slave of Allah, Ali, the Commander of the Faithful, to Talhah,
Al-Zubayer, you have known that I did not want the allegiance till I was
compelled to it; and both of you were among those who accepted my
homage. If you have paid homage obedi-ently, and if you have paid homage
to me reluctantly, you have certainly given me the excuse to deal with
you for action, by showing your obedience and concealing you
disobedience.

And you, o’ Talhah, chief of Muhajirin (immigrants), and you, o’
Zubaryer, the knight of Quraysh: your repulsing this mat-ter before
entering into it would have been easier than getting out of it after
having accepted it.

And you, o’ Aai’shah, you went out of your house disobeying Allah and
His messenger seeking a concern of whose responsibility you are free.
You claim that you want to reform peoples’ relations. Tell me what have
women to do with the leading of armies and challenging men!? You
requested, as you claimed, Uthman’s blood, and Uthman is one of Banu
Umayiah while you are from Taim.

Then, yesterday, you were saying before a group of the prophet’s
companions: “Kill Na’athal (i.e Uthman), may Allah kill him as he has
become a disbeliever!”, then you are, today, demanding his blood! Fear
Allah and return to your house, and drop your veil on yourself.
Wassalam.

**Come out of your Den**

His letter to Abu Musa Al-Ashari, his Governor of kufa, when he learned
that he was dissuading the people of Kufa joining the battle of Jamal.

From the slave of Allah, Amir Al-Mu’minin to Abdullah bin Qays:

Now, I have come to know of words uttered by you which go in your
favour as well as against you. So, when my messenger reaches you prepare
yourself and get ready, come out of your den and call those who are with
you.

Set your mind in order, take a grip on your affairs and acquire your
share. If you do not like it then go away to where neither you are
welcomed nor can you find a salvation.

By Allah, it is a matter of right with a rightful person and I do not
care about what heretics do!
The Clear Argument

When Imam approached Basrah an Arab met him – He is known as Kulayb
Al-Jarmi – and spoke to him, as he had been sent to him by some people
of Basrah to enquire from him on their behalf his position vis-à-vis the
people of Jamal. Imam explained to him his position with respect to
them, from which he was convinced that Amir Al-Mu’minin was in the
right. Then Imam asked him to swear allegiance, but he replied “I am
just a messenger of some people and shouldn’t do any thing till I return
to them.” Upon this Imam said this wonderful saying:

Suppose that those who have sent you as a forerunner to search out a
rain-fed area for them, and your return to them and apprise them of
herbage and water but they disagree with you and went towards dry and
barren land, what would you do then?

He said: I would leave them and go towards herbage and water. Imam
said: So then strech forth your hand.

This man said: By Allah, by such a clear argument I could not refrain
from swearing allegiance to Amir Al-Mu’minin.

And at one time, Imam was asked: with what thing you have overcame your
mated challengers? He answered:

I have not encountered any man except he helped me to kill him.

He Tried to Creat Misunderstanding from his speech, rich with logic, on
Talhah and his attitude towards Uthman’s case, before and after his
murder.

As for me, I would never be threatened with fighting or be frightened
of striking. By Allah Talhah has not hastened to draw his sword to
avenge Uthman’s blood except for fear that the demand for Uthman’s blood
be made against himself because the people’s idea in this matter is
about him, and, in fact, he was the most anxious among them for his
killing. Therefore he has tried to create misunderstanding by collecting
forces in order to confuse the matter and to create doubt.

By Allah, he did not act in either of three ways about Uthman. If the
son of Affan has been in the wrong, as Talhah was claiming he had to
support his murderers or resist his suppo-rters. If Uthman has been the
victim of oppression, then Talhah should have been among those who were
keeping (the assaulters) away from him and of those who defended him and
can’t be blamed.

If he was in doubt about these two states, then he had to leave him and
sit aside leaving the men with him. But he has not adopted any of these
three ways, and came out with a matter whose category couldn’t be known,
and its excuses are not free from blame.
I am their same challenger

Abdullah bin Abbas said that: I came to Amir Al-Mu’minin at Dhiqar and
saw that he was stitching his shoe. Then, Amir Al-Mu’minin said to me:
‘What is the worth of this shoe?’ I said: “It has no value now”. He then
said: “By Allah, it is more dear to me than your leadership but to
establish a righ and ward off a wrong”. Then, he came out and delivered
this speech:

I has not shown weakness or cowardice. My present march is also like
those. I shall certainly pierce the wrong till right comes out of its
side. What have I got to do with Quraysh? By Allah, I have fought them
when they were infidels verily I shall fight them when they have been
misled. I am their same challenger yesterday and today.
To What I has to Responded?

From a speech about those involved in the issue of the camel battle:

Beware! Satan has certainly instigated his party and has collected his
army in order that oppression return to its places, and wrong may occupy
its position.

By Allah they have not blamed me for a certain atrocity nor have they
dealed justly between me and themselves. They are demanding a right
which they have abandoned, and a blood that they have shed. If I has
been a partner with them in it then they too have their share of it. But
if they have been charged with the authority of demanding the blood but
me the liability is no another place but to them. Their biggest argument
(against me) is - really – against themselves.

How disappointed is this challenger (of battle)? whom he has
challenged? And for what I have to responded? I am satisfied with
Allah’s argument against them and His knowing of them. If they refuse
(to obey) I will offer them the edge of the sword which is an enough
curer of wrong and a deffender of right. It is strange of them to send
me a word to come out for challenging spear-fighting and to be patient
for combat with swords. May the mourning women mourn over them I have
not been to be frightened by fighting nor threatened by clashing. I
enjoy full certainty of belief in my creator, I am not suspecious of my
religon.
In a Deep area of sea

**Condemning the people of Basrah after the battle of Jamal “camel”
**
You have been the army of a woman and the follower of a quadruped. It
grumbled you responded, and it was wounded you fled away. You morals are
mean low, and your pledge is broken. Your religion is hypocrisy. Your
water is bitter. He who stays with you is pledged to his sins and he who
forsakes you is suplemented with Allah’s mercy. By Allah your city would
cer-tainly be drowned so much so that as though I see its mosque like
the bosom of a bird in a deep area of sea.

**They killed them in Captivity and by Treachery

from a sermon Describing the poeople of Jamal**

they came out dragging the wife of the Messenger of Allah – the peace
and blessing of Allah be upon him and his descendants – heading with her
for Basrah so they imprisoned their women in their houses and showed the
imprisoned of the Messenger of Allah to themselves and to others in an
army in which there was not a single individual who had not offered me
his obedience and sworn to me allegiance quite obediently, without any
compulsion. Here in Basrah they approached my governor and treasurers of
the public treasury and its other inhabitants. They killed some of them
in captivity and others assassinatedly. By Allah, even if they had
wilfully killed only one individual Muslim without any offense, I would
have the right to kill all that army.

**Those Who Fought Against Me

Describing the battle of Jamal**

I was afflicted, at the battle of Jamal, by the most extremely brave of
all people, and the most wealthy and granting the most obeyed among
people, and the most deep in cunning and pride: I was afflictted by
Al-Zubayer who had not turned his face at all, by Ya’la bin Munibah who
carries funds on many camels and grants everyone thirty dinars and a
horse so as to fight against me, and by Aai’shah who whenever she
referred as such except that people follow her and by Talha whose bottom
cannot be reached and whose cunning cannot be measured.
Dumb with speaking

Scolding his own companions in Kufa:

If Allah may respite the oppressor His catch would not spare him. He
lie in wait for him on the passage of his way.

By Allah in whose hand my life lies, these people will overcome you not
because they are more entitled to the right than you but because of
their hastening towards the wrong of their leader and your slowness
about my right. Nations are afraid of the oppression of their rulers
while I fear the oppression of my subjects. I called upon you for war
but you did not come. I made you hear but you did not listen. I called
you secretly as well as openly, but you did not respond. I gave you
sincere counsel, but you did not accept it. Are present people like
absent ones and slaves like masters? I recite to you maxims but you turn
away from them, and I preach to you with exhortaitons but you break up
away from them. I rouse you for jihad against the people of revolt
before I come to the end of my speech, I see you disperse like the sons
of Saba. You return to your places and deceive one another to forget
your maxims.

O’those whose bodies are present but their minds are absent and whose
wishes are scattered. Whose rulers are afflicted with them your leader
obeys Allah but you disobey him while the leader of the people of Syaria
(Al-Sham) disobeys Allah but they obey him. By Allah, I wish Mu’ayiah
exchange with me like dinars with dirhams. So that he takes from me ten
of you and gives me one of them.

O’ people of Kufa, I have suffered from you in three things and two
others: you are deaf in spite of having ears, dumb in spite of speaking,
and blind in spite of having eyes. You are neither true supporters in
combat nor dependable brothers in distress.
Do Not Revenge on an Enemy

A letter to Abdullah bin Abbas, his governor of Basrah. He had been
treating Beni Tameem hardly as they were with Talhah and AL-Zubayr at
Jamal. He exiled most of them. This became very hard for Imam Ali whose
big heart refuses revenge. He wrote to Ibn Abbas, preventing him,
blaming him, stating a fact we are thses days overlooking: the Head of
the state is responsible as well for the actions of his officers whom
the statesman appo-inted on people’s affairs ... he said:

Speek to them amically of this place pleased with good treatment and
loosen the knots of fear from their hearts.

I have come to know of your strictness with Benu Tameem and your
harshness to them. O’ Abu Al-Abbas, may Allah have mercy on you, keep
yourself restrained in whatever you say or do, good or bad about your
people, as we are partners in this. Strive to be according to my good
impressions about you, do not change my opinion! About you towards
weakness.
The Women

**Delivered after Jamal on dispraising women**

Beware of evil women and be on your guard even with those who are good.
Do not obey them even in good thing least they may not crave for
evils.
Bad Masters

**About the mischief mongering of Banu Umayyah**

Indeed the worst trial for you in my view is the trial of Banu Umayyah,
because it is blind and dark. By Allah, you will find Banu Umayyah after
me the worst masters for you, like the old unruly she-camel who bites
with its mouth, beats with its fore-legs, kicks with its hind legs and
refuses to be milked. They will remain over you till they wouldn’t leave
one of you except who benefits them. their calamity will continue till
your revenging on them become like the revenge of the slave on his
master or like the revenge of the fellower on his leader. Their trial
will come to you distorted, ugly and frightful cut off pieces.
No Bricks nor Wollen Tents

**Describing Banu Umayyah**

By Allah, they would continue their sinful behaviour till they would
not leave an unlawful act before Allah but they commit it and no knot of
contract but they would loosen it, and till there would remain no house
of bricks or of woolen tents but their oppression would enter it, and
till the two weepers begin to cry, the weeper for his religion and the
weeper for this world; and the revengful one of you on one of them would
be like the revenge of a slave on his master, namely when he is present
he obeys him, but when he is absent he backbites him!
A broad-pharynxed person

**From a speech of him to his com-panions**

Verily after me a person would overpower you with a broad mouth and a
big belly. He swallows whatever he gets and craves for what he does not
get! He would command you to abuse me and to renounce me. As for
abusing, you do abuse me because that would mean purification for me and
salvation for you. As regards renunciation, you should not renounce me
because I have been born on the natural religion (Islam) and preceded to
(accepting) faith and migrating.

**Greediness of the Wealthy**

A letter to Mu’ayiah which contain Imam’s right view to the wealthy
people whose appetite for funds incre-ase when their properties
increases.

So now, this world diverts man from other things. He who is devoted to
it achieves nothing of it except it increases his greed and coveting for
it. He who is devoted to it is not satisfied with what he gets of it to
do without what he has not got. Eventually there is the separation from
what he has amassed, and the undoing of what he twisted. If you had
taken a lesson from the past you. Should have preserved what remained.
Wassalaam.
With the right

Mu’ayiah wrote to Imam to grant him Al-Sham; so Imam wrote in reply to
Mu’ayih’s letter:

As for your demand to grant you Al-Shaam, I cannot give you today what
I have denied you yesterday. As regards your saying that the war has
eaten up the Arabs save its last breath, you should know that he whom
right has eaten up goes to Paradise and he whom wrong eaten up goes to
Hell. As for our equality in war and in men, certainly you aren’t more
sharp in doubt (of belief) than me in certainty (of belief).
The Carrier of Dates to Hajar([^1])

**In reply also to Mu’awiyah
Now, your letter has reached me wherein you recall that Allah Has
chosen Muhammad (s.w.a) for His religion and helped him by those
companions who helped him, time has concealed from us something
wonderful of you as you have started telling us of Allah’s favor for us
and His bounties to us through our Prophet. In this matter you are like
the person who carries dates to Hajar, or who challenges his own master
to a duel in archery!

Then you have mentioned my attitude with Uthman, and in this matter you
have the right to be answered because of your kinship with him. So (now
tell me), which of us was more inimical to him and who had done more to
bring about his killing; or who offered him his support but he asked him
to sit down and stop him; or that whom he called for help but he relaxed
and drew his death nearer to him till his fate overtook him? I wouldn’t
offer my excuse for had been angry with him for certain action of his,
for if my good counsel and guidance to him has been the sin then very
often a person may be blamed without a sin.
Fear Allah

**A letter to Mu’awiyah**

Fear Allah in what you have and consider His right on you, and turn,
and turn to understand what you are not excused to ignore. Your ego has
pushed you towards evil, thrown you into pitfalls, driven you to
destruction and made your paths rough.
You have Ruined A generation of people

**A letter to Mu’awiyah**

You have ruined a big generation of people whom you have deceived by
your seduction, and have flung them into the currents of your sea where
darkness had covered them and misgivings tossed them about. So they have
strayed from the right path and turned back on their heels,. They
withdrew backwards and depended on their ancesteries except some who
returned of clear – sighted men.
The fraud of child

**From a reply to a letter to Mu’awiyah**

You have stated that I have killed Talhah and Al-Zubayr, forced A’ishah
out of her house and invaded the two cities (Kufa and Basrah). This has
been a matter with which you have no concern as you were absent nor do
the apologize in it to you.

You have said a lot about Uthman’s murderers. You first join what the
people have joined i.e pay ahomage then bring the charged people to
trial before me and I shall settle the matter between you and them
according to the Book of Allah, the Subliem. As to that at which you aim
it is the intrigue to deceive the weaned child of milk by a nipple.

Glory be to God how strange O’ Mu’awiyah

**A letter to Mu’awiyah**

Glory be to God! How keen do you cling to fabricated desires with
ignoring the facts. As regards your prolonging the dispute about
Uthman’s murder certainly you have defended Uthman when it was really
your own assistance and you forsook him when the defence was his,
Wassalam.
