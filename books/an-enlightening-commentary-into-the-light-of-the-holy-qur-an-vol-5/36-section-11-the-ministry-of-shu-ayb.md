Section 11: The Ministry of Shu 'ayb
====================================

Shu'ayb exhorts his people to believe in and stick to the Unity of
Allah -His rejection and the punishment.

Surah Al-‘A’raf, Verse 85
-------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَإِلَى مَدْيَنَ أَخَاهُمْ شُعَيْبًا قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُواْ
اللّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرُهُ قَدْ جَاءتْكُم بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن
رَّبِّكُمْ فَأَوْفُواْ الْكَيْلَ وَالْمِيزَانَ وَلاَ تَبْخَسُواْ
النَّاسَ أَشْيَاءهُمْ وَلاَ تُفْسِدُواْ فِي الأَرْضِ بَعْدَ
إِصْلاَحِهَا ذَلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ
  </p>

**85.** ***"And (We sent) unto (the people of) Madyan their brother
Shu'ayb. He said: 'O' my people! Serve*** ***Allah! You have no god
other than Him. There has come to you a clear proof from your Lord.
Therefore give full measure and weight and do not diminish to men their
things, and do not make mischief in the earth after its improvement.
This is better for you, if you are believers."***

### Jethro's Messengership in Madyan

Jethro, whose genealogical tree, according to the history records, with
several dynasties reaches Abraham, was missioned to go towards the
inhabitants of Madyan. At that time, Madyan was one of the cities of
Syria the people of which were mostly merchants.

Idolatry, short weighing, defraudation and falsification in social
relationships were fully current among them. The explanation of the
conflict and dispute between this great prophet (as) and the inhabitants
of Madyan is stated in several Suras of the Qur'an, and in Surah Hud,
No.11 and Surah Ash-Shu'ara, No.26, in particular.

In this current verse, the Qur'an says that Allah sent to the people of
Madyan their brother Jethro.

The verse says:

***"And (We sent) unto (the people of Madyan their brother Shu'ayb.
..."***

Then the verse adds that Shu'ayb, like all other prophets, began his
invitation with the subject of Monotheism and, as the Qur'an remarks:

**"...** ***He said:*** **'** ***O*****'** ***my people! Serve***
***Allah! You have no god other than Him.*** **..."**

He emphasized that not only the mentioned ordinance was the command of
wisdom, but also it was proved by the clear evidences that had come from
their Lord for them. The verse says:

***"... There has come to you a clear proof from your Lord. ..."***

Next to the invitation to monotheism, he tried to struggle against their
social, economical, and ethical corruptions.

At first, he restrained them from defraudation, falsification in social
relationships which they were polluted with, and told them now that the
path of Allah was revealed to them they should pay the right measure and
weight so that the due things of people might not be diminished. The
verse says:

***"... Therefore give full measure and weight and do not diminish to
men their things....."***

Then, he points to one of other wrong actions of those people, and says:

***"... and do not make mischief in the earth after its improvement.
..."***

It is certain that none may make profit from making mischief,
irrespective of ethical mischief, faithlessness, and insecurity. So, at
the end of the verse, it adds:

***"... This is better for you, if you are believers."***

Surah Al-‘A’raf, Verse 86
-------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلاَ تَقْعُدُواْ بِكُلِّ صِرَاطٍ تُوعِدُونَ وَتَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ
اللّهِ مَنْ آمَنَ بِهِ وَتَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا وَاذْكُرُواْ إِذْ
كُنتُمْ قَلِيلاً فَكَثَّرَكُمْ وَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ
الْمُفْسِدِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**86.** ***"And do not sit in every path, threatening and hindering from
the path of*** ***Allah*** ***those who believe in Him, desiring to make
it crooked. And remember when you were few, then He multiplied you; and
consider how the end of the mischief makers was."***

In this verse, the fourth advice of Shu'ayb has been pointed out, where
it says:

***"And do not sit in every path, threatening and hindering from the
path of*** ***Allah*** ***those who believe in Him, desiring to make it
crooked. ..."***

Then, at the end of the verse, the fifth advice of Jethro has been
referred to. It reminds them the bounties of Allah in order to stimulate
the feeling of gratitude and thanksgiving in them. The verse says:

***"... And remember when you were few, then He multiplied you....."***

It is understood from this phrase of the verse that, in most instances,
multiplicity of persons can be the origin of power and greatness of the
development of the society.

Finally, the Qur'an advises people to carefully observe the end of the
mischief-mongers that how evil was their fate, and that they do not
follow the way of makers of mischief.

***"... and consider how the end of the mischief makers was."***

Surah Al-‘A’raf, Verse 87
-------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَإِن كَانَ طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنكُمْ آمَنُواْ بِالَّذِي أُرْسِلْتُ بِهِ
وَطَآئِفَةٌ لَّمْ يْؤْمِنُواْ فَاصْبِرُواْ حَتَّى يَحْكُمَ اللّهُ
بَيْنَنَا وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الْحَاكِمِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**87.** ***"And if there is a party of you who believe in that with
which I have been sent, and a party who do not believe, then wait with
patience until*** ***Allah*** ***judges between us, and He is the best
of the judges."***

The opponents of Jethro scornfully asked him where the punishment of
Allah was. On the other side, the adherents of the Faith were also
waiting for the helps of Allah*.* The content of the verse is something
in the middle, so that neither the disbelievers become proud nor the
believers lose hope.

Thus, the history of the adherents of both right and wrong should be
studied regarding the end of their fates.

However, in the school of thought and philosophy of prophets, the Faith
in the goal and their way is important, not those persons themselves.

The verse says:

***"And if there is a party of you who believe in that with which I have
been sent, and a party who do not believe, then wait with patience
until*** ***Allah*** ***judges between us, and He is the best of the
judges."***

The apparent seeming uniformity of the lives of this fleeting world of
the disbelievers and believers should not disturb you. Do persevere,
since the final judge is Allah (S.w.T.).
