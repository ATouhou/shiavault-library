Polygamy in Islam
=================

First of all, it should be remembered that the Hindus, Babylonians,
Persians, Athenians, Jews and pre-Islamic Arabs recognised no limit to
the number of wives a man could marry. Islam limited and restricted it
in number; and hedged it with severe restrictions.

The attitude of a husband towards his wives must be such as to give no
occasion to heart-break, jealousy, dissatisfaction, discontent and
frustration to any of them.

There should be no cruelty, injustice, bias or partiality on the part
of the husband. It is expected and seen that complete peace, harmony and
tranquillity prevail in the household where the husband faithfully
observes the injunctions of Islam regarding the equal status of all the
wives in matters of maintenance, and general treatment.

If the husband cannot exercise this equality he is not allowed to marry
more than one. Regarding this restriction of number and equal treatment,
the Qur'an, ordains:-

. . . , then marry such women as seem good to you, two, three and four;
but if you fear you will not be equitable, then only one, (Qur'an,
4:3)

To ensure that fairness and justice, the husband must have sufficient
economic means to provide adequate food, clothing and other necessities
of life to each of them; each of the wives must be provided with a
separate house of her own, where only the husband has a right to enter
without asking her permission first. The husband must spend equal time
in the house of each wife. He must divide his nights among them, and
must visit every wife in the morning.

This will give him a chance to look after the welfare of each every
day, and will maintain good relationships with each of them.

The fact that the imposition of the above conditions has made polygamy
very much restricted among the Muslims; and one seldom comes across
cases of polygamy in the Muslim societies.


**Polygamy: A Natural Law**

Now, we should look at the arguments of the Christians against the
system of polygamy. Is polygamy really against the natural law? The
facts and findings answer this question in negative.

"Man," says G.R.Scott, "is essentially polygamous and the development
of civilization extends this innate polygamy." (History of prostitution,
p.21; as quoted in Polygamy in Islam, published by Islami Mission,
Lahore) Dr. Mercier says: "Woman is by nature monogamist; man has in him
the element of polygamist." (Conduct and its Disorders Biologi cally
Considered, pp.292-293; as quoted in Polygamy in Islam)

Professor Russel, an American scholar, said in a conference, held at
the University of California, convened to discuss the Family Rights:-

"Marriage to one wife and being tied down to only one wife for the
whole span of life is unnatural and unreasonable." Then, in the course
of a long discussion, he summarized his theory by saying that, "Man
aught to accept the law of more than one wife as an important factor in
the struggle for survival." (Ittila'at), Tehran, no.3104)

While on this topic, we should examine the claim that the Creator
"preserves the number of males practically equal to the number of
females."

It is a claim which cannot be justified in any way. There are a number
of countries, including Tanzania, where the population of women exceeds
considerably that of men. According to statistics published some time
ago, in Soviet Russia, the population of women was about twenty one
million more than that of the men.

And even if we accept, just for the sake of argument, that the Creator
creates equal number of males and females, does it prove that there will
be no need of polygamy? Well, let us look at this matter in a reasoned
way. The girls become capable of re-production, and get the natural
sexual feelings earlier than the boys. Islam has fixed the age of nine
years for a girl to be considered as an adult, while the age limit for
boys is fourteen or fifteen.

It is because in temperate climate girls are able to conceive at the
age of nine or ten; while in the same climate an average boy becomes
able to establish sexual intercourse at the age of about fourteen or
fifteen.

Now, suppose a group of people settle together in a place, and suppose
that every year fifty boys and fifty girls are born in that community.
Also suppose that none of the children die in infancy. In twenty years,
there will be one thousand boys and one thousand girls.

Out of these one thousand girls, five hundred and fifty girls (who were
born from the first to the eleventh year) will have reached the age of
puberty, that is, will be from ten to twenty years old.

And out of the one thousand boys only three hundred will have reached
the age of puberty. These will be the ones born from first year to the
sixth year, who will be from fifteen to twenty years old.

If that community practices monogamy, the three hundred boys can marry
three hundred girls. What will be the fate of the remaining two hundred
and fifty girls? So, the supposed equality in number of boys and girls
is wrong not only according to the statistics, but in theory also.

Also, one more fact to be borne in mind, before claiming this equality
of the numbers.

All healthy women have to pass through a period, every month, when
their condition discourages establishment of sexual intercourse.

But the man does not lose his sexual urge at any time. What is the
remedy if a man is unable to resist his sexual urge at a time when his
wife is having her menstruation? Either polygamy, which has legal
status, or going to the prostitutes, which is forbidden in every
religion.

Apart from these natural causes which refute the claim of the Christian
priests, there are some situations created by man which give lie to that
claim. Take for example War.

In Europe, during the thirty-year War and in the last two World Wars,
so many men were killed that there were not enough males to marry the
young girls and young widows. In West Germany alone, after the second
World War, there were six million women who could not find a husband.

A group of them appealed to the government to promulgate a law allowing
polygamy, so that they may get husbands. They pleaded their case on the
grounds that it would provide them economic and social security and
satisfy their natural urge. The Church opposed this move, and the
helpless six million women were left to fend for themselves by illicit
sexual activities. Bertrand Russell says:-

"And in all countries where there is an excess of women, it is an
obvious injustice that those women who by arithmetical necessity must
remain unmarried should be wholly debarred from sexual experience."
(Marriage and Morals, p.47)
