For Prayers
===========

Al-Abbas went to Imam Husayn [a] to tell him about the enemies'
attitude. The Imam said to him:

*Go back and ask them for time to pray. We want to pray to Allah
tonight. We want to ask Him to forgive us. Allah knows that I love
prayers, reading the Qur'an, and asking forgiveness.*

Al-Abbas came back and asked them for some time. Umar bin Saad thought
for a while. He thought that Imam Husayn [a] would change his mind. So,
he agreed on Imam Husayn's request and said:

*We'll give you a chance till tomorrow. If you give in, we'll take you
to Emir Ubaidullah bin Ziyad. If you refuse to give in, we won't let you
go.*
