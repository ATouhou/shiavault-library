Chapter Nineteen : Thursday Namaz For the Deceased
==================================================

If the living can not offer Namaz daily for the deceased, then a
Thursday Namaz is recommended. It consists of a two Rak'at Namaz where
the reward is offered to the deceased at the end. [Sayyid, Hadi Husayn
(1988).pg. 175].

Details below:

Niyyat - You will need to make Niyyat for "Hadiyya Waalidayn", 2
Rak'ats.

In the first Rak'at after Surah Al-Humd (al-Fatihah), recite the
following ten times:

"Rabbanaghfirli wa li-waalidayya wa lil-moo-mineena yawma yaqoomul
h'isaab."

(O my Lord, forgive me and my parents, and the believers, on the Day of
Reckoning).

In the second Rak'at after Surah Al-Humd (al-Faatihah), recite the
following ten times:

"Rabbighfirlee wa li waalidayya wa liman dakhala baytee moo-minan wa
lil-moo-mineena wal moo-minaat."

(O my Lord, forgive me and my parents, and those who came into my
house, believing (in Thee); and all the believing men and women.) After
Salams recite the following ten times:

"rabbir-h'amhumma kamaa rabbayaanee s'agheeraa."

(My Lord, have mercy on them both (my parents), as they did care for me
when I was little (in childhood).) Alternatively, the following 2 rak'at
Namaz can be offered:

In the first Rak'at after surah Al-Humd, recite Surah al-Qadr, and in
the second Rak'at after Surah al-humd, recite Surah al-Kawthar with the
following Qunoot:

"Rabbanaghfirili wa li-waalidayya wa lil-moo-mineena yawma yaqoomul
h'isaab."

(O my Lord, forgive me, and my parents, and the believers, on the Day
of Reckoning.)

Imam Jafar as-Sadiq [A.S.] is quoted as having said:

"He who habitually tells the truth his deeds are purified; Allah
increases the sustenance of the one whose intention is good; and he who
treats his family members well, Allah prolongs the length of his
life."

[Ayatullah Sayyid Kamal Faghih (1998)(Khisal by Saduq,vol 1 pg 88]


**Conclusion**

And Allah Say in the Qu'oran:

"And He it is Who gave you life, then He will cause you to die, and
then will give you life (again)..." [22:66]

In the event and on the occasions where the world is embroiled with
intense fighting and the majority of the men are killed, it is necessary
that women know how to prepare the deceased for burial.

In some counties of the world, such as Saudi Arabia, women are
forbidden to attend a funeral, even when it is the funeral of their own
child. This is not in accordance to true Islamic teachings. Women must
have the aforementioned knowledge, as they may be required to prepare
and bury the deceased if there are no men to do so. And Allah [S.W.T.]
knows best. And Allah says in the Qu'oran:

"Lo! I have rewarded them this day forasmuch, as they were steadfast;

and they verily are the triumphant.

He will say: How long tarried ye in the earth, counting by years?

They will say: We tarried but a day or part of a day. Ask of those who
keep count! He will say: Ye tarried but a little if ye only knew"

[23; 111-114]
