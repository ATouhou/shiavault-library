Destruction of the Imamâ€™s Enemies
=================================

All the above oppressors and also those unfortunate ones who
participated in the killing of Husayn (a.s.) either died or were killed
during three or four years. None of them survived to bear the sorrows of
this world. Yazeed himself died within three and a half years of this
incident. Indeed, the people who helped Yazeed and acted on his orders
will be raised with him and they all would be recompensed like him and
abide in Hell forever.
