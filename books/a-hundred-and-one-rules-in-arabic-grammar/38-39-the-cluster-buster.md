39. The Cluster Buster.
=======================

Generally speaking, Arabic does not tolerate three or more consonant
clusters. The common practice to deal with such a phonological
environment is to insert a short or long vowel in between. We mentioned
earlier the use of the short helping vowel. A good example for the use
of a long vowel is when we have an attached object pronoun for
transitive verbs which have **أنتم**   as a subject. Notice the use of
the long vowel (**و** ) to break the cluster in the following sentences:

<p dir="rtl">
**شاهدتـُموها في السوق ِ.**
</p>

You (mp) saw her in the market.

<p dir="rtl">
**قابلتـُمونا في المقهی.**
</p>

**You (mp) met us in the cafe.**

<p dir="rtl">
**علمتـُموهُ العربية َ.**
</p>

You (mp) taught him Arabic.
