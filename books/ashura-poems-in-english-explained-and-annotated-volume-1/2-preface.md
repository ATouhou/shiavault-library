Preface
=======

The prime reason and motive for compiling the following anthology of
devotional poems on Imam al-Husain is to record and mark my humblest
degree of reverence and devotion to the unimaginably high status of Imam
al-Husain,

and then to provide readers with a range of such poems so far composed
in English.

When my colleague Mr. Abdul-Hosseyn Tale'i suggested to me to embark on
such a task, it hardly seemed practicable; however, it has been
certainly by divine grace that I have been able to gradually come across
such poems here and there and produce the first volume of such an
anthology.

Considering that this is my first endeavor to take a step toward
collecting and anthologizing Ashura literature in English, I wish to
request each and every esteemed reader to provide me with additional
poems of the nature collected here.

This is just to work out a further revised and enlarged edition. Surely
anybody who contributes to this collection they will receive the divine
grace and will benefit from the favor of Imam al- Husain.

The poems are anthologized in this collection just as they appear on
websites or in the sources from which they are taken.

I would sincerely appreciate any comment, suggestion, contribution, or
reminder. I can be reached at the following addresses:

**Acknowledgments**

First and foremost, I am thankful to Allah Who provided me with this
opportunity to carry out the present task as the least cultural service
to those who have got to know, or learned to love, Imam al-Husain (May
Divine grace and salaams be bestowed upon him).

No doubt, it is a gratifying and blessed work which, I hope, will be
recognized as a mark of my humblest service to the divine status of Imam
al-Husain which is beyond conjecture. I simply hope to receive his
graceful favor for such a humble task.

I am grateful to Mr. Abdul-Hoseyn Tale'i for his initial suggestion to
compile such an anthology. Next, my sincere thanks go to Sheikh Ali
al-Fatlawi, presently the Curator of the Library of Imam al-Husain's
Sacred Sanctuary in Karbala for his permission to let us have the honor
of indicating Imam al- Husain's Sanctuary as the publisher of the
present volume.

This will certainly remain an everlasting honor for all those who have
been involved in producing this book. I cannot forget Sheikh Muhammad
al-Hassoun for his kind and sincere help.

Indeed, Sheikh Muhammad al-Hassoun's cooperation makes me indebted to
him forever; he suggested to me to have this

book published in the series of the publications of Imam al- Husain's
Sacred Sanctuary. Also Sayyid Hashim al-Milani, the Curator of the
Library of Imam ?Al?'s Sanctuary in Najaf deserves my sincere
appreciation for this support.

I express my sincere appreciation to Dr. Ali Afkhami and Dr.
Ali-Muhammad Haghshenas-Lari, distinguished professor of linguistics at
the University of Tehran, and his family for having read the final draft
of the present volume and the suggestions they made.

My special thanks go to His Grace Archbishop Sebouh Sarkissian, Sheikh
Muhammad Sadiq Muhammad al- Karbasi, the editor of the London-based Imam
al-Husain Encyclopedia, Sheikh Muhammad Kalbasi, Dr. Ali-Reza Babazadeh,
and Mr. Kamal al-Sayyid.

Among my university students, Mr. Hamed Akhyani deserves my profound
and special appreciation. He has always expressed keen academic interest
as well as devoutly religious fascination and rendered his substantial
assistance while the present volume was in gestation. I am, and will
always remain, appreciative of his effective and invaluable cooperation
and crucial help.

Regarding office jobs, Mr. Gholam-Reza Yazdandoost, Mr.
Muhammad-Hosseyn Shahri, and Miss Minoo Jalali also helped me a lot.

I cannot forget the assistance I received from my good friends in New
Delhi in the summer of 2006. Among a long list of friends who proved
cooperative, I ought to mention the following: Mr. Morteza
Shafi'i-Shakib, Mr. Mohammad- Hossein Mozaffari, Dr. Syed Quayam
Hussain, all at Iran Culture House in New Delhi, Mrs. M.
Vijayalakshmi,

University. I am also grateful to Prof. Richard Parmentier of Brandeis
University, and Dr. Tabish Khair of the University of Aarhus, Denmark,
for contributing one of his poems to this collection. They helped me in
many ways and made my short research trip to India as pleasant and
fruitful as possible. May God reward them all.

Dr. Mahmoud Mahdavi-Damghani of Mashhad, Iran, Dr. Farideh
Mahdavi-Damghani and her eminent father, Dr. Ahmad Mahdavi-Damghani
(presently at Harvard University) showed great interest and encouraged
me to go along with the project.

I also thank my French friend Dr. Mouslim Fidahoussen and the famous
Lebanese Christian literary figure, Dr. Georges Gordak, widely renowned
for his scholarship on the life of Imam ?Al? b. Ab? T?lib, for their
moral support.

Last but not least, I offer my most heartfelt thanks to my wife for her
patience and understanding and for creating a fitting environment for
the accomplishment of this task.

Permission (to fight) is given unto those upon whom war is made for
they have been oppressed, and verily, to help them, God is Most Potent;
Those who have been expelled from their homes unjustly save that they
say: ?Our Lord is God!? The Holy Quran, 22 [al-Hajj]. 39-40.

And say not of those who are slain in God's cause, ?They are dead?:
nay, they are alive, but you perceive it not. The Holy Quran, 2

God loves whoever loves [Imam] al-Husain.

The Prophet Muhammad The place where [Imam] al-Husain is buried has
been one of Paradise Gardens since he was buried therein.

Imam Jafar al-Sadiq

Once God wishes to do a favor to someone, He makes them love [Imam]
al-Husain.

Imam Jafar al-Sadiq

In a distant age and climate the tragic scene of the death of Hussain
will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader.

Edward Gibbon, The Decline and Fall o f the Roman Empire The best
lesson which we get from the tragedy of Karbala is that Husain and his
followers were the rigid believers of God, they illustrated that
numerical superiority does not count when it comes to truth and
falsehood. The victory of Husain despite his minority marvels me.
