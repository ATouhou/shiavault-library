Justifying not Killing the Renegade
-----------------------------------

**Rabiâ€™ al-Awwal 26, 1330**

They, may Allah be pleased with them, may have understood the Prophet's
order to be a recommendation rather than an obligation, and this is why
they did not kill the man. Or maybe they thought that killing him was to
be handled by a more qualified companion, since such were present then,
and they did not refrain from killing him out of fear that he might
flee, having refrained from telling him about anyone's intention to kill
him, Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*S*
