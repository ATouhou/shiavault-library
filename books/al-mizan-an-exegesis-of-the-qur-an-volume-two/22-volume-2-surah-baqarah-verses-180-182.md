Volume 2: Surah Baqarah, Verses 180-182
=======================================

Bequest is prescribed for you when death approaches one of you, if he
leaves behind wealth, for parents and near relatives, according to
usage, a duty (incumbent) upon those who guard (against evil) (180).
Whoever then alters it after he has heard it, the sin of it then is only
upon those who alter it; surely Allah is Hearing, Knowing (181).
But he who fears. an inclination (to a wrong course) or an act of
disobedience on the part of the testator, and effects an agreement
between the parties, there is no blame on him. Surely Allah is
Forgiving, Merciful (182).

**COMMENTARY
**
QUR’AN: Bequest is prescribed for you when death approaches one of you,
if he leaves behind wealth:

The language is that of an obligatory rule, because al-kitabah (= to
write; translated here as "prescribed") is used in the Qur’an always for
definitely obligatory laws. It is further strengthened by the word “a
duty” coming at the end of the verse, because duty too is used, like
writing and prescription, for compulsory orders. But the word "a duty"
is qualified by "upon those who guard (against evil)"; this somewhat
weakens the sense of obligatoriness; it would have been more
appropriate, in case of obligatoriness, to say, 'a duty' upon the
believers'. In any case, it is said that the verse was later abrogated
by the verse of inheritance. If so, then it would only be its
"obligatoriness" which was abrogated, not its being liked, recommended.
Perhaps, the phrase qualifying "a duty" was used for this very
purpose.

al-
Khayr is wealth; it probably denotes consider­able wealth, not an
insignificant amount. al-Ma'ruf (= known; common usage of good deed and
favor).

QUR'AN: Whoever then alters it after he has heard it, the sin of it
then is only upon those who alter it:

The pronoun in "the sin of it" refers to the alteration; all the rest
refer to the bequest according to usage; bequest is a masdar and is used
both as mas­culine and feminine. (That is why the pronouns used in the
verse are of masculine gender.) "
upon those who alter it": Allah did not say 'upon them', because the
wording used clearly indicates the nature of sin, that is, alteration of
a will; also it paves the way for the next verse.

QUR'AN: But he who fears an inclination (to a wrong course) or an act
of disobedience on the part of the testator, and effects an agreement
between the parties, there is no blame on him:

al-Janaf (inclination; deviation); it is said that it indicates
out­ward inclination of the feet, and al-hanaf shows their inward
inclination. In any case, it is used here to denote an incli­nation
towards sin and disobedience, as it is followed by "or an act of
disobedience". The verse branches out from the preceding one. Its
meaning is as follows (and Allah knows better): The sin of alteration is
only upon those who alter the bequest (which was made according to
usage). Of course, if someone fears that the bequest of the testator is,
or shall be, an act of disobedience or inclined towards a wrong course,
and then effects an agreement between the parties, free from error and
sin, then there is no blame on him; because he has not changed a bequest
made according to usage; rather he has altered only the wrong and sin
found in it.

**TRADITIONS
**
Muhammad ibn Muslim says that he asked as-Sadiq (
a.s.) whether a bequest was allowed in favor of an heir. The Imam said:
"Yes". Then he recited this verse, "Bequest is prescribed . . . if he
leave behind wealth, for parents and near relatives. . . "
(al-'Ayyashi). This tradition is also narrated, with a slight change in
wording, in al-Kafi and at-Tahdhib.

as-Sadiq (a.s.) narrates through his father from 'Ali (a.s.) that he
said: "He who did not bequeath at the time of his death for those of his
near relatives who were not his heirs, surely ended his deeds with
disobedience." (al-Ayyashi)

as-Sadiq (
a.s.) said about this verse: "(It is) a right which Allah has given in
the properties of men to the Master of this affair (i.e. to the Imam)."
The narrator says: "I said: 'Is there a prescribed limit for it? He
said: 'Yes'. I said: 'How much?' He said: 'Its lower limit is one-sixth;
and the higher, one-third."' (al-'Ayyashi)

The author says: This theme has been narrated also by as­-Saduq in his
al-Faqih from the same Imam. It is a fine inference from this verse read
in conjunction with the verse: The Prophet has a greater claim on the
believers than they have on themselves, and his wives are their mothers;
and the possessors of relationship have the better claim in the
ordinance of Allah to inheritance, one with respect to another, than
(other) believers, and (than) those who have fled (their homes), except
that you do some good to your awliya’; this is written in the Book
(33:6). This verse abrogated the system prevalent in early days of Islam
by which a "muhajir brother" inherited from his "ansar brother"; and
initiated inheritance between the relatives; then it made an exception
(from this rule of inheritance by relationship), and that was about
doing some good to your awliyaa’\*. Now Allah has made the Prophet
al-waliyy and his pure progeny al-awliyaa' of the believers. And this
exception of doing good to the awliyaa’ brings it within the
jurisdiction of the verse under discussion: Bequest... for parents and
near relative. And the Imams are also the "near relatives" (of the
Prophet). Understand it.

The Fifth or the Sixth Imam said about the verse, Bequest is prescribed
for you...: It is abrogated. The verses of inheritance abrogated it."
(al-Ayyashi)

The author says: This tradition may be reconciled with the preceding
ones if we say that it was only its obligatoriness which was abrogated;
thus the order will continue as al-mustahabb (recommended) even after
that.

Abu Ja'far (a.s.) said about the verse, But he who fears an inclination
(to a wrong course) or an act of
disobedience. . . : al-janaf is inclination to the side of error
without knowing that it is allowed (or not)." (Majma’u l-bayan)

as-Sadiq (
a.s.) said: "When a man has made his will, then it is not allowed to
the executor to alter the bequest made; he should enforce it as (the
testator) has bequeathed; except when (the testator) has made his will
against the command of Allah, and done injustice (to an heir). Then it
is allowed to the executor to bring the will to the truth (i.e. the
right course). Let us say, there is a man who has got some heirs; and he
bequeaths all (his) property to some of the heirs, depriving the others.
In such cases, it is allowed to the executor to bring the will to the
right (course). And this is (the meaning of) the word of Allah, an
inclination (to a wrong course) or an act of disobedience. And al-janaf
is inclination to some of his heirs, leaving the others aside; and
al-ithm (= sin; act of disobedience) is that he directs to build
fire-temples, and to take intoxicant. Then the executor is allowed not
to do any such thing." (at-Tafsir, al-Qummi)

The author says: The explanation of al-janaf given in this tradition
makes clear the meaning of the word of Allah: and effects an agreement
between the parties. The words refer to effecting reconciliation and
settlement between the heirs, when there is conflict and quarrel among
them because the testator was inclined to wrong course, and favored one
heir at the cost of the others.

Muhammad ibn Suqah said: "I asked Abu Ja'far (
a.s.) about the word of Allah: Whoever then alters it after he has
heard it, the sin of it then Is only upon those who alter it. He said:
'It has been abrogated by the next verse; But he who fears an
inclination (to a wrong course) or an act of disobedience on the part of
the testator, and effects an agreement between the parties, there is no
blame on him.' He said: 'It means that if the executor fears that the
testator is inclined to a wrong course concerning his children in the
bequest he has entrusted the executor with, in a way Allah is not
pleased with, (and which is) against the truth, then there is no blame
on him, (i.e. on the executor of the will) if he changes it to the
truth, and to the way of right that Allah is pleased with."' (al-Kafi)

The author says: This tradition explains one verse with the help of
another. Therefore, the word, "abrogated", is not used here in its
terminological meaning. And we have earlier mentioned that the word,
"abrogation", is sometimes used in the speech of Ahlu ‘l-bayt, in a
meaning different from the language of the Principles of
Jurisprudence.

\* al-Awliyaa is plural of al-waliyy, which has several meanings,
important among them being: friend, guardian, relative, a person close
to Allah, and master. In the explanation given in the text, it has been
taken to mean master and guardian. (tr.)
