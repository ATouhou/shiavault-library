Lesson Ninety Two: Sinful Ways Solve Nothing!
=============================================

Imam Husayn (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ حَاوَلَ أَمْراً بِمَعْصِيَةِ اللّهِ كانَ أَفْوَتُ لِما يَرجُو و
اَسْرَعُ لِما يَحْذِرُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

One who looks to performing something through disobedience to God, will
lose whatsoever he desires sooner ; and, whatsoever he fears , will
happen to him sooner.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Some people suppose that if they use unlawful means for obtaining their
goals, they will attain their ends sooner. However, above tradition says
that in fact such ways will expedite the loss of their ill-gotten
objects and their fears will also materialize sooner. For example, he
seeks tranquility from earning unlawful wealth, yet first of all he
loses tranquility as a result of it and is involved in distress and
anxiety which he had feared.
