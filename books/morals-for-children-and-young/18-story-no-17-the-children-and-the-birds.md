Story no. 17: The children and the birds
========================================

It was winter, and severely cold. The snow-fall was so heavy that the
animals and birds were jumping about here and there in search of food,
Most probably they found it, but there was none……  
 Meanwhile, some of the children of the house became united, came out
and started clearing the snow from their compound and made some space of
a few meters.  
 They took a few grains and wheat stalks and sprinkled them on the
ground for the birds to eat.  
 The birds arrived and taking advantage of the sprinkled seeds became
busy picking them.  
 When their father, Aqa Ismail saw this he appreciated the children and
thanked god on giving him moral-favoring children.
