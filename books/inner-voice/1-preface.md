Preface of the First Edition
----------------------------

Character building is as vital and essential in our present day society
as it has been in the past. It is of even greater importance today to
acquire more content with the teachings of the Prophet of Islam and His
Ahlul-Bayt in view of our decadent society with its ever increasing
temptations all around us; since Islam is not a dogmatic religion, but a
complete code of life and a guide in all aspects of our day to day
activities and behavior.

Maulana Sayyid Sa’eed Akhtar Rizvi, the Chief Missonary of the Bilal
Muslim Mission of Tanzania, has been publishing small thought provoking
articles in the “Sunday News”, Dar-es-salaam, on general Islamic
Teachings and its role in our character building. This column has proved
very popular among Muslims and Non-Muslims alike; and, now, its Swahili
translation appears in the weekly “Baraza” (Nairobi). Also, the “East
African Standard” (Nairobi) has published many of these articles in its
Muslim Column.

I am, indeed grateful to Maulana for compiling these articles in this
booklet and I hope they will serve the useful purpose as they were meant
for.

The Mission commends the elders to give this booklet its widest possible
circulation.
