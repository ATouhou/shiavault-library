67: Control (mulk)
==================

This chapter of 30 Meccan verses was revealed after The Mount 52 and
before Reality 69. The next two Parts of the Qur\`an (XXIX and XXX) are
Meccan again except for the short chapter called [Divine] Support 110
and they comprise two score lyric gems. The present chapter gives us a
picture of how the Universe was formed as well as another of the final
Blaze which will mark the end of the world (I).

The title Al- Mulk gives some difficulty in translation from the Arabic.

In a so-called republican or pseudo-democratic age, I prefer the word
control instead of monarchical terms such as dominion or sovereignty
since control here refers to the ultimate power of the Divinity, while
actual political power was being slowly forged in Arabia through a
confederation of Arab tribes, the Islamic commonwealth or Umma which the
Prophet tried to achieve. Control also gives us an easier verb form to
use. God is here addressed as the Mercy-giving or Ar-Rahman.
