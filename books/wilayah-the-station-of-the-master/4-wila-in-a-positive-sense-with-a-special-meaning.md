Wila' In A Positive Sense, With A Special Meaning
=================================================

Wila' in its positive, special sense is the wila' of Ahlu 'l-bayt, the
Household of the Prophet. There can be no room for debate over the fact
that the noble Prophet has called and directed the Muslims to a kind of
wila' in connection with his pure, sinless family; that is to say that
even scholars from the Sunni sect make no controversy over this. The
aayah of the pure relatives:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْ لَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي
الْقُرْبَىٰ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Say: "I do not ask of you any reward f or it but love of my near
relatives" (42: 23)***

Sets down the matter of wila' in its special meaning. And it is also
present in the famous and uncontested hadith of Ghadiri, where it is
said [^1]:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ كُنْتُ مَوْلاهُ فَهذا عَلِيٌ مَوْلاهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“For whomsoever I am his mawla, \`Ali is his mawla.”*

This itself is mention of a kind of wila' which will be explained later.

A noble ayah says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّمَا وَلِيُّكُمُ اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا الَّذِينَ
يُقِيمُونَ الصَّلَاةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ الزَّكَاةَ وَهُمْ رَاكِعُونَ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Only Allah is your Vali and His Messenger and those who believe,
those who keep up prayers and pay the poor-rate while they bow
(5:55)”***

The different schools are of one opinion, that this was revealed
concerning \`Ali (a.s.) at-Tabari cites many ahadith in this
connection[^2], and az-Zamakhshari, who was one of the greatest scholars
of the Sunni school, said in a definitive manner

"This ayah was revealed concerning \`Ali,” and the reason for the plural
being used (i.e., those), although that which was revealed was not more
than one person, that it is exhorting people to behave like this; and it
explains that believers should acquire character and qualities like
this, and should be eager and fervent in this way in doing good and in
generosity and in helping the poor, and that even in prayer they should
not procrastinate."' (i.e., although they may be in prayer when the
matter of zakat arises, they should not delay, and should perform their
obligation during the time of prayer.)[^3]

Also Fakhru'd-Din ar-Razi, who, like az- Zamakhshari, is one of the
great men of the Sunni school and of the whole community, said: "This
ayah was revealed concerning \`Ali, and scholars are all in agreement
that the payment of zakat in the time of ruku\`[^4] (the position of
bowing down in prayer) did not take place except in the case of 'Ali."'

Towards the end he makes some contention about the interpretation of the
word wali, and later on we will discuss the meaning of this ayah.

\`Ali ibn Hammad al-\`Adwi al-Basri al-Bagh- dadi, known as Ibn Hammad,
one of the Shi'ah poets of the fourth century of the hegira (10th/11th
century A.D.) points to the present meaning in the following poem

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قرن الاله ولاءه بولائه مما تزكى و هو حان يركع
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
سماه رب العرش نفس محمد يوم البهال و ذالك مالا يدفع
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“God brought the wila' of Ali and His wila', Because Ali, in the time
of ruku, gave zakat.*

*The Lord of the Throne gave him the name of \`the soul of Muhammad’,*

*On the day of cursing. And this is an indisputable fact.”* [^5]*&*[^6]

As we said before, a kind of wila' has been prescribed in Islam that is
positive[^7] and has an ordinary meaning, and the noble ayah;

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتُ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءُ بَعْضٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And the believers, the men and the women, are wali one to the other
(9:71).”***

Is a witness to this kind of wila'.

Now we wish to say that the noble ayah:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّمَا وَلِيُّكُمُ اللَّهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Only Allah is your Wali. (5:55).”***

states the matter in such a way that it does not carry universality. In
no way is it possible that this ayah was designed as a statement of
wila' with its ordinary, positive meaning, because the Qur'an here is
not aiming to state a universal law; it does not seek to set down the
desirability or the necessity of paying zakat at the time of ruku \`,
and lay it down as a duty, something recommended legally in the Islamic
sense as a kind of law of the shad’ah.

Rather, it is a reference to an action that took place when someone did
something in the external world, and now the Qur'an established that
action to indicate the person, and in an indirect way affirms its decree
which is this very wila' in its special meaning.

This way of saying something, when a particular event pertaining to a
specific individual is expressed using a plural, is not uncommon in the
Qur'an. For example:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَقُولُونَ لَئِنْ رَجَعْنَا إِلَى الْمَدِينَةِ لَيُخْرِجَنَّ
الْأَعَزُّ مِنْهَا الْأَذَلَّ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*** “They say: If we return to Medina, the mighty will surely drive out
the meaner therefrom (63:8)”***

Here also, the Qur'an is referring to a story which actually took place,
and it says *yaquluna* (they say) although the speaker was not more than
one person - \`Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul.

The giving of zakat during ruku\` was not something commonplace among
the Muslims, as a result of which we might say that the Qur'an praises
them all and affirms wilayah in whatever sense we say it for everyone.

This very matter is a living witness that the reference of the ayah is
individual and specific, in other words that there was someone who,
while in ruku\` and while in worship, was still not inattentive to the
slaves of Allah and thus did something, and now the Qur'an tells us:
"He, also, like Allah and His Prophet, is your wali.” Therefore, a
particular person is being discussed, and he, like Allah and the
Messenger, is also the wali of the believers, and the believers must
accept his wila'.

However, what is the purpose of this wila'? Is it only a specific love
and devotion which people should have towards that respected person, or
is it higher than that? It is this matter that we shall be discussing
before long. For the time being, let it suffice to say that contrary to
the fancy of some of the scholars of the Sunni school, the sense of this
ayah is wila' with a special meaning, not wila' in its ordinary sense.

The Kinds of Wila in its Positive Sense, With a Special Meaning
---------------------------------------------------------------

So far, as has been noted, the matter of the wila' of \`Ali (a.s.) and
the rest of the household of the Prophet is in general, not open to
doubt. Ultimately, the controversy lies in what is the intended meaning
of wila' in this ayah, and in the rest of the aayah’s and in the ahadith
(traditions) of the Prophet which were gathered together with it. In
order, so that the meaning should be clear, we consider it necessary to
discuss the special uses of the words wila' and wilayah in the Qur'an
and the sunnah which have reference to the Household (of the Prophet).
These two words are normally used in four different ways:

### A. The Wila' Of Love (Mahabbah) Or The Wila' Of Nearness (Qarabah)

The wila' of love, or the wila' of nearness, signifies that the
Household are the near relatives of the noble Prophet, and that people
are recommended to cultivate affection for them and to love them in a
special way, over and above the necessity for wila' in its ordinary
positive sense.

This is in the Qur'an, and many ahadith have also been recorded through
Shi'ah and Sunni schools about this subject, that love of the Household,
and, among them, of \`Ali (a.s.), is one of the basic precepts of Islam;
and in this connection two problems immediately crop up.

Firstly, why, with special reference to the Household, has all this been
recommended: that people should cultivate devotion to them? And is this
love and devotion a means of approaching near to God? Suppose that
everyone is acquainted with the Household of the Prophet, and that they
truly have love and devotion towards them, what is the result and
benefit of this? All Islamic precepts have a philosophical and
metaphysical reason behind them.

If a certain precept turns up in the context of Islam, it absolutely
must have its own philosophy and metaphysics. The answer to this problem
is that the exhortation to love the Household and other expressions of
the wila' of love of the House hold do have a special metaphysics; it is
not an extravagance or a foolishness, it is not (merely) a reward for
the noble Prophet or for themselves.

The noble Qur'an makes it clear through the mouth of the Prophet that
the benefit of the recompense that he is asking from us, in other words
love of his near relatives, accrues to us ourselves.

The wila' of love, is an introduction and a way to other kinds of wila'
which we want to explain. The bond of love is what really joins people
to the Household so that they can benefit from their existence, from
what they have left behind, from what they have said and what they have
taught, and from their behavior and their manner.

In our book *Jadhibah wa daf i\`ah-e A li (alayhi’s-salam)*, we have
discussed at length the virtues of love and devotion towards the pure
ones, and the ones near to Allah (*al - Haqq*), which fashion man and
are precious agents in training and stimulating his spirit and
transforming his state of mind, and here we shall not repeat ourselves.

Secondly, is the wila' of love a peculiarity of the Shi\`ahs, or is it
also believed in by other Islamic groups?

In answer, it must be said that the wila' of love is not a peculiarity
of Shi \`ites. Other Muslim groups also give importance to it. Al-Imam
ash-Shafi'i, who is one of the Imams of the Sunni schools, wrote in his
famous poems:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يا راكبـا قف بالمحصب من منى واهتف بقـاعد جمعها والناهض
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
سحرا إذا فاض الحجيج إلى منى فيضا كملتطم الفرات الفـائض
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إن كان رفضا حب آل محمــد فليشهد الثقــلان أني رافضي
  </p>
</blockquote>

*O rider, standing on the stony ground of Mind:*  
*Cry at dawn to those stopped at Khif* [^8]   
*and those bestirring,*  
*When the pilgrims are leaving for Mind,*  
*Moving like the rolling of the waves of*  
*the surging Euphrates:*  
*If love of the Household of Muhammad is a heresy (rafd )*  
*Then, jinn and men bear witness that*  
*I am a heretic (Rafidite)!* [^9]

He also wrote:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يا آل بيت الرسول حبكم فرض من الله في القرآن انزله
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يكفيكم من عظيم الفخر انكم من لم يصل عليكم لا صلاة له
  </p>
</blockquote>

*O Household of the Messenger of Allah,*  
*love for you*  
*Is an obligation from Allah,*  
*revealed in the Qur'an.*  
*It suffices as the greatest honor bestowed*  
*on you,*  
*That his prayer is as nothing who does not*  
*include in it praises to you.*

Again, he wrote:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ولـمّـا رأيــتُ الـنـاس قــد ذهـبت بـهم مـذاهـبُهم فــي أبـحـرِ
الـغـيِّ والـجـهلِ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ركـبتُ عـلى اسـم الله فـي سـفن النَّجا وهـم آلُ بـيت الـمصطفى خاتمِ
الرُّسْلِ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وأمـسـكـتُ حــبـلَ الله وهــو ولاؤهــم كــمـا قـــد أُمِــرنـا
بـالـتمسكِ بـالـحبلِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*When I saw people being taken*  
*Through their madhahib*[^10] *into seas*  
*of erring and ignorance,*  
*I set sail in the name of Allah in the ship*  
*of deliverance*  
*Which is the Household of Mustafa, the*  
*Seal of the Prophets;*  
*I grasped the rope of Allah which is their wila',*  
*As we were commanded to grasp the rope* [^11]

Az-Zamakhshari and Fakhru’d-Din ar-Razi, who in the matter of the
succession to the caliphate, came down against the Shi’as, are
themselves narrators of hadith on the subject of the wila' of love.
Ar-Razi quotes from az-Zamakhshari that the Prophet said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَلا و مَنْ مَاتَ عَلى حُبِ آلِ مُحَمًدٍ مَاتَ شَهيداً, أَلاَ ومَنْ
مَاتَ عَلى حُبِ آلِ مُحَمًدٍ مَاتَ مَغْفُوراً لَهُ, أَلاَ ومَنْ مَاتَ
عَلى حُبِ آلِ مُحَمًدٍ مَاتَ تَائِباً, أَلاَ ومَنْ مَاتَ عَلى حُبِ آلِ
مُحَمًدٍ مَاتَ مُؤْمِناً مُسْتَكْمِلَ اِلإيمانِ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Whosoever died in love of the Household of Muhammad has died a
martyr;*

*Whosoever died in love of the Household of Muhammad has died in
forgiveness; whosoever died in love of the Household of Muhammad has
died a believer and in the perfection of his faith."* [^12]

Amiru 'l-mu'minin (a. s.) has also said in Nahju 'l-balaghah, Sermon
232:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَاِنًهُ مَنْ مَاتَ مِنْكُمْ عَلى فِراشِهِ وُهُوَ عَلى مَعْرِفَة حَقَ
رَبَهِ وَ حَقّ رَسُولِهِ وَأَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ ، مَاتَ شَهيداً وَوَقَعَ
آجْرُهُ عَلى اللهِ ، واستَوْجَبَ ثَوابَ مَا نَوَى مِنْ صَالِحِ
عَمَلِهِ وَ قَامَتِ النِيَةُ مَقامِ إِصْلاتِهِ لِسَيْفِهِ .
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Whosoever from among you dies in his bed in knowledge of the truth of
his own Lord and the truth of His Messenger and his House- hold, has
died a martyr and his reward is with Allah. He will deserve the reward
for the intention of his righteous actions, and the intention will take
place of the unsheathing of the sword.”*

Ibnu l-Farid, the famous Egyptian Sufi and poet (in Arabic literature,
he is the equivalent of Hafiz in the Persian language), has said in his
famous ghazal which begins with the couplet "Driver of the caravans,
passing through the desert: With the measured pace of thy goodness,
ascend the dunes of Tayy."

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ذهب العمر ضياعا و انقضى
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
باطلا ان لم افز منك بشئ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عترة المبعوث حقا من قصى
  </p>
</blockquote>

*Life dwindles away wastefully and ends in*  
*futility*  
*If I do not attain union with you.*  
*A part from this one thing I hold nothing, but*  
*connection*  
*To the wila' of the family (of the Prophet)*  
*who was appointed from the descendents*  
*of Qusayy.*

Here, perhaps, his meaning is wila' in a most sublime sense, but it is
indisputable that he mentions wila' in the sense of love.
\`Abdu'r-Rahman Jami[^13], about whom al-Qadi Nurullah [^14] said "two
\`Abdu'r-Rahmans have injured \`Ali - \`Abdu 'r-Rahman ibn Muljam
al-Muradi [^15] and \`Abdu 'r-Rahman Jami", arranged in Persian the
famous poem of al-Farazdaq [^16] in praise of al-Imam Zaynu'l-\`Abidin
(a.s.).

It is said that someone reported from a dream that after the death of
al-Farazdaq they had asked him in the dream: "What did Allah do with
you?" He replied: "He forgave me on account of that poem I recited in
praise of \`Ali ibn al-Husayn."

Jami himself adds to this and says: "If God forgave all men for the sake
of this poem, it would not be surprising!" Jami says of Hisham ibn
\`Abdu'1-Malik who imprisoned al-Farazdaq and tortured him

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اگرش چشم راست بين بودى 
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
راست كردار و راست ‏دين بودى‏
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

  </p>
</blockquote>

*If he had right-seeking eyes,*  
*Had done goodness and had true din.*  
*He would not have opened his hand to injustice and oppression*  
*Instead of imprisonment he would have*  
*given his robe of honor.*

Therefore the Shi'ah and the Sunni do not have different views about
wila' meaning love, except for the Naasibi who hated the Household of
the Prophet, were excluded from Islamic society, and were, like the
unbelievers, condemned to vileness, and from the defilement of whose
existence, praise be to Allah, the world has become cleaned in this age.

Only a few people are now occasionally seen, who write the odd book
still endeavoring to increase the gaps between Muslims; and there are
few among ourselves. And this is the best evidence that they have no
authenticity, and that, like their associates from amongst us, they are
the tools of the infernal colonialists.

Az-Zamakhshari and ar-Razi, in a foot- note to the previous hadith,
narrate from the Prophet that he said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَلا و مَنْ مَاتَ عَلى بُغْضِ آلِ مُحَمًدٍ مَاتَ كافراً, أَلاَ ومَنْ
مَاتَ عَلى بُغْضِ آلِ مُحَمًدٍ لَمْ يَشُمً رائِحَة الجَنةِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

 *“Whosoever dies in enmity to the family of Muhammad, dies an
unbeliever. Whosoever dies in enmity of the family of Muhammad, will not
smell the scent of Paradise.”*

And al-Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَإِنً اللًه تًبارَكَ وَتَعالى لَمُ يَخْلُقْ خَلْقاً
أَنْجَسَ مِنَ الكلبِ وَ إِنَ النًاصِبَ لنا أَهْلِ البَيْتِ
لأنْجَسُ مِنْهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Allah has not created anything more unclean than the dog; and those
who oppose us, the Household, are more unclean than that.”*

We must call this kind of wila', if it is attributed to the Household of
the Prophet (we call them those who are \`entrusted with wila'), the
wila' of nearness; and if we attribute it to Muslims, from the point of
view of an obligation that they have concerning affection for the
Household, then we should say wila' of love.

This is obviously not the place to go into how the root-word wila' has
come to be used in the sense of love . . . but two more aspects should
be considered. One is whether the word wali has been used in the sense
of friend or not? The other concerns which meaning is intended when the
word wali is used in connection with the ayah of the Qur'an: ***"Surely
Allah is your wali . . ."*** (5:55) which established the wilayah of
Amiru 'l-mu'minin.

Some believe that in the Qur'an, everywhere this word is used (and it
does at first seem as if this is the case), that it has the meaning of
\`friend'. But with attention it is realized that it does not mean this.
For example, the meaning of

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا يُخْرِجُهُمْ مِنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى
النُّورِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*** “Allah is the guardian of those who believe. He brings them out of
the darkness into the light;” (2:257)***

Is not that Allah is the friend of the believers; rather that Allah,
through His own special providence, has the ranks of the believers in
His hands. Similarly, the meaning of

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَلَا إِنَّ أَوْلِيَاءَ اللَّهِ لَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ
يَحْزَنُونَ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

*** “Now surely the friends of Allah-- they shall have no fear nor shall
they grieve (10:62)”***

Is not that there is no fear for the friends of Allah. Here the word
wali is in the form of *"fa\`il"* (subject) with the meaning of
*“maf'u1"* (object) [^17]. So the meaning thus becomes:

"***Those whose guardian and the master of whose affairs is Allah are
not subject to fear and*** ***apprehension”*** (10:62).

Similarly, the meaning of the ayah:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتُ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءُ بَعْضٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And the believers, the men and the women, are awliya ' one to the
other"*** (9:71)

is not that the believers are each other’s friends; rather that the
believers are under a mutual obligation to one another, and are occupied
with each other's affairs, and considerate of each other's future. So
afterwards it says: "Bidding to good and forbidding evil."

From here the answer to the second question becomes clear. In the ayah
under discussion, the meaning is not that Allah and the Prophet and
\`Ali are your friends; rather that they are the holders of authority
and the ones with the right to be the masters of your affairs.

So, although the idea that the word wali is used with the meaning of
friend is correct, it is inconceivable that it should be restrictively
used to mean that Allah, the Prophet and \`Ali are nothing but your
friends.

From this it becomes obvious that the explanation by some of the Sunni
commentators is wrong when they say that the substance of this ayah is
not something important, rather that it just means that \`Ali is your
friend, and that \`Ali must be loved by you and be the object of your
affections (because it is in the form *\`fa\`il'* with the meaning of
\`*maf \`ul'*) .

According to this proof, the ayah:

***"And Allah is your wali."***(5:55)

Which uses wali in the positive special sense, is not just wali in the
sense of love. It is greater than this. So what kind of wila' is it? The
explanation that will be given now will clarify this matter.

### B. Wila' - Imamate

Wila' meaning Imamate and leadership; or, in other words, the position
of authority in the din (to which matters are referred for decision),
that is, a position which others should follow, should take as an
example for their actions and behavior, from whom they should learn the
precepts of the din; or yet again, supremacy (za\`amah).

Such a position is necessarily one of immunity from sin (\`ismah), and
the speech and actions of such a person are a guarantee and a proof for
others. It is this same position about which the noble Qur’an, when
talking of the Prophet, says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِمَنْ كَانَ
يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الْآخِرَ وَذَكَرَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Certainly you have in the Messenger of Allah an excellent exemplar
for him who hopes in Allah and the latter day and remembers Allah much.”
(33:21)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ اللَّهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِي يُحْبِبْكُمُ
اللَّهُ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Say: If you love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you and
forgive you your faults” (3:31)***

In this ayah, the Messenger of Allah is introduced as an exemplar to
whose behavior and morality people should conform their own behavior and
morality, and whom they should take as their precedent. And this in
itself is a proof of the Prophet's immunity from sin and error, because,
if it were possible for sin and error to proceed from him, there would
be no purpose in Allah, the Sublime, introducing him as a leader and a
precedent.

This position then, after the Prophet, passed to the Household, and,
according to a hadith which many Sunni scholars have narrated in books
on the life of the Prophet, in histories, and in their own books on
hadith from nearly thirty companions of the Prophet[^18], the Prophet
chose his Household for the leadership and Imamate.

He said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنّي تارِكٌ فِيكُمُ اَلَثَقَلَيْنِ: كِتابَ اللهِ وَ عِتْرَتي أَهْلَ
بَيْتي, وَ إِنَّهُما لَنْ يَفْتَرِقا حَتَى يَريدا عَليّ الحَوْضَ, فَلا
تَقَدَّمُوهُما
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَتَهْلكِوا, وَ لا تَقْصُرواعَنْهُما فَتَهْلكِوا, وَ لا تُعَلِّمُوهُم
فَإْنَّهُمْ اَعْلَمُ مِنْكُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“I leave among you two precious things: the Book of Allah and my
Household. These two will not be separated until they encounter me at
the pool of Kawthar (in Paradise). Do not run ahead of them, for you
will be ruined; do not neglect them, for you will be ruined. And do not
seek to instruct them, for they are wiser than you.”*

Allah appoints, and Allah says about His Book:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَا يَأْتِيهِ الْبَاطِلُ مِنْ بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَلَا مِنْ خَلْفِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*** “Falsehood shall not come to it from before it nor from behind it”.
(41:42)***

So, if the Household were associates of falseness and unrighteousness
and ignorance, and thus ceased to be the complement and twin of the
Book, and if they were not, like the Prophet, preserved and free from
sin and error, they would not have become the leaders and exemplars in
his place.

The subject matter of the hadith shows that those mentioned in it must
be individuals preserved from sin, and, as Khwajah Nasiru'd-Din at-Tusi
said, the others (i.e., the non- Shi’as) neither have anyone who is
protected from sin, nor do they claim this protection for anybody, and
so, apart from the pure Imams, the hadith has no applicability.

Ibn Hajar (al-Haytami) says:

"This saying of the Prophet - \`Do not run ahead of them, for you will
be ruined; do not neglect them, for you will be ruined; and do not seek
to instruct them, for they are wiser than you' - is a proof that whoever
from the Household reaches the highest degree of knowledge, and merits
the taking on of religious duties, is to be preferred before others."
[^19]

Al-Hafiz Abu Nu'aym narrates a hadith from Ibn \`Abbas that the Prophet
said:

“Whoever wishes that his life and death be like mine, and that he rest
in eternal Paradise, should choose \`Ali as wali after me, and take his
wali as wali, and should follow the Imams after me for they are my
descendants and were created from my clay. They are gifted with
understanding and knowledge. Woe unto those who deny their virtues and
who alienate them in kinship from me, for my intercession will never
include them." [^20]

Imamate and leadership in din, in such a sense that whatever the leader
says and whatever he does is taken as a Divine guarantee and a proof, is
a kind of wilayah, because it is an example of the right to govern,
direct and control the affairs of man.

Anyway, every teacher and mentor, in so far as he is a teacher and
mentor, is a wali, an authority and a master of the affairs of the
learner and student. What does the teacher and the mentor have, that
this right should not be given to someone sent by Allah?

The glorious ayah:

"***Only Allah is your Wali and His Messenger, and those who believe,
who keep up prayer and pay zakat while they bow in ruku'*** " (5:55)

Is a witness to this kind of wilayah. Of course, this does not mean that
this ayah does not contain some other meaning of wilayah which we shall
mention later on. It means that this ayah encompasses wila' in the sense
of Imamate, leadership and mastery over the din. This word wali, was
also used in some of the ahadith that have been quoted in the sense of
wali - Imamate.

This kind of wila', then, if it is used in connection with the Imam,
means the right to leadership and mastery in the din, but if it is used
in connection with an ordinary individual, it means acceptance of and
compliance with this right.

### C. Wila' - Za'amah

Wila', in the sense of za\`amah, is the right to social and political
leadership. Society needs a leader. That person who takes the reins of
the government of a society and directs the social affairs of man,
carries the destinies of the people, and is the ruler (waliyyu 'l-amr)
of the Muslims. The Prophet, during his lifetime, was the waliyyu 'l-amr
of the Muslims, and Allah granted him this position; and after him,
according to a great deal of irrefutable evidence, it

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*** “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from among
you;”(4:59)***

Similarly, the first ayah of surah al-Ma'idah and the hadith of Ghadir,
together with the whole of the ayah:

***"Certainly Allah is your Wali . . ."*** (5:55), and the whole of the
ayah,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
النَّبِيُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“The Prophet has a greater claim on the faithful than they have on
themselves”(33:6)***

concern the same kind of wilayah.

In so far as the Prophet did have such a rank, and in so far as this
unique rank was a Divine one, that it to say, it was a Divine obligation
with which Allah had favored the Prophet, and it was not conferred on
him by the people, thus far there is no argument between the Shi\`ahs
and Sunnis; up to this point our Sunni brothers are with us.

The problem now arises as to what, after the Prophet, the commandment
was concerning wilayah-za \`amah. In order that there should be no
social instability, and that chaos should not intervene, individual
people must submit to someone who is worthy to be called the ruler, the
waliyyu 'l-amr.

What is the commandment concerning such a position? Did Islam make a
specific commandment about this matter, or did it choose to remain
completely silent? And if it did make a specific commandment, what was
it? Or did it leave the choice to the people to elect after the Prophet
anyone they wanted to, and is obedience to him then an obligation to
others (who did not elect him)? Or did the Prophet nominate a specific
person before his death to take his place in this great and important
position?

Here we shall go into the Prophet's social dealings among his ummah
according to what can be inferred from the Qur'an. From the Qur’an, and
from the sunnah as well and the life of the Prophet, it can be shown
that in this matter the Prophet held together in his person three
positions among the Muslims.

First, he was the Imam, the leader and the authority in the din; he held
the wilayah of the Imamate, and his speech and actions were his
guarantee and his proof.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانْتَهُوا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it, and from whatever he
forbids you, keep back” (59:7)***

Second, he held juridical wilayah; in other words, his judgment was
binding in legal differences and internal disputes.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ
بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنْفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِمَّا قَضَيْتَ
وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا 
  </p>
</blockquote>

*** “But no! by your Lord! they do not believe (in reality) until they
make you a judge of that which has become a matter of disagreement among
them, and then do not find any straitness in their hearts as to what you
have decided and submit with entire submission” (4:65)***

Of course, it is true that in this case, it is also an example of the
previous instance of the use of the term wilayah, but we have not yet
seen this term actually used in the meaning of juridical wilayah...

Third, he had social and political wilayah. That is, apart from being
the explainer and propagator of the commands, and apart from being the
judge for the Muslims, he was the statesman and the ruler of the Muslim
community, he was the waliyyu 'l-amr of the Muslims and the holder of
authority in the Muslim community, as we have said before:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
النَّبِيُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*** “The Prophet has a greater claim on the faithful than they have on
themselves”. (33:6)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from among
you” (4:59)***

are relevant here. Of course, the Prophet held a fourth rank also, which
we shall mention later.

The Prophet formally governed the people, and he was the leader of the
policies of the Islamic community. According to this ayah:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ صَدَقَةً تُطَهِّرُهُمْ وَتُزَكِّيهِمْ بِهَا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Take alms out of their property, you would cleanse them and purify
them thereby” (9:103)***

He took taxes from the people; he administered the financial and
economic affairs of the Islamic community.

This situation, from the three kinds of positions that the Prophet held,
is a basis for the discussion of the caliphate. It is necessary to say
here that the word 'Imamate', as well as having the meaning of
leadership, is also used to mean a leader in reaching the ways of the
din; that is to say, the word "Imam" is said and understood as \`someone
from whom one should obtain the ways of the din', and the Sunni Muslims
generally apply the word \`Imam' to Abu Hanifah, ash-Shafi'i, Malik and
Ahmad ibn Hanbal. It is also much used in the sense of social and
political leadership.

The Prophet said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ثَلَاثٌ لَا يُغِلُّ عَلَيْهِنَّ قَلْبُ امْرِئٍ مُسْلِمٍ: إِخْلَاصُ
الْعَمَلِ لِلَّهِ, وَالنُّصْحَةُ لِأَئِمَّةِ الْمُسْلِمِينَ، وَلُزُومُ
جَمَاعَتِهِمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“In connection with three things, the heart of a Muslim will never
permit treachery and doubt. Purity of intention before Allah, wishing
good for a leader (Imam) of the Muslims in the way of leading the
Muslims, (and) support for the community of Muslims.”*

\`Ali, peace be upon him, in one of his letters which are recorded in
Nahju 'l-balaghah says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ أَعْظَمَ الْخِيَانَةِ خِيَانَةُ الْأُمَّةِ و أَفْظَعَ الْغِشِّ
غِشُّ الْأَئِمَّةِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The greatest treachery is treachery to the community, and the most
abominable deceit is deceit with the leaders (Imams) of the community”*

The result of this deceit is against the Muslims. If the captain of a
ship steers the ship on a good course, and then someone comes who
misleads the captain and involves the ship in some danger, he has not
only been treacherous to the captain, and he has betrayed all those on
board the ship. In this sentence, then, the word \`Imam' is used in the
sense of social leader.

In the history of Islam we read that the Muslims, even those who
acknowledged the true Imams, addressed the caliphs of their time using
the word Imam. The problem is that an Imam in this meaning is sometimes
an Imam of justice and sometimes an Imam of oppression and the Muslims
have (different) obligations when faced by each one of these.

The Prophet said, in an authentic hadith reported by both schools:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَفْضَلُ الْجِهَادِ كَلِمَةُ عَدْلٍ عِنْدَ سُلْطَانٍ جَائِرٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The most excellent jihad is (to utter) a word of justice in front of
an oppressor.”*

And, similarly, the .Prophet said

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
آفَةُ الدِّينِ ثَلاثَة: إِمَامٌ جَائِرٌ, وَ مُجْتَهِدٌ جاهِلٌ,
وَعاَلِمٌ فاجِرٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The blight of the din is three things. Oppressive leader (Imam),
ignorant worshipper of Allah, and a sinful \`alim (scholar).”*

More important than this, in the Qur'an itself leaders are mentioned who
invite people to the Fire of Gehenna, and they are also designated by
the word of Imam.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَدْعُونَ إِلَى النَّارِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And we made them Imams who call to the fire. (28:41)***

Of course, there is no doubt that usually the word \`Imam' or \`Imams'
is applied to just and pious leaders, and in Shi'ite parlance, the word
is applied to those who lead to Allah who are immune from sin and these
are only twelve.

### D. Wila'-Tasarruf

Wila '-tasarruf (free universal determination), or spiritual wila', is
the highest of the stages of wilayah. The other kinds of wilayah are
either connected to the degree of nearness to the Prophet, to the
abundance of the loftiness of the degree of purity, or to the stature of
an individual of the Household, or else they are connected to their
social or cognitive knowledge. That which has been designated by the
word wilayah in the two last sections did not stretch beyond the limits
of legislation and administration, although the origin and foundation of
the philosophy behind this administration is social and cognitive
authority.

However, w ila'-tasarruf, or spiritual wila' is a kind of extraordinary
creative ability and mastery. First we must see what the meaning and
semantics of wilayah-tasarruf are, and what the ideas of those who
believe in it are.

The concept of creative wilayah, from one angle, is connected with
hidden faculties in this creature who appeared on the face of the earth
with the name of man, and with accomplishments which this amazing
creature is potentially capable of, and which he can bring up to the
level of action.

From another angle, it is connected with the relationship of this
creature to Allah. The purpose of creative wilayah is that man, as a
result of travelling on the way of submission, achieves the station of
Divine nearness, any the result of his arrival at the station of
nearness, naturally to the higher stages of it, that is, human
spirituality, which is itself truth and reality, becomes the leader of
the caravan of spirituality, the commander of the hearts, the testifier
of actions and the Proof of the Age (Hujjatu 'z-zaman).

The earth is never void of a wali, who is the bearer of this
spirituality; or, using a different expression, of the Perfect Man
(al-Insanu l-kamil).Wilayah in this meaning is different from prophet
hood, different from the caliphate, different from guardianship
(wilayah), and different from the Imamate when it has the meaning of an
authority in the commandments of the din. Its difference from prophet
hood, the caliphate and guardianship is an absolute one, but from
Imamate it has a conceptual and mentally creative difference.

The meaning of its difference from prophet hood, the caliphate and
guardianship being absolute is not that everyone who became a prophet, a
caliph or guardian was not a wali, rather, it means that prophet hood,
and also the caliphate and guardianship are realities different from
wilayah. Notwithstanding this, the great proph- ets, and especially
their Seal, were possessors of universal Divine wilayah.

And the meaning of its difference from Imamate being mentally created is
that there is only one station. Considering it from one direction it is
called Imamate, and from another direction it is called wilayah. But the
meaning of Imamate is a wide one.

Imamate means leadership, but an authority in the commandments of the
din is a leader; a political and social leader is also a leader; and a
teacher of the inner self, a spiritual guide, is also a leader for the
innermost heart.

From the Shi\`ite point of view, from which the question of wilayah is
under consideration, it can be viewed from three aspects; and in each of
the three aspects the word Imamate has been used.

Firstly, from the political point of view, who was the person who most
merited and was fittest to assume the place of the Prophet in social and
political leadership of the Muslims? And who had to be the leader (z
a\`im) of the Muslims after the Prophet? There is also the fact that the
Prophet, on behalf of Allah, appointed \`Ali to that social position.
This point of view, in the present instance, has a historical and
dogmatic aspect, and is not being looked at from the point of view of
pure knowledge.

Secondly, as far as the commandments of the din are concerned, on whom
does the authority for reference fall? And in which way has this person
acquired his knowledge? And is this person incapable of erring as far as
the commandments are concerned, or not? This aspect has a dogmatic side
to it as well as being a question of knowledge.

Thirdly, from the point of view of the spirit and the inner self, the
Shi\`ite view is that at all times there is no Perfect Man who has the
power of penetrating what is hidden, and he is a witness for the
spirits, the souls and the hearts, and he has a kind of creative control
over the world and over man. He is always in existence, and for this
reason he is called hujjah - proof, guarantee.

As was said, the ayah: ***"The Prophet has a greater claim on the
believers than they have on themselves" (33:6)*** is not very far from
this subject, and it also bears witness to this meaning of wilayah.

The meaning of wilayah-tasarruf or creative wilayah is not what some
ignoramuses have supposed, namely, that one man from humanity obtained
the position of guardianship and protector ship with regard to the world
in such a way that he becomes the turner of the earth and the heavens,
the creator, the sustainer, the life giver, and the bringer of death on
behalf of Allah.

Although Allah arranged the world according to the regularity of cause
and effect, and although creatures which the Qur'an calls angels were,
by Allah's permission, ***"those who regulate the affair" (79:5)*** and
***"the partitioners"(51:4),*** this consideration is in no way
contradictory with Allah's not taking a partner in His supreme authority
and creative power: and, similarly, it does not contradict the fact that
no being can ever be deemed a wali in the sense of a companion or an
assistant to Allah or even a tool or instrument of Allah.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ شَرِيكٌ فِي الْمُلْكِ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ وَلِيٌّ

  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Who has not a partner in the kingdom, and Who has not a helper to
save Him from disgrace; and proclaim His greatness magnifying (Him)”
(17:111)***

The relationship of the created to the Creator is not anything other
than, absolute dependence and nothingness. The Qur'an, in the same way
as it makes Allah known to the highest limit of self-sufficiency, and in
the same way as it says, for examples;

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اللَّهُ يَتَوَفَّى الْأَنْفُسَ حِينَ مَوْتِهَا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Allah takes the souls at the time of their death.” (39:42)***

Also proclaims:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْ يَتَوَفَّاكُمْ مَلَكُ الْمَوْتِ الَّذِي وُكِّلَ بِكُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Say: The angel of death who is given charge of you shall cause you
to die.”(32:11)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الَّذِينَ تَتَوَفَّاهُمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ ظَالِمِي أَنْفُسِهِمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Those whom the angels cause to die while they are unjust to
themselves.” (16:28)***

The Qur'an, at the same time as it says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ رَبِّي عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَفِيظٌ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Surely my Lord is the Preserver of all things” (11:57)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَيُرْسِلُ عَلَيْكُمْ حَفَظَةً حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءَ أَحَدَكُمُ
الْمَوْتُ تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“He sends keepers over you; until when death comes to one of you, Our
messengers cause him to die.” (6:61)***

In this ayah, He distinguishes the prophets both as guardians and also
as takers of souls.

So, from the point of view of tawhid (Divine Unity), there is nothing
preventing the existence of means, or the ascribing of the carrying out
of commands to other than Allah, but by the permission of Allah and by
the will of Allah, in such a way that those who carry out and execute
are themselves the very command and will of the Lord.

At the same time, good Islamic thinking firs of all requires that we do
not associate the creation, and giving and taking of life, and instances
of these, to other than Allah; because the Qur'an forces us to pierce
through the ways and the means and to gain access to the original
source, to turn our attention to Him Who accomplishes the labor of the
whole world, to see that the means are His creation, the execution of
His command, and the manifestation of His wisdom.

Secondly, the order of the universe is, from the point of view of means,
a special order which Allah created, and man will never, as the result
of his own evolution; take the place of any of the means of Divine
bounty. Rather, he himself will take the bounty through these very
means; that is to say, an angel will inspire him, and an angel will
become an agent of his preservation, and an agent of the taking away of
his soul. And yet at the same time it is possible that the station of
nearness and freedom of existence of that man be sometimes higher and
greater than that of the angel who is an agent for him.

Another matter is that we cannot exactly determine the limits of the
wilay ah-tasarruf, or creative wilayah of a perfect or comparatively
perfect man. That is to say that all the indications of the Qur'an and
the knowledge that we have verified, in short, the arrival of man at a
level at which his will has a determining control over the universe; but
to what extent? Is there no limit, or is there a restriction to the
extent? This is a matter which is outside our present undertaking.

The third matter which it is necessary to mention is that
wilayah-tasarruf is a question of a degree of obedience which has become
entirely cleared of material thoughts. This power is not a power which
we call a desire of the heart, or a function of the mind, or someone's
willful desire. Basically, a man who is still condemned to the thoughts
and desires of his fancy is deprived of such wonders.

In a man who is pure to this extent, his will is never excited by the
beginning and preliminaries that excite our will; his will is excited by
inward stimulation and beckoning’s from the unseen. But how and what is
the nature of this stimulation and beckoning we do not know, and so such
a man "sometimes sits in the highest heaven" and "sometimes does not see
as far as his instep. [^21]

However, according to what was revealed in the ayah of the Qur'an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْ لَا أَمْلِكُ لِنَفْسِي نَفْعًا وَلَا ضَرًّا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Say: I do not control any benefit or harm for my own
soul.”(7:188)***

It is clear that this means that the original power for all profit and
hurt is Allah, and that my ability to profit and hurt myself is also
from Allah, not from myself. Anyway, how could it be possible for other
men to be, within limits, the masters of their profit and hurt, and for
the Prophet to be even less so than other men.

It was necessary to raise these three points in the introduction to the
discussion of creative wilayah. Since there has been less discussion on
this subject, and, moreover, since there are a number of assertions
which stimulate interest and which we shall put forward on this topic,
we shall extend the discussion about this matter a little further.

We confess that the acceptance of wilayah in this meaning is a little
difficult; believing in it is not without its problems, especially
since, for our level of understanding, so many explanations for such
problems are not satisfying. From time to time people expose the
difficulties of the problem and the way in which it is rejected in this
manner, at present, with all the urgent and pressing problems that there
are for Muslims, what is the necessity of introducing such difficulties
as to whether the Prophet and the Imams have wilayah-tasarruf or not?"

Some others bring forth their objections and difficulty in another
manner which has a religious coloring, and they say that this is an
exaggeration, and it is believed to be a super-human, semi-divine degree
for a man to have: it associates the work of Allah with what is other
than Allah, so it is shirk (associating with Allah) and is in opposition
to the first Islamic fundamental which is tawhid.

The fact of the matter is that we cannot either accept or refute a
matter just by ourselves; whether a concept entails shirk or conforms to
tawhid is not a matter for our desire or free-will, so that anything we
want to stick the word tawhid onto we can. There are many precise
criteria in the Qur’an and from the proofs of reason. Islamic teachings
on matters concerned with shirk and tawhid emanate from the summit and
the highest-degree of self-mastery, beyond the conceptualization of the
ordinary individual.

The question of whether one matter is more urgent and more pressing than
another is also a fundamental matter, but it is not the only criterion
of necessity that one matter in one epoch is discussed more, and so more
people have the impression of its necessity. It is a mistake if we
always imagine that the impressions of necessity are the same as the
necessities themselves.

To what extent the Qur'an emphasizes a matter in the presentation of a
problem and in its teaching is in itself a criterion which must at all
times be something to be made use of. The problem of creative wilayah is
one of the problems associated with man and human powers. The Qur'an
lends great importance to man, human powers and the extraordinary
aspects of his nature, and, in discussions which we shall, insha'Allah,
set forth in our book “Man in the Qur'an”[^22], we shall deal with this
subject.

Here, it is sufficient that we give a summary indication of this problem
and make clear the foundations of this idea, with attention to the
meaning and understanding of the Qur'an; so that the ordinary person
should not imagine that this is, so to speak, an "occult” subject.

With this kind of problem, which may sometimes seem irrelevant to our
understanding, we get nearer to the truth if we find fault within
ourselves rather than if we reject the matter.

There is no doubt that the subject of wilayah in its fourth meaning
belongs to gnosis (\`irfan), but it has not been proved that since
something belongs to gnosis, it must be declared null and void. This
matter belongs to gnosis, which, from the point of view of Shi\`ism, is
also an Islamic matter. Shi'ism is a school of Islam, and \`irfan is a
way; at this point this school and this way (irrespective of the
superstitions with which the latter is cluttered) coincide with one
another.

And if, necessarily, it is agreed that it be said that one of these two
was derived from the other, by the verdict of indisputable historical
circumstances it is definitely \`irfan which produced an adaptation of
Shi\`ism and not the other way round. In any case, we shall explain the
foundations and bases of this consideration in an abridged form.

The most important problem which must be dealt with in this area is the
problem of nearness and approach to Allah. We know that in Islam,
perhaps in every revealed religion, the spirit of the precepts which
must be carried out is a determination to \`approach near', and the
extreme result which can be attained through action is proximity to the
essence of Oneness. So we shall begin the discussion itself with the
meaning and understanding of \`nearness'.
