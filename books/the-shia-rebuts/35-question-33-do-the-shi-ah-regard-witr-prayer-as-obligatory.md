Question 33 : Do the Shi‘ah regard witr prayer as obligatory?
=============================================================

**Reply:** *Witr* prayer is part of the supererogatory night prayers and
it is one of the recommended {*mustahabb*} works which the Muslims who
follow the Messenger of Allah (S) perform, but the Shi‘ah jurists
{*fuqaha*} who rely on the Book of Allah and the Prophet’s *Sunnah* say
that the *witr* prayer is one of the things which are incumbent on no
one except the Holy Prophet (S).

In his book, *Tadhkirah al-Fuqaha*, ‘Allamah al-Hilli enumerates about
70 salient features of the Prophet (S) and at the beginning of his
statement, he thus says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فأما الواجبات عليه دون غيره من أمّته أمور أ: السّواك ب: الوتر ج:
الأضحيه. روي عنه صلى الله عليه وأله وسلم أنه قال: ثلاث كتب عليّ ولم
تكتب عليكم: السواك والوتر والأضحية.
  </p>
</blockquote>

As for the things which are incumbent only upon him (S) and not upon his
*ummah*, they are: the use of tooth-stick {*miswak*}, *witr* prayer, and
offering sacrifice {*adhiyah*}. He (S) is reported to have said: “Three
things were made incumbent upon me but not you: the use of tooth-stick
{*miswak*}, *witr* prayer and offering sacrifice.”[^1]

Consequently, according to the Shi‘ah *witr* prayer is obligatory
{*wajib*} upon the Holy Prophet (S) and it is recommended {*mustahabb*}
upon the other Muslims.
