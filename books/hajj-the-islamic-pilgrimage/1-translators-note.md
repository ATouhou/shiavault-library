**In The Name of Allah, The Most Compassionate, The Most Merciful**

All Praise Is Due To Allah, The Lord of The Worlds. May The Peace And
Blessings of Allah Be Upon Muhammad And His Pure Progeny.

This is the third book of its kind I have translated into English for
Ansariyan Publications. The other two books are *Uddatul Da’i* by Allama
Hilli and *Ethos of Prophets* by Taaj Langaroodi.

It is an honor for me to translate a book into English on Hajj, a
religious duty that prepares man for his spiritual journey towards God.
The present book not only discusses the physical acts of Hajj rites but
also elaborates on the spiritual and mystical aspects of this divine
ritual, which has greatly impressed mm.

Like a mystic poet who has to go through seven cities of love, namely
quest, love, gnosis, detachment, unity, amazement, and finally
annihilation in order to become united with the Beloved, the pilgrim of
God’s house too has to go though seven stages similar to the seven
cities of love in order to be received by God.

This book can serve as a handbook for the pilgrims who wish to have more
knowledge about the physical and spiritual aspects of Hajj.

The translation of this book is dedicated to the souls of my parents,
Safar ‘Ali Aghili and Roghayyeh Aghili as well as my sister, Ghamar
Aghili, may their souls rest in peace forever.

Aghili Ashtiani
