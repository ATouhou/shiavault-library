The Thirteenth Spurious Argument: Loving the Prophet’s Family
=============================================================

Some people spuriously argue that the Shia love the Prophet's family
more than Allah and His Messenger Muhammad (s), and they believe that
their love for them is enough to get them into Paradise and save them
from Hell.

The Answer
----------

This is a great fabrication. The Shias love the Prophet’s family simply
because they are the family of the Prophet (s) and for the sake of their
love for the Prophet. Their love for the Prophet is simply because he is
the Messenger of Allah. Therefore, it is irrational for the Shia to love
the Prophet’s family more than they love the Prophet, and it is also
irrational for them to love the Prophet more than they love Allah.
