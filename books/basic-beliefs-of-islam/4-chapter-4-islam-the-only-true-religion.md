Chapter 4 : Islam - the Only True Religion
==========================================

Though the followers of every religion say that their religion is the
only true religion, but none other than Muslims can prove it rationally.
Let's give some strong points in suppor t of our belief that no one can
disprove them on valid grounds.

1. Muslims never claim that Islam is a new religion, but believe that
it is the first and the oldest religion which was revealed to the first
man and the first Prophet, Adam (as ) who arrived on the planet earth by
the order of Allah Subhanahu taala.

2. Muslims believe in the basic teachings of Prophet Ibrahim (as),
Prophet Musa (as), Prophet Isa (as) and assert that Prophet Muhammed was
the last prophet of all prophets who testified and completed the Divine
message. i.e. all prophets from Hazrat Adam (as) to Hazrat Muhammad (sws
) have the same basic beliefs.

3. The Holy Quran is the only Divine book which is present in its
original form and has never been slightly changed or adulterated or
corrupted in anyway. No other book claimed as Divine book is available
in its original form or in the same language in which it was revealed.

4. Islam covers each and every aspect of human life and gives complete
guidance in every field of human interest. It has complete code of
perfect life. No other religion has such complete course of social
laws.

5. The basic beliefs and social laws of Islam never collide with each
other. Also, the basic beliefs and fundamental teachings of Islam and
the established facts of science show compatibility with each other.
This is not true with any other religion of the world.

6. Islam tells us very clearly, from where we have come, why we are
here, and where we will ultimately go. Islam clearly defines the aim of
our creation and the purpose of our life. All other religions do not
answer these basic questions so clearly.

7. Islam is the only true monotheistic religion which teaches us to
believe in the absolute oneness of God.

Christians claim that they believe in one God but they also believe in
trinity, i.e. they say 1+1+1 =1 which is not correct. Similarly Hindus
claim that they also believe in one God but they worship many gods.

We shall now prove that the original teachings of Judaism, Christianity
and many other religions testify the basic beliefs of Islam. These
religions are now different because they have been changed by the people
to fulfill their selfish demands.

**The original Judaism and Christianity verify Islam**

Followers of Judaism are known as Jews. Judaism in its original form
was nothing but Islam. Jews still believe in Hazrat Moosa (Moses) who
was a true messenger of Allah.

The name of Hazrat Musa (as) has appeared 136 times in 37 different
chapters of the Holy Quran. Hazrat Moosa (as) is among the five great
prophets. Allah Subhanahu taala has admired his sincere efforts and
great contribution in the Quran.

And mention in the Book Musa. For He ( Hazrat Musa ) was an apostle, a
prophet , and a chosen man. (19:51) Hazrat Musa ( as ) preached to his
nation, the Ten Commandments, which are described in the Holy Quran. He
taught his people that, There is no god except Allah and I (Musa) am His
messenger.

Just as the Holy Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (sws), Torah (
Taurait ) was revealed to Hazrat Musa ( as ). Quran has confirmed that
Taurat was a true Divine book which was revealed to the Prophet Musa (as
).

"He has revealed to you the Book with the truth, confirming what
preceded it; and he has already revealed the Torah (Laws of Moses) and
the Gospel (of Jesus) for the guidance of mankind, and the distinction
between right and wrong." (3:3)

"It was We who revealed the Torah (law to Moosa): therein was guidance
and light". (5:44) But today the religious book of Jews, the first five
books of the Bible, which is called the Pentateuch or the Old Testament
or the Torah, is not the same book which was revealed to Hazrat Moosa
(as ).

Thus Muslims believe that Taurait, the original religious book of Jews,
is a true Divine book which was revealed to Hazrat Musa (as ) from Allah
but do not recognize the present Torah as a Divine book as it has been
changed.

It is important to note that some of the unchanged traditions of Hazrat
Musa (as) which Jews could not change and which they still observe are
present in Islam. For example;

a - Jews still practice circumcision which is also compulsory in
Islam.
b - Jews do not eat pork which is also strictly forbidden in Islam.
c - Jews do not eat shrimps, and other kinds of shellfish.
d - Jews follow certain acts of Islamic slaughtering.
e - Jews spiritual leaders Rabbis keep beard and cover their head.
f - Jews observe burial formalities as soon as possible.

It is intersting to note that Christians, who also recognise Hazrat
Musa as the Prophet of God and consider Torah as the part of their Bile
do not follow any of the above laws. Jews also believe in Hazrat Ibrahim
( as ), the great prophet of Islam and the ancestor of the Holy Prophet
of Islam Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa (sws ).

The grandson of Hazrat Ibrahim (as ) was Hazrat Yaqoob ( Jacob ), who
was also called Israel. He had 12 sons. They founded the 12 tribes that
became the Israelites. Over a period of time, many of them (the
descendants of Hazrat Yaqoob) settled in Egypt, where they eventually
became slaves. In the 1200's B.C, Hazrat Musa (as) freed them from the
captivity of Firaun ( Pharaoh ) and led them out of Egypt to Cannon
(Palestine ).

It is unfortunate that the followers of Hazrat Musa and the descendants
of Hazrat Yaqoob and Hazrat Ibrahim (as) were the staunch enemies of the
Holy Prophet (sws) Similarly the followers of Christianity are known as
Christians.

Christians claim that Christianity is based on the life and teachings
of Hazrat Isa (Jesus Christ). They believe that God sent Hazrat Isa as
the savior of mankind.

But Christianity in its original form was nothing but Islam. Hazrat Isa
(as ) taught his people that God is one and He has no par tner, no son,
no father and that he is his messenger. Today Christians believe that
Hazrat Isa is son of God and is a par t of God. They call him the lord
of the universe and associate him with God. This is totally against the
tr ue and original teaching of Hazrat Isa (as ).

The Quran tells us very clearly that Hazrat Isa (as ) did not say what
Christians believe but he said what we Muslim believe. Quran also
confirms that the true followers of Hazrat Isa (as) were Muslims.

"And behold! I inspired the disciples to have faith in Me and Mine
messenger: They said, We have faith and do thou bear witness that we bow
to Allah as Muslims." (5:111) "Then Allah (S.W.T) will say: Isa, son of
Mariam, did you ever say to mankind: 'Worship me and my mother as gods
besides Allah?

"Glory to You,' he will answer, 'how could I say that to which I have
no right? If I had ever said so, You would surely have known it. You
know what is in my mind, but I can not tell You what is in Yours. You
alone know what is hidden. I spoke to them nothing except what You bade
me. (I said): 'Serve Allah (S.W.T), my Lord and your Lord'.

I watched over while living in their midst, and ever since You took me
to You, You Yourself have been watching over them. You are the witness
of all things. If You punish them, they surely are Your servants; and if
You forgive them, surely You are Mighty Wise." (5: 116-118) This shows
that the Christian's claim that they follow the teachings of Hazrat Isa
is not correct. Hazrat Isa had never taught what Christians believe
today.

Thus the true followers of Hazrat Isa are not Christians but Muslims.
Muslims also believe that Injil was the Divine Book which was revealed
to Hazrat Isa by Allah (S.W.T). The present Bible (New Testament) which
Christians believe as a Divine Book is not the original Divine Book
(Injil) which was revealed to Hazrat-e-Isa.

Thus, Muslims strongly believe that Hazrat Isa was the true messenger
of Allah (S.W.T) who taught the basic beliefs and teachings of Islam.
Today Christians do a lot of things which are totally against the
teaching of Hazrat Isa. The religious center of Christianity is Rome,
which was never even visited by him. Thus, history shows that
Christianity has no connection with Hazrat Isa and his basic
teachings.

Thus, both Jews and Christians claim that their religion is based on
monotheism, but they don't believe in the absolute oneness of God. Quran
reveals:

"The Jews call Uzayr a son of God, and the Christians call Christ the
son of God. That is a saying from their mouth. They imitate what the
unbelievers of old times used to say.

Allah's curse be on them, "How they are deluded away from the truth."
(9:30) The religions such as Hinduism and Zoroastriaanisim etc., have
been so badly changed that it is difficult to trace out their origin. We
can not say anything about their original teachings and original beliefs
Buddhism, Jainism, Confucianism, Shintoism, and Sikhism are the thoughts
of human minds and cannot be considered as Divine religion.
