Story no. 20: Girls of the house and helping their mother
=========================================================

Narjis was a good girl and her parents were contented with her.  
 But her sister, Mubaraka was jealous of Narjis. She used to say “I
don’t know why mother and father love you so much more than me”.  
 When she asked her mother, mother replied “Because Narjis revises her
lessons and helps me in all household jobs”.  
 Mubaraka thought that from now on she would also revise her lessons and
help her mother in all household jobs too.  
 Parents, too, must pay attention whether their children are, with the
help of the people inside the house, revising the lessons taught in
classes or not.
