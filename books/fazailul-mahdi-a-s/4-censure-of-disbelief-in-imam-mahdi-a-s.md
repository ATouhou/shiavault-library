Censure of Disbelief in Imam Mahdi (a.s.)
=========================================

The Holy Prophet (S.A.W.S.) said,"One who disbelieves in the Qaem from
my sons, disbelieves in me."(Kamaaluddin Vol.2 Pg.412)

The Holy Prophet (S.A.W.S.) said,"The Qaem is from my Progeny (sons).
His name is my name. And his kunniyat (agnomen) is my kunniyat. And his
appearance is (like) my appearance. And his behaviour is (like) my
behaviour. He will establish among the people my practice and my
shariat. And he will call them towards the book of his Lord, the High
and the Mighty. One who obeys him has obeyed me. And one who denies his
'ghaibat' has denied me." (Kamaaluddin Vol.2. Pg.411)Imam Jafar as Sadiq
(A.S.) said:"One who believes in all Imams (A.S.) from my forefathers
and my sons, but denies Al Mahdi from my sons. He is like the one who
believes in all the Prophets and denies Muhammad, sallallaho Alaihe wa
Aalehi." (Kamaaluddin Vol.2. Pg. 338 and 411)

**Lineage Of Imam Mahdi (A.S.)**

The Holy Prophet (SA.W.S.) said, "Al Mahdi is from us, Ahlul
Bayt."(Sunan Ibne Majah .VoL2 Pg.23, Al Mustadrak Vol. 4 Pg. 557) The
Holy Prophet (SA.W.S.) said,"Certainly, Ali Ibne Abi Talib Alaihis
salaam is the Imam of my ummat and my vicegerant upon them after me. And
of his sons is Al Qaem, Al Montazar. One, through whom Allah will fill
the earth will justice and equity like it would have been filled with
injustice and tyranny."(Kamaaluddin Vol.1 Pg.288. Faraidus simtain Vol.2
Pg. 335/336)

"Al Mahdi is from the sons of Fatima."(Sunan Ibne Majah Vol.2 Pg.24)
Huzaifa says The Holy Prophet (SA.W.S.) has said, "Even if one day
remains for this world (to come to an end) Allah will prolong that day
until he sends a man from my progeny (sons). His name shall be (like) my
name." Salman asked, "From which of your sons, O Prophet of Allah?"He
(SA.W.S.) replied, "From this son of mine", and thumped his hands upon
Husain (A.S.)"(Zakhaerul Uqba Pg.136 & 137: Faraidus Simtain Vol.2
Pg.326)A Jew, named Nathal asked the Holy Prophet (SA.W.S.),"Inform me
as to who is your successor? Because every Prophet had a successor and
our Prophet Musa Ibne Imran (A.S.) had designated Yusha Bin Nun as his
successor."

The Holy Prophet (S.A.W.S.) replied, "Yes my Vasi and the caliph after
me is Ali bin Abi Talib and after him my grandsons Hasan and Husain,
followed by nine of the offsprings of Husain. They are the holy
Imams."

The Jew said, "O Muhammed, tell me their names." 'Yes,' said the
Prophet (S.A.W.S.), "When Husain will pass away, then his son Ali, and
after Ali his son Muhammed and after Muhammed his son Jafar and after
Jafar his son Musa and after Musa his son Ali and after Ali, his son
Muhammed and after Muhammed his son Ali after Ali his son Hasan and
after Hasan his son Hujjat Ibnul Hasan. These are the twelve Imams.
Their number is equal to the chiefs of Bani Israel"(Faraidus Simtain
Vol.2 Pg.133, Kifayatul Asar Pg.13 & 14. Yanabiul Mawaddah Pg. 441)

**Similarity Of Imam Mahdi (A.S.) To The Prophets (A.S.)**

The Holy Prophet (S.A.W.S.) said, "Al Mahdi is from my progeny. His
name is the same as my name. And his kunniyat is the same as my
kunniyat. In his physique and character he looks exactly like me. He
will be in a state of occultation and there will be confusion (Hayra) in
which people will wander about (deviate). Then he will come forth like a
sharpy shooting star to fill the earth will justice and equity as it was
filled before with injustice and inequity."(Kamaaluddin Vol.1 Pg.286.
Faraidus Simtain Vol.2 Pg.335)

Imam Muhammed Al Baqir (A.S.) said,"Certainly in the Qaem of the
Progeny of Muhammed (S.A.W.S.) is the similarity to five prophets, Yunus
bin Mutah, and Yusuf bin Yaqoob, and Musa, and Isa and Muhammed,
salawatullahe Alaihim"

Thus, his similarity to Yunus bin Mutha is his reappearance after
Ghaibat. He looked like a young man inspite of his advanced age.And, his
similarity with Yusuf bin Yaqoob (A.S.) is his ghaibat when he was away
from the sight of the general, as well as the special people; due to the
fear of his brothers.His affair was hidden from his father. And in such
a condition when there was no distance between his father and family and
his friends.And his similarity with Musa (A.S.) is persistent fear, and
his prolonged ghaibat and a secret birth, and the feverent pleas of his
shias after him, and his return by the permission of Allah, and his
assistance by the people in subduing of the enemy.And his similarity to
Isa (A.S.) is the controversy among the people with regard to him. A
group of them says; 'He is not yet bom.' Another group says, "He is
dead\* and some say: "He was killed and crucified,"And his similarity
with his own grandfather, Mustafa (S.A.W.S.), is his advent with the
sword. He shall slay the enemies of Allah and the Holy Prophet
(S.A.W.S.), and the unjust, and the tyrants."(Kamaaluddin Vol.1
Pg.327)

Imam as-Sajyad (A.S.) said,"In the Qaem is a similarity to Nuh (AS.)
and that is his long life."(Kamaaluddin Vol.1, Pg.322. & Vol.2.
Pg.524)
