Introduction:
=============

***In the Name of Allah The Beneficent, The Merciful***

This booklet includes practical lessons from some opening verses of
chapter 48 of the Holy Quran. These are manipulated and presented in an
ugly way to the world. Islam is not about bloodshed nor is it about
massacre of women’s’ rights; it is about brotherhood and it is about
setting a certain norm in the society where the people can share and
practice this glorious religion in a friendly and favorable
environment.   In this short booklet you will find a clear concept of
war and peace in Islam and a clear picture of victory in Islam and how
this good religion propagates its message.
