72: Sprites (jinn)
==================

This graphic chapter was revealed after The Heights 7 and following the
Prophet 's apparently unsuccessful mission to the mountain town of Ta!if
(or Tayif) 50 miles to the southeast of Mecca. This event took place in
620 A. D.. or two years before the Hijra or his Transfer to Madina. It,
like the previous chapter. contains 28 Meccan verses arranged in two
sections. Its style resembles that of Chapter 18 on The Cave, for it
relates similar allegories.

The terms Jinn or genie \` (which forms the usual rendering for the
title) are confusing, and when employed they tend to give an undesirable
Arabian Nights " atmosphere to this sacred text. The Jinn (which is a
plural in Arabic) are intelligent yet immaterial beings created from
fire. If the cognate word spirits is used in English, it can be confused
with the Holy Spirit (or Ruh who in Islamic theology is the archangel
Gabriel); thus I prefer the more popular term sprites which somewhat
makes them resemble the gremlins, elves or the so-called little people
\`in Western folklore, especially in Celtic areas. Professor Faruqi
calls them: spiritual beings between man and angels " (in referring to
51:III). We can also remember the evil spirits which Jesus cast out in
Matthew 8:16 and Mark 5. Some commentators consider these sprites to be
opponents of the Prophet's mission hecause of those associated with
solomon.
