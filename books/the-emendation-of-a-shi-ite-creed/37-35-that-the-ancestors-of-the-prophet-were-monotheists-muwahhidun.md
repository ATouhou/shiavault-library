35. That the ancestors of the prophet were monotheists (Muwahhidun)
===================================================================

Abu Ja‘far says: "Our belief concerning the ancestors of the Prophet,
may the blessing of Allah be upon him and his pro- geny, is that they
were Muslims".ash-Shaykh al-Mufid adds that: The ancestors of the
Prophet,may the blessing of Allah be upon him and his progeny, as far as
Adam, peace be upon him, were monotheists (muwahhidun) and believers in
Allah, as has been demonstrated by Abu Ja‘far, may Allah have mercy upon
him, and the consensus of opinion of the adherents of the truth. Allah,
the Exalted, says:

***Who sees thee when thou standest, and when thou turnest about among
those who prostrate themselves [26:218-9],***

which means his transmission through the loins of the monotheists. His
Prophet, may the blessing of Allah be upon him and his progeny, says: "I
was transmitted from the loins of the pure to the wombs of the chaste
till Allah, the Exalted, brought me forth in this world of yours," which
demonstrates that his ancestors were all believers, since had there been
an unbeliever amongst them, then they would not merit the description
'pure', for Allah, the Exalted, says: The polytheists are indeed unclean
[9:28]. Hence, He stigmatized the unbelievers are unclean. Consequently,
when the Messenger of Allah, may the blessing of Allah be upon him and
his progeny affirmed that his ancestors were all chaste and so described
them, he confirmed that they were believers.
