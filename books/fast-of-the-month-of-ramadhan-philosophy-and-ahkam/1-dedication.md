***"O you who believe! Fast is prescribed for you as it was prescribed
for those before you so that you may ward off (evil). (Fast) a certain
number of days..." (Qur'an Surah Baqarah 2:182-183)***

***\*\*\****

To the best man who ever walked on earth or ascended to heaven... To the
one for whom the whole world was created... To the one whom I never saw
yet in whom I firmly believe and whom I passionately love, in whose
footsteps I try my best to follow, and who I very much hope to see in
the life to come, though I know I am not worthy of it... To the master
of mankind and jinns...

To the one who perfected the code of ethics and who was sent as a mercy
for all creation: to

**Muhammad**

The prophet and messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him and his pure and sinless progeny, peace and blessings that shall
keep multiplying so long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the
west...

Hoping he will accept this humble book as a gift and intercede on my
behalf on the day of judgment with the judge of judges and lord of lords
to forgive my sins, faults, shortcoming, and transgressions, to permit
me to meet his prophet and messenger Muhammad and his pure and sinless
progeny, to help me stay on the path of righteousness, and to help me
guide through the medium of this book as many of my Muslim brethren as
he pleases thereto...

Allahu akbar! Allahu akbar! Allahu akbar!
