Maytham addressed the people:

*People, if you want to hear some information about Ali bin Abi Talib,
then come to me.*

The people crowded around Maytham. He began teaching them various kinds
of knowledge.

The spies told Ubaidullah bin Ziyad about Maytham's words.

Ibn Ziyad ordered a policeman to cut off Maytham's tongue. Maytham said:

*Amirul Mu'mineen has told me about that.*

The policeman cut off his Maytham's tongue. Another policeman stabbed
him with a sword.

Thus, this mujahid's life was put out like a candle!
