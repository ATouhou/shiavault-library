ABSTRACT
========

The philosophical reader cannot help but notice that some of the major
assertions of Immanuel Kant and Martin Heidegger are thematically
intertwined. Perhaps even more clearly, the viewer who approaches the
work of Edvard Munch with a philosophical frame of mind will discover
how the thoughts of Kant and Heidegger often illuminate key aspects of
his paintings.*Authentic Dasein* *and the Anxious Uncanny* strives to
analyze the main works of Edvard Munch, the father of Expressionism.
This thesis uses Heidegger’s concepts of anxiety and
being-towards-death, as well as Kant’s notion of the Sublime as laced
with anxiety, to re-examine nineteen of the artist’s masterpieces. The
first chapter explores the relationship between Kant and Munch, while
the second focuses on artist’s works through the philosophy of
Heidegger. The third and concluding chapter brings together Kant and
Heidegger through a series of paintings to demonstrate how Munch’s
achievement can be interpreted philosophically.
