Translator's Note
=================

It is a great honour to be asked to translate the tale of the martyrdom
of Imam Hussain (a.s.) into English. However, in undertaking the task, I
was faced with the problem of translating the Arabic poetry which
normally accompanies the account of Imam Hussain's martyrdom and which
may lose its meaning in the process. To circumvent this difficulty, I
resorted to English poetry from the book "***Sunshine at Midnight, the
Kerbala Epic*** " written by the late Syyid Ali Mahdi, an eloquent poet
and writer. Thus the reader will notice befitting passages of his poetry
adorning the translation throughout.
