Introduction
============

This book is the second in a series on Fundamental Aspects of Islamic
Culture, specially written for young readers or anyone wanting a
simplified version of Basic Islamic Doctrines.

The first book developed a few simple concepts, such as the Omnipotence
of Allah, the Creator and Bestower of Blessings on mankind as well as
other pillars that are fundamental to Islam, like Judgement Day, life in
the Hereafter, Angels, etc... All aspects are very basic in presenting a
glimpse of the comprehensiveness of the great Islamic religion.

This volume focuses mainly on the behaviour of man as a moral being
under the guidance of Prophet Muhammad (s). It tackles the issues of
what makes up good conduct and how it is practised by a true believer as
part of Islam being a complete way of life.

Most discussion can be said to be simple common sense towards righteous
behaviour and building a moral society beneficial not only to the life
of this world but also towards seeking the pleasure of Allah for the
life in the Hereafter. It is this very nature of being so basic that
often means the small important things in life are forgotten and from
this aspect alone this book may prove enlightening.

As servants of Allah, we are all humble in His Hands and we trust that
this offering helps to put our personal mission on earth into
perspective.

Glory is to Allah and to Allah alone.
