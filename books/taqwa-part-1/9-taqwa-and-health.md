Taqwa and Health
================

As said above, Imam Ali (a) has stated about taqwa:

Certainly, fear of Allah (taqwa) is … the cure for the ailments of your
bodies…17

It might be asked what is the relationship between taqwa (a spiritual
issue) and physical health? Of course, taqwa is not a tablet and
medicine, but if taqwa does not exist, a physician is not good enough to
heal the ailment of someone who is in need of taqwa.

A person who has taqwa is satisfied with his limits and his rights,
feels calm and confident, and has inner peace. This results in a
healthier heart; tensions will not cause him to suffer from stomach
ulcers and from pain in his intestines. He will not become weak and
infirm because of being liberal in sexual relations. The well-being of
his body, social life, and spirit all depend on taqwa.
