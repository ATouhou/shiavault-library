Prophet Adam (a)
================

Allah made the mountains and the seas.

He made all the animals.

He made the heavens and the stars.

He made the sun and the moon

and he made the angels.

The angels were like Allah's servants

and did everything He ordered.

Then Allah decided to make a man.

He called this first man Adam.

He taught him many things

so that Adam had more knowledge

than the angels.

There was one Jinn,

called Iblis and he thought

he was better than Adam

so Allah would not let him

stay with the other angels.

He was to be called

'Shaytan', the Devil.

Shaytan blamed Adam for what had

happened to him and was very angry.

Allah let Adam live in

a beautiful place because

he was good. The place was

called Paradise.

It was a very nice place but

Adam was a little lonely,

on his own all of the time.

Allah decided to help Adam.

He made Hawa to be Adam's wife.

They were happy and

liked living in Paradise.

There was, however,

one thing they were not allowed to do.

There was a special

tree and Allah had told them they must not

eat any fruit from that tree.

At first Adam and Hawa were

very good and kept away

from the tree.

Shaytan decided to do

something very naughty.

He told them they were silly

to keep away from the tree.

He said nothing would happen

if they ate its fruit.

He said the fruit was delicious

and they should try it.

After a while they began to

listen to Shaytan and thought

they would have just a little

taste of the fruit, just to see

what it was like.

Shaytan was very happy because

he had made them disobey Allah.

As soon as they had eaten

the fruit,

Adam and Hawa

realised that they had been

very naughty and

they felt guilty

for what they had done.

Allah forgave them

But He wouldn't let them

stay in Paradise any more

So He sent them to live on earth.
