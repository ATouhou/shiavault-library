Conclusion: The Islamic Struggle against Feminism
=================================================

The brief points made above, though sketchy, should be sufficient to
show that the incompatibility of Islam with feminism is profound. It is
not just a disagreement about how Islamic law is to be interpreted or
what sort of rights should be accorded to women. Islam and feminism have
contradictory views on the most fundamental issues in metaphysics,
ethics, social and political philosophy and theology.

Muslim women have also argued that feminism is an ideology relevant only
to the lives of Western affluent women, and that even for them it has
only resulted in making them into quasi men or sex objects. They have
also pointed out that while Muslim women see their own most important
roles to be mother and wife feminist ideology belittles the importance
of these roles in its combat against gender stereotypes.

The most obvious marker of the struggle against feminism by Muslim women
is hijab (the canons of modesty in Islamic dress). While feminists have
taken the scarf to be a symbol of their subjugation to men in Muslim
societies, the faithful take it to be a symbol of respect and modesty.
