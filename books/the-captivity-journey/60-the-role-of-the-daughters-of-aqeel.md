The Role of the Daughters of Aqeel
==================================

The daughters of Aqeel had an important role in motivating the sympathy
of people and turning their views against Yazeed after the demise of
Imam Hussain (Q) and his companions. Thus when Yazeed had dispatched his
two messengers to the Medina to inform the people about the death of
Imam Hussain (Q), Asmaa the daughter of Aqeel Bin Abi Taleb heard about
that, so she went out with a group of ladies till she reached the grave
of the Messenger of Allah (P) and held on to it and started to sob next
to it, then she turned to the Muhajereen and Ansar (migrants and
supporters) while saying:

What you are going to say if the Prophet asked you,

On the Day of Judgment, and only the truth would be heard.

You let down my progeny while I was absent,

And all the truth will be revealed by Allah.

So no one had seen more people crying than that day.

Then Zeinab the daughter of Aqeel went out with some of her related
women wandering while saying: "O Hussain, O brothers, O family, O
Mohammad". Then she said:

What you are going to say if the Prophet asked you,

What did you do being the last nation of all.

With my Progeny and supporters, do you not have,

An old pledge, do you not fulfill your oaths
