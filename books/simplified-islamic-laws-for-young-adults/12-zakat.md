Zakat
=====

One of the other important economical responsibilities of Muslims is the
paying of Zakat.

As for the importance of Zakat, it suffices to point out that in the
Glorious Qur'an, after the mentioning of Salat, Zakat is mentioned.
Paying Zakat is also counted as one of the signs of faith and righteous
actions.

In countless hadith from the Ma¥umin (‘a), it has been narrated that:
“One who does not pay Zakat, is out of the religion of Islam.”

Zakat, just like Khums, has its own specific instances. One part of
Zakat is a tax on the body and life, that once a year, those people who
have the ability to pay this tax (from the view point of property), it
becomes Wajib on them on the day of ‘Eid al-Fitr. The rules related to
this type of Zakat were explained at the end of the section on Fasting.

The other division of Zakat is the Zakat on wealth, but this does not
mean that it is necessary or includes all the property of a person -
rather Zakat is only Wajib on nine things.

Issue 390: Things that Zakat is Wajib to be paid on are the following:

Wheat, barley, dates, raisins, camels, cows, goats, gold and silver.

Issue 391: Zakat becomes Wajib in the event that the item that Zakat
must be paid on reaches a certain quantity. These amounts have been
given in the following table:

A brief note:

Camels, cows and sheep also have other quantities (that Zakat becomes
Wajib on), and for a complete listing of these rules, one can refer to
the Tawdhiul Masail, rules 1918-1932.

The Rules of Zakat
------------------

Issue 392: If for a complete year, the animals graze from the grass of
the wilderness, then Zakat will become Wajib on these animals.
Therefore, if during the year, or for a part of the year, the grass that
is picked or that, which is cultivated, is eaten, then Zakat will not be
paid on these animals.

Issue 393: The Zakat of gold and silver becomes Wajib in the event that
the amount reaches one *Sikke* - that which one can do business with.
Therefore, the amount women possess and use these days does not have any
Zakat liable on it.

Issue 394: Paying the Zakat is one of the acts of worship and must be
given with the intention of Zakat and with the Niyyat of being paid for
the pleasure of Allah (SWT).

The Disposal of Zakat
---------------------

Issue 395: There are eight ways in which the Zakat can be disposed of;
and one can dispose of one’s Zakat in all or some of these ways. The
following are some of the examples of these places:

• It can be given to the poor and destitute.

• It can be given to those non-Muslims who, if Zakat is given to them,
may become inclined to Islam or they may help Muslims in the time of
war.

• It may be spent in the way of Allah; meaning, in those things that
have a common benefit for the Muslims or a benefit for Islam - for
example, building a well, bridge or Masjid[^1]

Tawzhiul Masa’il, rule number 1933.
