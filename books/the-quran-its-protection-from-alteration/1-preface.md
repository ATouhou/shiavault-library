Preface 
========

The Qur'an is the basis of Islam and the eternal miracle of the Prophet
of Islam. It is a Book which forms the main guide for the Muslims. Its
vital place in Islam can be seen from the importance given to its
preservation, in memory and written form, by the Prophet and his
followers during past fourteen centuries of the history, of Islam. 

No sect in the diversified world of Islam entertained any doubt about
the authenticity and integrity of the Qur'an. Unfortunately, during the
last fifteen years, some groups have started distributing booklets and
leaflets in which they accuse the Shi'a Muslims of *kufr* because, in
their assumptions the Shi'as do not believe in the integrity of the
present Qur'an. 

How far this accusation is true, to what extent the accusers themselves
are free from this "sin," and who eventually benefits from this *fitna*
is the subject of this study done in a very unbiased way by 'Allamah
Sayyid Sa'eed Akhtar Rizvi. This was first presented as a paper at the
"Islamic Thought conference" in Tehran in January 1992. It is the
pleasure of Ahlul Bayt Assembly of North America to present this booklet
to the seekers of truth.
