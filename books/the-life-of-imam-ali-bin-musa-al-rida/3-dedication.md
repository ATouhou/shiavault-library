Dedication
==========

  

I submit this humble effort to the great position of the pioneer of the
intellectual and cognitive renaissance in Islam, the Prophets
descendant, Imām Jafar al-Sādiq, peace be on him. I have made this
research about his grandson Imām Ali b. Mūsā al-Rida, peace be on him,
while hoping that he will kindly accept, so it would be a treasure for
me on the Day of Resurrection.
