Peace Based on Justice
======================

   
 If we want to study Islamic peace, we shall have to do so in the
framework of the overall Islamic ideology. Islam is, in a manner of
speaking, a single entity. We should not look at any Islamic concept in
isolation; we must have the whole structure in view.  
    
 We may describe the whole Islamic ideology in one word: Justice. God
has laid the foundation of Islam on justice. Justice has been defined as
“putting a thing in its rightful place”. A judge does justice when he
awards or restores a disputed item to its rightful owner.  
    
 This brings us to the concept of peace. When every thing is kept in its
rightful place, when every member knows not only his rights but also his
duties towards others, then peace reigns in society; and the society
works smoothly like a well-balanced watch. It is what we call balance,
harmony and equilibrium.
