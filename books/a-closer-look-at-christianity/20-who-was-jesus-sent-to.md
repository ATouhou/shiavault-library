Who was Jesus sent to?
======================

Jesus was sent to the entire world. It is known that the total number of
prophets that God sent were 124,000. Five of these prophets were
considered to be the best, and they were called o-loo Al-Azm. These
prophets were Nooh (Noah) Ibraheem (Abraham), Mousa (Moses), Ee-saa
(Jesus), and Muhammad (Peace be upon them all, and Muhammadâ€™s progeny).
Being one of the five o-loo Al-Azm prophets meant that Jesus was sent to
the entire world of mankind and Jin (other beings living amongst us that
can see us without us seeing them).
