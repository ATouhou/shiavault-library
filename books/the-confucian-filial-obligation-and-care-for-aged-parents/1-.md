ABSTRACT
Some moral philosophers in the West (e.g., Norman Daniels and Jane
English) hold that adult children have no more moral obligation to
support their elderly parents than does any other person in the society,
no matter how much sacrifice their parents made for them or what misery
their parents are presently suffering. This is because children do not
ask to be brought into the world or to be adopted. Therefore, there is a
"basic asymmetry between parental and the filial obligations." I argue
against the Daniels/English thesis by employing the traditional
Confucian view of the nature of filial obligation. On the basis of a
distinction between 'moral duty' and 'moral responsibility' and the
Confucian concept of justice, I argue that the filial obligation of
adult children to care respectfully for their aged parents is not
necessarily self-imposed. I conclude that due to the naturalistic
character of the family, the nature of our familial obligations (such as
parental caring for young children and adult children's respectful
caring for aged parents) cannot be consensual, contractarian and
voluntarist, but instead existential, communal and historical.
