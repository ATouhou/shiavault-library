[Preface]
=========

The impact of Islamic civilization on the European civilization is
undeniable. Muslims’ philosophical, theological and scientific thoughts
that were introduced to the Medieval West had a remarkable impact on
different aspects of European life. Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd and Ghazali’s
works left a tremendous influence on Western Medieval philosophy and
theology. Mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy and medicine are
other areas of influence. Some Western scholars in the Middle Age
studied Arabic, and translated Islamic sciences into Latin. Through
trade and crusade wars too some aspects of Islamic culture were
transmitted to the West.
