Translator’s Foreword
=====================

Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds and benedictions upon the
Messenger of Allah and his Purified Progeny.

By the Grace of the Almighty, the English translation of *“Life of the
last successor, Imam Mahdi (a.s)”* is complete.

The esteemed author, Baqir Sharif Qarashi, has to his credit detailed
biographies of the Holy Imams (a.s) and he covers almost all aspects of
the respective Imam in the particular book.

This book is the biography of the Twelfth Imam, Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi
(a.s), also referred to as the Qaim of Aale Muhammad, the Awaited Imam
and the Last of the Successors.

The book also covers major objections that the opponents of Shias aim
against belief in Imam Mahdi (a.s), which the respected author, Baqir
Sharif Qarashi has refuted in a convincing way.

I have translated the Arabic term, ‘Hazrat’ as ‘his or her eminence’ and
also used the same titles and honorifics that the original author has
employed, though English readers may find this a little unusual,
especially when the same personality is referred to by different
appellations in a single sentence. For example the same Twelfth Imam is
called as the Qaim, the Awaited Imam, the Promised Mahdi and the Imam of
the Time, the Remnant of Allah…etc.

Since the English equivalents of Islamic terminology do not convey the
exact meaning, I have sometimes used the original Arabic terms with the
English meaning in parentheses. However those who are not conversant
with Arabic words may refer to the “Glossary of Islamic Terms” at the
end of the book.
