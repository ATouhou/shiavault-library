Bahlool and a Slave who was Scared of the Sea
=============================================

A Baghdadi merchant was sitting in a ship with his slave, and they were
going to Basra. Bahlool and some others were also in this ship. The
slave started crying because he was afraid of the ship's turbulent
movements. All the travelers became annoyed at this. Bahlool asked the
slave's master permission to quiet him by some advice. The merchant
agreed. Bahlool immediately gave the order to throw the slave into the
sea. His command was carried out. When the slave was near death, he was
rescued. After that experience, the slave quietly sat in a corner of the
ship.

The travelers asked Bahlool the reason why this act quieted the slave.
Bahlool replied, “This slave didn't know how comfortable this ship was
or what greatness and value it held. When he was thrown into the sea, he
understood that this ship is a comfortable and relieving place.”
