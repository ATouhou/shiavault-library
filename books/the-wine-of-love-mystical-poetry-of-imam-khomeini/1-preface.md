Preface
=======

Imam Khomeini, may his soul be sanctified, was a person who, by his
auspicious presence in the world of modern coercion and deception,
voiced the slogan of awakening and through his noble message that had
the fragrant aroma of the true breeze of monotheism, showed the path to
those who had gone astray, and as among the decanters of love which had
enraptured himself, he served mouthfuls to those who thirst for love and
truth.

Centuries passed and the dormant earth remained expectant until the alma
mater of times graduated a son such as Khomeini, a man who was a guide
to the path of truth and demonstrator of the path of love and religion.
Islam had remained covered under the veils of deception imposed on it by
tyrants and rulers dispensing coercion and cruelty. These enemies of
human happiness and salvation had concealed the beautiful face of Islam
until a man rose and, through a power that arose from faith in Almighty
God and his own true devotion, wiped off the dust and taught the Muslims
what the true rusts of the face of Islam were and how, by manly uprising
and valiant *jihad*, Islam could be saved from the pestilence in which
it was engulfed.

Verily, why was Imam Khomeini promoted to such a station and become the
bright sun that no bat could tolerate? Truly, if this wasn’t the case,
the rulers of the East and the West and their reactionary hired
agents—during his blissful life when his divine guardianship, as the
shadow of the heavenly tree of *Tuba*, sheltered men everywhere on
earth, and after his ascension—would not undertake such extensive
challenge to an epic man showing the road to salvation!

The cause for so much honor and dignity is embodied in one sentence:
Imam Khomeini was assimilated in Allah and the divine religion of Islam.
Martyr Sayyid Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr[^1] has mentioned this nicely:
“Melt away in Imam Khomeini even as he had melted away in Islam.”

*From your cask has come the drunkenness of the heart-lost lover;*  
*The outcome of my life is this drunkenness, no other.*  
*If between you and Him, besides you stands none else.*  
*If you are a heart-lost lover, abandon yourself.*

That is how he (Imam Khomeini) has acknowledged life and all that has
being and existence. He considered man’s worth and credibility in his
seeing another but God and interpreted man’s liberty to mean that he is
tied to the beloved’s tress and ringlet and see nothing nor be mindful
of anything save the One and Only Divinity.

*I am nothing, nothing,*  
*for being is all in naught.*  
*Nothing else but nothing,*  
*for You gaze upon the naught.*

During the course of his blessed life, Imam Khomeini presented to
humanity, by his pen and tongue, all he had received from the divine
source of grace. He wrote books, delivered sermons, wrote messages and,
in his everlasting will and testament, he penned the final chapter of
his guiding life. In all these the Imam has tried to speak in the
language of the folks or his audience as called for by his station of
guardianship and leadership. Had he spoken in his own tongue revealing
the concealed secrets, none could understand. Imam Ja‘far as-Sadiq[^2]
(‘*a*) has said that the Prophet (*s*) never in his life time addressed
the people in his own tongue.

In like manner, in his divine mystic, peripatetic journeys Imam Khomeini
had gained access to secrets that were concealed from others. Some of
those secrets found manifestation in the glorious guardianship of this
noble personality, while others are reflected in the ardent,
impassionate and stirring odes and lyric poetry of His Eminence.

Imam Knomeini’s poetry are indeed the hidden secrets between him and
that Unique Friend—the friend for whose love only the Imam lived, who
was all that he could see and acknowledge and to whose command alone he
would bow.

*I will be a moth, burning,*  
*burning all my life in her candle.*  
*I will be drunk with wine,*  
*marveling at her beautiful face.*

If he tolerated derisions by the ignorant; if he took poison and traded
his pride,[^3] it was for Islam and Allah and if he waged *jihad*, that
too, was to please the Lord. In his ode known as the ‘Alawiyyah Elegy,
Ibn Abi’l-Hadid[^4] has said:

*For love’s sake the veil*  
*of chastity I’ll tear.*  
*Infamy, should the friend’s path entail*  
*is the loveliest thing to bear.*

That is how one should be in incurring the pleasure of the friend. As a
noble tradition implies, a believer does not fear the blame of the
reproachers.

From a single view, the poetry of Imam Khomeini is a compendium of all
the qualities and aspects of his personality. For, his turbulent spirit
has visited all corners and horizons, and the lights of his personality
have radiated in all stations. At the same time, the Imam’s poetry
comprise his only unspoken secrets for which there was no audience in
this world, for only words could withstand the weight of such
unfathomable mysteries. Words are divine blessing for mankind, and God’s
relations with men are through words. Words were a “well” for him to put
his head, as in the case of Hadrat ‘Ali (*‘a*), and whisper his hidden
secrets to it. This is how Imam Khomeini’s verses found form and how he
occasionally composed some poetry.

Since the poetry of Imam are gnostic in expression and meaning and his
mystic personality was infinite, his lyric poems and odes have multiple
strata, and each reader enjoys this ocean of insight and meaning
according to his capacity of understanding. The spiteful, ignorant and
uncultured enemy who naturally has very scant knowledge and
understanding of these concepts and takes them to mean as he thinks,
regards the term, *love*, in these poems to mean as what the vulgar
think of it, and the term, *Friend*, is taken to mean what the vulgar
consider it to mean.

While the divine prophets were persecuted by ignorant persons and
deceitful enemies or even murdered by them and the Seal of the prophets
(*s*) were called by such elements as “crazy,” “magician,” “poet,” etc.,
it is not surprising if the ignoble, spiteful individuals interpret the
lofty words of Imam Khomeini in any way they want.

Verily, those who understand themselves are ever so few!

On the other hand, those who enjoy the delicacy of “the jug of love” and
divine knowledge, search for perfection, and understand the term,
*hijab* (veil, barrier), tear it and soar above the subterfuge of the
meanings of words and immerse in the tumultuous depths of these poems,
find them engulfed with the impassioned love of a servant (of God) who
has rested his head at the threshold of the “Beloved” or “Friend” and
wants nothing but Him. Such is the worship of the noble and free minds:

*I will rest my head on her feet,*  
*kissing them ‘till the instant of death.*  
*I will be drunk with the wine of her jug*  
*‘till the morning of the resurrection.*

Thus, words, which are the most potent and abstract form of realization
of the meanings and of setting forth the facts—that is why poetry is
said to be the most abstract form of art—can themselves be *hijab* or
barriers for the comprehension of the concepts.

The deeper and more exact the meaning and the heavier the moral burden
of the speaker of words, the more the barriers to them. In addition to
their apparent meanings, words have inner chambers and it takes a highly
skillful driver to tear up the veils and roam around from one chamber to
another.

Due to its depth and richness of meanings derived from Islam, one of the
characteristics of Persian mystical poetry is that meanings do not only
appear on the surface of words. In fact, mystic words and terms are all
used figuratively and their real meanings are concealed. Man better
understands reality through allegory.

In the Holy Qur’an, wherever Almighty God speaks of Hell and Heaven, for
closer comprehension by minds, He uses the names of objects that men
recognize such as palaces, trees, streams, beautiful women, silk cloth,
honey, fire, etc. Whereas the Hereafter, is not like this world bound by
matter, and things that are there differ from things that are here on
earth. And since this world is figurative in relation to the Hereafter,
these objects are all used allegorically.

The core and axis of mysticism is “love,” and when love comes to the
fore, a lover and a beloved enter the picture and, when the poet wants
to speak of the “heart-burnt lover” (whose heart has been burned by
love’s flame) and the tantalizing beloved and draw pictures of them, he
is impelled to use whatever metaphor, comparison, allusion, and such
figurative terms existing in his own language, and in this way,
interpret the real love the object of which is the infinite Truth and
the One-and-Only God. The poet has no other elements available to him
and is obliged to make use of exoteric and real elements for stating and
expressing the meanings of lofty esoteric concepts, and thus, span a
bridge between matter and sense, exterior and interior, real and
figurative.

It must be said that the process of the creation of the world is also in
this manner and man’s progressive course from the world of matter to
heaven, from material to moral and beyond matter towards perfection
takes place in the similar fashion. If it wasn’t so, man’s movement and
the progression of the world and perfection would all be meaningless:

*I am a supplicant for a goblet of wine*  
*From the hand of a sweetheart.*  
*In whom can I confess this secret of mine,*  
*Where can I take this sorrow?*  
*I have lost my soul in despair*  
*of seeing the face of the Friend.*  
*I am the rue, whose burnt scent fills the air,*  
*I am the moth ‘round the candle.*

Who is there to understand the depth of these words? He (the Imam) was
being consumed in the flame of divine love and was feeling the ecstasy
of that wine which God has promised His true servants in heaven. For
such a man, this world is nothing but a tight cage and his only wish is
joining that “Friend”.

The criterion for his attachment to objects is love for Allah. Whatever
has a color and aroma like that of the Friend is beautiful for him and
anything that is not reminiscent of the Friend is redundant for him.
Even the mosque, the minaret, the school and the books, if they are
without Him and His ardent love, are null and void. This is so because
in a monotheistic logic like this, nothing is real except Him and
whatever can serve as a bridge to the Friend must be adhered to and
whatever is not like this, is null and void and must be relinquished.
***“I have set my face towards Him who created the heavens and the
earth.***”[^5]

*I did not find purity in the session of the dervishes.*  
*Within the cloister, I heard none call on Him.*  
*I did not find the Friend in the books of the seminary.*  
*At the top of the minaret, I saw no sound of the Beloved.*  
*I did not uncover anything in any scholarly books.*  
*In the lessons of Scripture, I was led nowhere.*  
*I spent my life in the temple, spent my life in vain.*  
*Among my companions, I found neither cure nor affliction.*  
*To the circle of the lovers I would go, and there I find*  
*a breeze from the garden of a sweetheart, and footprints.*

He, who is fascinated and captivated by His Countenace, shuns anything
that is not of Him. He disowns the *I’s* and the *we’s*, and avoids the
circles of friends, rivals, the mystic’s circle, the mosque, and the
school, and searches for a refuge, away from all these, to be alone with
Him and Him only and be so befuddled by His love as to “forget” himself
entirely and “forget” all else. It is at this point that he (the Imam)
hymns:

*Open the door of the tavern before me night and day,*  
*for I have become weary of the mosque and seminary.*

And

*O You* saqi*! Fill up my cup*  
*with wine to cleanse my soul!*  
*For my soul is overflowing,*  
*flowing over with passion for fame.*  
*Fill up my cup with the wine*  
*which annihilates this soul,*  
*Which expels the cope of intrigue*  
*and my well-laid traps from being.*

Even knowledge and gnosticism become *hijab* (veil, barrier) for him who
sees and seeks nothing but the Truth (God) and he wants to tear up this
veil, too, because knowledge and *‘irfan* are holy only if they can be a
road to Him, otherwise, they have no per se value:

*In the tavern, learning and mysticism have no way,*  
 *For in the station of the lovers, fallacy has no way.*

And

*When from the gnostic realm I came,*  
 *I saw all that had been in vain,*  
*All that we’d heard or studied of,*  
 *was vain, after I came to love.*

While all regard gnosticism as the only road to reach Him, he (Imam
Khomeini) is so monotheistic that he even sees *‘irfan* as a barrier and
declares it null and void. He wants the plain Truth, and since the bare
Truth is nothing but the sacred Essence of the Friend, everything else
is null and void.

Imam Khomeini’s poetry, as in the case of the personality of that great
and magnanimous man, is stormy and effervescent. Albeit a love poetry,
it is replete with the spirit of valiance, nobility and epic. In loving
God, he is gallant, brave and fearless. He carries his own gallows and
like Mansur (al-Hallaj),[^6] cries out: *“Ana al-Haqq”* (I am the
Truth!) even if he would be hanged (as al-Hallaj was).

*I have departed from myself,*  
 *beating the drum of “I am the Truth!”*  
*I have become like Mansur,*  
 *a buyer of a hanging rope.*

We are entangled in plurality while he is captivated by the mole of the
Beloved or Friend’s lip, the mole which is the central point of being’s
domain and the focal point of monotheism. We are sickly because of our
carnal desires while he is befuddled by the Friend’s (eye) vision and
insight which oversees the secrets of all that is apparent and all that
is concealed, and if that “eye” shows favor to a person he shall become
ensnared, enthralled and enraptured. We are ensnared by the unreal,
untrue objects. We do not see the Truth. We do not comprehend the beauty
of the Friend. If we could we should surely become “beset” by it.

We are beset by the idol of *nafs* or carnal desire and the worldly
idols we ourselves have created. He is captivated by that unique idol,
the One and Only Friend and Master. We are concerned with thoughts of
our shame and dishonor while he is free and rid of all that is lust and
shame. We are caught in the meanings of words and interpretation of
terms while he is beset by the love to see the beauties of the Friend.
He had shed away the robe of existence and attained union with the
Friend and has saddened us by his ascension. We see the world of matter
and material and he is witnessing the Heaven. In the words of Ibn Abi
al-Hadid:

*Patience is nice*  
*not in separation from thee.*  
*Hardships will all ease*  
*except sorrow on account of thee.*

[^1]: The great Muslim scholar and jurist, Ayatullah al-‘Uzma Sayyid
Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr, was born in 1931/1350 AH to a prominent family
in Kazimayn, a city in Iraq. He first studied at the Najaf seminary and
by the age of twenty he attained the status of theologian and obtained
the qualifications to practice religious jurisprudence. He was active in
most Islamic movements and in a famous decree, he banned membership in
the Ba‘ath Party of Iraq and declared the members of this party as
outright enemies of Islam and the Muslims. In another decree he
proclaimed as martyrs those who fought and were slain in the Islamic
Revolution of Iran against the Shah’s regime. In the month of Jamad
al-Awwal 1400 AH (April 8, 1980), the Ba‘ath government of Iraq martyred
him and his sister after months of imprisonment and torture. He wrote
numerous books, the most famous of which are Falsafatuna (“Our
Philosophy”) and Iqtisaduna (“Our Economics”). For the English
translation of the two mentioned books, see Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr, Our
Philosophy (Muhammadi Trust, n.d.), http://al-islam.org/philosophy ; Our

[^2]: Ja‘far ibn Muhammad (‘a) entitled, as-Sadiq (The Truthful),” is
the sixth Imam from the Prophet’s Progeny (83-148 AH). Many of the Sunni
and Shi‘ah ‘ulama and scholars attended his teaching classes and
seminars. Narrators of tradition have quoted the number of Imam
as-Sadiq’s students as four thousand. The socio-economic conditions of
his time necessitated greatest efforts to be made by His Holiness in the
areas of expanding authentic and original Islamic teachings and in the
training and education of faithful students. For this reason the books
of tradition and other books quote and cite more traditions from Imam
Ja‘far as-Sadiq than from any other infallible Imams.

[^3]: In his message of July 20, 1988, commemorating the anniversary of
the Meccan Massacre and his acceptance of the Security Council’s
Resolution 598, Imam Khomeini said: “The acceptance of this resolution
is more lethal for me than any poison but I seek the consent of the
Lord… In the hope of incurring His pleasure and mercy, I disregarded
what I had said and, if I had any honor, I traded it with Almighty God.”
