83. The Nominalizer إنَّ & her Sisters ( لعلَّ ، أنَّ ، کأنَّ ، لکنَّ ، لأنَّ )
===============================================================================

The Nominalizer إنَّ & her Sisters ( لعلَّ ، أنَّ ، کأنَّ ، لکنَّ ،
لأنَّ ) change the subject nominative case marker to the accusative but
they leave the predicate in its nominative case. By the way, **أنَّ /
إنَّ** are called "Nominalizers" because they introduce nominal
sentences.

<p dir="rtl">
**إنَّ الأکلَ لذيذ ٌ.**
</p>

In fact, the food is delicious.

<p dir="rtl">
**  قالتْ اُختي أنَّ الأکلَ لذيذ ٌ.**
</p>

My sister said that the food was delicious.

<p dir="rtl">
**لکنَّ الأکلَ لذيذ ٌ.**
</p>

... but the food was delicious.

**إنَّ**   is only used in the initial position of a sentence, and
following any form of**قالَ** . Anywhere else you have to use**أنَّ** .
Its meaning, therefore, changes from "indeed/in fact" to "that".
Remember that all these particles should be followed by nouns or
attached pronoun suffixes. Also notice that** إنَّ** and her sisters
should be followed by the subject or its corresponding attached pronoun.
