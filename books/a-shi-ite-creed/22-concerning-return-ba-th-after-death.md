Concerning Return (Ba'th) After Death
=====================================

Says the Shaykh Abu Ja'far, may the mercy of Allah be upon him: Our
belief concerning the return to life after death is that it is true.

The Prophet said: O sons of 'Abdu'l-Muttalib, verily the scout does not
lie to his own people. I swear by Him Who sent me as a Prophet of truth,
that you will surely die even as you sleep. And you will be resurrected
even as you awaken, and after death there is no abode except Heaven or
Hell. The creation of the whole of mankind and their resurrection is,
for Allah the Mighty and Glorious, like the creation of but one soul.
This is in accord with His Word, Exalted is He:

***“Your creation and your raising (from the dead) are only as (the
creation and the raising of) a single soul” (Qur'an 31:28)***.
