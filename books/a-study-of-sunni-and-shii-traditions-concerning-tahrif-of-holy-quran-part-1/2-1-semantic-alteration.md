1. Semantic Alteration
======================

This kind of tahrif has definitely been committed in regard to the
Qur'an, particularly in some of its exegeses whose authors have tried to
impose meanings on the Qur'anic verses different from their literal
sense, in order to justify the doctrines and ideas of certain schools.
It is about this kind of tahrif that al-'Imam al-Baqir (a.s.) said:

<p dir="rtl">
وكان من نبذهم الكتاب أن أقاموا حروفه وحرفوا حدوده، فهم يروونه ولا يرعونه
</p>

*“They have recorded its letter but changed its meaning. They narrate
its text without heeding its contents”* 2
