Dedication
==========

I pray that this modest work is accepted by Almighty Allah, His Prophet
(s.a.w.a.), and his immaculate progeny. I have basically tried to
present some documented facts about a lady who led a revolution against
oppression and falsehood.

I dedicatethis humble attempt to Imam al-Husain bin Ali (a.s.), the most
beloved individual to Lady Zaynab (a.s.), for he trained herto become an
exceptional character, a character which still stands to be unique.
Consequently, she passed the Divine trial so remarkably and achieved all
her brotherâ€™s goals.

To you, Imam al-Husain (a.s.), I dedicate this work hoping for
acceptance because you have been the guide and inspirer of seekers of
Righteousness, Justice and real Humanity.
