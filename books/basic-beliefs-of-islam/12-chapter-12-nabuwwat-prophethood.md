Chapter 12 : Nabuwwat - Prophethood
===================================

The third basic belief in Islam is prophethood.

It means that Allah Subhanahu taala has sent His messengers to teach
mankind about the purpose of their creation.

The Divine scheme of sending the prophets was that no one should be
left out without Divine teachings. For this reason the first man on the
ear th i.e. Hazrat Adam himself was a prophet. Then Allah Subhanahu
taala sent prophets to all nations and all communities to preach.

**Definition of Prophethood**

Prophethood has been defined by a great Alim, Allama Hilli, as " the
Prophet is the person who reports from Allah Taala without any human
mediation."

**What is the meaning of Nabi and Rasul ?**

In Islamic terminology two different words are used for messenger of
Allah Taala.

1 - Prophet [Nabi]
2 - Apostle [Rasul]

A Messenger of Allah can be a Nabi [Prophet] or a Rasul [Apostle] or
both Nabi and Rasul at a time.

**Nabi [Prophet]**

Nabi is an Arabic word, which has been derived from the word, Naba,
meaning, True News of great importance. In Arabic language, the word
naba is not used for ordinary news (Khabar), but is applied to a news
which is absolutely true (confirmed truth) and a news of great value.
Thus, the word Naba refers to a great and true news.

Now we can easily explain the meaning of Nabi which is as follows; The
Nabi [Prophet] is a truth-speaking person who receives the truthful news
of high value from Allah Taala and conveys it to people.

Thus, we can say that the Nabi is an exalted and high-ranking person
who has an assignment from Allah Subhanahu taala to communicate with His
servants on His behalf.

**Rasul [Apostle]**

Rasul is also an Arabic word which is derived from the word, Risalat,
meaning, to send. Thus, the meaning of Rasul is, one who is sent from
Allah. In Islamic terminology, both Nabi and Rasul are the most
high-ranking people chosen by Allah Subhanahu taala to guide the
mankind.

**What is the difference between Rasool and Nabi ?**

After knowing the terminological meanings of Rasul and Nabi, it is also
impor tant to understand the difference of these two great positions.
The Quran has used both the words, Nabi and Rasul, which shows that
there were two kinds of messengers.

1 - Some of the messengers were Nabi only.
2 - Some messengers were both Nabi and Rasool.

The difference between Rasul and Nabi is that,

1- A Rasul was a messenger of Allah who was given a new Shariat (codes
of law) from Him. And a Nabi was also the messenger of Allah, but he was
not given any new Shariat and followed the shariat of earlier Rasul.

Sheikh Mufid, a great scholar of Islam writes in his book, Awa'il
al-Maqalat, "every messenger is a prophet [Nabi], but not every Prophet
is a Rasul [Apostle]. All Rasules were Nabi but all Nabis were not
Rasuls.

2- A Prophet is always a Nabi by birth, but a prophet become Rasul when
he officially receives the post and declares it. For example, our
Prophet Muhammad (sws) was Nabi by birth, but became Rasul when he
officially got and delivered the message of Risalat at the age of 40.

3- The Rasul [Apostle] receives the message from Allah Taala in many
different manners such as, vision during sleep, direct communication
with angels when he is awake. i.e., he can see and speak to the angels
during communication of Divine message.

But the Nabi [prophet] differs from the Rasul in that he does not see
the angels when awake but sees during sleep.

4- The Rasul is higher in rank than a Nabi.

Out of 25 Prophets mentioned in the Holy Quran, or among 124000 Nabis,
Five were Rasul, and are called Ulu l-azm prophets, meaning those who
possess a quality of determination and firmness. The five Rasuls and
Ulul-azm Prophets are:

Prophet Nooh(as) was given a Shari'ah which was followed by other
prophets up to the time of Hazrat Ibrahim(as). Prophet Ibrahim(as) was
given a Shari'ah which remained in force up to the time of Hazrat Musa.
i.e., Hazrat Yaqub, Hazrat Lut, Hazrat Yousuf (as) etc. followed the
Shariat of Ibrahim.

Prophet Musa(as) was given a new Shari'ah which was followed by all the
prophets of Bani Israel until the time of Hazrat Isa (as). Prophet Isa
(as) was given a new Shariat which remained in force upto the time of
the Holy Prophet.

Prophet Muhammad (sws) was given the last and the most perfect Shariat
which will remain in force up to the last working day of the world. The
Shariat -e- Muhammadi can never be changed as Prophet Muhammed (sws) is
the last prophet and no prophet will come after him.

Our Prophet, Hazrat Muhammad (sws) has the highest position and rank
among all the Prophets.

**What was the special work of Prophets ?**

The Holy Quran precisely tells the responsibility of the Prophet
towards his nation. "It is He Who sent forth among the unlettered an
apostle of their own to recite to them His revelations, to purify them,
and to instruct them in the scriptures and wisdom, - (62:2) From this
verse of the Holy Quran, we arrive at a conclusion that there were four
main assignments of the prophet. No other person except a Divine agent
is capable to do these works.

1 - To guide the mankind to the right path.
2 - To inform the people about the unseen and hidden realities which
they can never know or perceive by themselves.
3 - To purify their souls and to develop their morals of Divine
standard.
4 - To certify the actions of people on the day of judgment.

1st assignment of the Prophet - to guide the people. This was the first
and the main duty of all the prophets. To do this work efficiently and
adequately, Allah Taala gave the prophets, both theoretical book [core
concepts] and Practical book [ Shariah - complete codes of ideal
life].

All actions and activities of the Prophets were totally according to
the Divine Will. In this way the life of the Prophet itself was an open
book.

All Prophets taught their respective nations all essential things that
are necessar y for a meaningful life in this world and for the ultimate
success of the eternal world. 2nd assignment - To inform the people
about the hidden and unseen realities.

This was the second important work of the Prophets. There are many
facts and truths which are totally beyond the human reach. Man can never
know them unless a reliable person from God tells and explains these
facts.

3rd assignment - to purify the souls and to develop high morals. This
is the third important duty of the Prophets. Quran declares the
prophethood as a great favor of Allah Taala to mankind and a source of
His unlimited mercy.

"O mankind: there has come to you a direction from your Lord for the
(to cure disease) heart - and for those who believe, a guidance and a
mercy." (10:57) 4th assignment - to certify the actions of the people on
the Day of Judgment.

Quran informs us that on the day of Judgment, the Prophets and their
true successors, Imam, will be asked to give full reports of their
nation. "One day We shall call together all human beings with their
(respective) Imams: those who are given their record in their right hand
will read it (with pleasure), and they will not be dealt with unjustly
in the least." (17:71) Characteristic features of Prophets.

Apart from many other characteristic features, all prophets have five
things in common.

1 - All prophets were appointed by Allah Subhanahu taala and none of
them was self- appointed or appointed by the public.

2 - All prophets were infallible and perfect human beings. No angel was
sent as Nabi or Rasul. All prophets were males. No woman was appointed
by Allah as a Nabi or Rasul.

3 - All Prophets were endowed with some kinds of distinct signs.

4 - All prophets taught the basic beliefs of Islam, i.e., There is no
god but Allah who has no partner (Tawhid ) and that there is a day of
Judgment when each person will get reward according to his/her deeds.

5 - All prophets successfully completed their task.

Let's discuss the characteristics of the Prophets in the light of the
Holy Quran. Appointment of the Prophet. All prophets were appointed by
the Allah Subhanahu Taala, and none out of the 124000 messengers, was a
self-appointed or public's nominee.

Why Allah should appoint the Prophet is a self-explanatory fact. The
nature of Prophet's work clearly demands that he should be appointed by
Allah and not by the public or by himself. This rule will also apply on
the successor of the Prophet.

The Prophets are the chosen people who are capable of receiving Divine
guidance from the invisible world and communicating it to the people
living in the physical world. They are the most trustworthy, selfless
and unchanging people. It is Allah alone who can judge who is fit to do
this job and, hence, fit to be a Prophet.

Quran attests this rule; "Allah knows best whom to entrust with His
message." (6:124) "He is taught by one who is mighty in power, and
vigorous." (53:5) Thus, no ordinary person, be he a very intelligent and
knowledgeable, can qualify this criterion except the one who is
appointed by Allah, Who is Almighty.

The infallibility of the Prophets - [Ismat ul-anmbiya] Another
distinguishing feature of the Prophets of Allah is that they were all
infallible and perfect human beings.

The Arabic word to express this unique quality is, Ismat, meaning,
immunity from committing a sin or making a mistake. Thus, every action
of the Prophet is always accurately correct and can not be questioned
for verification.

Quran has ascertained that prophets never do anything out of their own
desire or under any pressure. They always strictly follow Allah's
Commandments, whether they do anything in private or in public.

"He does not speak out of his own desire." (53:3) Another strong proof
of infallibility of the Prophet is that Allah Taala has asked all
mankind to follow the footsteps of the Holy Prophet (sws) without any
reservation. This Divine command in itself is a valid proof that His
prophets always do the right things, and there is no chance of any kind
of error.

"Say: if you do love Allah, follow me. Allah will love you." (3:31)
Thus, from the Quran and also by common sense, the Prophet is totally
free from all kinds of indecencies and human errors.

What is a difference between Prophet and a common man. In physical
appearance, all prophets (Nabis, Rasuls and Imams) were like common
human beings. They all have the same body as we have, same needs as we
have, i.e., they used to eat food, they used to drink water, they used
to sleep and rest, they married, they had children, they died after
certain age etc.

But despite these many common characteristics, all Prophets were highly
elevated souls with special signs and extraordinary characters. Quran
has described this unique combination of similarity and difference of
the Prophet's personality.

"Say: I am only a man like you, (but) it is revealed unto me that your
God is but one God." (18:110) From this verse of the Holy Quran, we can
infer two impor tant facts of their personality. G that in general
physical appearance, Prophet is not different from common human beings,
but he is wholly like them.

G but with all this bodily resemblance, he also receives Divine
revelations. This additional and exceptional quality of the Prophet,
i.e., capability of communicating with God (there is no god but Allah
Taala), which no ordinary human being can do, makes him indescribably
higher than all human beings. This difference is beyond any
imagination.

This exceptional quality of the prophet, i.e., prominently like a
common man but remarkably different from man, is not a mystery or
unusual. We can explain it rationally and scientifically with the
following few examples.

Similarity and dissimilarity of diamond and charcoal.

Every student of chemistry knows this fact very well that pure carbon
occurs in nature in four entirely different forms - diamond, graphite,
carbon black (amorphous carbon) and fullerenes. This means that as far
as the chemical composition of carbon black (charcoal) and diamond is
concerned, they both are utterly the same. Diamond is made up of almost
entirely of carbon. And black charcoal (common wood charcoal) consist of
mainly carbon.

So, there is no dispute or argument when we say that diamond and wood
charcoal are basically the same (pure carbon), but remarkably different
in value and wor th. This is a scientific fact which no one can deny.
But, can we exchange diamond with coal ? Can we present a wedding ring
made up of black charcoals to our newly married wife telling her that
basically it is the same as diamond?

Despite the basic similarity of origin (i.e., both are basically
carbon), diamond and charcoal are totally different.

Diamond is extremely costly and charcoal is petty cheap. Diamond is the
hardest and most lasting substance while charcoal is easily breakable
and powdery. Exactly in the same way, we can understand the similarity
and difference of the prophets, Imams, and common people. They all are
basically the same - humans, but remarkably different in character and
values.

If anyone quotes the above verse of the Quran and say that Prophets and
Imams are just like us, than they are not acting sensibly and lacking
the knowledge about the facts on the prophets and Imams.

Apart from this pure scientific argument, we can also show great
differences among the people living around us. Some are highly educated,
intelligent and extremely rich while others are uneducated, dull, and
badly poor. Basically, they all are the same, but in actuality, there is
a world of difference.

**Why Prophets were human beings and not the angels?**

This question was asked by the people of many Prophets. Quran has given
a very rational explanation to this argument. "Nothing prevents men from
having faith when guidance is revealed to them but the excuse : Why
Allah has sent human being as an apostle ?

Say : Had the earth been safe place for angels to dwell in, We would
have sent forth to them an angel from heaven as an apostle." (17:94) The
answer is very simple and clear. A beautiful explanation of this queston
has been given by M.J. Chirri in his monumentle book 'Inquiries about
Islam', which says;

A prophet is an example to mankind. He should share with them the same
nature, the same ability, and the same limitation. An attractive example
to the prophet must be obtainable. It must have the capability of
including the people to follow it. Should the prophet be from a
different nature, people will not attempt to follow his example. A
relative per fection shown by a prophet should be possible for his
followers. Should a human being show me a high degree of virtuous life,
I may be tempted to try to attain that degree. He and I are humans.

What is possible for him is possible for me. But if an angel shows me a
high degree of morality, I may not attempt to follow his example. What
is possible for him may be impossible foe me; he is not from the same
nature.

There is another reason to believe that mankind should receive human
prophets: We have advanced that a prophet is expected to substantiate
his truthfulness by showing people unusual performance. By doing so,
people would know that he is empowered by God because what he does is
beyond his natural ability. This will not work if the prophet is not
human, let us say an Angel. A human prophet may, for example, show his
truthfulness by taking an unaided flight. Should an angel do the same,
it will not demonstrate his natural ability, since he may not be
affected naturally by gravitation.

"Indeed (there) is for you in the Apostle of Allah (Muhammad sws) an
excellent pattern (of conduct).
Miracles - visible sign of prophethood.

When a person makes a claim, it is his duty to give a satisfactory
proof in support of his claim. For example, when the ambassador, who is
the nation's highest-ranking diplomat in the country, arrives to take
charge of his office, he first delivers authentic papers cer tifying his
position. The government of that country will never entertain any person
in that capacity unless he shows valid credentials as an evidence of his
candidacy for that position. The same rule applies for prophethood.

Thus, if a person claims that he is the Prophet of God, it is his
religious duty to show satisfactory evidence in support of his
statement. In Islamic terminology, such an evidence is known as miracle
or Ayat, meaning sign of prophethood.

Quran confirms that, every Prophet sent by Allah Taala was endowed with
some kind of supernatural power by means of which he was able to
demonstrate one or more miracles to prove his prophethood.

What is the difference between Prophet and a scientist There is a sharp
difference between a scientist and the Prophet. In fact, there is no
comparison. However, for the sake of understanding the unparalleled
position of the Prophet, few basic differences are being mentioned
here.

1- A Prophet demonstrates miracles to prove his prophethood. A miracle
is a cer tain act which can puzzle the people and that act can not be
done by anyone else.

A scientist can also demonstrate something which can puzzle the people,
but that act can be performed by many other scientists of his caliber.
No scientist has ever shown anything which was impossible by other
scientist to perform.

2- The Prophet tells about the future or about the unseen which has
never been proved wrong.
Scientists also tell many things about future on the basis of cer tain
knowledge and experiments, but many of their repor ts have been proved
wrong by other scientists.

3- Scientists have extraordinary talent, sharp memory, and incredible
thinking faculties. They have designed Electron microscope of tremendous
magnifying power to see an object as small as 1/ 250,000,000 inch. They
have also designed high power telescope to see extremely distant
objects.Scientists can see with these powerful tools of penetrating
eyes, inside the invisible atom and the outermost galaxy.

But despite these powerful instruments at their disposal, they can not
see what happens inside the grave, and what will happen after the
death.

Whereas, the Prophets have a quite different power - that is of
receiving the absolutely accurate news from a totally invisible world -
a world which will always remain outside the range of highly
sophisticated telescope or microscope.

All great prophets were given some kind of miracle to establish their
authority over the people of their nation. These miracle were in
accordance with the specialization of their time. For example, Hazrat
Musa was given the miracle of serpent to beat the magician who were
specialist in camouflaging the ropes as snakes. Hazrat Isa was bestowed
with a miracle of giving life to the dead people, and curing the born
blinds. In his time, the Greek medicine was at its peak.

The miracle of the Holy Prophet (sws) - The Quran - is a miracle for
all nations that will emerge from time to time until the Doomsday. Thus,
Quran will remain a challenge in every field of study and every sphere
of specialization. Thus, the scientists can do a lot of useful work if
they wholehear tedly recognize the Prophets as their teachers.

Basic message of all Prophets - awhid and Day of Judgment.T Quran has
confirmed that the basic message of all the Prophets was the same. This
shows that there has been only one single religion, Islam, from the
beginning.

Those to whom We have given the Book rejoice at what hath been revealed
unto thee:

but there are among the clans those who reject a part thereof. Say: "I
am commanded to worship Allah, and not to join partners with Him. Unto
Him do I call, and unto Him is my return. (13:36)

Hazrat Nooh(as) taught his nation about Tawhid and the Day of Judgment.
"We sent Nooh to his people(with a mission), I have come to you with a
warning : that you serve none but Allah. Verily I do fear for you the
penalty of a grievous day." (11:26) Prophet Ibrahim (as) conveyed the
message of Tauhid to his people. "And Ibrahim said to his people: serve
Allah and fear Him: that will be best for you if you understand."
(29:16)

Prophet Hud gave the same message to his nation. "To the Ad people (we
sent) Hud, one of their brethren, He said: " O my people! worship Allah!
you have no other god but Him". (11:50)

Hazrat Saleh reminded the same message of Tawhid to his people. " "To
the Thamud People (We sent) Salih, one of their own brethren. He said:
"O my people! Worship Allah: ye have no other god but Him. It is He Who
hath produced you from the earth and settled you therein: then ask
forgiveness of Him, and turn to Him (in repentance): for my Lord is
(always) near, ready to answer." (11:61)

Hazrat Shu'ayb revised the same lesson of Tawhid during his time. "To
the Madyan people (we sent) Shu'ayb, one of their brethen: he said: O my
people! worship Allah: You have no other god but Him."(11:84)

Hazrat Yusuf reminded the same message of Tawhid. "I don't follow the
ways of people who don't believe in Allah and deny the Day of Judgment.
I follow the ways of my fathers - Ibrahim, Ishaq, and Yaqoob. We must
never serve any beside Allah." (12:37,38)

"The command is for none but Allah: He has commanded that you worship
none but Him: that is the right religion, but most men don't understand"
(13:40) Hazrat Musa was given the same message to deliver to his nation.
"We gave Musa the Book, and made it a guide to the children of Israel
(commanding)" Take not other than Me as your Lord" Hazrat Sulaiman
said:

"Allah! there is no god but He - Lord of the throne supreme" (27:26)
Thus, the core content and the basic message of all Prophets was one and
the same - Tawhid and the Day of Judgment. This is also the fundamental
message of the Holy Prophet (sws) and the basic teaching of Islam.

All Prophets have successfully completed their mission of conveying
this great message and no one from the nation of any prophet can give
any excuse of committing any kind of Shirk. Blasphemy Any acts,
utterances, and writings showing slightests disrespect of the Holy
Prophet or Imams.

Total Number of The Messengers.

Nuh, and among his progeny, Dawood (David), Sulaiman (Solomon), Ayoub
(Job), Yousuf (Joseph) Musa (Moses), and Haroon (Aaron). Thus do We
reward those who do good. And Zakariya and Yayha (John), and Isa
(Jesus), and Elias: all in the ranks of the righteous." (6:84)
