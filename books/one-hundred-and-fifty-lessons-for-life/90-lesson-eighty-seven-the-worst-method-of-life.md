Lesson Eighty Seven: The Worst Method Of Life
=============================================

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَسْوَءُ النّاسِ مَعَاشاً مَنْ لَمْ يَعِشْ غَيْرَهُ فِى مَعاشِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The worst people, from an economic viewpoint, are those who do not offer
livelihood to others from their own livelihood, and others are excluded
from their life.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

A healthy economy is one which strengthens social relations and embraces
all members of the society. When wealth is concentrated in certain
individuals or groups who refuse to allow the rest to benefit , a cancer
takes root in that soceity that will eventually destroy its economic
health to the detriment of all. Imam Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) refers to this as
the worst type of livelihood and economic life.
