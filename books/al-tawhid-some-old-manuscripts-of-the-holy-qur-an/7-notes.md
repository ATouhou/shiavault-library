Notes
=====

1. Most of the Prophet's biographers have mentioned the names - more or
less - of the scribes of the revelation. Dr. Ramyar in his Ta'rikh-e
Qur'an, p. 66, has mentioned the names of forty of them. Dr. Subhi
al-Salih, in Mabahith fi 'ulum al-Qur'an, p. 69, ascribes the maximum
number of forty to Blachere.' Dr. Hujjati, in his Ta'rikh-e Qur'an, p.
203, mentions the names of these forty scribes. See Dr. Ramyar, op.
cit., p. 324 for the names and number of the scribes mentioned in
different sources.

2. This is what is mentioned in al-Fihrist, but it must be Zayd ibn
Thabit. Similarly, it is Sa'd ibn 'Ubayd in more correct accounts. See
al-'Isabah.

Museum, but since I do not have a precise knowledge of it I refrain from
mentioning it. Another Qur'an attributed to 'Ali (A) exists at the
Library of San'a', Yemen, about which I came to know through my learned
friend Sayyid Ahmad Ashkawari.

64. Husayn ibn 'AbbAs al-Hasani al Safawi Bahidur Khan had the honour
of viewing this blessed and noble mushaf. "Isma'il al -Musawi al-Hasani
al Safawi Bahadur Khan had the honor of viewing this blessed and noble
mushaf on the 27th of Rajab 9... (the year has been lost as a result of
the binding). Mr. Farrukh writes: "That which I know is that this Qur'an
was in the library of the late Mirza Askari, the imam jumu'ah. My
grandfather, Mirza Husayn Jawahiri, with the takhallus 'Asi, purchased
it from the heirs of Mirza 'Askari, and it reached me through my father
Sayyid Ahmad Jawahiri, whose takhallus was Dana, as a legacy. It is
presently in my possession. Hujjat al-'Islam Hajj Mirza 'Askari, the
imam jumu'ah, was the uncle of the famous mujtahid and poet Hajj Sayyid
Habib and the son of Hajj Mirza Hidiyat Allah, son of Sayyid Mahdi, the
Shahid-a Thalith. The Shahidi families of Khurasin are his progeny.
Sayyid Mahdi, the Shahid-a Thalith, was himself a descendant of Shah
Ni'mat Allah Wali. He had come to Khurasan from Isfahan and was
martyred."

70. It would be very appropriate if the library of the Astinah-ye
Quds-e Radawi obtains films and facsimiles of, this and other
manuscripts which exist in foreign libraries for displaying them to
those interested in the relics of the Family of the Prophet (S) and the
general public.

72. Considering that deerskin is white, delicate and has a low fat
content, it was used for parchments, and the ancient manuscripts were
accordingly termed "deerskin", although apparently lambskin, which was
available in larger quantities,: has also the same qualities. 'Jafr' or
'jafr-e abyad' were also lambskin parchments on 4 which sacred knowledge
was recorded and were in the possession of the Ahl al Bayt. See under
'jafr' in Majma' al-bahrayn.
