Eulogies
========

Arabs eulogize their lost ones with poems. Since the tragedy took place,
innumerable poems have been composed eulogizing Imam Husayn (‘a) and
innumerable others will be composed till the Day of Judgment. The
following are some of them. We preferred to keep them without an English
translation due to our belief that no translation into any language can
do justice to them. They are better appreciated in their own language.  
    
 We pray the Almighty to grant His guidance to all those who read this
book, who benefit from it, and who pass it on to others, *Allahomma
Ameen.*
