Lesson Seventy: Three Basic Social Principles
=============================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلنّاسُ سَوَاءٌ كَأَسْنانِ الْمِشْطِ وَ الْمَرْءُ كَثِيرٌ بِأَخِيْهِ
وَ لا خَيْرَ فِى صُحْبَةِ مَنْ لَمْ يَرَ لَكَ مِثْلَ الَّذِى يَرَى
لِنَفْسِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

People are equal (in social rights) with each other like the teeth of a
comb! An individual becomes a great society together with his
(religious) brothers. It is not right to associate with one who does not
wish for you whatever he wishes for himself.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Three basic social principles are mentioned in the above tradition.

First, equal rights and justice for everyone irrespective of their
color, race, language and social status.

Second, the relationship of an individual with the society and the
society with an individual. Each individual counts and in co-operation
with his brothers forms a great community.

Lastly, the necessity of respecting the others’ interests as one’s own
interests as the basic element of true friendship and companionship. A
society devoid of these three principles is neither an Islamic nor a
humanitarian society.
