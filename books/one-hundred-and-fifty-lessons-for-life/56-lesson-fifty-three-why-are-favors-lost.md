Lesson Fifty Three: Why are Favors Lost?
========================================

Imam Al-Baqir (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ اللّهَ قَضَى قَضاءً حَتْماً أَلاّ يُنْعِمَ عَلَى الْعَبْدِ
بِنِعْمَة فَيَسْلُبُها إيّاهُ حَتّى يُحْدِثَ الْعَبْدُ ذَنْباً
يَسْتَحِقُّ بِذلِكَ النَّقِمَةِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

God has made an inevitable rule that he does not take back the favors
bestowed on the people, unless they commit an offense causing
deprivation from that favor.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

God’s graces are infinite but not unreasonable. He does not grant or
take back anything unreasonably. When world’s people use his favors for
conceit, corruption, destruction and injustice, the same favors become
the cause of their misfortune. Their favors are taken back and replaced
with calamity. Their industries and technology turn destructive, and
their society generates discord and discomfort, and even the speed
devices become the cause of their retardation, because they have misused
the graces.
