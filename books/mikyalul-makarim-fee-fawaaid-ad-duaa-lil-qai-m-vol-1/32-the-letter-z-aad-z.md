1. Z”Iyafat (Hospitability) Of His Eminence
-------------------------------------------

In *Darus Salaam* it is quoted from *Qisasul Anbiya* that Prophet
Ibrahim (as) was nick-named Abu Ziyafaan (father of the hospitable
ones). He was such that he neither ate in the morning nor in the evening
without being accompanied by a guest. He used to walk one or two
*farsangs* to find someone who would be willing to become his guest. His
hospitability continues till the Day of Judgment and it is the same
‘blessed tree’ that the Almighty Allah has spoken about:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يُوقَدُ مِنْ شَجَرَةٍ مُبَارَكَةٍ زَيْتُونَةٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“…lit from a blessed olive-tree.” (Qur’an, Surah Noor 24:35)***

I say: This hospitability and hosting is the hospitability of knowledges
and *Sunnahs* that by the being of the Holy Prophet (S) and the Imam
continues till the Day of Judgment. And in the *Ziarat* of Friday we
recite:

“And I, my master am on this day your guest and refugee.”

In Part Three we have previously given some matter pertaining to this
subject. Sayyid bin Tawus says in *Jamaal al-Usbu’:*

I reach you wherever I travel.

In whichever city I may be, I am always your guest.

Here I would like to quote a narrational report that in my view is not
inappropriate to our subject matter.

In the book of *Darus Salaam* it is quoted from Tabarsi’s *Mishkaat*
that:

A man asked His Eminence, Abul Hasan (Imam Hadi) Askari (as): How is it
that Abu Dalf is having 4001 villages? He replied: One night a believer
became his guest and he also presented to him a big tray full of dates
numbering 4001. Thus the Almighty Allah rewarded him with a village for
each date.
