Responsibility 83: Not Hurting or Upsetting the Imam
====================================================

Another responsibility is to keep away from anything which would lead to
the Imam being upset or saddened with us.

Without doubt, the primary reason for the Imam being upset with his
followers is due to us not obeying the orders of Allah  and instead,
following our base desires. In other words when we do not follow the
religion and teachings of the Imam (which as we know, is the same
religion and set of teachings which his noble fore-fathers taught), it
is at this time that the Imam becomes upset with us.

Indeed, the Ahlul Bayt (as) sacrificed everything including their own
lives to implement the religion, just like the sacred chain of previous
prophets had done.

Disrespecting the sacred beliefs of the faith, objecting to and
desecrating the faith and its teachings and the method of the Prophet of
Islam, exposing the secrets of Allah  in places where they should not
be mentioned, not observing taqiyyah, not having taqwa, exaggerating and
over glorifying the pure Ahlul Bayt (as) are all things which lead to
the Imam becoming distraught and thus, we must keep away from all of
these things.

Imam al-Mahdi (ajtf) wrote the following to his followers:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَدْ آذَانَا جُهَلاَءُ الشِّيْعَةِ وَ حُمَقَائُهُمْ وَ مَنْ دِينُهُ
جَنَاحُ الْبَعُوضَةِ أَرْحَجُ مِنْهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Surely the ignorant and foolish Shi’as have upset us and the person
whose faith is (as weak as) the wing of a gnat is better than one of
them (the ignorant Shi’as).”[^1]
