The Rest of the Hussain Convoy inside the Medina of the Messenger (P)
=====================================================================

When the women of Imam Hussain (Q) entered the Medina, the ladies of the
family of Hashim started to weep, and the whole Medina bawled a loud
cry. Then Imam Zein El-Abedeen with a group of his men entered the house
of the Messenger (P), and saw it desolated, empty of its people, and
lonesome with its grieves.

As for Sayyeda Zeinab (O) she held to the hangers of the mosque’s doors
and called: "O Grandfather, I do deliver to you the bad news about the
demise of my brother Hussain

", then she was always sad with her tears never drying. She did not stop
crying and weeping, and whenever she looked at Ali Bin Al-Hussain, her
grief would renew and her pain would increase.

Thus the ladies of the Hashim’s family wore black and sackcloth29 and
they did not complain of hot or cold. Imam Ali Bin Al-Hussain (Q) used
to prepare the funeral food for them.

It was narrated that Imam Jaafar Bin Mohammad (Q) had said: "Al-Hussain
Bin Ali was mourned for one whole year every day and night; and for
three years from the day of the tragedy…"

This indicates the depth of the grief of the Hashim’s family and how
they were keen to mourn the Master of martyrs (Q). They had passionately
grieved and longed for him, and they kept on doing that as a way to keep
remembering Abu Abdu Allah (Q) and as continuation of his approach.
