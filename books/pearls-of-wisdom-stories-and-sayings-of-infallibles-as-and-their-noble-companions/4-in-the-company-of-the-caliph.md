When ‘Ali (as) was coming to Kufa, he entered the city of Anbar
populated by Iranians. The Iranian farmers were very happy to see their
beloved caliph passing through their town. They came to his visit. When
it was time for ‘Ali (as) to leave, they started running infront of his
horse. ‘Ali (as) inquired about this behaviour.

“This is one way that we extend respect to our leaders and respectful
individuals. This is our custom that has been practiced for years.”

“This behaviour puts you in discomfort in this world, and brings about
humiliation in the next world. Always stay away from practices that
humiliate you. After all what benifit is their in such a practice to the
recipients?”[^1]
