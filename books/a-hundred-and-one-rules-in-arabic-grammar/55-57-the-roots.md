57. The Roots.
==============

Most Arabic words can be attributed to some 3-letter root, where
radicals are referred to by means of a prototypical root,** فَعَلَ**
.**ف** stands for the first radical,**ع** for the second, and**ل** for
the third. This 3-letter root form is the entry you need to use when you
want to check out any word in any Arabic dictionary. You should know by
now how to dissect words in order to get to that root. Mainly, you need
to drop off any gender and number markers of the noun/adjective. In case
of the verbs, you need to drop off any subject, tense, and mood markers.
