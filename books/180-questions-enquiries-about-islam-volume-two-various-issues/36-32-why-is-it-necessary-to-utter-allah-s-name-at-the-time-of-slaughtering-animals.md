32. Why is it Necessary to Utter Allahâ€™s Name at the Time of Slaughtering (Animals)?
====================================================================================

Does reciting the name of Allah (s.w.t.) or another entity while
slaughtering an animal have an influence upon the meat of the animal as
far as hygiene and sanitation is concerned?

In answer to this question it must be mentioned that it is not essential
for the name of Allah (s.w.t.) or another entity to necessitate an
impact on the substance and essence of the meat in terms of cleanliness.
This is because, the prohibition imposed on certain things in Islam are
dictated by several factors.

At times, the prohibition is for the purpose of hygiene and protection
of the body, while at other times it is for the purification of the soul
and on occasions it is for preserving the social order. In reality, the
prohibition imposed upon consumption of meat of animals that have been
slaughtered by reciting the names of idols has a spiritual, ethical and
educative dimension associated with it.

Such acts distance man from Allah (s.w.t.) and possess undesirable
psychological effects; this is so since this act belongs to the rites
associated with polytheism and paganism, and serves to revive their
memories.[^1]
