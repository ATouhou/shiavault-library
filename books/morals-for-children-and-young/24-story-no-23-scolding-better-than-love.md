Story no. 23: Scolding better than love?
========================================

Farhad came home from school with tearful and crying eyes.  
 Aqa Hadi, Farhad’s father Asked “What’s the matter, son?”  
 He replied “I was pestering the children on my class and the teacher
was also attentive on me. He told me to be silent, but I didn’t obey.  
 He came in front at once and caught my hand and hit me.  
 Aqa Hadi said “My son, don’t be unhappy, and first know:  
 Teachers punishment is better than father’s love  
 And secondly that school is a place to study and not to play.”
