What is Music?
==============

Music, according to the New National Dictionary, means "Art of combining
sounds or sequences of notes into harmonious patterns pleasing to the
ear and satisfying to the emotions; melody". According to the Great
Encyclopaedic Dictionary, this combining of sounds is "for reproduction
by the voice or various kinds of musical instruments in rhythmic,
melodious and harmonious form so as to express thought or feeling and
affect the emotion;" and the word is also used for the "sound so
produced," and for ‘written or printed score of musical compositions."
Not so technically, it is also used for "pleasant sound, e.g., song of a
bird, murmur of a stream, cry of hounds."

In Islam music is called Ghina, and in Shia Sha’riah is counted as one
of the ‘great sins’. At first, it may seem unrealistic to ban every
"pleasant sound"; but there is no need to be alarmed. The Sha’riah has
defined ‘Ghina’ in a different way. In Islam, vocal music means:
"Prolongation and vibration of sound with variation of the pitch to such
an extent that people may say that ‘he/she is singing’."

It is evident from the above definition that the Sha’riah does not
forbid ‘pleasant sounds’; but if someone recites any thing with
prolongation of sound and variation of pitch so much so that a common
man thinks that he/she is singing, then and only then it will be ‘Ghina’
and sin.

And it makes no difference whether the thing recited was the Qur’an,
religious poem or love song.
