Lesson Seventy Nine: A Hidden Imam
==================================

Imam al-Sadiq (a.s) said,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كَيْفَ يَنْتَفِعُ النّاسُ بِالْحُجَّةِ الْغائِب الْمَسْتُور؟ قالَ كَما
يَنْتَفِعُونَ بِالشَّمْسِ إذا سَتَرَهَا السَّحآبُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) was asked: “how can people enjoy the existence of
an invisible and hidden Imam?”

He replied, “ just as they enjoy sunlight from behind the clouds.”[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Sunlight is the source of all activity on this earth and no living
creature can continue to live without it. The fact that it sometimes
comes from behind the clouds does not diminish its utility. And the same
applies to the light from a divine Imam and leader in the context of
man’s spiritual and human life.

Sun hidden by a cloud, just like a light behind a translucent glass,
sends out a considerable part of its light and removes the darkness of
night and benefits the living plants and creatures. The spiritual
blessings of the Imam (a.s.) illuminate the human world even from behind
the hiding curtain, but just as the amount of sunlight entering a
building depends on its openings, people’s share from the light of
leadership is proportionate to the method and degree of their relation
and connection with the Imam.
