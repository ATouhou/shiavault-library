36. Response To The Call Of Allah And His Messenger (S)
=======================================================

Allah, the Mighty and Sublime says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اسْتَجِيبُوا لِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ
إِذَا دَعَاكُمْ لِمَا يُحْيِيكُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“O you who believe! answer (the call of) Allah and His Apostle when
he calls you to that which gives you life.” (Qur’an, Surah Anfaal
8:24)***

Doubtlessly, the implication of life in this verse is the eternal life
and a prosperous and happy livelihood that is obtained by following the
Holy Prophet (S). We had previously mentioned that whatever the
infallible successors of the Holy Prophet (S) have ordered or performed,
they are commands of Allah and the Prophet. And in the past discussions
and the coming chapters it will become clear how much the Imams arranged
and made efforts to pray for our master, the Master of the Time (aj) and
the early reappearance of His Eminence (aj). And there is no scope of
any doubt in it that preparation of man in this great matter is a
response to the call of Allah and His Messenger (S).

This matter has also been mentioned under other topics in different
verses of the Holy Qur’an. Among them is the statement of the Almighty
Allah:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا
الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“O you who believe! obey Allah and obey the Apostle and those in
authority from among you…” (Qur’an, Surah Nisa 4:59)***

Also relevant to this part are all the verses that order the performing
of good deeds and those that command us to take the Holy Prophet (S) and
his progeny as role models, to express love for them and to follow them.
