**It is an Ism that is Manṣūb and is mentioned (in the sentence) for the
purpose of clarifying the one in connection with whom the action is
performed, like when you say:**

جاء الأميرُ والجيشَ                    (The Commander came withthe army
)

استوى الماءُ والخشبةَ       (The water became level withthe stick/wood )

As for the Khabar of كان and its sisters and the Ism of إنّ and its
sisters, they have already been mentioned in (the Chapter on the
Marfū‘āt) and likewise the the Tawābi‘, they have already been dealt
there.
