Abstract
========

No doubt life in its all forms enjoys a very high status in Islam. Human
life is one of the most sacred creatures of God. Therefore, it must be
appreciated, respected and protected. In this regard, the paper refers
to different parts. The first part studies the value of life in Islam.
It helps to understand why life must be appreciated and respected. The
second part sheds some light on the nature of the Islamic bioethics.
Discussing the sources and authorities in the Islamic bioethics, in this
part we will study the way of life protection which is regulated by the
Islamic law and bioethics.

Part three reflects on some important issues in bioethics from an
Islamic perspective. Concerning the Islamic believes, physical health
maintenance and disease treatment are two important aspects of the
Islamic teachings. In respect to the beginning of human life; firstly,
we will see that reproduction must occur in the context of a legitimate
and stable family. Secondly, we will study family planning and abortion.
With respect to the end of life, issues such as suicide and euthanasia
will be studied. Finally organ transplantation will be discussed.
