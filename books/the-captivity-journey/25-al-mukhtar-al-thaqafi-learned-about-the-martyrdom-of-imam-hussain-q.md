Al-Mukhtar Al-Thaqafi Learned about the Martyrdom of Imam Hussain (Q)
=====================================================================

Obayd Allah Bin Ziad could not kill Al-Mukhtar Al-Thaqafi due to his
kinship with Omar Bin Al-Khattab and Omar Bin Saad. Bin Ziad ordered
Al-Mukhtar out of jail after having put him in it after the killing of
Muslim and Hani. As after he got the letter of Yazeed in which he
ordered him to kill and imprison people for any suspicion, he imprisoned
a group from the Shia, and Al-Mukhtar was one of them. He stayed in jail
till they brought the head of Imam Hussain (Q) and it was put between
his hands, so he covered it with a veil. Then he took Al-Mukhtar out of
the jail and when Al-Mukhtar saw the Noble Head, he shouted a loud cry.
Thus, Al-Mukhtar was released afterwards, after Bin Ziad had injured his
eye.
