Why Use it as a Testimonial if not Transmitted Consecutively?
-------------------------------------------------------------

**Muharram 19, 1330**

Shiâ€™as apply the principle of consecutive reporting when discussing
imamate, due to the fact that they consider consecutive reporting as one
of the principles of faith; so why do you quote the Ghadir hadith in
support of your argument although such hadith is not consecutively
reported according to Sunnis, even if its authenticity is attested to by
their *sahih*s?

Sincerely,

*S*
