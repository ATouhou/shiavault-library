Ali (peace be upon him) at the Time of Fatima’s Demise:
=======================================================

Ali (peace be upon him) sat beside Fatima (peace be upon her) on the
last day of Fatima’s life at dusk. Although he was as a dam in front of
the difficulties, and a mountain of resistance, he blew out crying when
seeing Fatima’s status. Fatima (peace be upon her) came to her senses,
and a dialogue took place between them:

-O, my cousin, are you?

-Yes, dear Fatima, it’s me.

-This is the ninth year of our marriage.

- Yes, O my dear Fatima.

-I did my best to be a fidle and sincere wife, didn’t I?

-Yes, dear Fatima; your esteem, your knowledge, and your fidelity were
praiseworthy. You were more honorable than everyone

“ والله انت ابرّ و اتقي واكرم”.
</p>

(At this time, both Ali (peace be upon him) and Fatima (peace be upon
her) cried. Fatima (peace be upon her) got unconscious, and when came to
her senses again and found Ali crying above her head. She went on:

-My cousin, is that you?

-Yes, dear Fatima. How are you?

-Dear Ali, I want to make a will.

-Tell me Fatima.

-My will is about my children. After my death, marry Amame, my niece,
because my children are more accustomed with her. Bury me at night, and
do not let the enemy attend my funeral ceremony or say prayer on me.

Then, Ali started reciting Yasin Sura (from the holy Quran). Fatima then
closed eyes forever.
