**Resolve-العزم**

1. Whoever reveals his decision [to others], his judiciousness gets
nullified.

> 1ـ مَنْ أظْهَرَ عَزْمَهُ بَطَلَ حَزْمُهُ.

2. Whoever resolves to do evil, his arrow returns to him.

> 2ـ مَنْ ساءَ عَزْمُهُ رَجَعَ عَلَيْهِ سَهْمُهُ.

4. Do not resolve upon that in which you find no clear guidance.

> 3ـ لاتَعْزِمْ عَلى مالَمْ تَسْتَبِنِ الرُّشْدَ فيهِ.

5. There is no good in [making a] resolution without determination.[^1]

> 4ـ لاخَيْرَ في عَزْم بِلا حَزْم.
