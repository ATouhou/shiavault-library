The practical laws of Islam that are related to the actions that one
must perform and those that must be avoided, and are the responsibility
of everyone to learn, are called the *Ahkam* (rules).

Every action that a person performs has a specific ruling in Islam. The
various actions that we perform, which are related to our responsibility
(to Allah) are divided into five categories: *Wajib, Haram, Mustahab,
Makruh, and Mubah.*

***Wajib*****:** Those actions that must be performed, and turning away
from them, incur Allah’s punishment - for example Salat, and Sawm.

***Haram*****:** Those actions which must be avoided, and performing
them incur punishment from Allah, like lying and oppression.

***Mustahab*****:** These are actions which are recommended to be
performed and earn the person a reward, but not performing such actions
do not incur punishment from Allah - for example saying Salam and giving
Sadaqa.

***Makruh*****:** Those actions which are better if not performed, and
if avoided, earn a reward, but if performed, do not accompany a
punishment - for example, sleeping in a Masjid, and the praising of
goods that a person sells (otherwise known as advertising).

***Mubah*****:** Those actions whose performance or turning away from
are equal; meaning one neither gets a reward, nor punishment - for
example walking or sitting.
