96. غيرُ
========

غيرُ is a noun which will create Idaafa when it is used with another
noun (a). It  also serves to negate nouns and adjectives and may be
translated "non-," "un-," and so on. When it is used in such a
Syntactical Environment (i.e., with adjectives) it creates what we call
"Phony/Fake Idaafa," where the second term is an adjective (b).
