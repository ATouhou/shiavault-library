94. An active participle noun is a form that indicates that which
performs an action or indicates a state, for example: **کاتِب.**

95. An active participle noun is formed from triliteral verbs on the
form **فاعِل,** for example: **شاکِر.** It is formed from verbs with
more than three letters from their active aorist form by replacing the
aorist letter with a *mīm* that has a *dummah* and giving the next to
last letter a *kasrah*. So, the verb **یُکرِم** becomes **مُکرِم.**

96. A passive participle noun is a form that indicates that which the
action was performed on, for example: **مَکسُور.**

97. The passive participle is formed from triliteral verbs on the form
**مَفعُول,** for example; **مَنصُور.** It is formed from verbs with more
than three letters from their passive aorist form by replacing the
aorist letter with a *mīm* that has a *dummah*, for example:
**مُکرَّم.**

The two forms **فَعُول** and **فَعیل** are common for both the active
and passive participle nouns. Sometimes they are used to mean an active
participle noun, for example: **صَبُور** and sometimes a passive
participle noun, for example: **رَسُول.**

The passive participle noun is formed from passive transitive verbs
whether they accept an objective compliment by themselves or by a
intermediary, for example: **مکانٌ مَجلوسٌ فیه.**
