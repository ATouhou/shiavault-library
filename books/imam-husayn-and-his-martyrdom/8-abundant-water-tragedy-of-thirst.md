Abundant water & tragedy of thirst
==================================

From the most ancient times this tract of the lower Euphrates has been a
garden. It was a cradle of early civilisation, a meeting place between
Sumer and Arab, and later between the Persians and Arabs. It is a rich,
well watered country, with date-palms and pomegranate groves.

Its fruitful fields can feed populous cities and its luscious pastures
attract the nomad Arabs of the desert, with their great flocks and
herds. It is of particularly tragic significance that on the border of
such a well-watered land, should have been enacted the tragedy of great
and good men dying of thirst and slaughtered because they refused to
bend the knee to the forces of iniquity.

The English poet's lines*“Water, water everywhere, and not a drop to
drink”* are brought home forcibly to you in this borderland between
abundant water and desolate sands.
