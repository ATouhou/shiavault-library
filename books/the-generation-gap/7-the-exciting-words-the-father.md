The Exciting Words the Father
=============================

My child! We have inherited from our fourth Imam, Ali b. Husain (as) a
precious encyclopedia in the form of supplication and requests from
Allah, by the name of al-Sahifah al-Sajjadiyyah. I am going to read to
you a passage from this book on the topic of our discussion. I hope to
draw your attention to some exciting words in connection with one's
obligations to his father and mother. The honourable Imam with much fear
in his heart, sits in prayer in front of glory and majesty of Almighty
Allah and in a humbling voice says:

"O Lord, bless Muhammad, Thy servant and Thy Apostle and the holy
people of his house.

Distinguish, O Lord, my parents with excellence before Thee and grace
from Thee, O Most Merciful! O Lord, bless Muhammad and his descendants.
Acquaint me by inspiration with the knowledge of what is due unto them
from me. Collect for me the complete knowldge of all this. Cause me to
act according to what Thou reveal to me by inspiration. Give me grace to
penetrate into such of this knowleges as Thou teach me till I omit to
perform nothing Thou has taught me. Do not let my limbs grow heavy (so
as to prevent them) from the discharge of what Thou reveal unto me.

O Lord, bless Muhammad and his descendants as Thou hast exalted us with
him. Favour Muhammad and his descendant as Thou has given us claims upon
Thy creation bexause of him. Make me fear my parents as I would fear a
despotic ruler and love them with the tenderness of an indulgent mother.
Let me obedience to my parents and beneficence to them be sweeter to my
eyes than sleep is to the drowsy, cooler to my beast than drinking water
is to the thirsty, till I give prefrence to their wishes over mine and
precedence to the satisfaction of their needs over mine.

Let me over-value their benevolence to me, even in small things and
under-value my beneficence to them, even in great things.

O Lord, let me lower my voice for them.
Let my speech be agrrable to them
Soften my conduct towards them.
Let my heart be kind to them.
Make me tender and lenient unto them both.
O Lord, reward them for bringing me up.
Recompense them for loving me.
Guard them as they guarded me in the my infancy.

O Lord, whatever pain they may have received from me, whatever
displeasure may have been caused to them by me or whatever duty owed to
them that was left unperformed by me, let that be a pardon of their
sins, and exaltation of thier rank and an addition to their good deeds.
O Thou, who does change evil deeds into multiplied good deeds!

O Lord, that speech in which they were unjust to me. or that action in
which they were extragant against me. or such of my claims as they
faidled to satisfy, or such debts as they faidled to discharge, verily,
I forgive it to them and favour them therewith. I turn unto Thee with a
view to removing the penalty thereof from them.

For verily I do not accuse them falsely of haveing done something to my
hurt, nor do I deem them negligent in doing good to me, nor do I despite
the care they took of me, O Lord! Because their claim upon me is so
great, their benevolence to me so magnificent and I am os highly obliged
to them, that

I cannot fairly meet, it nor repay them as they deserve. O my God, how
can I repay them for their tedious employemnt in bringing me up. For
their hard labour in guarding me. For their self-denied to lavish
comfort upon me.! Alas! alas (I cannot).

Their claim can never be satisfied by me, nor can I perceive what is
due from mr unto them nor can I fully discharge the duty of serving
them! Therefore, bless Muhammad and his descendants. Help me, O best of
all those whose assistance is solicited. Give me grace, O Greatest of
Guides, towards whom people turn.

Do not let me be of those who wronged their fathers and mothers on the
day wherein " every soul shall be paid what it has merited and they
shall not be treated with injustice.

O lord, bless Muhammad and his descendants. Distinguish my parent, in
particular with the best distinctions which Thou hast confrred upon the
fathers and mothers of Thy true believing servants, O Most Merciful.

O lord, do not let me forget to remember them after my ritual prayers,
at every time of my night and at every hour of my day. O God, bless
Muhammad and his descendants. Forgive me for the sake of my prayers for
them. Grant a sure pardon to them because of their goodness to me.

Be perfectly satisfied with them through my intercession for them.
Bring them by Thy Mercy into places of safety. O God, If Thy Pardon for
them has preceded (my prayers), than make them intercessiors for me.

If Thy pardon for me has preceded (Thy forgiving them.) than make me an
intercessor for them so that we may be gathered by Thy Mercy in the
place of Thy grace, the place of thy pardon and Mercy. For verily Thou
art the one Whose Munirficence is Great, Whose kindness is eternal. Thou
art the Most Merciful." - Al-Sahifa Al-Sajjadiyyah, Prayer number 24
(For parents)

The Child:

No matter how hard or how long I tried, I would not be able to observe
the sensitive and important subjects on fathers and mothers as it is
apparent from the beautiful and meaningful and concise words of our
Fourth Imam. Every single sentence of his statements are an indication
of how deeply he thinks and of how knowledgeable he is. Such words can
come only from an individula of excellent calibre and a pious man as
Imam Sajjad (as). Hearing him had such an impact upon me as if he woke
me up from a deep and long sleep. I pray to Allah, by the glory of this
holy man and his words, to grant me that ability to put these words
practice.

**28. The Limited Obedience The Father:**

My child! As important as it is to obey your father and mother, you
should know that is is not an absolute must. In instances where the
parents are corrupt and they encourage the child in doing wrong and
illegal actions, one ought not obey them. Nevertherless, treating them
with respect is always recommended. The almighty Allah says:

"But if they strive to make thee join in worship with me, things of
which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not, yet bear them company in
this life with justice (and consideration)"

- The Holy Qur'an 31:15 Imam Ali (as) in Nahjul-Balaghah, which after
the Glorious Qur'an is the best guide for mankind, says:

"An obligation of a child to his father is to obey him in all but not
sinfulness actions." - Nahjul Balaghah p. 546

The Child:

Yes, what you are sayingk is absolute truth. Of course, breaking
Allah's rules even upon the insistance of father and mother is wrong.

**29. Forever The Father:**

My beloved child! You are not only advised to treat your parents with
respect in their lifetime, but after they die too, you must speak of
them with honour. You must beg Allah to forgive them. For, if you are a
child worthy of your father, you can still earn your parents rewards
from Allah. Imam al-Sadiq (as) says:

"After a man dies, he can still rewards from Allah in three defferent
ways: Â 1. From what he has left behind which still benefits he public.

2. From establishing a useful tradition be followed by others after his
death, and
3. From prayers done in his name by pious child."

- Wafi part 13, p. 90

So, when your parents are dead and no longer are able to do rewarding
deeds for themselves, you can come to their help. You can be thinking of
them and make them happy by asking Allah to bless their souls. As they
thought of you throughout their lives.

The Child:

I pray to Allah to keep you and protect you for many years to come, and
to succeed in doing my best in fulfilling my obligations to you; and to
make both of you absolutely happy with me.

**30. The Eldest Brother The Father:**

My child! In the same way that fathers are worthy of everybody's
respect, the eldest brothers ought to be honoured by all their siblings.
Furthermore, the later should regard hm as their father.

Our Eighth Imam al-Rida (as) had a saying in this regard:

"Your eldest brother is like your father."

- Wafi, part 14, p. 79
The Child:

Of course, he deserves such a high respect provided that his attitudes
towads all his siblings are as that of his father. He is to treat them
with brotherly love and compassion. Be nice rather than cruel to them at
times. In short, be like a father to them.

**31. Caring For the Family and The Mankind The Father:**

My child! In same manner that one should honour and respect his
parents, it is appropriate that he be compassionate to his spouse,
children, brothers, sisters and all his relatives, so life would become
pleasant for him. Lord Aviboury says:

"One must have love and kindness in every aspect of life. What is a
home without love likes? How is life possible in such a home? It is
possible to have a beautiful buikding equipped with all facilities and
appliances. But such a place without love is noting less than hell. On
the other hand, if you base you home on love and friendship, you can
live there in happiness forever after."

- In Search of Happiness, pp. 107, 139 He further continues: "Life in
this world is like dream.1 It does not last long. Here man is like a
drop of dew that shiness of a few moments then suddenly he disappears.
In this case, why should we spend this short life with misery and
hardship? In our short lifetime, we should love one another and enjoy
each others friendshie."

- In Search of Happiness, pp. 107, 139

The Child:

Of course, loving and caring for family, relatives and friends and all
minkind, brightens our hearts and makes life a more pleasant and joyous
one to live.

1. In a poem written in 1982, William Buttler Yeats commented on the
brevity of human life:

"From our birthday untill we die is but the winkling an eye."
Also the Holy Qur'an says as follows:
He says: "What number of years you did stay on earth?"
They will say: "We stayed a day or part of a day, but ask those who
keep accounts."

- The Holy Qur'an 23: 112-113 [Tr]

**32. The Spiritual Fathers The Father:**

My child! As in the same way that you are greatly indebted to your
parents, we are oblitgated to the Holy Prophet (p.b.u.h.) and to our
other religious pioneers and leaders. Our Holy Prophet (p.b.u.h) founded
the religion of Islam. Imam Ali (as) and other Imams trenthened its
foundation as far as they possibly could propagate it, and struggled
diligently for the betterment of Islam and the Muslims. They took great
pains in strenthening and protecting Islam's roots against dangerous and
cataclysmic events througout their lives.

These true leaders have always had peopl's interest in mind and have
issued instructions for people to follow in order to achieve complete
happiness in life. Through their divine influence on masses, they were
able to attract their unshakeable loyalty. The later were even willing
to sacrifice their own lives for the Imams.

Through following their philosohy, one can learn about perseverance,
faith, strong belief, struggling for the cause fo liberty, self
sacrifice, serving others, suppressing injustice, assisting the
oppressed and finally bout love for human beings. My child! The entire
world pay homage to the excelent thoughts and firm institutions of our
religious leaders.

The Child:

Of course, to be fair to our religious leaders is to put their words of
guidance into practice. and to model our actions after their actions. If
we could sincerely implement their guidelines our society will become
the most dynamic, prosperous community of mankind. Simply, knowing theri
noble characters and greeting and remembering them with honour, is not
enough. I say so, because I know of people who speak of their love and
respect for our Imams and utter excellent salutations after upon hearing
their names and even in some instances, will rise in their honour, but
when it comes to act according to thier instructions, it is something
else. They forget all about them.

In my opinion these sort of people simply deceive themslves, and feel
happy that they are the followers of the Holy Prophet (p.b.u.h.), Imam
Ali (as), and other religious leaders. Because their acts and deed do
not reflect any traces from these exalted leaders. Certainly, the
Prophet and innocent Imams are unhappy with these type of people. As
Islam is a practical religion, only those who adhere to and practice
according to its principles, will benefit from Islam.

**33. The Teacher's Rights The Father:**

In addition to parents obligations, Islam attaches special regards for
the teachers right. We must appreciate their existence and should
discharge our duties and obligations towards them. Is is believed that
Imam Ali (as) has said.

"The one, who had taught me one word had indeed earned the rights of
masterhood upon me."

It is the teacher who fights ignorance or in other words fights
illiteracy. He sacrifices his productive years educating and nourshing
peoples minds. Finally, it is he who delivers these services and through
his endeavours brings value to the society.

A famous Iraqi poet by the name Rassafi has written a beautiful and
meaningful poem in praising teachers, describing their contributions in
an appropriate manner, as follows:

"Whenever ignorance misleads people, there is nothing for propgress
except learning. If I am asked, 'when people are deep in corruption, who
is the one who can save them out of its? I would "the teacher'. The
teacher of the chidren of the country, are also their physicians who
treat their ignorance. As lact of knowledge is pathogenic. The teacher
is like a brights star shining in the society's sky, who guide the
knowledge seekers to glory and greatness.

Do not underestimate your indebtedness to your teacher. It equals that
to your parents and even more. Your wisdom comes from your teacher while
your muscles and bones are from your parents. It is our duty to teach
the illiterate and it is theirs to learn. Allah has not commanded the
people to learn without first making arrangement of divine teachers (the
prophets) and the heavenly books.

- Iraqi peot Rassafi A persian poet too, says:

"Higher than rank of the father is that of the teacher. As the former
nourishes one's body while the later. his soul." George Herbet says: "O
God! You have prodived for us in every way. At first with our parents to
bring us up, and later with our teachers to nourishe our minds and to
teach us the laws of intellect."

- The Book of Ethics, Part 1. p. 37 Immanuel Kant says:

"It is only through education that man can culturally become a most
complete or perfect human being. In fact he is the result of his
education." - The Philosophy of Education, Vol. 1 p. 41

The Child:

In general, teachers, professors and those serving others through
educational activities play an important part in people's happiness. One
can easily state that the people's future depends on the way the
educators educate them.

Of course they should be sincerely devoted teaching and should bestow
knowledge upon their pupils. They must possess a pure heart and be of
excellent character to succeed in educating good-natured and enlightened
students. Because to receive good quality education and to learn good
character, the students are entrusted to them. Only after they have
successfully taught their students, the teachers have fulfilled their
grave duty. An accomplished teacher succeeds in replacing eveil
characters by food ones. Of course, such teachers are worthy of high
recognition and respect and are considered valuable and useful to the
society.

**34. The Fatherly Guidance The Father:**

My child! Do take advantage of your youth and do not waste it. Use
those unreturnable years to prepare yourself for your golden years.
Bravery is not when one spends his younger years in lewdness and
drunkenness. Rather, it is when, inspite of his youthfulness and energy,
proctects himself against any kind of sinful act, and to put his
futures's well being ahead of his sensual desires and to follow his
intellectual judgement in every situation.

There are some young people who know nothing about good mannerism and
good behaviour. They should try to better themselves while there is
still a chance and before it becomes too late. They should also free
themselves from indulgence in their own desires. Instead, they should
try to conduct themselves with modesty and to protect themselves behind
a strong shield of chastity.

But, unfortunately, sometimes they are so deeply involved in such a
degree of negect thaat they cannot find a way out and fail to have any
forsight. Undoubtedly, someday they will be sorry, But then, it will be
too late as they have lost all their chances. My child! I am afraid you
will grow up to be one of them. Choosing to lead a rebellious life, you
may have a future similar to theirs.

The Child:

Your fear about my future is justified because one can expect just
about anything from an unexperienced young individual. But, I am hoping
that with your guidance and advice you will help me find the right path
and that I will be able to follow it steadfastly.
