Lesson Ninety Nine: The Zealous
===============================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ اللّهَ تَعالَى يُحِبُّ مِنْ عِبادِهِ الْغَيُورَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

God likes his zealous servants.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Zeal in this context refers to resolute determination , earnest
dedication, fervent striving to protect divine bounties including
everything from religion and chastity to water and land and well being
of Islamic countries.

A zealous person is one who is fully committed and takes responsibility
for protecting these things and becomes very disturbed by any aggression
and encroachment against them.

Zeal is one of the prominent attributes of the prophets and men of God.
We read about Abraham (a.s.), the idol- breaker hero, ‘surely Abraham
was zealous’. Zeal is a powerful barrier against the advance of alien
forces and ideologies.
