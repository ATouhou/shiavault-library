After all, I say “Merry Christmas” to the entire people of the world,
especially to my own fellow citizens, as he was granted by God the title
of “Spirit of Allah”. Celebrating birthdays of each of these great men
is much better than mourning for their departure from life. I hope that
God help us follow him and, in our time, we may have the chance that
Imam of the age (AFTS) emerge while Jesus accompanies him and we may
meet the two of these great men,

In Shaa Allah (hopefully).
