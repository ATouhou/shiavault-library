***"O you who believe! Fear Allah and seek an approach unto Him..."
(Holy Qur'an 5:35)***

Over the last few centuries, the Muslims have been wracked by severe
discord and hostility over the issue of*tawassul* (beseeching or
supplicating) to Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.A.), the Ahl al-Bayt (A.S.),
the Saints and the Pious, to the extent that those who reject this
concept have accused its supporters of shirk or polytheism, while the
upholders of*tawassul* have charged its opponents with enmity and
aversion towards the Prophet (S.A.W.A.) and his Infallible Household
(A.S.). The result has led to increasing bigotry on both sides to the
benefit of their common enemies who have increased their domination of
Muslim lands. This article is an attempt to examine and critically study
the issue of*tawassul* .
