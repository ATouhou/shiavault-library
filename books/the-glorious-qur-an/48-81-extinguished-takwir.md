81: Extinguished! (takwir)
==========================

These 29 Early Meccan verses were revealed after The Flame (or Palm
Fibre) 111 and before Glory to Your Lord in the Highest 87. The chapter
is quite poetic, and rhymed throughout; it concerns the Last Judgment,
and in this aspect resembles Chapter 74 The Man Wearing a Cloak. Its
graphic quality conveys vivid dreams or visions to us, while the
Prophetic message moves swiftly.
