Lesson One Hundred Twenty Three: Cooperation With Satan!
========================================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لا تَسُبَّنَّ إِبْلِيْسَ فِى الْعَلانِيَةِ وَ أنْتَ صَدِيقُهُ فِى
السِّرِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Do not curse Satan publicly, while you are his friend inwardly.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Some people proclaim their disdain and distance themselves verbally from
things like poverty, hypocrisy, Satan and such like, while in practice
they are drowned in them.

We know of rich men who live like the poor for the fear of becoming poor
if they spent more. We know hypocrites who repeatedly curse the
hypocrites, when their own life is full of hypocrisy.

We know devilish people who say publicly: ‘I take refuge in God from
Satan, the outcast’. And yet , they are his friends inwardly and give
much importance to their devilish activities. Their words are devoid of
substance and contradict their inner reality.
