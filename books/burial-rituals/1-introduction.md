Introduction
============

Death is a reality. The Qur'an in says:

**"*****Every person (nafs) will taste death, .....*****" (Surah
3:185)**

(taste can be either sweet or bitter!).

At another place the Qur'an says,

**"*****... no one knows (where) in what land (or place) he will
die*****". (Surah 31:34)**

Still at another place the Qur'an says,

**"*****Allah does not give any breather (or let up) to anyone for death
when its fixed time comes."*** **(Surah 63:11)**

Therefore, one should not dread death but take it as crossing the bridge
from this temporary life to the permanent, everlasting life. So, what
should be done when one is confronted with it? This is the topic for our
discussion.
