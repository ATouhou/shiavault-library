Chapter 10: Contribution in Literature
======================================

Imam Jafar al-Sadiq (A.S) defined 'literature' as no one had ever denied
during the past twelve centuries. He said : "Literature is the garment
which one puts on what he says or writes so that it may appear more
attractive."

He further said that it is possible that literature may have no
knowledge, but there is no knowledge without literature. Every kind of
knowledge contains literature, but every kind of literature does not
necessarily contain knowledge. These are indeed concise and
comprehensive definitions of the relationship between knowledge and
literature.

The Imam was indeed the pioneer to start the literary age. If he had not
taken the first step and given encouragement to scientists and men of
letters, there would have been no literary awakening and no Renaissance
of knowledge.
