A - Abdullah Ibn Abbas
======================

Among the people who tried to stop the Imam from going to Karbala, when
he was that the Imam would not change his mind he became sad. He was
among the first to know of Imam Husayn's death. On the day of Ashuraâ€™,
he saw in his sleep that his perfume had changed to blood, so he knew
that Imam Husayn had been killed.

Ibn Abbas was the Prophet (pbuh&hf) and Imam Ali's cousin. He was a very
well-known and respected figure in Quraish. He lost his vision near the
end of his life and died in Al Ta'ef in 68 A.H. at the age of 70.
Muhammad Ibn Al-Hanafiyyah, Imam Husayn's brother from his father's
side, prayed on his body.
