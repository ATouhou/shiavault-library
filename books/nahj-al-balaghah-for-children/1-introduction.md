Introduction
============

Welcome to the Nahj al-Balaghah, the world of Imam Ali, may peace be
upon him.

Here is a small selection from the great collection of speeches,
sermons, letters, and sayings of the Imam, next only to the Qur'an in
its beauty.

This work, which is one of the masterpieces of Arabic prose is difficult
to translate, especially for a children's book. Yet we have tried to
select the simplest of its passages which can be useful for children.
These small passages, together with the illustrations, are a small
window into the great world of Imam Ali, peace be on him, who was the
most perfect of human beings after the Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless
him and his Household.
