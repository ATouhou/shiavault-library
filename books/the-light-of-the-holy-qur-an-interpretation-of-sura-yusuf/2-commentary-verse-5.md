Commentary : Verse 5
====================

(5) هُوَ الَّذي جَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ ضِياءً وَ الْقَمَرَ نُوراً وَ
قَدَّرَهُ مَنازِلَ لِتَعْلَمُوا عَدَدَ السِّنينَ وَ الْحِسابَ ما خَلَقَ
اللَّهُ ذلِكَ إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ يُفَصِّلُ الْآياتِ لِقَوْمٍ
يَعْلَمُونَ

5. "He it is Who made the sun a radiation and the moon a light, and
determined it by stations, that you might know the number of years and
the reckoning(of time). Allah did not create that save in
truth.(Thus)does He explain the Signs in detail, for a people who know.
"

**Commentary :**

There are words used in the Qur'an for the sun, such as/ siraj/ and/ d
iya'/, which signify a strong and intensive light. As for the moon, the
words used are/ nour/ and/ munir/ which signify even dim light as
well.

From among the tokens of Allah's designs in the world of existence and
His absolute command over the universe, one can name the wise order
spread throughout the entire cosmos. Do you not behold what a heat and
what a light He has given to the sun They change with the changes of the
sun in the morning and during the day, and manifest themselves in the
variety of the seasons of the year.

It varies at dawn and midday, not exceeding the limits at any extreme.
If the sun's heat exceeds what it already is, all the earth would be
incinerated, and if it decreases from its present temperature, the earth
and what ever is in it will freeze, and in both cases, life will
terminate in its totality. If the light of the sun was extinguished you
would no longer be able to see the moon for it borrows its light from
the sun.

It spreads its light at nighttime over the earth, residing temporarily
in its different stages: as the full moon, as a crescent and
occasionally disappearing altogether. Through observing the regularity
of these changes mankind can keep track of their days, months and years,
organize their work and make plans with a schedule. That is, it is an
accurate natural calendar that can benefit both the sage and the
illiterate for keeping track of the rhythm of their work in their daily-
lives. This privilege of the moon is besides the light that it gives us.
The verse says:

"He it is Who made the sun a radiation and the moon a light, and
determined it by stations, that you might know the number of years and
the reckoning(of time). ..."

Then the Qur'an implies that this process of creation and the
revolution and rotation of the sun and the moon are not to be dismissed
as trivial matters. The verse continues saying:

"... Allah did not create that save in truth. ..."

The cloud and the wind, the moon and the sun move in the sky that you
may earn your bread, and you should not eat it without being aware of
your Provider.

At the end of the verse, the Qur'an emphasizes that Allah explains His
verses for those who comprehend them although those who are ill- sighted
and unaware overlook all these verses, not understanding the slightest
thing from them. It says:

"... (Thus)does He explain the Signs in detail, for a people who know.
"


**Commentary : Verse 6**

(6) إِنَّ في‏ اخْتِلافِ اللَّيْلِ وَ النَّهارِ وَ ما خَلَقَ اللَّهُ فِي
السَّماواتِ وَ الْأَرْضِ لَآياتٍ لِقَوْمٍ يَتَّقُونَ

6. " Verily, in the alternation of night and day, and all that Allah
has created in the heavens and the earth, surely there are signs for a
people who keep from evil. "

**Commentary :**

Allah has designed the universe in keeping with His Own magnificence
and wisdom, the cycle of night and day, the overarching heavens, the
fixed and moving stars, the animals, plants, inanimate objects, and all
the rest of provisions and bounties provided in the earth are proofs and
evidences upon His Oneness and Glory for those people who avoid
committing sins and disobeying Allah for the fear of His punishment.

The fact that He only mentions the pious as those who reflect upon His
Signs is an indication that it is only such people who take lessons by
observing the worldly phenomena. The rest of mankind are blinded by
their own negligence and ignorance; no phenomenon can affect on their
hearts; thus, they cannot grasp the objectives of creation.

Incidentally, the word 'alternation'/ 'ixtilaf/, mentioned in the holy
verse, signifies coming and going as well as variation. Thus the night
and the day are different in some respects:

A. They alternatively substitute for each other. Allah says:

"... The sign of the night have We made to pass away and have We the
sign of the day manifest, ..."(1)

(1) Sura Al- 'Isra', No. 17, verse 12

B. Night is pre- ordained for tranquility and the day for the hustle
and bustle of struggle. Allah says:

C. The decrease and increase in the number of daylight hours in the
different seasons of the year.

"And We made the night as a covering, " "And We made the day
for(seeking)livelihood. "

D. The change in the hours of the day and the night in various regions
of the world. The verse says:

" Verily, in the alternation of night and day, and all that Allah has
created in the heavens and the earth, surely there are signs for a
people who keep from evil. "

Question: Why is it that some scientists are atheists ?

Answer: In itself, science is not sufficient. The approach to truth
must stem from intentional and purposeful people and the motive must
originate from those who honestly seek the truth and reality. Thus sins
and pollutions from sin leave a negative impact upon one's analysis and
cognition.


**Commentary : Verse 7.8**

(7) إِنَّ الَّذينَ لا يَرْجُونَ لِقاءَنا وَ رَضُوا بِالْحَياةِ
الدُّنْيا وَ اطْمَأَنُّوا بِها وَ الَّذينَ هُمْ عَنْ آياتِنا غافِلُونَ

(8) أُولئِكَ مَأْواهُمُ النَّارُ بِما كانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ

7. " Verily those who do not expect the meeting with Us, but are
pleased with the life of this world and are satisfied with it, and those
who are neglectful of Our Signs, "

8. " These! Their abode is the Fire for what they used to earn. "

**Commentary :**

From this verse on, there is also a description concerning the
Resurrection and the destiny of people in the Hereafter.

At first, the verse says:

"Verily those who do not expect on the meeting with Us, but are pleased
with the life of this world and are satisfied with it, ..."

Then it refers to those who are neglectful of the revelations of Allah
and do not meditate upon them so as to be thoroughly awakened and feel
responsibility. The verse continues saying:

"... and those who are neglectful of Our Signs, "

Both of these two groups will have their abode in the Fire for the evil
actions they have committed. The verse says:

" Their abode is the Fire for what they used to earn. "

The Messenger of Allah(p.b.u.h.) said: "He who loves meeting Allah,
Allah also loves meeting him. "(1)

(1) Tafsir- ul- Furqan

In fact, the direct result of the lack of belief in the Resurrection is
this very love unto this limited life, of worldly position and a
confidence and reliance upon it.

Also, negligence from the revelations of Allah, is the origin of
separation from Allah which in turn is the origin of the lack of
sympathy and, consequently, falling into pollution, mischief, and sin
whose ultimate result cannot be aught but Fire.


**Commentary : Verse 9**

(9) إِنَّ الَّذينَ آمَنُوا وَ عَمِلُوا الصَّالِحاتِ يَهْديهِمْ
رَبُّهُمْ بِإيمانِهِمْ تَجْري مِنْ تَحْتِهِمُ الْأَنْهارُ في‏ جَنَّاتِ
النَّعيمِ

9. " Verily those who believe and do righteous deeds, their Lord will
guide them by their Faith: beneath them rivers flow in gardens of bliss.
"

**Commentary :**

Then the Qur'an refers to the state of another group who behave
opposite of the two groups mentioned before. The holy verse says:

" Verily those who believe and do righteous deeds, their Lord will
guide them by their Faith: "

This beam of light of Divine guidance which has its origins in their
faith enlightens every aspect within the entire horizons of their lives.
They are so enlightened by that light that they will never submit
themselves to the falsity of the materialist schools, satanic fancies or
the false glamour associated with sin, wealth and power, and they never
pave the path of astray.

As for the Hereafter, the Creator(s. w. t.)establishes them in palaces
and Gardens underneath which Rivers flow. The verse continues saying:

"... beneath them rivers flow in gardens of bliss. "


**Commentary : Verse 10**

(10) دَعْواهُمْ فيها سُبْحانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَ تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فيها سَلامٌ
وَ آخِرُ دَعْواهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعالَمينَ

10. "Their cry therein(will be): 'Glory be to You, O Allah! ' and
'Peace' will be their greeting therein. And the close of their cry(will
be):

'(All)praise is(only)Allah's, the Lord of the Worlds'. "

**Commentary :**

The faithful will lead their lives in an environment full of peace,
kindness, love unto the Lord, and blessings of various kinds. Whenever
they contemplate these things and reflect upon His Essence and
qualities, in their speech and prayers in Paradise they will invoke
their Lord, and as the verse says:

"Their cry therein(will be): 'Glory be to You, O Allah! ' "

And whenever they encounter each other, their talk will be of peace and
friendliness. Their greetings are exclusively/ salam/. The verse
continues saying:

"... and 'Peace' will be their greeting therein. ..."

And finally, whenever they enjoy the various blessings of Allah in
Paradise, they will start thanking Him, and end their words with
gratitude. The verse says:

"... And the close of their cry(will be): '(All)praise is(only)Allah's,
the Lord of the Worlds'. "

**Explanations:**

"Peace" is the word uttered by the people in Paradise and the
atmosphere of Paradise is filled with/ salam/(peace). It comes from
different sources, such as from Allah: " Peace: a ‏word from a Merciful
Lord"(1)and which comes from the angels saying: "Peace be upon you, you
shall be happy; "(2) It also is uttered by all those who reside in
Paradise. "Only the saying: 'Peace, Peace'. "(3)

The holy phrase "(All)praise is(only)Allah's" is the saying of the
prophets and saints. Had rat Noah(a.s.), after being released from the
unjust people uttered these words, and 'Ibrahim(a.s.)also, saying them,
thanked Allah in his old age for He had bestowed him Ishmael and
Ishaq.

Some Islamic tradition indicate that the People of Paradise, by
uttering/ subhaanaka 'allahumma/ will call up the hosts of Paradise, who
in turn show up immediately and fulfill their wishes.(Manhaj- us-
