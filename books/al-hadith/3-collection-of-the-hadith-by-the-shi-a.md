Collection of the Hadith By the Shi'a
=====================================

It was during the Khilaafah of Abu Bakr and early Khilaafah of Omar
that Imam Ali (a.s.) set to the task of registering the Hadiths. Imam
Ali was incomparably strict about Islam, and could foresee the need to
register the Hadith to be the source for future generations. Ali was
fanatic about the accuracy of his writing, and in an agonizingly
methodical manner he accomplished the following:

1. During Abu Bakr's Khilaafah: Ali rendered in writing the
following:

1. Holy Quran: Chronological order of the Quran's revelations.
2. Tafseer of the Holy Quran, 3 volumes: called Mus'haf Fatima.

2. During Omar's Khilaafah: Ali rendered the following:

1. Hadith of the Prophet (pbuh): Voluminous writing, called Saheefa of
Ali.
2. Fiqh: Al-Ah'kaam and Mu'aamalat, the Halal and Haram.
3. During Uthman's Khilaafah: Ali rendered the following:

1. History of the various Prophets as he learned from Prophet Muhammad
(pbuh), called: The White Al-Jafr.
2. Islamic rules and directives of Wars, called The Red Al-Jafr.

The books Ali rendered were called Al-Jaami'a (the Encyclopedia) and
they were left with the Imams of Ahlul Bayt, each new Imam receiving
them from the dying predecessor Imam. The Imams referred to these
Hadiths and books over a period of about three centuries. Notable among
them is Imam Ja'far Al-Saadiq, who was the teacher of Imam Abu Hanifah
and Al-Maliki, and as many as 4000 scholars who graduated from his
school. As many as 400 religious books were written by his students,
referred to as the 400 Usool.

Because of the source and chain of narration of the Hadith, the Shi'a
(Ja'fari) rely only on the Hadiths as narrated by Ahlul Bayt or those
Hadiths in the Al-Sihaah Al-Sittah (Bukhari, Muslim and others) that are
similar to what Ahlul Bayt had quoted.
