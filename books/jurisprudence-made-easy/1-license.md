In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate the Merciful  
 Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds,  
 and peace be with the best of His creation,  
 Mohammad and his pure progeny.  
 This book, Al-Fatawa Al-Muyessarah (Jurisprudence Made Easy), has been
written in accordance with our fatawa (edicts). This has been found to
be so by a group of trusted people. Thus, whoever, among the faithful,
acts upon the edicts contained therein shall be acquitted of their
religious obligation. Inshallah (Allah willing)

 Religious edicts shown between these [ ] brackets are to be followed as
a matter of ihtiyat wujubi (obligatory precaution). Thus, you have the
choice of either acting upon them or following another Mujtahid (Jurist:
a cleric who has studied sufficiently and achieved the level of
competence necessary to interpret shari’a law), taking into account the
most erudite among them.
