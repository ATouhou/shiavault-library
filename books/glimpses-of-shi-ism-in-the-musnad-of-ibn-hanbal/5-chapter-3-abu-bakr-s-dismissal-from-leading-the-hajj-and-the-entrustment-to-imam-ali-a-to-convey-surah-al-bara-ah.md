Chapter 3 : Abu- Bakr’s Dismissal From Leading the Hajj and the Entrustment To Imam ‘ali- (‘a) To Convey Surah Al-bara-’ah
==========================================================================================================================

Ibn Hanbal says of the event which occurred in the month of Dhi-
al-Hijjah, 9 AH:

Waki-‘ has related to us from Isra-’i-l from Abi- Isha-q from Zayd bin
Yuthay‘ from Abu- Bakr:

The Prophet sent him (Abu- Bakr) with Surah al-Bara-’ah to the people
of Mecca (to proclaim) that after this year no polytheist will be
allowed at the Hajj, neither should the nude circumambulate the Ka‘bah,
none will enter paradise except the person who has become Muslim,
whoever has a pact between him and the Messenger of Allah it is valid
until the specified period, and Allah and His Messenger are free from
any obligation to the polytheists. After a while, he told (Imam) ‘Ali-
[(‘a)], may Allah be pleased with him:

Overtake Abu- Bakr and send him back to me and you proclaim (the Surah
to the Meccans).

(Imam) ‘Ali- [(‘a)] acted as per the instructions and when Abu- Bakr
returned to the Prophet he cried and said:

O Messenger of Allah, did anything happen?

He replied:

Nothing has happened concerning you except good, but I have been
commanded (by Allah) that these (commandments) should either be conveyed
by my or by a man who is from me.[^30]

Ahmad Sha-kir, the annotator of the Musnad has considered the isna-d of
this hadi-th as sahi-h (authoritative) and has said that Zayd bin
Yuthay‘ was a trustworthy person of the first generation of Muslims
after the Prophet and the name of his father has also been mentioned as
Uthay‘.

Habashi- bin Juna-dah al-Suluki- who took part in the Farewell
Pilgrimage of the Prophet, has recorded four hadi-th with a similiar
text in his own Musnad which confirms Ibn Hanbal’s narration of the
above hadi-th. Habashi- quotes Abu- Bakr that the Messenger of Allah (S)
said:

‘Ali- is from me and I am from him. My words will not be conveyed
except by me or by ‘Ali-.[^31]
