**In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful**

The Islamic Revolution of Iran continues its triumphant march, despite
the enemies' plots, and this year (1985) the Islamic Republic of Iran
celebrates the sixth anniversary of the victory of the Revolution on
Feb. 10, 1979. On this day, after a centuries-long night, the sun of
Islam rose again in all its resplendent glory, and this historic event
is celebrated in the Islamic Republic during the course of the “Ten-Day
Dawn Celebrations” (Daheh-ye Fajr).

On this auspicious occasion, we thank God, the Almighty, for
strengthening the Revolution and for assisting us in our efforts to
bring its message of salvation to the Muslims and the rest of the
world's oppressed people. Indeed the secret behind its victory was trust
in God, obedience to the laws of Islam, and the leadership of Imam
Khomeini - may God continue to light our path by the light of his
guidance.

The present book is one of a series of publications brought forth on the
occasion of the sixth anniversary of the victory of the Islamic
Revolution. We pray to God to keep us steadfast on the straight path of
Islam, to confer upon us more sincerity and strength in our efforts to
implement the laws of God. In Him do we trust and it is He who grants
success.
