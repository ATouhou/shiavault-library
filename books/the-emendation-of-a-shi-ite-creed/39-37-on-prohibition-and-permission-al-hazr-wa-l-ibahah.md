37. On Prohibition and Permission (Al-Hazr wa 'l-Ibahah)
========================================================

Abu Ja‘far says, concerning prohibition and permission, that "Everything
is permitted . . ."ash-Shaykh al-Mufid says: Things according to the
dictates of reason fall into two categories; the first, those which are
conceived as prohibited by reason, these are the things which reason
abhors and admonishes against, such as injustice, foolishness and
vanity. The second are those which are not defined by reason as either
forbidden or lawful but only by textual proof (sam‘).

This group includes deeds, the performance of which may corrupt on one
occasion and be beneficial on another, and they are restricted to the
rulings of canon law, which have suffered abrogation and amendment.
Since, however the religious law is settled once and for all, the
general decision is that: Everything that is not prohibited by nass
(i.e., the specific ordinances of religion) is permitted, because the
religious canon has laid down the limits of the law, and distinguished
finally what is prohibited, so it follows logically that what lies
outside their scope is permitted.
