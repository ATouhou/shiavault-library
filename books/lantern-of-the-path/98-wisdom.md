Wisdom
======

Wisdom is the light of gnosis, the measure of fearful awareness and the
fruit of truthfulness. Allah has not given any of his servants a
greater, more favourable, generous, lofty or more splendid blessing than
wisdom for the heart. In Allah's words,


<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يُؤتِي الْحِكْمَةَ مَن يَشَاء وَمَن يُؤْتَ الْحِكْمَةَ فَقَدْ أُوتِيَ
خَيْرًا كَثِيراً
  </p>
</blockquote>

***He grants wisdom to whom He pleases and whoever is granted wisdom, he
indeed is given a great good and none but the men of understanding
remember.*** (2:269)


That is, only the one whom I have singled out for My sake and whom I
have designated for it knows what wisdom I have reserved and prepared.
Wisdom is rescue, steadiness at the beginning of the affair and a firm
stance at the end. It makes Allah's creatures aspire to Him. And the
Messenger of Allah said to 'Ali, 'That Allah should guide one of His
slaves at your hands is better for you than everything the sun shines
upon, from east to west.'
