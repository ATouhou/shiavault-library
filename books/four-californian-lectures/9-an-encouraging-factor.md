An Encouraging Factor
=====================

From a Muslim's point of view it is fortunate that some religious
communities and denominations, like the Roman Catholics and the Orthodox
Jews, are striving to hold fast to their religious teachings.  
    
 The Muslims should join hands with all those communities who are trying
to stem the flood of licentiousness and irreligiousness. Twists of the
Middle East politics should not prevent them from standing shoulder to
shoulder for the sake of common causes of ethics and morality.
