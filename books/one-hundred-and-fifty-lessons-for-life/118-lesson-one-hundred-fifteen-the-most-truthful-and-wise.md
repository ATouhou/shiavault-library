Lesson One Hundred Fifteen: The Most Truthful And Wise
======================================================

The Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لِكُلِّ اُمَّة صَديقٌ وَ فارُوقٌ وَ صَدِيقُ هذِهِ الاْمَّةِ وَ
فارُوقُها عَلِىُّ ابْنُ أَبِى طالِب(ع).
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Every nation has a man who is truthful and esteemed, and the one who is
truthful and a distinguished from my nation is ‘Ali Ibn Abi Taleb. [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

For completion of the program of a genuine religion, an everlasting
religion like Islam, there should be someone familiar with all aspects
and details of that religion and be able to distinguish between truth
and falsehood (deserving the name of distinguished).

Islam needed such a man after the demise of the Prophet (peace be upon
him and his progeny), the most part of whose mission was spent in
different conflicts with obstinate enemies. That person had to be
someone very truthful, honest, eloquent and frank so that he could
remove any ambiguities and doubts that crop up among people in the
absence of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny).

This rank, as per the above explicit statement, was allocated to Imam
‘Ali (a.s.).
