Author's Introduction
=====================

Here are a number of traditions to be found in the 'Shi'a Guide to the
Shari'a'4 and other books regarding the importance of the Qur'an and its
etiquettes and disciplines which we have mentioned hoping to bring
benefit to many. We have preceded this with information about the
collation of the Qur'an and its textual non-corruption and that not one
word or letter has been added nor subtracted.

It is the same Qur'an today that was sent down to the Messenger of
Allah and was compiled by him in the same structure of verses and
chapters at the command of Allah during his life.
