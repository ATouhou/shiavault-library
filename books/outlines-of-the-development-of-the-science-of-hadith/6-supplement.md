Supplement
==========

40. Study of the names of the muhaddithun: On page 177, he says, "Abu
\`Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Bukhari has met the complete needs
of this study by his book."

41. Study of surnames (kuna pl. of kunyah) of the Sahabah, the Tabi'un,
and their descendents up to the present. On page 83, he says that the
scholars of hadith have compiled many works on this subject.

42. Knowledge of the homelands and regions of hadith narrators.

43. Study of the mawali [^7] among the narrators of hadith from among
the Sahabah, the Tabi'un and their descendents.

44. Study of the lives, dates of death and birth of the muhaddithun.

45. Study of the titles of the muhaddithun.

46. Study of contiguous narrators. On page 215, he says that this study
is different from that of al-akabir 'an al-asaghir; rather it relates to
narrators who relate from those contiguous to them.

47. Study of similarities between the tribes of narrators, their
homelands, names, nicknames, and accomplishments. In this regard he
mentions five secondary disciplines, such as the study of tribes, the
study of their homelands, etc.

48. Study of the battles of the Holy Prophet (S) and his epistles
written to kings and others.

49. Study of the well-known pioneers of hadith collection from among
the Sahabah, the Tabi'un and their descendents.

50. Study of the mode of classification of hadith into various chapters
by the muhaddithun.

51. Study of a group of narrators from the Tabi'un and their
descendents, regarding whose reliability in case of al-hadith al-sahih
the evidence is inconclusive.

52. Study of those who received an ijazah from a scholar for
transmitting ahadith. [^8]

In addition to the above, there are other disciplines linked with the
study of Arabic morphology, syntax, and philology, as mentioned by
al-Suyuti in his al-'Itqan.[^9] In this regard, it may be mentioned that
Ibn al-Nadim in his Kitab al-Fihrist, quoting Muhammad ibn Ishaq and
other scholars, says that Abu al-'Aswad al-Du'ali, the first Arab
grammarian, acquired it from \`Ali ibn Abi Talib (A).[^10] Following
this, he quotes a statement from Abu Nasr that \`Abd al-Rahman ibn
Hurmuz is the foundation layer of Arabic studies and that Abu Sa\`id
al-Sirafi had confirmed this. Furthermore, Ibn al-Nadim explaining the
origin of the name 'nahw' for Arabic syntax says that Abu al-'Aswad had
asked for \`Ali's (A) permission to formulate rules of Arabic grammar
similar (nahw) to what \`Ali (A) had done in his discourses.

Those who had learnt Arabic grammar from Abu al-'Aswad al-Du'ali,
according to Ibn al-Nadim, are: Yahya ibn Ya'mur, 'Anbasah ibn Ma'dan
and Maymun ibn Aqran.[^11]

Sayyid Hasan al-Sadr, in his Ta'sis al-Shi\`ah, writing about the
origins of \`Ilm dirayat al-hadith, says that the first to compile a
work on this subject was Abu \`Abd Allah Hakim al-Nishaburi, a Shi'ite
(d. 405/1014-15), and Ibn Salah, who came after him, was his follower.
However, al-Suyuti, in his Kitab al-wasa'il fi awa'il, states that Ibn
Salah, Abu 'Amr \`Uthman ibn \`Abd al-Rahman (d. 643/1051-52), a Shafi'i
from Damascus, was the first to work on \`ilm dirayat a-hadith.[^12]
Evidently, al-Suyuti has shown complete indifference to the work of Abu
\`Abd Allah Hakim al-Nishaburi, who lived about two hundred years before
Ibn Salah.

In Ta'sis al-Shi\`ah, it is stated that the first to compile a book on
the study of Islamic sects was al-Hasan ibn Musa al-Nawbakhti, a
prominent scholar of the third century, who lived before Abu Mansur
\`Abd al-Qadir ibn Zahir al-Baghdadi (d. 429/1037-38), Abu Bakr
al-Baqillani (d. 403/1012-13), Ibn Hazm (d. 456/1062-63), and
al-Shahristani (d. 548/1153-54).[^13] The author of al-Adab al-Farisi not
only confirms this, he also explicitly states that al-Hasan ibn Musa
al-Nawbakhti was a Shi'ite:

Several men of the house of Nawbakht excelled in the Islamic sciences
and became (great) scholars of the Imamiyyah Shi'ite sect and
forerunners of its mutakallimin. To them goes the great credit of
providing support for this sect on the basis of its kalam. Among them
was Abu Muhammad al-Hasan ibn Musa al-Nawbakhti (d. 300 or 301 A.H.),
the author of the book Firaq al-Shi\`ah and al-'Ara' wa al-diyanat; also
he was the first to write a book on the subject of al-milal wa al-nihal
(study of nations and sects):[^14]

The author of Tadrib al-rawi writing about the origins of \`ilm
'istilahat al-hadith, says that the first to compile a work on this
subject was Qadi Abu Muhammad al-Ramhurmuzi, the author of Kitab
muhaddith al-fadil, followed by Hakim Abu \`Abd Allah al-Nishaburi, Abu
Nu'aym al-'Isfahani, and al-Khatib al-Baghdadi.[^15]

In regard to the history of the military campaigns (al-maghazi) of the
Prophet (S), which is a part of \`ilm al-rijal, the author of Ta'sis
al-Shi\`ah says that the first to write on this subject was Muhammad ibn
Ishaq al-Matlabi. Elsewhere, he quotes a statement from Khulasat
al-'aqwal relating to \`Ubayd Allah ibn Abi Rafi', who was 'Ali's
scribe, as being the first to write on the Prophet's battles.[^16] This
is also confirmed by al-Najashi in his al-Rijal.[^17] Al-Suyuti, however,
in his Kitab al-wasa'il fi al-awa'il considers 'Urwah ibn al-Zubayr (d.
94/712-13) as being the pioneer in writing on al-maghazi.

With regard to historiography, according to Kash al-zunun, the first to
write on this subject was Muhammad ibn Ishaq (d. 151/768) the forerunner
among the writers of al-maghazi.

According to al-Suyuti, the first to compile a musnad was Sulayman ibn
Dawud Abu Dawud al-Tayalisi.[^18] As to \`ilm dirayat al-hadith, the
first to write on this subject was Sayyid Jamal al-Din Ahmad ibn Musa
ibn Tawus Abu al-Fada'il (d. 673/1274-75), the teacher of \`Allamah ibn
Mutahhar al-Hilli. He formulated new Shi'ite terms in hadith (such as
al-sahih, al-hasan, al-muwaththaq, and al-da'if).[^19]

**Kinds of Hadith**

In general, there are three basic kinds of hadith from the viewpoint of
the Ahl al-Sunnah (al-Sahih, al-hasan, and al-da'if), and four basic
kinds from the viewpoint of the Shi\`ah (al-sahih, al-hasan,
al-muwaththaq, and al-da'if). These are further classified both by the
Shi\`ah and the Ahl al-Sunnah. Following are some of these general
classifications:

1. Al-sahih: It is a hadith free of any kind of fault related by
several continuous chains of veracious transmitters with more than one
first recorder (ruwat 'adilun, dabitun ghayr shawadhdh).[^20]

2. Al-hasan: It is a hadith which is well-known, and with reputable
source (makhraj) and transmitters (ruwat).[^21] It has been defined in
these words in al-Jurjani's al-Ta'rifat:

Al-hasan is a hadith whose transmitters are reputed for their veracity
and trustworthiness; however, it does not reach the station of al-hadith
al-sahih.[^22]

3. Al-da'if: It is a hadith which does not have the qualities of either
al-sahih or al-hasan.[^23]

4. Al-musnad: It is a hadith whose chain of transmission goes right up
to the Holy Prophet (S).

5. Al-muttasil (mawsul): It is a hadith whose all links in transmission
are mentioned by the later transmitters.

narrator that contradicts other traditions narrated by others.

14. Al-gharib: It is of three kinds: gharib al-'alfaz (with uncommon

(uncommon with respect to the chain of transmission).

a. Gharib al-'alfaz is a tradition containing problematic words.
