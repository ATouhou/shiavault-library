***And when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people, who subjected you to
severe torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and in this
there was a great trial from your Lord (49).***  
***And when We parted the sea for you, so We saved you and drowned the
followers of Pharaoh while you watched by (50).***

***And when We appointed*** **(a time of)** ***forty nights with Mūsa,
then you took the calf*** **(for a god)** ***after him and you were
unjust (51) ;***

***then We pardoned you after that so that you might give thanks
(52).***

***And when We gave Mūsa the book and the distinction that you might
walk aright (53).***

***And when Mūsa said to his people: “O my peo­ple! you have surely been
unjust to yourselves by taking the calf*** **(for a god)*****, therefore
turn to your Creator*** **(penitently)** ***and kill your people, that
is best for you with your Creator; so He turned to you***
**(mercifully),*****for surely He is the Oft­returning*** **(with
mercy),** ***the Merciful” (54).***

***And when you said: “O Mūsa! we will not believe in you until we see
Allah manifestly, ” so the punishment overtook you while you looked on
(55);***

***then We raised you up after your death that you may give thanks
(56).***

***And We made the clouds to give shade over you and We sent to you
manna and quails: Eat of good things that We have given you; and they
did not do Us any harm, but they did harm their own selves (57).***

***And when We said: “Enter this city, then eat from it a plen­teous***
**(food)*****wherever you wish, and enter the gate making obeisance, and
say, forgiveness, We will forgive you your wrongs and give more to those
who do good*** **(to others)** ***(58).***

***But those who were unjust changed it for a saying other than that
which had been spoken to them, so We sent up­on those who were unjust a
pestilence from heaven, be­cause they transgressed (59).***

***And when Mūsa prayed for drink for his people, We said: “Strike the
rock with your staff.” So there gushed from it twelve springs; each
tribe knew its drinking place: “Eat and drink of the provisions of Allah
and do not act corruptly in the land, making mis­chief” (60).***

***And when you said: “O Mūsa! we cannot bear with one food, therefore
pray to your Lord on our behalf to bring forth for us out of what the
earth grows, of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its
lentils and its onions. He said: “Will you exchange that which is better
for that which is worse? Enter a city, so you will have what you ask
for. ” And abasement and humiliation were brought down upon them and
they returned with Allah's wrath; this was so because they disbelieved
in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly; this was so
because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits (61).***

Commentary
----------

**Qur’an:** ***and sparing your women:*** They left your women alive in
order that they (i.e. the women) might serve them. *“al-Istihya ”'*
(**الاستحيآء**) means to wish someone to remain alive. The word may also
mean: They behaved indecently with the women until they (i.e. the women)
lost their modesty.

*“Yasūmūnakum”* (**يسومونكم**) translated here as “they subjected you
to”, literally means, they imposed upon you.

**Qur’an:** ***And when We parted the sea for you: al-Farq***
(**الفرْق**) is opposite of *al-jam'* (**الجَمْع**); the words mean to
separate and to gather, respectively. The same is the case of *al-fasl*
(**الفَصْل**) vis-a-vis *“al-wasl”*(**الوَصْل**). To separate the sea
means to part its water. *“Bikum”* (**بِكُم**), translated here as “for
you”, may also mean, “Soon on your entering the sea”.

**Qur’an:** **And** ***when We appointed*** **(a time of)** ***forty
days with Mūsa***: The same event has been described in Chapter 7 in
these words:

***And We appointed with Mūsa a time of thirty nights and completed them
with ten*****(more), so** ***the appointed time of his Lord was
complete, forty nights*** **(7 :142).**

This verse mentions the total duration of the two promises together, as
a tradition says.

**Qur’an:** ***therefore turn to your Creator*** **(penitently**):
*al-Bari'* (**الباريء**) is one of the beautiful names of Allah, as
Allah says:

***He is Allah, the Creator, the Maker, the Fashioner; His are the most
beautiful names. . .*****(59:24).**

This name has been used three times in the Qur'an: twice in the verse
under discussion and once in Chapter 59, quoted just above. Perhaps
Allah used this name here because it was most suitable in the context of
the event described.

While it is nearer in meaning to *al-Khaliq* (**الخالق** = the Creator)
and *al-Mūjid* (**الموجِد** = the Inventor), it is derived from *bara'a,
yabra'u, bar'an* (**بَرَءَ يَبْرَءُ بَرَءً** = he separated, he
separates, to separate).

Allah thus separates His creation from in­existence, or He separates man
from the earth. This name in this context conveys the following idea: No
doubt it is very hard to repent by killing your own people. But Allah,
Who now orders you to destroy yourselves by killing, is the same God who
had created you. He was pleased to create you when it was good for you;
and now He has decreed that you should kill your own people, and this
order too is good for you.

How can He decide anything for you except that which is good, and He is
your Maker and Creator. The phrase, “your Creator”, points to a special
relation which they have with Him, and it emphasizes the fact that the
given command is not for revenge; it is based on divine love, in order
to purify them.

**Qur’an:** ***that is best for you with your Creator:*** This and the
preceding verses (that enumerate their transgressions and sins) are
addressed to the whole Jewish nation, although the sins were committed
by only some groups of them and not by all. Obviously it is because they
were very much united as a nation; if one did a thing, others were
pleased with it.

It was because of this feeling of their national unity that one group's
action is attributed to the whole nation. Otherwise, not all the
Israelites had killed the prophets, nor had all of them indulged in the
calf-worship, or committed other sins mentioned herein.

It proves that the order, “kill your people”, actually meant, kill some
of your people, i.e., the calf-worshippers. It may also be inferred from
the words, “you have surely been unjust to yourselves by taking the calf
for worship”, and the words, “that is best for you with your Creator”
(which apparently is the final part of the speech of Mūsa).

The words, “so He turned to you (mercifully)”, prove that their
repentance was accepted. Tradition says that their repent­ance was
accepted and sin forgiven when only a few of them had been killed.

This forgiveness before the order was fully complied with shows that the
command was given as a trial. The case is somewhat similar to the dream
of Ibrahīm (a.s.) and his being told to sacrifice Isma'ī1; before he
could reach the ultimate stage, he was told,

**O** ***Ibrahīm! You have indeed made the vision come true***
**(37:104 -105).**

Likewise, Mūsa (a.s.) told his people “turn to your Creator (penitently)
and kill your people, that is best for you with your Creator”, and Allah
confirmed the order, yet He took the killing of some as equal to the
execution of all, and informed them that their repentance was accepted,
“so He turned to you (mercifully)”.

**Qur’an:** ***a pestilence from heaven:*** *“ar-Rijz”* (**الرجز** =
punishment).

**Qur’an:** ***do not act corruptly:*** *“La ta'thaw”* (**لا تعثَوا**)
is derived from*al-\`ayth* and *al-\`athy* (**العيْث، العَثى**) it means
the biggest chaos and mischief.

**Qur’an:** ***and its cucumbers and its garlic:*** *“al-Khiyar”*
(**الخِيار**) is cucumber; *“al-fum”* **الفوم**) *is* garlic or wheat.

**Qur’an:** ***and they returned with Allah's wrath:*** *“Ba'ū”*
(**باءوا** = they returned).

**Qur’an:** ***this was so because they disbelieved**:* It gives the
rea­son of preceding statement; and the next sentence, “this was so
because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits” is the reason of that
reason. Their disobedience and perennial excesses caused them to reject
the signs of Allah and kill the prophets. Allah says in another verse:

***Then evil was the end of those who did evil, because they rejected
the signs of Allah and used to mock them*** **(30:10).**

How was the disbelief caused by disobedience? One of the coming
Tradition explains it.

Tradition
---------

Abū Ja'far (a.s.) said about the words of Allah: *and when We appointed*
(a time of) *forty nights with Mūsa:* “It was thirty nights in the
(divine) knowledge and measure, then some­thing else happened (to show
that it was not the final decree) and Allah added ten more; and in this
way the appointed time of his Lord, the first and the last, was
completed forty days.”[^1]

The author says: This tradition supports what we have mentioned earlier
that the forty was the total of the two ap­pointed times.

\`Alī (a.s.) said about the words of Allah: ***and when Mūsa said to his
people: “0 my people! you have surely been unjust to yourselves. . .
”**: “They* asked Mūsa: \`How should we repent?' He said: \`Some of you
should kill the others.'

Thereupon, they took the knives and everyone started killing (the
others), even his brother, father and son, without caring, by God! whom
he killed. (It continued) till seventy thousand of them were killed.
Then Allah revealed to Mūsa: ***\`Tell them to stay their hands;' and he
who was killed was forgiven and he who remained, his repentance was
accepted. ”***[^2]

The Imam said: “Mūsa (a.s.) went to the appointed place and time, and
then came back to his people; and they had started worshipping the calf;
then he told them: **'*****O*** ***my people! you have surely been
unjust to yourselves by taking the calf*** **(for worship),**
***therefore turn to your Creator*** **(penitently)** ***and kill your
people, that is best for you with your Creator.'***

They asked him: \`How should we kill our people?' Mūsa said to them:
\`Tomorrow every­one of you should come to Baytu '1-Maqdis[^3] with a
knife or a piece of iron or a sword; when I ascend the pulpit of the
Children of Israel you should all keep your faces hidden, so that nobody
should recognize the other at his side; then you should kill each
other.' Thus seventy thousand of those who had worshipped the calf
assembled in Baytu '1-Maqdis.

When Musa finished praying with them and ascended the pulpit, they
started killing each other. (This continued) until Jibrīl came down and
said: \`Now tell them, O Mūsa! to stop killing (each other), because
Allah has ac­cepted their repentance.'

And (by that time) ten thousand of them had been killed. And Allah
revealed: ***that is best for you with your Creator; so He turned to
you*** (mercifully), ***for surely His is Oft­returning*** (with mercy),
***the Merciful. ”***[^4]

The author says: According to this tradition, the sentence, “that is
best for you with your Creator”, was said by Mūsa (a.s.) and was also
used in the divine speech. In this way, Allah con­firmed the word of
Mūsa (a.s.), and made it clear that what had actually happened - the
execution of ten thousand calf-worship­pers - was all that was intended
from the very beginning; and that the order of Musa was carried out in
full, and not partially.

According to what appears from the wording of Mūsa (a.s.) , it was best
for them if all of them were killed; but only some of them got killed,
not all. By repeating the same words, Allah made it clear that what Mūsa
(a.s.) had meant from the words, “the best for you”, was not the
execution of all.

The same *at-Tafsīr* says about the words of Allah: ***and We made the
clouds to give shade over you**:* “When Mūsa crossed the sea with the
Israelites, they landed at a desert. They said: 'O Mūsa! you have really
destroyed and killed us, by bringing us from an inhabited land to a
desert where there is, either any shadow or tree nor even water.'

At daytime a cloud appeared over them to protect them from the sun; and
at right, manna came down to them, settling on leaves, trees and stones,
and they ate it; and at dinner time roasted birds fell on their
dinner­-spread, and when they finished eating and drinking, the birds
(became alive and) flew away.

And Mūsa had a stone which he used to place in the midst of the station
(of the caravan), striking it with his walking-stick and, lo! Twelve
springs gushed from it, as Allah described, every spring going to the
station of a particular tribe - and they were twelve tribes.”[^5]

Abu l-Hasan al-Madī (a.s.) said about the words of Allah: ***and they
did not do Us any harm but they did harm their own selves:*** “Surely
Allah is too powerful and too unassailable to be harmed or to ascribe
any harm to Himself.

But He has joined us to Himself and took any injustice done to us as an
injustice done to Him, and treated our love as His love; then He
revealed it in a (verse of the) Qur'an to His Prophet, and said: ***and
they did not do Us any harm, but they did harm their own selves**.* The
narrator says: “I said, \`This is the revelation?' He said, \`Yes.”[^6]

The author says: Nearly the same thing has been narrated from al-Baqir
(a.s.).

”. . . too unassailable to be harmed ”: It is the explanation of the
Qur'anic expression, “they did not do Us any harm”; the next sentence,
“or to ascribe any harm to Himself”, rejects also the opposite
proposition. Allah can neither be harmed nor does He do any injustice
Himself. Why did the narrator ask the ques­tion, “This is the
revelation?”

Obviously, for a negative sentence to be plausible there should be a
real or hypothetic possibility of a positive connection between the
subject and its predicate. We do not say, “This wall does not see”. Why?
Because wall has no possible connection with seeing. Now, Allah can have
no possible connection at all with injustice or oppression.

Therefore, the sentence, “they did not do Us any harm”, would seem a
super­fluous and implausible assertion, because there was no need for
saying that Allah could not be harmed nor did He harm anyone - unless it
was meant to convey some fine point to the listeners.

And that point is this: Great persons often speak on behalf of their
servants and dependants; likewise, Allah in this verse is speak­ing on
behalf of Muhammad and his progeny (peace be on them all), joining them
to Himself in this declaration.

as-Sadiq (a.s.) recited the verse: ***this was so because they
disbelieved in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly; this
was so because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits,*** and then said:

“By God, they did not hit them with their hands, nor did they kill them
with their swords; but they heard their talks and announced it (to their
enemies); so the prophets were caught on that charge and killed; this
was the killing, the exceeding the limit and the disobedience.”[^7]

The author says: A similar tradition from the same Imam is found in
*al-Kafi.* Apparently, the Imam inferred it from the words, “this was so
because they disobeyed . . .” Needless to say that murder, and
especially of the prophets, and rejection of the signs of Allah cannot
be termed as mere disobedience.

It should be the other way round. But if we take the disobedience to
mean disclosing the secrets then it would be perfectly right to say that
they killed the prophets, because they (disobeyed them and) did not keep
their secrets and thus delivered them into the hands of their enemies
who killed them.

[^2]: ad-Durru 'l-manthūr

[^3]: Mūsa was called to the Mount Sini'i and given Torah while the
Israel­ites were still in the wilderness. And it was at that time that
the events in question took place. They had not entered Palestine at
that time and Baytu '1-Maqdis was not built yet. Therefore, the word
“Baytu '1-Maqdis” used in this tradition must mean the tent which Mūsa
erected for divine worship.
