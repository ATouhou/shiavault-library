Sundays' Supplication
=====================

In the name of God,
from whom I hope for nothing but His bounty, and from whom I fear
nothing but His justice!
I rely only upon His words, and I cling only to His rope!
O' the pocessor of pardon and prosperity, In You I seek sanctuary,
from oppression and enmity,
from the changes of the time and recurrence of sorrows,
from the striking events, and
from the expiration of my term (life) before forgiveness and
preparation.

From You I seek guidance wherein is righteousness and sets me right.
From You I seek help which is linked to success and favorable
response.
To You I tend,
for the garment of well-being and its completion, and for the covering
of health and its continuity.
To You I seek refuge, O' my Lord, from the stimulations of Satans,
and I seek protection in Your government, from the injustice of
governors.
So accept my past prayers and fasting, and make my tomorrow and its
after,
better than my present hour and today!
Exalt me in my clan and my people.
Protect me in my waking and my sleeping.
For You are God, the best guardian, and the most merciful.

O' God, I quit before You, on this day and the following Sundays
(AHAAD),
of associating anything with You (SHIRK) and of heresy (ILHAAD),
and I sincerely devote my supplication to You seeking for response.
So bless Mohammad and his Household, the best of Your creatures and the
summoners to Your truth, and
exalt me with Your exaltation which never suffers from loss,
protect me with Your sight which never falls asleep, and
seal my affairs by cutting me off from everything but You, and my life
with forgiveness! Surely You are the merciful and the compassionate.

Prophet (PBUH&HF).

**Mondays' Supplication**

Praise belongs to God,
who allowed none to witness when He created the heavens and the earth,
and who took no assistant when He shaped the spirits (of people)!
He has no associate in divinity and no support in unity.

Tongues fall silent in describing the deepness of His attributes,
intellects fail in knowing Him thoroughly,
tyrants fall low before His majesty,
faces are humbled in fear of Him, and
everything mighty is overwhelmed of His might!
Thus praise be to You, again and again, and continuously!
And His blessings be upon His Messenger endlessly and everlastingly!

O' God, make the beginning of this day of mine righteousness, its
middle prosperity, and its end success!
And I seek refuge in You from a day whose beginning is fright, whose
middle is anxiety, and whose end is pain!

O' God, I ask forgiveness for every promise I have promised, then
failed to keep. I ask You concerning Your servants:

If there is any servant from among Your servants or any handmaid from
among Your handmaids, who has against me a complaint because I have
wronged him in respect to himself, his reputation, his property, his
family, evil words I have spoken about him in his absence, an imposition
upon him through inclination, caprice, scorn, zeal, false show,
bigotry,

whether he be absent or present, alive or dead, such that my hand has
fallen short in order to find him and ask him for forgiveness, or my
capacity has been too narrow to compensate for him,

I ask You, O' He who owns all objects of need which are granted by His
will and hasten to His desire that bless Mohammad and his Household, and
have mercy on me by satisfying (the one I might have wronged) from me in
the manner that You will. Because forgiveness decreases You nothing, and
grant hurts You nothing, O' Most Merciful of the merciful!

O' God, give me on every Monday (ITHNAIN) two favors from You:
the opportunity to obey You from its beginning, and
the favor of Your forgiveness by its end.
O' He who is the God, and none but him can forgive the sins!

**Tuesdays' Supplication**

In the name of God, the all merciful, the compassionate.

Praise belongs to God,
and praise is His right, for He deserves abundant praise!
I seek refuge in Him from the evil of my soul (nafs), "for surely the
soul commands to evil unless my Lord do bestow His Mercy (to protect my
soul)" (12:53).
I seek refuge in Him from the evil of Satan who adds sins to my sin.
I seek protection with him from every wicked tyrant, unjust king, and
conquering enemy.

O God,
place me among Your troops, for Your troops are the only real
victorious (37:173),
place me in Your party, for People of Your party are the only
prosperous (58:22),and
place me among Your friends, for Your friends no fear shall be upon
them, nor shall they sorrow (10:62).

O God

set right for me my religion, for it is the protection (Ismah) of my
affair,
set right for me my Hereafter, for it is my permanent residence and to
it I could flee from the neighborhood of the vile!
Make life an increase for me in every good and death an ease for me
from every evil!

O God,

bless Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets and the terminator of the
number of the messengers, and bless his chaste and pure Household, and
his select Companions, and grant me on the Tuesday three things:

Afflict me

no sin unless You have already forgiven,
no sorrow unless You have already taken it away,
and no enemy unless You have already repelled him!

By means of "in the name of Allah", the best of the Names, in the name
of Lord of earth and heaven,

I seek to repulse every hateful thing (makrooh), which has His anger at
its beginning, and
I seek to attract every lovable thing (mahboob), which has His
satisfaction at its beginning!
So seal me with forgiveness from You, O Patron of beneficence!
