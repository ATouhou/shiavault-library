=====================

Inspite of the fact that well-over 400 years have passed from the advent
of Islam as perfect religion that addressed the human being and society
yet this has not been well understood by the people of the world.

Jamiat-ul-Ather publications plan to do its best to explain Islam to the
mankind. The publication of this book is a step in this direction.

**“Are you free or slave?”** covers the foremost factor “belief” and the
ground of its formation in men, is the outcome of lectures that the
esteemed author has delivered in the session of a group of university
and theology school students.

Jamiat-ul-Athar hopes to meet this big challenge, we present this book
and plan to translate and publish the books on other aspects of Islam
afterwards.
