The Best ‘Jihad’
================

“The best ‘Jihad’ (religious war) is to say the truth in the presence of
a tyrant ruler”. (The Holy Prophet)

The condition of a society can easily be judged by the attitude of its
members towards each other. If the members care enough for each other to
exhort each other to act righteously, the society is healthy. When the
attitude changes to that of “Why should I bother?” the society begins
its funeral march. As the society shuts its eyes from the individual’s
behavior, the bad elements gradually become bold. Then comes a time when
they start glorifying their evil action.

For this purpose, high-sounding phrases are coined. Nakedness is called
‘natural condition’. Lie becomes ‘political talk’, brothels are labeled
‘night dubs’, gambling dens are named, ‘recreation centers, fornication
becomes ‘indiscretion’, and hijacking and kidnapping political
necessities.

Was is waged to ‘stop the wars’, bombs are dropped on civilians to ‘save
their lives’. Countries are attacked to ‘save their freedom’, hateful
methods are used to ‘create a harmonious society”

It was to avoid this type of situation that “enjoining what is good and
forbidding what is wrong” has been emphasized in Islam. It is the corner
stone of Shariah which strengthens the whole structure of religion.
