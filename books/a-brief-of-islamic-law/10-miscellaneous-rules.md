Miscellaneous Rules
===================

664. A traveller can offer full prayers in the entire cities of Makkah,
Madinah and Kufah. He can also offer full prayers in the Halal (allowed)
of Imam Husayn (A.S.), upto the distance of nearly 11.5 metters from the
sacred tomb.

665. If a person who knows that he is a traveller, and should offer
QA?r prayers, intentionally offers full prayers at places other than the
four mentioned above, his prayers are void. And the same rule applies,
if he forgets that a traveller must offer QA?r prayers, and prays full.
However, if he prays full forgetting that a traveller should offer
shortened prayers, and remembers after the time has lapsed, it is not
necessary for him to give the Qada.

666. If a person who knows that he is a traveller, and should offer
shortened prayers, offers full prayers by mistake, and realises within
the time for that prayer, he should pray again. And if he realises after
the lapse of time, he should give Qada as a precaution.

667. If atraveller who does not know that he should shorten his
paryers, offers full prayers, his paryes are in order.

668. If a traveller knew that he should offer shortened prayers, but
did not know its details, like, if he did not know that shortened
prayers should be offered when the distance of the jouney is of 8
Farsakh, and if he offers full prayers, he should, as an obligatory
precaution repeat the pryers if he comes to know the rule within the
time of prayer, and if he does not do that, he will give its Qada. But
if he learns of the rule after the time has lapsed, there is no Qada.

669. If a person who should offer complete prayers, offers Qasr
instead, his prayers are void in all circumstance ; and as an obligatory
precaution, this will apply also when one ignorantly prays QA?r, at a
place where he decided to stay for 10 days.

670. If before the time of prayer lapses, a traveller who has not
offered prayer reaches his hometown, or a place where he intends to stay
for ten days, he should offer full prayer. And if a person who is not on
a journey, does not offer prayer within the early time, and then
proceeds on a journey, he should offer the prayer during his journey in
shortened form.

671. If the Tuhr, A?r, or Isha prayers of a traveller, who should have
offered QA?r prayers, becomes Qada, he should perform its Qada as QA?r,
even if he gives Qada at his hometown or while he is not travelling. And
if a non-traveller makes one of hte above three prayers Qada, he should
perform its Qada as full, even if he may be travelling at the time he
offers the Qada.

**Qada Prayers**

672. A person who does not offer his daily prayers within time, should
offer Qada prayers even if he slept, or was unconscious during the
entire time prescribed for the prayers. Similarly, Qada must be given
for all other obligatory prayers, if they are not offered within time,
and as an obligatory precaution this includes those prayers which one
makes obligatory upon oneself by Nadhr (vow), to offer within a fixed
period. But the prayers of Id-ul-Fitr and Id-ul-Adha have no Qada, and
the ladies who have to leave out daily prayers, or any other obligatory
prayers, due to Haydh or Nifas, do not have to give any Qada for them.
And the rule of Qada forSalat-ul-ayat will be explained later.

673. If a person realises after the time for the prayer has lapsed,
that the prayer which he offered in time was void, he should perform its
Qada prayer.

674. A person having Qada prayers on him, should not be careless about
offering them, although it is not obligatory for him to offer them
immediately.

675. A person who has Qada prayer on him, can offer Mustahab prayers.

676. It is not necessary to maintain sequential order in the offering
of Qada, except in the case of prayers for which order has been
prescribed, like, Tuhr and A?r prayers or Maghrib and Isha prayers of
the same day.

677. If a person knows that he has not offered a prayer consisting of
four Rak'ahs, but does not know whether it is Tuhr or Isha, it will be
sufficient to offer a four Rak'ah prayer with the intention of offering
Qada prayer for the prayer not offered. And as far as reciting loudly or
silently, he will have an option.
