The Excellences of the Imam Husayn in Sunni Hadith Tradition
============================================================

HUMAN history may be seen as a record of the eternal struggle between
right and wrong, virtue and vice, good and evil, and righteousness and
wickedness. This struggle was decreed by God when Adam, an earthly
creature, was sent to earth to engage in this eternal battle. It is
through this struggle that human beings can earn their eternal bliss in
the Gardens of Paradise, or their eternal punishment in the Fire. In the
history of nations this struggle often attains universal significance as
that moment of the struggle can speak to all subsequent times and
situations.

Thus the Qur'an urges us over and over again to ponder the end of those
who were before us, and how God dealt with them. In every case,
moreover, a prophet or messenger of God was rejected by his people and
killed or driven out. In this sense, therefore, the struggle is in the
end between God and humankind, between truth and falsehood, and between
right guidance and manifest error.

Nowhere is this struggle placed in sharper relief than in the life of
the Prophet Muhammad, and the lives of the people of his House. The life
and witness of the Imam Husayn in particular, has acquired special
significance in Muslim piety. This is because he has provided a model
for all martyrs in the way of God, for all time.

The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the universal significance of
the Imam in Muslim tradition. It is important to observe that all the
traditions cited in this essay are found in both Shi'i and Sunni hadith
literature. But while in the Sunni community such traditions remain
purely pietistic, Shi'i tradition has made them the basis of a complex
theological system.

However, to appreciate the place of Husayn, 'the prince of martyrs', in
Muslim history, a word must be said about the place of the Prophet's
family (the ahl al-bayt) in Muslim piety. At the same time the people of
the House of the Prophet Muhammad are not unique in the prophetic
history of human societies. A word is, therefore, necessary concerning
the families of other prophets, if we are to appreciate fully the
devotion which Muslims throughout their long history have accorded the
people of the House of Muhammad, the seal of the prophets.

Prophetic history begins, according to the Qur'an, with Adam, called
safwat Allah (the elect of God). He was followed by Noah, the first of
the prophets of power or resolve (ulu al-'azm). Noah was sent as a
messenger by God to his people who rebelled against God's message, and
were thus destroyed by the flood. Then came Abraham, the father of
prophets. With his son Ishmael he built the Ka'ba, the first house for
the worship of God.[^1] Ishmael was also a prophet, and the ancestor of
the prophets Shu'ayb, Salih, Hud, and finally Muhammad, the last
messenger of God to humankind.

Isaac, Abraham's second son, was also a prophet and the father of
prophets. Among his descendants were the family of 'Imran, the father of
Moses, and Jesus, as well as other earlier prophets who were sent by God
to the Children of Israel. The Qur'an declares that God has elected
Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham and the family of 'Imran. It further
states that they were a single progeny, one from the other'.[^2] All the
prophets and their families are therefore of one physical and spiritual
lineage They and their households are the elect of God, purified and
honoured over the rest of humankind.

The people of the House of the Prophet Muhammad were likewise chosen by
God and purified from all evil and sin. The Muslim community did not,
however, infer the status of the family of Muhammad from that of earlier
prophets and their families.

Rather they too were chosen by God and purified from all evil and sin.
Yet because Muhammad was the last prophet sent to guide humanity to God
and the good, his descendants could not assume his prophetic role. Their
mission was to be the Imams, or guides, of the Muslim community. Their
task is to safeguard the message vouchsafed to Muhammad by God for
humankind. Like many prophets, the Imams had to endure rejection by
their people and much suffering at their hands; martyrdom in the cause
of God was often their lot. Yet the greater the suffering, the greater
is the reward and honour which God promises His prophets, friends
(awliya'), and righteous servants. Thus the Prophet was asked: 'Who
among men are those afflicted with the greatest calamity?' He replied:

The prophets, then the pious, everyone according to the degree of his
piety. A man is afflicted according to his faith (din); if his faith is
durable, his affliction is accordingly increased, and if his faith is
weak, his affliction is made lighter. Afflictions continue to oppress
the worshipful servant until they leave him walking on the face of the
earth without any sin cleaving to him. [^3]

**EXCELLENCES OF THE AHL AL BAYT**

In both Sunni and Shi'i Muslim tradition, one important event
symbolizes the status of the ahl al-bayt and the human as well as
spiritual dimensions of their relation to the Prophet. This is the
tradition or episode of al-kisa' (the mantle, or cloak) which the
Prophet spread over himself and Fatima his daughter, 'Ali, and their two
sons Hasan and Husayn. This tradition has come down to us in a number of
versions, each stressing one or another aspect of the excellences of the
family of the Prophet and his love for them. Ahmad b. Hanbal relates on
the authority of Umm Salama, the Prophet's wife, that he said to Fatima
one day:

'Bring me your husband and two sons.' When they had all come together
he spread over them a mantle, and laying his hand over them, he said: 'O
God, these are the people of the House of Muhammad! Let therefore your
prayers and blessings descend upon Muhammad and the people of the House
of Muhammad; for you are worthy of all praise and glory.' Umm Salama
continued: 'I then lifted the mantle to enter in with them, but he
pulled it away from my hand saying, "You too shall come to a good end".
[^4]

The point which this version of the kisa' tradition emphasizes is that
the ahl al-bayt are only the five: Muhammad, 'Ali, Fatima, and their two
sons Hasan and Husayn. Umm Salama, one of the most highly venerated of
the Prophet's wives, was denied this special status. We shall have more
to say about this point, as it is emphasized in almost every version of
this tradition.

In another highly interesting version of the kisa' tradition, related
on the authority of 'Abd Allah b. Jafar b. Abi Talib, we read:

As the Apostle of God saw mercy descending, he demanded: 'Call them for
me, call them for me!' Safiyya asked: 'Who should we call, O Messenger
of God?' He answered: 'Call the people of my household: 'Ali, Fatima,
Hasan, and Husayn.' When they were brought, he spread a mantle over
them; then lifting his hands to heaven said: 'O God, these are the
people of my House; bless, O God, Muhammad and the people of the House
of Muhammad!' God then sent down the verse: Surely God wishes to remove
all abomination from you, O People of the House, and purify you with a
thorough purification. [^5]

This version of the tradition provides the meaning of the kisa' and the
basis of its significance. The mantle is a symbol of divine mercy and
blessing covering the Prophet and his holy family. It is, moreover, a
source or haven of consolation and serenity in the face of the great
sufferings and martyrdom which the Prophet's family had to endure after
him. In this infinite source of divine mercy, the pious also share in
times of sufferings and afflictions. The kisa' finally sets apart the
'holy five' from the rest of the faithful, and distinguishes them from
the rest of the Prophet's family.

The event of the kisa' provides the occasion for the revelation of the
verse of purification just cited. Before the sectarian conflicts which
split the Muslim community set in, classical tradition was almost
unanimous in interpreting this verse as referring to the Prophet, his
daughter Fatima al-Zahra' (the Radiant), her husband and cousin,' Ali,
and their two sons Hasan and Husayn. [^6]

In still another version of the kisa' tradition, the continuity of the
Prophet's family with those of earlier prophets is clearly indicated.
Wathila b. al-Asqa', on whose authority this tradition in most of its
variants is related, reports the following prayer uttered by the
Prophet:

O God, as you have bestowed your blessings, mercy, forgiveness, and
pleasure upon Abraham and the family of Abraham, so they ['Ali, Fatima,
Hasan and Husayn] are of me and I am of them! Bestow, therefore, your
blessings, mercy, forgiveness and pleasure upon me and them.' [^7]

This prayer echoes a prayer which Muslims repeat daily:

O God, bless Muhammad and the people of the House of Muhammad, as you
have blessed Abraham and the people of the House of Abraham among all
beings.

The House of Muhammad is, therefore, for all Muslims, 'the household of
prophethood and the frequenting place of angels'. The famous Qur'an
commentator al-Suyuti quotes a tradition attributed to Umm Salama in
interpretation of the verse of purification: This verse was sent down in
my house ... There were in the house then, seven: Gabriel and Michael,
and 'Ali, Fatima, Hasan, and Husayn, and I stood at the door of the
house. I asked: 'O Messenger of God, am I not of the People of the
House?' He said: 'You shall indeed come to a good end! You are, however,
one of the wives of the Prophet.' [^8]

The close friendship between the Prophet and the holy family, a
relationship which went far beyond the bond of blood relation, may be
seen in the incident of the mubahala, or prayer ordeal, with which the
Prophet challenged the Christians of Najran.[^9] In the mubahala verse of
the Qur'an, God orders the Prophet and his opponents to 'Call together
our sons and your sons, our women and your women, and ourselves and
yourselves.' In the view of most Qur'an commentators and traditionists,
the Prophet's sons are Hasan and Husayn, 'his women' refers to Fatima,
and 'his self' refers, apart from himself, to 'Ali. When the people of
Najran saw them, they recognized their high status with God, and with
great trepidation they declined the mubahala and opted instead for
peace.

Tradition asserts that the Prophet sensed the hostility which his
community was to show to the People of his House after him. He is said
to have often declared, 'I am at war against him who fights against you,
and will show peace toward him who shows peace to you.' This invective
is strongly put in a tradition related on the authority of Abu Bakr, the
Prophet's famous Companion and the first caliph. He said:

I saw the Messenger of God pitch a tent in which he placed 'Ali,
Fatima, Hasan, and Husayn. He then declared: 'O Muslims, I am at war
against anyone who wars against the people of this tent, and am at peace
with those who show peace toward them. I am a friend to those who
befriend them. He who shows love toward them shall be one of a happy
ancestry and good birth. Nor would anyone hate them except that he be of
miserable ancestry and evil birth. [^10]

Love for the Prophet's family is enjoined by God in the Qur'an, where
He says: Say, 'I ask no other reward of you save love of my next of kin'
(42:23). Qur'an commentators have generally agreed that 'the next of
kin' here intended are the ahl al-bayt. [^11]

The People of the House of the Prophet Muhammad have been for the pious
an example of generosity, steadfastness in the face of hardship, and a
source of solace in time of trials and afflictions. After days of
fasting and prayers for the health of the two sick children Hasan and
Husayn, the family fed the few morsels of dry bread and dates for which
'Ali had laboured so hard to the needy. On the first evening, we are
told, a beggar came.

On the second, it was an orphan, and on the third, a captive. To each
in turn, they gave the loaf of barley bread and few dates which Fatima
had prepared for the family to break their fast. Thus God sent down the
verse: They give food to eat, even though they cherish it, to the needy,
the orphan and the captive. [^12] Yet, in the end, God sent down a
celestial table to feed His friends.

Early tradition shows a tension in the relationship of the Prophet to
the community and in the relationship of the latter to the holy family.
Much of the literature reflecting this tension was most likely the
product of a later age, but projected back to the time of the Prophet
and his Companions. Here love for the Prophet's family is not simply
recommended as a pious act, but is presented as a challenge, and in a
harsh reproaching tone. Furthermore, it is on this love to the ahl
al-bayt that rewards and punishments on the Last Day are predicated.[^13]
Thus we are told that the Prophet said:

He who desires the pleasure to live my life, die my death and dwell in
a garden of Eden which my Lord has planted, let him be a friend to 'Ali
after me. Let him also be a friend to his friends. Let him finally be
guided by the Imams after me, for they are my progeny. They were created
of my clay, and have been vouchsafed knowledge and understanding. Woe to
those of my community who deny their superiority, and those who violate
the demands of kindness to my next of kin. May God not grant them my
intercession.' [^14]

In another tradition, the Prophet promises his intercession to those
who honour his descendants, provide them with whatever needs they may
have, and those who love them with their heart and profess this love
with their tongues. [^15]

It has already been stressed that the ahl al-bayt share with the
prophets of old and their descendants a high status and divine favour,
but not the office of prophethood. They share, moreover, with the
Prophet Muhammad the prerogative of intercession. This is expressed in
hagiographical language, a language common to both Sunni and Shi'i
tradition. One such common example may suffice to demonstrate the
devotion in the piety of both traditions to the Prophet and the people
of his household.

The Qur'an tells us that Adam received certain words of God which
earned him God's forgiveness and mercy: Adam received words from his
Lord, and He turned towards him; for He is relenting, compassionate
(2:37). Suyuti reports that Ibn 'Abbas, the famous traditionist and
authority on the Qur'an, asked the Prophet about the words which Adam
received. The Prophet answered: 'He prayed saying, "O God, for the sake
of Muhammad, 'Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn, do turn toward me", and He
turned toward him.

' [^16] In another highly dramatic version of this tradition, Adam is
taught the words as the only means by which God would accept his
repentance and forgive him. 'Ali, we are told, enquired of the Prophet
concerning the verse under discussion. The Prophet told him that when
Adam and his wife were expelled from Paradise, Adam wept bitterly over
his sin for a hundred years. Finally, Gabriel came to him and spoke thus
on God's behalf:

O Adam, did I not create you with my own hand? Did I not breathe into
you of my spirit? Did I not command my angels to bow down before you?
Did I not provide you with Eve my servant?' 'Yes', Adam answered.
Gabriel asked: 'What then is the cause of this weeping?' Adam replied,
'Why should I not weep when I have been expelled from the proximity of
the All-Merciful?' The angel then said: 'You must pray fervently with
these words, and God will accept your repentance and forgive your sin.
Say: "O God, I beseech you for the sake of Muhammad and the people of
the household of Muhammad; nor is there any god but you. I have done
evil, and have wronged my soul. Turn towards me for you are relenting,
compassionate." [^17]

**HASAN AND HUSAYN**

Islamic tradition has preserved numerous anecdotes depicting the tender
care and love which the Prophet showed Hasan and Husayn. They were both
born in Medina, and thus knew the Prophet only as children. It is
therefore with the intimacy and love of a grandfather that the early
life of the two Imams is coloured. Once more, these family anecdotes
also reflect clearly the theological and political tension within the
community, a tension which largely centered around Hasan and Husayn. One
such anecdote is the following.

One day, we are told, Hasan and Husayn were lost, and their mother
Fatima came to the Prophet greatly alarmed. The angel Gabriel, however,
came down and told the Prophet that the two youths were asleep in an
animal fold some distance away. God, the angel reassured the anxious
family, had charged an angel to keep watch over them. The Prophet went
to the spot and found the angel had spread his two wings: one under them
and the other over them as cover. The Prophet stooped over the two
children and began to kiss them until they awoke.

He then carried them on his shoulders back to the city. A large crowd
of Muslims followed the Prophet and his two grandsons to the mosque. The
Prophet then addressed the assembled people and said: 'O Muslims, shall
I inform you of those who have the best grandfather and grandmother of
humankind?' 'Yes, O Apostle of God', they all replied. 'They are Hasan
and Husayn', he said. 'Their grandfather is the Apostle of God, the seal
of the Messengers, and their grandmother is Khadija, daughter of
Khuwaylid, mistress of the women of Paradise.' The Prophet then declared
Hasan and Husayn to have the best maternal uncle and aunt: Jafar and Umm
Hani', son and daughter of Abu Talib. Their maternal uncle and aunt were
likewise the best of all uncles and aunts:

they were al-Qasim, son of the Messenger of God, and Zaynab, daughter
of the Apostle of God. The Prophet concluded: 'O God, you know that
Hasan and Husayn shall be in Paradise, their uncles and aunt shall be in
Paradise, and those who love them shall be in Paradise, while those who
hate them shall be in the Fire." [^18]

Abu Hurayra, the famous hadith transmitter, related that often when
they prayed behind the Messenger of God Hasan and Husayn would jump on
his back while he was prostrate in prayer. When he lifted his head, he
would move them gently and place them beside him.

One evening, after prayers, Abu Hurayra offered to take the two youths
home, but the Prophet wished them to stay. Soon, however, a flash of
lightning illuminated the sky, and they thus walked in its light until
they entered their home. [^19] The friends (awliya') of God, like the
prophets, are favoured with miracles. These are not miracles proper
(mu'jizat), but rather karamat (divine favours). The lightning incident
was one such divine favour by means of which the Prophet wished to
inform the community of the special status with which God had favoured
the two Imams.

There is a unity between the Prophet and the ahl al-bayt, a unity not
simply of blood, but also of the spirit. It is a unity symbolized by the
kisa' event. It is, therefore, a unity of love, as the following
statement of the Prophet clearly indicates. He said, as related on the
authority of Salman the Persian: 'Whoever loves Hasan and Husayn, I love
him, and whomsoever I love, God also loves, and whomsoever God loves, He
shall cause him to enter into the gardens of bliss.' Likewise he who
hates Hasan and Husayn shall be consigned to the Fire, because both God
and his Messenger will hate him, 'and a terrible punishment awaits him'.
[^20]

Muslim hagiographical piety extended this unity and intimacy between
the Prophet and his two grandchildren to include the angels of heaven.
Thus Hudhayfa, a well known companion and traditionist, reported that
the Prophet said: 'An angel is here who never came down to earth before
this night. He sought permission from his Lord to come down and greet
me, and to bring me the glad tidings that Fatima is the mistress of the
women of Paradise, and that Hasan and Husayn are the masters of the
youths of Paradise.' [^21]

There is no doubt that the special status of the Imam Husayn in Muslim
piety and devotion has in large measure been due to the Imam's great
sacrifice of family, wealth, and life itself in the way of God. Husayn's
martyrdom - his courage, steadfastness, dignity, and true devotion in
times of great crisis - have inspired Muslims of all walks of life.
Husayn has inspired the best poetry in all Islamic languages; even
non-Muslim poets celebrated his great virtue and valour.

Above all, however, the Imam Husayn's martyrdom became a source of
strength and endurance for Muslims in times of suffering, persecution
and oppression. He has stood with every wronged man or woman before
oppressive rulers, reproaching wrongdoers and encouraging the oppressed
to persist in their struggle for freedom and dignity. The following
encounter between Zayd b. Arqam, a venerable companion of the Prophet,
and 'Ubayd Allah b. Ziyad is a living testimony to the struggle between
illegitimate authority and the power of right. When the head of the Imam
Husayn was brought before him, Ibn Ziyad began to poke its teeth and
lips with a stick.

Zayd protested: 'Take away your stick! For, by God, I saw the Apostle
of God often kiss these lips.' Saying this, Zayd began to weep. Ibn
Ziyad reprimanded him, saying: 'May God cause your eyes to weep! Had it
not been that you are an old and senile man, I would have cut off your
head.' Zayd then walked away, exclaiming: 'O men, you are slaves after
this day.

For you have slain the son of Fatima and set as amir over you the son
of Marjana [i.e., Ibn Ziyad]. By God, he shall kill the best of you and
enslave the most wicked among you. Perish those who accept humiliation
and shame.' Zayd then said, 'O Ibn Ziyad, I shall tell you something
that will enrage you even more. I saw the Apostle of God seating Hasan
on his left leg and Husayn on his right, and say, "O God, I commend them
and the most righteous of the people of faith to your trust." How have
you dealt with the trust of the Prophet, O Ibn Ziyad?' [^22]

Divine wisdom in creation can be best discerned, according to the
Qur'an, in the order of nature, and in the human individual and his
society. Muslim hagiography has recorded the dramatic effect the death
of Husayn had on nature. Thus the famous traditionist al-Bayhaqi
reported that when al-Husayn b. 'Ali was killed, the sun was so deeply
eclipsed that stars were seen at midday. People feared that it was the
Day of Resurrection.[^23] Nadra al-Azdiya, a woman who was contemporary
with the Imam Husayn, is said to have reported: 'When al-Husayn b. 'Ali
was killed, the sky rained down blood, so that next morning we found our
wells and water jugs filled with it.' [^24]

The memory of the martyred Imam has been kept alive and nourished by
the tears of the faithful who vicariously share in the tragedy of the
Imam Husayn and his loved ones and friends. Here again, tradition has
extended the grief displayed by the pious for the tragedy of Karbala' to
the cosmic order. Thus al-Suyuti reports in his commentary on the verse
describing God's compassion towards the ancient martyr John son of
Zachariah that 'The heavens did not weep for the death of anyone except
John son of Zachariah and al-Husayn b. 'Ali. Its redness [at sunset] is
the sign of its weeping.'[^25]

**CONCLUSION**

It has already been argued that there is an existential and
all-inclusive unity between the Prophet and his daughter Fatima, her
husband, 'Ali, and their two sons. This unity makes it impossible to
discuss one without discussing all the others. We have, therefore, been
concerned throughout this study with the Imam Husayn in the context of
this essential unity. It must be added, however, that the Imam Husayn
was especially close to the heart of his grandfather, the Prophet
Muhammad.

It is of Husayn alone that he declared: 'Husayn is of me and I am of
Husayn. May God love those who love Husayn.'[^26] When sura 108
(al-Kawthar) was revealed, the Prophet announced this great favour to
his close companion Anas b. Malik, on whose authority this tradition is
reported. Anas asked: 'What is al-Kawthar?' He answered: 'It is a river
in Paradise, but neither those who violate my covenant (dhimma), nor
those who shall kill the people of my House will be allowed to drink of
it.' [^27]

Finally, Shi'i tradition has always insisted on the great merit the
faithful earn in making pilgrimage (ziyara) to the tomb of the Imam
Husayn and the tombs of the men who were martyred with him.

Yet Sunni tradition has likewise seen great merit in this pious
act.[^28] The ziyara to the tomb of the martyred Imam has acquired this
great significance in all Muslim tradition because the Imam and his
fellow martyrs are seen as models of jihad in the way of God. It is
related that the father of the Imams, 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, passed by
Karbala' after the battle of Siffin. He took a handful of its soil and
exclaimed: 'Ah, ah, on this spot some men will be slain, and will enter
Paradise without reckoning!' [^29]

The spiritual unity of the ahl al-bayt, symbolized by the kisa', is in
turn a symbol of the unity of all Muslims. It is for the sake of this
unity in faith and commitment (islam) to God and the truth that the Imam
Husayn sacrificed his life. He refused a partisan Islam when he refused
to legitimize Umayyad rule.

Because he refused humiliation, wrongdoing and deviation from the
ideals of Islamic leadership as exemplified by the Prophet and his own
father 'Ali, the Commander of the Faithful, the Imam Husayn drew once
and for all the distinction between a true khalifa (representative) of
the Apostle of God and the kings of this world. But above all, the Imam
Husayn and his fellow martyrs accepted God's bargain with the people of
faith to exchange their lives and wealth for the eternal bliss of
Paradise.[^30] This divine challenge is no less relevant to the Muslim
community today than it was fourteen hundred years ago. It invites us
still to 'a garden whose breadth is greater than the heavens and earth,
prepared for those who fear God'.
