The Opinion of the Prophet About He Who Hurts Fatimah
=====================================================

The Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HF) had frequently said:

"Fatimah is a part of me. Whoever makes her angry, makes me angry."

**Sunni references:**

- Sahih al-Bukhari, Arabic-English, v5, Traditions \#61 and \#111
- Sahih Muslim, section of virtues of Fatimah, v4, pp 1904-5

According to al-Bukhari and Muslim, the Messenger of Allah has
testified that Fatimah is the best of the ladies of the worlds:

Sahih al-Bukhari Hadith: 4.819

Narrated 'Aisha:

The Messenger of Allah said to Fatimah (who was crying at her father's
deathbed): "Are you not satisfied that you are the chief of all the
ladies of Paradise or the chief of all the believing women?"

Furthermore, Ibn Abbas (RA) narrated:

The Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HF) said: Four women are the mistress of
the worlds: Mary, Asiya (the wife of Pharaoh), Khadija, and Fatimah. And
the most excellent one among them in the world is Fatimah."

Sunni references: Ibn Asakir, as quoted in Tafsir al-Durr al-Manthoor
Allah, Exalted He is, said in Quran:"(O Prophet) tell (people) I don't
ask you any wage except to love my family." (Quran 42:23).

He also said:"(O Prophet) tell (people) whatever I asked as wage (in
return for my prophethood) is in the benefit of you (people)."(Quran
34:47).

The above two verses of Holy Quran explicitly indicate that the
Prophet, with the order of Allah, has asked people to love his family as
a command. Moreover loving them is in our benefit since "true love"
requires to follow and obey the purified members of his family who carry
his true Sunnah.

It is unfortunate that those who claimed to be his sicere compnions
inflicted such horrible pains to his family while a week had not been
passed since the death of the Prophet (PBUH&HF). Is this the love, Allah
ordered for the family of prophet?!


**Where his her grave?**

The Muslims have been deeply pained.
Their beloved prophet has passed away.
And especially for his kith and kin,
it is one of their lives saddest day.

A lady who happens to be his daughter,
above all is the most afflicted one.
She was the nearest to her father.
Alas her troubles have just begun.

What in the Prophet's eyes was her status,
unfortunately the people shall forget.
She should be respected by all of us.
But a harsh treatment, she'll be met.

Everyone had heard her father say,
"My daughter is a part of me".
For her safety he would often pray;
Not wanting her to bear any agony.

But his words fell on deaf ears.
His followers were lead astray.
So, were realized those worst fears,
and his tidings were disobeyed.

Each forthcoming day brings her sorrow
and only a few more months she'll live.
Each night she worries about her woes.
Her tormentors, she may not forgive.

In her last days, she is seen weeping.
Awake all night, she seldom sleeps.
Of her troubles, she keeps thinking.
The wounds in her heart are so deep.

The thoughts of her father alone
cause tears from her eyes to flow
and what will happen to her children?
What fate do they have in stow?

"Be kind to them and take care",
she wills about her poor children,
because she'll be no longer near
and they'll soon be orphans.

As she spends the time crying,
her neighbours come and complain.
But look! She is already dying.
Their complaint will be in vain.

And that dark moment finally comes,
for her heavenly abode, she departs.
Holding back their tears, her children,
see their baba, who, with a heavy heart,

hands trembling and with great anguish
takes away her coffin during the night.
He makes sure to fulfill her last wish.
She will rest, out of everyones sight.

Has gone from this world forever,
the mother of children so brave!
But why was she buried in a manner
that no one knows, where is her grave?


Ali Rizwan Shah,

But also they cut all the financial resources of Ahlul-Bayt in order to
crush the opposition. In Sahih al-Bukhari the following has also been
narrated by Aisha:

Fatimah the daughter of the Prophet sent someone to Abu Bakr (when he
was a caliph), asking for her inheritance of what Allah's Apostle had
left of the property bestowed on him by Allah from the Fai (i.e. booty
gained without fighting) in Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the
Khumus of the Khaibar booty. ...but Abu Bakr refused to give anything of
that to Fatimah.

So she became angry with Abu Bakr and kept away from him, and did not
task to him till she died. She remained alive for six months after the
death of the Prophet. When she died, her husband 'Ali, buried her at
night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral prayer by
himself.

**Sunni References:**

- Sahih al-Bukhari, Chapter of "The battle of Khaibar", Arabic-English,
v5, tradition \#546, pp 381-383, also v4, Tradition \#325 (Please see
the appendix for the whole tradition.)

Now either Fatimah was liar or Abu Bakr treated her unjustly. If she
was liar, then she did not deserve such a saying from the Prophet that
Fatimah is a part of me and whoever angers her, angers me. This itself
is a clear indication of her infallibility. The purification sentence of
the Holy Quran (the last sentence of verse 33:33) is another indication
of her infallibility, as Aisha herself testified (See Sahih Muslim, 1980
Edition, Arabic, v4, p1883, Tradition \#61).

Hence there is nothing left for the sensible people but to accept the
fact that she was unjustly treated, and that she was easy to be branded
as a liar by Umar who was willing to let her burn unless the remaining
people in her house come out to vote for Abu Bakr.

So logical conclusion from the above traditions in Sahih al-Bukhari and
Sahih Muslim is that Fatimah was treated unjustly, and that she was
angry at Abu Bakr and Umar, which follows Allah and his prophet are
angry at them according the above tradition in Sahih al-Bukhari.

The excuse that Abu Bakr used to refuse to pay the right of Fatimah
(see Appendix) was against the text of Quran. How can he be the executor
of prophet while he does not obey the clear text of Quran? Abu Bakr
claimed that prophet has said: "We prophets do not leave any
inheritance, and whatever we leave should go to charity."

This is false allegation that he has made up, because prophet can not
contradict Quran which in two verses testifies that prophets had heir,
and their children inherited from them. Allah says in Quran:

"And Solomon (Sulaymaan) inherited from David." (Quran 27:16)

While both Sulaymaan and David were prophets and very wealthy. They
were kings of their times. Allah , Exalted, also says:

"(Zakariya prayed to Allah by saying)... Grant me a son from yourself,
who inherits from me and inherit from the children of Jacob, and make
him, O' my Lord, the one with whom you are well-pleased." (Quran
19:5-6).

These are examples that prophets left inheritance. In fact, Fatimah
(AS) mentioned these verses as her proof for her right, but Abu Bakr
refused due to the suggestion of Umar, and they intentionally went
against the clear text of Quran.

Historical facts testifies that prophet even had already transferred
Fadak (Which was a big and rich piece of land in Hijaz) to Fatimah and
it was the property of Fatimah long before the demise of the Prophet. As
such, even it was not even the matter of inheritance as claimed by Abu
Bakr. The reason that the Prophet has transferred Fadak to Fatimah was
to provide financial resources for the followers of Ahlul-Bayt.

But after the Prophet passed away, Abu Bakr and Umar dismissed the
managers of that land (who were assigned by Fatimah in the life time of
his father), and confiscated that land and other properties of
Ahlul-Bayt.

The reason is very simple: They knew that if this rich property remains
in the hand of Imam Ali and Fatimah, peace be upon them, they will spend
its revenues to their followers and this would give strength to the
rival party and endangers their position. Abu Bakr and Umar realized the
fact that in order to control the oppositions, it is necessary to remove
all the funding abilities first.

Thus the problem was not a simple financial problem. It was absolutely
political in nature. The quarrel Fatimah (AS) was not for the pleasure
of this world. History testifies that Imam Ali and Fatimah have had a
very simple life during the life time of prophet as well as
thereafter.

It is well known that verses (76:8-9) of the holy Quran was revealed
for them when for 3 consecutive days, they gave their meal to needy
people at the time of IFTAR, when they were going to break their fast,
and there was noting left for them and their children to eat for three
consecutive days.

So such pious people do not struggle or GET ANGRY because of such
worldly things. THAT IS WHY, ANGER OF FATIMAH IS ANGER OF PROPHET. They
were, in fact, struggling for the sake of Allah and for spending their
ligitimate properties for His Right Path and its followers.

At the time of Harun al-Rashid (one of the Abbasid Tyrants) the Islamic
country was in its biggest extent. It was extended from Afghanistan and
central Asia to the North Africa. So it was not important for government
to give up a piece of land.

Moreover, by returning it they could make propaganda for their
interest. According to some reports, Harun told to Imam Musa al-Kadhim
(the 7th Imam of the Ahlul-Bayt): "Let us know the location of the land
of Fadak so that I could return it to you." The Imam (AS) replied: "I
would accept it only in its entirety." Harun said: "Specify its
boundaries then."

The Imam (AS) said: "If I specify its borders, you will not return it."
Harun said: "I swear in the name of your grandfather that I shall return
it." At this time, the Imam (AS) said: "It extends from one side to Aden
(Southern part of Arabian peninsula), and from one side to Samarqand
(Afghanistan), and from one side to Armenia (south of Russia) and from
one side to Egypt in Africa." The face of Harun turned red and said:
"This does not leave anything for us." The Imam (AS) replied: "I told
you that you will not return it if I specify its limits!" (al-Bihar,
v48, p144, Hadith \#20).


Wassalam.


**APPENDIX**

Here is the whole tradition which was referred above:

Sahih Bukhari Hadith: 5.546


Narrated 'Aisha:

Fatimah the daughter of the Prophet sent someone to Abu Bakr (when he
was a caliph), asking for her inheritance of what Allah's Apostle had
left of the property bestowed on him by Allah from the Fai (i.e. booty
gained without fighting) in Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the
Khumus of the Khaibar booty. On that, Abu Bakr said, "Allah's Apostle
said, "Our property is not inherited.

Whatever we leave, is Sadaqa, but the family of (the Prophet) Muhammad
can eat of this property.' By Allah, I will not make any change in the
state of the Sadaqa of Allah's Apostle and will leave it as it was
during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle, and will dispose of it as
Allah's Apostle used to do." So Abu Bakr refused to give anything of
that to Fatima.

So she became angry with Abu Bakr and kept away from him, and did not
talk to him till she died. She remained alive for six months after the
death of the Prophet. When she died, her husband 'Ali, buried her at
night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral prayer by
himself.


When Fatimah was alive, the people used to respect 'Ali much, but after
her death, 'Ali noticed a change in the people's attitude towards him.
So Ali sought reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him an oath of
allegiance. Ali had not given the oath of allegiance during those months
(i.e. the period between the Prophet's death and Fatima's death). 'Ali
sent someone to Abu Bakr saying, "Come to us, but let nobody come with
you," as he disliked that 'Umar should come, 'Umar said (to Abu Bakr),
"No, by Allah, you shall not enter upon them alone " Abu Bakr said,
"What do you think they will do to me?

By Allah, I will go to them' So Abu Bakr entered upon them, and then
'Ali uttered Tashah-hud and said (to Abu Bakr), "We know well your
superiority and what Allah has given you, and we are not jealous of the
good what Allah has bestowed upon you, but you did not consult us in the
question of the rule and we thought that we have got a right in it
because of our near relationship to Allah's Apostle ."

Thereupon Abu Bakr's eyes flowed with tears. And when Abu Bakr spoke,
he said, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is to keep good relations with
the relatives of Allah's Apostle is dearer to me than to keep good
relations with my own relatives.

But as for the trouble which arose between me and you about his
property, I will do my best to spend it according to what is good, and
will not leave any rule or regulation which I saw Allah's Apostle
following, in disposing of it, but I will follow." On that 'Ali said to
Abu Bakr, "I promise to give you the oath of allegiance in this after
noon."

So when Abu Bakr had offered the Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit
and uttered the Tashah-hud and then mentioned the story of 'Ali and his
failure to give the oath of allegiance, and excused him, accepting
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what excuses he had offered; Then 'Ali (got
up) and praying (to Allah) for forgiveness, he uttered Tashah-hud,
praised Abu Bakr's right, and said, that he had not done what he had
done because of jealousy of Abu Bakr or as a protest of that Allah had
favored him with.

'Ali added, "But we used to consider that we too had some right in this
affair (of rulership) and that he (i.e. Abu Bakr) did not consult us in
this matter, and therefore caused us to feel sorry." On that all the
Muslims became happy and said, "You have done the right thing." The
Muslims then became friendly with 'Ali as he returned to what the people
had done (i.e. giving the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr).
