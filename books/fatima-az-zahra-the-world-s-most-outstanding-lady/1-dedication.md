***(1) Surely We have given you kawthar.***[^1]

***(2) Therefore pray to your lord and make a sacrifice.***

***(3) Surely your enemy is the one who shall be without posterity.
Qur’an (108:1-3)***

A gift to the holy presence of the Master of the Age (Waliyul ‘Asr) (may
Allah hasten his appearance):

O’ Allah, at this time and for all the time, for the master of Your
command, Imam Zaman Hujjah ibn al-Hassan (may Your blessings be upon him
and his progeny) be Supervisor, Guard, Leader, Helper and Guide, and
Guardian until you bring the world under his leadership, and his
profiting it for many ages.

[^1]: The Heavenly Fountain of unbounded grace and benefits.
