Lesson Sixty Four: Do Not Belittle Any Sin!
===========================================

Imam Hasan Al-’Askari (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مِنَ الذُّنُوبِ الَّتِى لا يُغْفَرُ: ليتنى لا اُؤاخَذُ إلاّ بِهَذا!
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

One of the sins that would not be forgiven is for a man to say, “I wish
my sin to be only this one.”[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Minor sins are changed to major sins due to several factors, one of
which is to consider them to be little and unimportant. This is one of
the dangerous satanic temptations.

Those sins which man fears and considers as major sins are not so
dangerous because one is always careful not to commit them. But when he
assumes a sin to be minor and is not afraid of it, he is easily drawn to
it again and again; minor sins change to major, keeping him away from
happiness and prosperity for ever. Furthermore, every sin, however
small, is significant in one respect : it exceeds the bound of rules of
Allah, the Almighty.
