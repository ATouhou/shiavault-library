Eating of sahari
----------------

The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) has said: Eat your
'sahari' (the morning meal before the start of a fast) even if it is
(mere) mouthfuls of water, for the blessings of Allah are upon those who
eat the sahur.*Tahdheeb al-Akhaam, vol. 4, pg. 198*
