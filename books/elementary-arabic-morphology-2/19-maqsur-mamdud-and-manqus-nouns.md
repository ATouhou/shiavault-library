141. A *maqsūr* noun is a noun that ends in an *alif*. The *alif* can
either be:

• long, for example: **عصا** (cane)

• *maqsūrah*, for example: **فتیَ** (young man)

142. *Maqsūr* nouns are always verbalized with a *fathah* nunation,
except if it is an unnonated noun. For example: **جاءَ** **فتیً** (a
young man came), **رأیتُ** **فتیً** (I saw a young man), and **مَرَرتُ**
**بفتیً** (I passed by a young man)

143. A *mamdūd* noun is a noun that ends with a *hamzah* preceded by an
*alif*. For example: **سماء** (sky).

144. A *manqūs* noun is a noun that ends with a *yā'* preceded by a
*kasrah*. For example: **القاضي** (judge).

145. A *manqūs* noun is verbalized:

• By two *kasrahs* after the *yā'* is erased when it is in the
nominative and genitive cases. For example: **جاءَ** **قاضٍ** (a judge
came).

• Just like any other noun in the accusative case, unless it is
unnonated. For example: **رأیتُ** **قاضیاً** (I saw a judge).
