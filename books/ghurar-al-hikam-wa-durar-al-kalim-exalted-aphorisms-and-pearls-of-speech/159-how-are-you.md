How Are You?
============

**How are you? كيف الحال؟**

1. (When he was asked ‘how are you O Amīr al-Mu’minīn?’, he replied: )
How would he be whom life is driving towards death, whose state of
health can be changed to sickness at any moment and who can be
approached [by death] from his place of safety?!

المُؤمِنينَ؟ فقال: كَيْفَ يَكُونُ (حالُ) مَنْ يَفْنى بِبَقائِهِ،
ويَسْقَمُ بِصِحَّتِهِ ويُؤتى مِنْ مَأْمَنِهِ؟!
