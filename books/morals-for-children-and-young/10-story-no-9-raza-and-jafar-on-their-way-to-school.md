Story no. 9: Raza and Jafar on their way to school
==================================================

Raza went to school.  
 On his way he met Jafar, his neighbor’s son.  
 He said “Why did you go to school alone? Weren’t we supposed to go to
school together?”  
 Raza replied “You promised me yesterday that you would arrive at my
house at 7:00 in the morning, but I waited for half an hour before going
to school today, but you didn’t turn up. Don’t you know that being
unfaithful on what you have promised is against the morals of Islam?  
 Jafar regretted the act he committed the day before and said that he
would be faithful on his promises from now on.

Yes, one of the signs of the Muslims of the right path is to be faithful
on promises.
