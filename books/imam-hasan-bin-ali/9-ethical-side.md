Ethical Side
============

Covering this aspect of the character of the grandson of the Prophet (S)
by no means signifies a difference among the guiding Imams (as) in this
respect, or in any other ingredient of the ideal Islamic character. They
are equal in this. We will confine ourselves to presenting some
narratives of the Imam's behavior with the people. We hope that his
morals are the ones which we adopt and follow.
