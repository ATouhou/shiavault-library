Lesson Ninety: Be Self-Sufficient
=================================

Imam As-Sajjad (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
طَلَبُ الْحَوائِجِ إِلىَ النّاسِ مَذَلَّةٌ لِلْحَياةِ وَ مَذَهَبَةٌ
لِلْحَياءِ وَ إِسْتِخْفافٌ بِالْوَقارِ وَ هُوَ الفَقْرُ الْحاضِرُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Asking from people is abasement in life and destroys modesty and
degrades man’s dignity, and is a poverty which man brings upon for
himself.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Some people subject themselves to poverty although they think that they
are escaping from it. They do this by making themselves dependent and
needy through unnecessary demands from others. In the process they also
ruin their human dignity.

Islam instructs its followers to be self-sufficient as far as possible
and avoid a life of dependency for having to depend on others is itself
a form of poverty.
