Importance of Marriage in Islam
===============================

The Holy Quran says,  
***“And marry those among you who are single and those who are fit among
your male slaves and your female slaves; if they are needy, Allah will
make them free from want out of His grace; and Allah is Ample-giving,
Knowing.” (Surah an-Nur, 24:32)***

The above *ayat* begins with the words ***Wa Ankehoo*** **(*****And
marry…)***. The imperative form of the word ‘*nikah*’ implies that
either it is obligatory or highly recommended.[^1] According to
scholars, though marriage is a highly recommended act, it becomes
obligatory when there is a chance of falling into sin.

The Prophet (S) says, *“No house has been built in Islam more beloved in
the sight of Allah than through marriage.”* [^2]  
 On another occasion the Prophet (S) said,  
*“The best people of my nation (Ummat) are those who get married and
have chosen their wives, and the worst people of my nation are those who
have kept away from marriage and are passing their lives as bachelors.”*
[^3]  
 Imam ‘Ali (A.S.) exhorts, *“Marry, because marriage is the tradition of
the Prophet (S).”* The Prophet (S) also said, “*Whosoever likes to
follow my tradition, then he should know that marriage is from my
tradition.”* [^4]

A. Importance of Sex in Marriage
--------------------------------

In Islam, marriage is not restricted to a platonic relationship between
husband and wife, nor is it solely for procreation. The Islamic term for
marriage, “*nikah*” literally means sexual intercourse.[^5]  
 So why has Islam provided extensive rules and regulation regarding sex?
This was because Islam has fully understood that sexual instincts cannot
and must not be repressed. They can only be regulated for the well being
of human beings in this life and for their success in the hereafter.  
 Sex in married life has been openly recommended in Qur’an,  
***“…when they [i.e., the wives] have cleansed themselves [after
menstruation], you go into them as Allah has commanded…” (Surah
al-Baqarah, 2:222)***

B. Fulfillment of Sexual Urge
-----------------------------

The Holy Prophet (S) and the Holy Imams (A.S.) also encouraged their
followers to marry and to fulfill their sexual urges in lawful ways as
can be seen from the following: The Prophet (S) said, *“O you young men!
I recommend marriage to you.*” [^6]  
 Imam Reza (A.S.) said, *“Three things are from the traditions of the
Messengers of God (A.S.): using perfume, removing the [excessive] hair
and visiting one’s wife.”* [^7]

C. Celibacy and Monasticism is Forbidden
----------------------------------------

Islamic is totally opposed to monasticism and celibacy. ‘Uthman bin
Maz’un was a close companion of the Prophet (S). One day his wife came
to the Prophet (S) and complained, “O Messenger of God (S)! ‘Uthman
fasts during the day and stands for prayers during the night.” In other
words, she meant to say that her husband was avoiding sexual relations
during the night as well as the day. The Prophet (S) was angered. He did
not even wait to put on his slippers. He went to ‘Uthman’s house and
found him praying. When ‘Uthman finished his prayers and turned towards
the Prophet (S), he said, *“O ‘Uthman! Allah did not send me for
monasticism, rather He sent me with a simple and straight [Shariah]. I
fast, pray and also have intimate relations with my wife. So whosoever
likes my tradition, then he should follow it; and marriage is one of my
traditions.”* [^8]

D. Beneficial Effects of a Married Life
---------------------------------------

Various studies prove that married people remain healthier, physically
and mentally. Islam has always maintained that marriage is beneficial
for us in many ways.  
 Islam also regards marriage as a way to acquire spiritual perfection.  
 The Prophet (S) said, *“One who marries, has already guarded half of
his religion, therefore he should fear Allah for the other half.”* [^9]
How true! A person who fulfills his sexual urges lawfully would rarely
be distracted in spiritual pursuits.

E. Marriage Enhances the Value of Prayers
-----------------------------------------

The Prophet (S) said, *“Two rak‘ats (cycles) prayed by a married person
are better than the night-vigil and the fast of a single person.”*
[^10]  
 A woman came to the Prophet (S) and said that she had tried everything
to attract her husband but in vain; he does not leave his meditation to
pay any attention to her.  
 The Prophet (S) told her to inform her husband about the reward of
sexual intercourse which he described as follows: *“When a man
approaches his wife, he is guarded by two angels and [at that moment in
Allah’s views] he is like a warrior fighting for the cause of Allah.
When he has intercourse with her, his sins fall like the leaves of the
tree [in fall season]. When he performs the major ablution, he is
cleansed from sins.”* [^11]

F. Marriage increases Sustenance
--------------------------------

The Holy Prophet (S) remarked, *“Give spouses to your single ones,
because Allah makes their morality better (improves it) (under the
shadow of marriage) and expands their sustenance and increases their
generosity (human values).”* [^12]
