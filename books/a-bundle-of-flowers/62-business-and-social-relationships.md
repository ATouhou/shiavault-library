Business and Social Relationships
=================================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "He who purchases the food stuff which is a
public necessity and stores it for forty days with the hope that its
price will go up in the Muslim market, then, sells it and gives the
entire sum as charity to the poor, it can not be the atonement for what
he has done."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 103, p. 89

Imam Amir ul Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) said: "He who ventures transactions
without observing the concerning Islamic rules, has surely run into
usury," (while he is not aware of it).

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 103, p. 93

Imam Amir ul Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) narrates from the Messenger of Allah
who said: "He who is in business and buys and sells things must avoid
five traits, otherwise he should not buy or sell anything: usury, taking
oath, concealing the faults or defects of the goods, praising it wrongly
when selling it, and finding faults in it when buying it."

Al-Khisal by Saduq, vol. 1, p. 286

Imam al-Baqir, the fifth Imam (‘a) said: "He who seeks for sustenance in
this world in order to be independent of people for his needs, to
provide for his famlly members, and to stretch affection unto his
neighbours, will meet Allah, Almighty and Glorious, on the Day of
Judgement while his face will be as bright as the full moon."

Al-Kafi, vol. 5, p. 78
