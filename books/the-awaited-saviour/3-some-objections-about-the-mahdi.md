Some Objections about the Mahdi
===============================

Some of the objections raised by them are mentioned below:

(a) Longevity
-------------

They object to the Mahdi being a contemporary of so many successive
generations during the past ten centuries and continuing to live until
he reappears on the scene. How is it possible for him, they ask, to live
such a long life without being affected by the natural laws, according
to which everyone has to pass through the stages of old age and senility
and eventually has to die at a time far earlier than the supposed
present age of the Mahdi. Such a long life is impossible from a factual
point of view.

(b) Suspension of laws
----------------------

They also inquire as to why Allah is so keen to suspend natural laws for
the sake of this particular person and to prolong his life so
extraordinarily. Is humanity unable to produce any other competent
leader? Why is it not possible that the role of filling the world with
justice and equity be left to a leader who may be born on the eve of the
appointed day and grow like other people?

(c) Lack of training
--------------------

They also say that if it is true that the Mahdi is the name of a
particular person who is the son of the eleventh Imam of the Prophet's
House, who was born in 255 A.H. and whose father died in 260 A.H. and
who at the time of his father's death was a child of not more than five
years of age, then obviously this age was not sufficient for his having
been trained religiously and intellectually by his father. They ask as
to how then has he been prepared for his great role.

(d) His continued existence
---------------------------

They also say that even if it is presumed that the existence of the
Mahdi is theoretically possible, how can they believe in his actual
existence in the absence of any scientific or religious proof? According
to them, a few traditions of unknown authenticity attributed to the holy
Prophet cannot be considered to be enough for such a belief.

(e) Delay in appearance
-----------------------

They also say that, if the leader is already prepared for the
performance of his great role, then what is the necessity of waiting for
hundreds of years. Could not the upheavals and the tragedies so far
witnessed by the world justify his appearance on the scene?

(f) His superhuman role
-----------------------

With reference to the Mahdi's role they ask as to how it is possible for
an individual, howsoever great he may be, to play such a decisive role
in the world, when it is known that no individual by himself can make
history nor can he give it an entirely new turn. It is the prevailing
circumstances which produce and direct historical changes. The greatness
of an individual lies only in his coming to the fore-front, in the given
circumstances, and in effecting a practical change by selecting one of
the multiple solutions.

(g) His modus operandi
----------------------

They also ask what practical methods will be employed by that individual
to bring about the colossal change and to ensure the final victory of
the forces of justice over the mighty and dominating forces of
oppression and injustice, which now have the most destructive weapons,
scientific potentialities and political, social and military power at
their disposal.

These are the questions which are frequently asked in this connection
and repeated in one form or another. They are not always motivated
merely by intellectual curiosity. There are psychological reasons also
which stimulate them. There is a strong general feeling that there is
little chance of overthrowing the present world system, which is too
powerful and invincible.

This feeling produces scepticism and gives rise to queries. It leads to
defeatism and an inferiority complex. One begins to shudder at the very
idea of a world-wide change which may eliminate injustice and historical
contradictions and usher in a new system based on justice and equity.
This mental frustration impels one to doubt and reject every possibility
of such a change by giving one reason or another.
We now propose to take up the above-mentioned queries, one by one, and
deal with them briefly.
