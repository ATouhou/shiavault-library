Lesson Ninety Four: Nearer Kinsfolk
===================================

Imam Hassan al-Mujtaba (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلْقَريْبُ مَنْ قَرَّبَتْهُ الْمَوَدَّةُ وَ إنْ بَعُدَ نَسَبُهُ وَ
الْبَعيدُ مَنْ باعَدَتْهُ الْمَوَدَةُ وَ إِنْ قَرُبَ نَسَبُهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Near kinsfolk are those who are more affectionate, although they may be
genealogically not as near as those who are less affectionate.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Kinship is one of the most important social relations in Islam . It
enables formation of well-knit groups in the heart of great human
society whose members cooperate closely and help each other in solving
critical problems.

The criterion of relationship in Islam , as stated in the above
tradition, gives much importance to affection and friendship, not merely
the closeness of genealogical relationship.
