59. A *wasl hamza* is that which is pronounced at the beginning of
speech but is not pronounced in the middle of speech, for example:
**اِجلِس یا رَجُلُ** and **یا رَجُلُ اجلِس**. The *qat‛ hamza* is that
which is pronounced wherever it occurs, for example: **أکرِم یا رَجُلُ**
and **یا رَجُلُ أکرِم.**

60. The *wasl hamza* is written according to the rules in the preterite
tense of five and six-letter verbs as well as their imperative and
infinitive forms. This is also the case in the imperative case of the
triliteral verb. The *hamza* in all of these verbs is added to the
beginning.

61. The *qat‛ hamza* is written according to the rules in the preterite
tense of quadriliteral verbs, as well as their imperative and infinitive
forms. This is also the case in all aorist tense verbs. This *hamza* is
sometimes added and sometimes not, is sometimes at the beginning of the
verb, sometimes in the middle of it, and sometimes at the end of it.
