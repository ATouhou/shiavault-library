Call to Surrender or Die
========================

Presently messengers came from Kufa, and Imam Husayn was asked to
surrender. Imam Husayn offered to take one of three alternatives. He
wanted no political power and no revenge. He said “I came to defend my
own people. If I am too late, give me the choice of three alternatives:
either to return to Mecca; or to face Yazid himself at Damascus; or if
my very presence is distasteful to him and you, I do not wish to cause
more divisions among the Muslims.

Let me at least go to a distant frontier, where, if fighting must be
done, I will fight against the enemies of Islam.” Every one of these
alternatives was refused. What they wanted was to destroy his life, or
better still, to get him to surrender, to surrender to the very forces
against which he was protesting, to declare his adherence to those who
were defying the law of God and man, and to tolerate all the abuses
which were bringing the name of Islam into disgrace.

Of course he did not surrender. But what was he to do? He had no army.
He had reasons to suppose that many of his friends from distant parts
would rally round him, and come and defend him with their swords and
bodies. But time was necessary, and he was not going to gain time by
feigned compliance. He turned a little round to the left, the way that
would have led him to Yazid himself, at Damascus. He camped in the plain
of Karbala’.
