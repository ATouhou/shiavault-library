Infallibility
=============

All Prophets were infallible and free from all defects, sins, and
negligence and forgetfulness in their deeds and sayings from their early
childhood till their death, for if they had committed a sin or a
mistake, they would have lost their position in the hearts of the people
who would not have had confidence in what they said or did. In this way
the benefits of Prophethood would have come to naught. Therefore certain
stories mentioned about them in the Holy Qur'an must be explained away.

The Prophets (peace be on them) must be the best and the most learned
men of their time, for it is absurd to give preference to the inferior
people.
