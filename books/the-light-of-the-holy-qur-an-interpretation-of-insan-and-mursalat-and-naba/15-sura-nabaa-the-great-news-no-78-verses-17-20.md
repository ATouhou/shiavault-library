**Commentary:**

Finally, the Promised Day Will Come.

There were some various evidences for Resurrection referred to in the
previous verses. Here, as a consequence, the first verse says: Verily
the Day of Sorting out is (a day) appointed,.

The phrase /yaum-al-fasl/ 'the Day of Sorting out' is a very meaningful
one which speaks of isolations on that Great Day: The separation of Good
from Evil, the separation of the believing good-doers from disbelieving
sinners, the isolation of parents from child, and brothers from each
other.

The term /miqat/ is based on the term /waqt/ 'time' which means 'The
certain places, where the pilgrims to Kaaba put on their pion appointed
tune'.lgrimage dress, are called /miqat/ because they gather there at an
appointed time.

Then, some of the specialties and the events of that Great Day are
detailed: The Day when the Trumpet shall be blown and you shall come
forth in groups.

It is well understood, from the verses of the Holy Qur'an, that two
great events will happen ...when the Trumpet shall be blown. In the
first incident, the order of the universe becomes disturbed and all the
people, over the earth, and those who are in the heavens will die. In
the second case the world will be renewed, the dead will return to life
and the Resurrection will occur.

The term /nafkh/ means 'blow' and the term sur means 'trumpet' which is
usually sounded for stopping or starting the caravans or troops, and the
people, in them, understand this from its two different sounds whether
they should stop or start.

This is a delicate point referring to those two great events. And what
is said in the above verse, is a hint to the 'second blast', when the
dead are revived and the Resurrection occurs'.

This verse says that on that Day, ...you shall come forth in groups,
while Sura Maryam No. 19, verse 95 says: And every one of them will come
to Him singly on the Day of Judgment and, also, Sura Asra, No. 17, verse
71 says: One day We shall call together all human beings with their
(respective) Imams....

To collect these senses together, we see that 'people being in groups'
is not in contrast with 'every group enters the Resurrection with its
respective Imam'. And ' every one of them will coming singly' is stated
for the reason that there are several stopovers in the Hereafter. People
ay come in groups with their respective leaders; leading or misleading,
at the first halting places, but when they stand before the throne of
Justice, they stand individually, or as Sura Qaf, No.50, verse 21 says:
And there will come forth every soul: with each will be an (angel) to
drive, and an (angel) to bear witness.

It is also probable that they come one by one, because they are
separated from their friends, partners and supporters. Since, in the
Hereafter, everyone is alone with one's own deeds.

And the heaven shall be opened and becomes (wide as) gates.

**What are the meanings of 'be opened' and 'gates'?**

Some commentators have said that it means that the doors of the 'unseen
world' will be opened to the intuition world' where the curtains will be
removed, thus making the world of angels open to the world of Man.(1)

Some others think that this verse points to what is said in other
verses of the Holy Qur'an, such as in sura Inshiqaq, No. 84, verse 1
which says: 'When the Sky is rent asunder', and on another occasion in
relation to the same sense, but using another word it says: When The Sky
is cleft asunder' (Sura Infitar, No. 82, verse 1) .

In fact, there will appear so many clefts in the celestial spheres that
it will seem as if they have changed into open gates.

There is another probability that Man, in the present conditions of
this world, cannot venture through the heavens, and if it were possible
for him to, it would be strictly limited, as if, the present
ircumstances had shut the gates of the skies to him. But, in the
Hereafter. Man will become free from the earthly world and the gate-ways
to the heavens will be opened to him, and then the necessary conditions
will become available.

In other words, on that Day, the skies will be 'cleft asunder' and
after that new skies and earth will be substituted, as Sura Ibrahim, No.
14, verse 48 says: One day the Earth will be changed (into) a different
Earth and so will be the heavens... On this occasion the gates of the
skies are opened for the earthly men to go through and follow their
ways: the righteous go into Heaven whose doors will he opened to them:
...until behold, they arrive there; its gates will be opened; and its
keepers will say: Peace be upon you...'. (Sura Zumar No. 39. verse 73)
.

It is in the same place that angels come to them from every door and
congratulate them: ... and angels shall enter unto them from every gate
(with the salutation) . (Sura Ra'd, No. 13. verse 23) .

And the doors of Hell will he opened to the Unbelievers:
'TheUnbelievers will be led to Hell in crowds: until when they arrive
there, its gates will be opened.... (Sura Zumar, No. 39, verse 71) .

And, thus. Man arrives in a place where the width is as wide as

(1) Al-Mizan, vol. 20, p. 265 (Farsi Translation)

the phenomenal earth and heavens: ...and for a garden whose width is
that (of the whole) of the heavens and of the earth... (Sura
Al-i-'Imran. No. 3, verse 133) .

And finally, the next verse, explaining the events of the Hereafter,
illustrates the status of the mountains and says: And the mountains
shall vanish as if they were a mirage.

As it is understood from all the different verses of the Qur'an about
'the end of the mountains in the Hereafter', that mountains will go
through stages: at first they will move: And the mountains are in
motion, (Sura Tur, No. 52, verse 10) .

Then they will be taken off and crushed: "...and the earth and
mountains are lifted up and crushed with a single blow", (Sura Haqqah,
No. 69. verse 14) .

And after that they will he as a poured heap of sand: ...and the
mountains become a slipping heap of sand,(Sura Muzzmmil, No. 73, verse
14) .

Then, they will change like fibers of teased or carded wool which can
be moved about by the winds: 'And the mountains will be like carded
wool', (Sura Al-Qari'ah, No. 101. verse 5) .

They will turn to dust, then, and scatter about: And the mountains
shall be crumbled to atoms, Becoming dust scattered abroad, (Sura
Waqi'ah, No. 56. Verses 5-6) .

And finally, as the current verse denotes, there will remain only a
trace of them as a mirage.

Thus, mountains will disappear throughout the earth at last, and the
land will be level: They ask you concerning the Mountains: say, My Lord
will uproot them and scatter them as dust; He will leave them as plains
smooth and level, (Sura Ta-ha No. 20, verses 105-106) .

The term /sarab/ is based on the term sarab and means: 'a mirage', a
deceitful appearance as of water in the desert. Then anything that has
an appearance, but is nothing, indeed, is called 'mirage'.

In fact, the mountains will turn into dust and will be scattered in the
air in a state like a mirage. When high solid mountains will have a
destiny like this, the state of other changes in the world and, also,
the state of people of great authority, in this life, will be obvious
there; a mere mirage.

The following question may arise: Do these events happen with the
'first blast', which is the end of this world, or with the 'second
blast', which is the beginning of the Resurrection?

Since the verse "The Day when the trumpet shall be blown and you shall
come forth in groups" certainly relates to the first blast', when people
survive and arrive at the Hereafter in groups, this verse must be
concerned with the same blast, too, but its beginning (the movement of
the mountains) may occur with the first blast' and its end (changing as
a mirage) with the 'second blast'.

There is another probability that all the stages of the mountains
relate to the first blast, however, since the range of these two blasts
are almost close to each other, they are mentioned together, as in some
other verses of the Qur'an. Te events of the first blast are mentioned
with the events of the second blast (as in Sura Takwir and Infitar) .

It is noteworthy that in the former verses mountains were referred to
as 'pegs' and the earth as a 'cradle'; but in these verses it is said
that on the Day when the order of the destruction of this world will be
issued, that cradle will be disturbed and those great pegs will be
leveled and, hence, their tangible matter will become decomposed and
shattered.
