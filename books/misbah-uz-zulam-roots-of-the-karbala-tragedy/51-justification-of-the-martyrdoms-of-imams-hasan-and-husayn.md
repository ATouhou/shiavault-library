Justification Of The Martyrdoms Of Imams Hasan And Husayn
=========================================================

Scholars have written that the Almighty Allah had bestowed every type of
excellence on the Holy Prophet (S), except for the position of
martyrdom. This exception is explained in the way that if he had been
martyred directly, it would have been somewhat disrespectful for his
stature. Therefore, this martyrdom was saved for his sons. In the view
of the writer, this is a defective opinion.

First of all, how can martyrdom be disrespectful to any prophet?
Secondly, if martyrdom is in anyway related to respect, how is it
possible that it should apply to the Prophet but not for his grandsons?
If martyrdom was a cause of disrespect for the Prophet, it should in the
same way for his grandsons. According to the writer, this is not a valid
explanation of the martyrdoms of Imams Hasan and Husayn (a.s.). Because,
the fact seems to be that the martyrdoms of the grandsons was intended
by Allah to prove the veracity of the Holy Quran.

Thus, this martyrdom proved the truthfulness of the claim of the
prophethood of the Holy Prophet (S). Imam Hasan (a.s.) showed to the
whole world the beautiful patience that the Quran has prescribed and
Imam Husayn (a.s.) practically showed all the teachings of the Holy
Quran.

O Allah! Bless Muhammad and the Progeny of Muhammad.
