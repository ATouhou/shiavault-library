Lesson Ten: Three Worthy Things Before God
==========================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"ثَلثُ تَخْرُقُ الْحُجُبَ وَ تَنْتَهِىْ إلَى مَا بَيْنَ يَدَي اللّهِ:
صَرِيْرُ أَقْلامِ الْعُلَمَاءِ، وَ وَطْىُ أَقْدامِ الُْمجَاهِديْنَ، وَ
صَوْتُ مَغازِلِ الُْمحْصَناتِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

There are three things that remove the veils and approach God’s
dignity:[^1]

The sound of the movement of scientists’ pen when writing!

The sound of the paces of warriors in the cause of religion in the
battle field!

The sound of the spinning wheel of chaste women!

Brief Description
-----------------

What a strange and meaningful interpretation! There are three voices
which penetrate into the depths of existence and their vibrations reach
up to the everlasting nature of the world and approach God’s dignity:
voice of knowledge and pen, although it may be low and slow, voice of
holy war and self-sacrifice, and voice of attempt, endeavor and work
although it may be seemingly small.

And actually, these three things, knowledge, holy war, and work
constitute the foundation of an honorable human community.
