Her Policy after Her Father:
============================

During the life of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his descendants),
toleration of the pains for Fatima (peace be upon her) seemed easier but
since the demise of her father to her own death, of about three months,
she faced other policy which was not Islamic.

The policy, after the death of her father, was an illogical and
aggressive policy was “الغايه تبرر الوسيله” [the end justifies the
means]. This is the policy of aggression, setting fire to the door,
inserting Fatima (peace be upon her) between the door and the wall
causing miscarriage for her, breaking her side, slapping her in the face
in order to make Ali (peace be upon him) submit, usurping the Fadak to
impoverish Ali and Fatima (peace be upon her) and as a result impoverish
the whole Muslims.

The policy during Fatima’s life was the policy of pressure, the economic
as well as social pressure, fastening rope around Ali’s neck, keeping
the swords ready over his head and asking him for pledge; assailing
towards Fatima’s home, breaking the honor of the Prophet’s household,
and degrading the rights of the real human beings…. She had been faced
with such a policy, but she continued her campaign and struggles even if
it resulted in her death.
