Slander
=======

As a completion of the subject of backbiting, let us refer to slander,
which means to accuse a believer falsely. It is in fact more serious
than backbiting:

***“One who makes a mistake or commits a sin and ascribes it to an
innocent person, he only burdens himself with slander and a grave sin.
(4:112)”***

The Prophet (S) said: “For him who accuses falsely a male or female
believer or ascribes to them false things, Allah will detain him on a
hill of fire, on the Day of Resurrection, unless he provides justifiable
excuse[^1].”

ir-Ridha)
