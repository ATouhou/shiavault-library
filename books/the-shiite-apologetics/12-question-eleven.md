### What does intercession mean and why do Shiites believe in it?

Answer:
-------

Intercession is one of the definite principles of Islam which, in
compliance with the verses of the Quran and the tradition, has been
accepted by all Islamic sects however disagreed they may be among
themselves concerning its result. What intercession really means is that
an esteemed person, who enjoys proximity to God, asks Him for someones
sins to be forgiven or for a rank to be promoted. The noble Prophet
said, I have been endowed with five divine gifts as well as (the
permission) to intercede, so I saved it on for my Ummah.[1]

Limitations
-----------

In the viewpoint of the Quran, an absolute and unconditional
intercession is rejected; however, intercession may operate

a) if the one who intercedes is close to God and has been permitted. The
Quran says: *They will have no powers of intercession, save the one who
has made a covenant with his Lord. (19:87)*

On that day no intercession avails save the person unto whom the
Compassionate has given leave and whose word He accepts. (20:108)

b) If the person who is interceded for, himself deserves to receive
Divine grace through the interceder, i.e. neither his trust in God nor
his spiritual bond with the interceder is

disrupted. Thus, those disbelieving in God, and some Muslim sinners such
as those who do not perform their prayers and the murderers who lack a
spiritual bond with the interceder, will not be included for
intercession. Referring to those who do not perform their prayers and
those who deny the Day of Resurrection, the Quran says:

*The mediation of no mediators will avail them then. (74:48)*

Then the intercession of interceders shall not profit them, and as
regards the wrongdoers, there will be no friend for the wrongdoers, nor
any interceder who will be heard. (40:18)

The Philosophy of Intercession:
-------------------------------

Like repentance, intercession is a glimpse of hope for those who can,
halfway through their sinful life, repent and follow a worshipful life,
obeying God. A sinner, who realizes that the conditions under which
intercession is possible are limited, not uncategorical, may try to
observe these limitations, and not to violate them.

Results of Intercession:
------------------------

Muslim commentators differ as to the eventuality of intercession; that
is, whether it results in ones sins to be forgiven, or in a rank to be
promoted. However, based on the holy Prophets words who said, My
intercession on the Day of Judgment is for those of my Ummah who have
committed grave sins[1] the first assumption seems clearer.
