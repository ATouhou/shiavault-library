Part 1: On what befell Imam Husayn (a.s.) before Yazid bin Mu’awiyah claimed alle­giance from him, until his Martyrdom
======================================================================================================================

After the death of Imam Hasan (a.s.), a movement came about among the
Shi’ah of Iraq. They wrote a letter to Imam Husayn (a.s.) stating their
intention of deposing Mu’awiyah and their readiness (to support him) and
swearing the allegiance (bay’ah) at his hands. In reply to their letter
Imam Husayn (a.s.) wrote that he disagreed to it because a pact had been
made between them and Mu’awiyah, which would not be violated by them
until the period expired (till Mu’awiyah died), and when Mu’awiyah dies
it would then be decided as to what would be done.

Mu’awiyah died in the middle of the month of Rajab 60 A.H. Yazid wrote a
letter to Waleed bin Utba bin Abu Sufyan, who was appointed the governor
of Madina by Mu’awiyah, to demand the oath of allegiance from Husayn ibn
Ali (a.s.) immediately.
