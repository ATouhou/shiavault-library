Lesson Thirty One: Delight of Forgiveness
=========================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إذا قَدَرْتَ عَلى عَدُوِّكَ فَاجْعَلِ الْعَفْوَ شُكْراً لِلقُدْرَةِ
عَلَيْهِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

When you overcome your enemy, adopt forgiveness and pardon as the
gratitude for this victory.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

In Islam’s view, any favor and grace, without any exception, should be
reciprocated by gratitude. For the gift of empowerment over the enemy,
one expresses gratitude by forgiving the enemy . Victories become rooted
only when enemy’s heart is purged of the spite and the root cause of the
opposition is removed. Pardon will touch their hearts in a way that
yesterday’s enemy becomes today’s friend. It is then that the victory is
truly complete - outwardly and inwardly. Conversely, those who seek
vengeance after victory not only deprive themselves from a great human
virtue, but also endanger their victory.
