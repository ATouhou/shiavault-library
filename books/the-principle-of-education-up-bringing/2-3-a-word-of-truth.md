3. a Word of Truth
==================

Who doesn't know that the children have gigantic obligation, regarding
their parents. What! just one right? Parents have tremendous rights, and
one who does not accept this reality, can not be termed as human being,
what to say that he is a Muslim!

At about twelve locations, the Holy Quran explicitly and emphatically
directed the "sons of Adam" to have an extremely balanced, highly
modular and exemplary attitude towards their parents. In two verses the
instruction is general, one being Surah Ankabu't, the 29th surah, and
the ether Surah Ahqa'f, the 46th surah of the Holy Book. It is
stated:-

And we have ordained upon man, to be humble with his parents.7 And we
had made it obligatory upon Man, that he should deal nicely with his
parents.8 But in Surah Al-Baqarah, the Allah Almighty along with His
worship has made the elegant behaviour with the parents, as a part of
social contract. Therefore in the context of Bani Israel, to all those
who submits (mukallif) to the limits of Allah's sovereignty, this
constitutional reality has been reminded in the following verse,:-

And when we took oath from the sons of Israel, that you should not
worship any one else, except Allah, and should have an elegant behavior
with your parents.9

Similarly in Surah Nis'a the sole Creator while mentioning the Islamic
system of Legislation,along with submission to Him, and the belief of
His Oneness (Tauhi'd), has given priority to the respect of parents and
has guided us in the following way:-

7. Surah Ankabu't, Verse: 8.
8. Surah Ahqa't. Verse: 15
9. Surah Al-Baqarah, Verse: 83

3.Worship Allah, do not make anyone His associate, and serve your
parents in an examplary way.10

In Surah Anna'm, while preventing from idolatory, the need for a better
approach with the parents, has emphasized. And in this verse, the way
adulatory has been declared non statutory (unconstitutional), in the
same context the indecency, of the children towards their parents, has
been annoUnced as contrary to the fundamental beliefs of Islam. It has
been stated:

4."Oh Prophet! tell the people. --- come on: I read out all that to
you, which Allah has declared forbidden (Harn'm). (Firstly) that, do not
associate anyone with Allah, (secondly) that always treat you parents in
an examplary way (never be immoral)".11

Besides this, in the 17th Surah of the Holy Quran, the Ultimate Creator
along with the acceptance of Hiso Oneness (Tauhee'd), has also
considered the examplary dealing of the children with their parents, as
a fundamental issue of religion (Deen). It Is mentioned as follow:-

5.The order of your Creator (Ru'b) is inflexible (definite), that do
not worship any one except Him, and keep on treating your parents in an
examplary manner.12 Further, in Surah Luqman, the prestige of the
parents have attained boundless heights. Therefore regarding the issue
of, obligation of thanks giving to the benefactor,13 Allah 4ias
ordained. "Oh My people! it is not sufficient to be just indebted in My
Grace, but the dignity of My directive and your conscience

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Surah AI-Nis'a, Verse: 36
Surah Al-Aanna'rn, Verse: 152
Surah Bai Israel, Verse: 23

The American Government system is a collection of multiple evils, but
this aspect is quite thought provoking that on the face of the world, it
is the only country where the 'Thanks Giving Day' is officially being
observed. Alas! the people who are willing to sacrifice everything
against the evils of that nation, may atleast include this one good
aspect of that nation, in their lives, Naiafi,

demands, that you should persistently submit before your parents, due
to the services they rendered for you."

Therefore the verse guides us in the following way:-

6.And We have instructed man, for whom his mother bore labours after
labour when she was pregnant, breast fed him, weaned him after two
years, that he should thank Me and along with it, also pay thanks to his
parents. After all everyone has to return to us.14 Then in Surah Mariu'm
at two locations, the quality of being graceful and submissive to
parents or mother, has been regarded as an ideal attribute of the
prophets. Hazrat Yahya-bin-Zakariya and both "father and mother", so
regarding him it is mentioned:

7."Oh Yahya! Holdthis book with steadfastness. We granted him prophet
hood (nabuwa't) while he was a child, and (due to our special Grace)
also blessed him with soft heartedness and chastity (purity), further
that, he himself was pious, and was very obedient to his parents, and he
was not rebellious and disobedient.15 And since Hazrat lssa only had
mother, so in his own words it has been stated:-

8.(while in cradle, lssa as a child) said, "I am an obedient servant of
Allah. He has given me the Book, made me Prophet, where ever, and in
whatsoever condition I may be, He has made me a blessed one. And that,
till I am alive, He has instructed me to offer prayers and pay Zakat
(alms). And that Allah Almighty has made me an "absolute obedient" son
of my mother,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
14. Surah Luqmari, Verse: 14
15. Surah Mariu'm, Verse: 12 - 14

further that, He has safe-guarded me from being violent and unlucky."16
Moreover while mentioning the details of those people who could be
considered deserving for monetary support, the Holy Quran gives top
priority to the economic service to the parents. It is mentioned:

9."Oh Prophet! People inquire from you as to what and how they should
spend? Tell them that whatsoever you should spend for prosperity should
be distributed amongst your parents, relatives, orphans, needy and
strangers (wanderers). And whatever good deed you would perform, Allah
will know about it.17

The way Hazrat Nu'h expresses his involuntary love and respect for his
parents, in the same manner it has become the part of the Holy Quran. It
is mentioned:-

10. "Oh Allah! Grant a place in your Grace, for me and my parents."18
Then let us witness the friend of Allah, Hazrat lbrahi'm (ASWS)! See
with what devotion, is he supplicating before Allah:- 11."Oh Our
Nourisher! On the Day of Judgement, bless me, my parents, and all the
pious persons (momi'ns), with Your forgiveness."19

It all does not end up here! But regarding the elegance in behaviour
and obedience towards the parents, the Holy Quran has mentioned many
other practical standards and factual realities, which manifests deep in
one's self. Moreover the explanation and interpretation communicated to
us by those personalities, who understood the Quranic view point and are
a guide of humanity, widely opens our insight, and all the rights of the
parents and our

A1-Baqarah. Verse: 215

obligations regarding them, gets deep embedded in the conscience of
every wise individual. Note the instructions given to us, in the
following verses of Surah Bani-lsrael: -

12."When either of your father or mother gets old, then do not dare to
think of scolding them (on their anger) and do not even sound Aah! and
even if you have to say something, then present it with utmost courtesy
tenderness and respect. Keep yourself submissive in front of them. And
that, supplicate for them in the following manner, Oh Allah! the way
they borne us (with complete sacrifices), (as it's reward) You too
should bless them a place of peace (and tranquil) in Your Grace."2O

In this regards, Sadiq-e-Ale-Muhammed lmam Jaffer-e-Sadiq and the
eighth Imam Hazrat lmam Riza(ASWS) says:

"To prevent the parents from any grief from their children, had their
been any other concise and more comprehensive word than "Aah!", then the
same would have been revealed in the Holy Quran, through the Divine
revelation (Vahi)."21 While explaining the meaning and purpose of the
Quranic Verse; () 22

the Sadiq-e-Ale Muhammed (SAWS) has stated:-

"That is! never gaze or cast a frowny look towards the parents, but
whenever you look towards them, it should be felt that as if you have
bloomed roses of love and affection in their lapse. Be cautious! that
your tone should never be above their voice. Your hands never higher
then

Regarding respect and honour, lmam Muhammed Baqir(ASWS) says: - "Once on
a way, my grand father lmam Zain-ul-Abi'dee'n saw a father and son going
some where together, but the style was, that while walking the son was
hanging over the shoulder of his father. lmam Muhammed Baqar said that:
My father was so much dejected to see this indecent act, that he never
spoke with him for the rest of his life. "24 Further, Baqar-A1-U'loom
Hazrat lmam Muhammed Baqar(ASWS) has stated, that once the Last
Prophet(SAWAW) was inquired:-

"Who has the highest priority of right on a man? He replied: "the
parents right rank highest" 25

Besides to above, let us now dwell a while upon the importance and
significance of the following words uttered by the Prophet, who
(according to Holy Quran) uttered nothing except what was ordained upon
him through the Divine revelation. May be, it glitters the mirror of our
luck:

"The Holy Prophet(SAWAW) has said: if a child casts an eye of love upon
his parents, this vision turns into divine w5rship (ibadat). "26

"If the parents of some person, are prodigal (extravagant) towards him,
and his reaction of this maltreatment is that he castes an eye of anger
upon his parents, then Allah Almighty would not accept his prayers
(namaz) "27 And the following commandment of the Holy Prophet(SAWAW)
should always be borne in mind:- "The will of Allah is merged with the
will of the parents, and His rage, is concealed in the rage and anger of
the parents". 28

And finally in the end, let us mention an extremely thought provoking
message of Sadiq-e-Ale Muhammad for the "coming generation". He says:-

"You should set up the "tradition" of obedience . towards your parents.
Your children would continue 29. displaying obedience towards you!"

**4. And Now about duties**

The way the parents have a number of rights upon their children,
similarly they have some "duties" concerning their children. And in
"Quran and Surah (traditions of Prophet and lmams)" there is a
magnanimous treasure regarding this, which enlightens the thinking and
conscience.

Children are a great blessing of Almighty Allah, for which we should
always remain highly obliged to Him. but be cautious! the meaning of
gratitude is not just that we verbally keep on uttering the word of
"thanks" all along our lives, and that is all! The purpose of "the
recognition of grace" in Islam is that, whatsoever favour Allah Almighty
has bestowed upon us, we should do full justice with it. In relation to
it, we should keep our attitude flawless, so that in accordance with the
promise of Allah, He keeps on extending His Blessings upon us, with
regards to each thanksgiving. 30

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
Witness the Allah's Gracel When after a long spell; consecutively two
roses bloomed in the family of Hazrat Ibrahim Khalil-ullah!

Under such conditions, the common practice is that the children are
borne with extreme care and Extraordinary affection! And the minimum
list of expectation is expressed in this verse:

Health, Happiness, and Good fortune, Abundant grandeur, Enormous
property (land), and long life.

But Hazrat lbrahim who in a blink, had uprooted the hundreds of year
old Calesdient culture, had trampled the politics of the boastful,
ferocious, and proud man like Namrood, and moreover whose examplary
style of guidance provided a new enlightenment for mankind, and
originated a completely new innovative style in thinking; knew very
well, his responsibilities

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
30. It is a promise of Allah that, "If you pay gratitude, then We would
extend our blessings, but if you are ungrateful, then My punishment is
extremely severe, - --Surah lbrahirn, Verse: 7.

regarding the upbringing and modelling of his children, and along with
paying gratitude for His blessings, knew what to initially demand from
his Nourisher, and what to request at a later stage! In these words, The
Holy Quran expresses the feelings, impression, desires and the
supplication of Khalil-e-Khuda:-

First verse:

"I praise Allah, who at this old age has blessed me with (the sons
like) lsmail and lshaq, and there is no doubt in it, that my Nourisher
definitely complies to the supplication."31 Second Verse:

"Oh Creator! I have settled some of my children in a waterless
(infertile) and barren valley, near Your distinguished House. Oh my
Nourisher! all this has been done so that they may live under the aegis
of Your House, establish the system of prayer (Namaz). Therefore it is
requested that, (You Please) mould the hearts of the people towards
them, and bless them with subsistence, so that they may keep on paying
gratitude to."

Come on! Let us now start examining our duties. In this regards our
first obligation is, that we should provide our children with complete
protection (security). Pay attention towards their intellectual
training, along with physical development, so that in this world there
is a continual growth in men of qualities.

At this stage someone might think as to what is the good idea behind
discussing the significance Of caring for the children? In this world,
whether it may be the civilized or the primitive society, everyone love
their dear ones! Yes it is true....! But what to do, when if ha~ been a
common experience that due to the social differential, economic tussle,
sense of deprivation, lack-bf self confidence, unawareness from
religion, and above all, the


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
31. Surah Ibrahim, Verse: 39
32. Surah lbrahim, Verse: 37.

indifferent attitude towards Allah, sometimes intentionally, or
unintentionally, people sacrifice their children yes, I stress again,
their children for political, social, and economic expedience, or at
occasions slaughter them at the alter of their egoistic desires.

However there do exist some difference in approach, between the
culturally conscious and in undeveloped societies, but these minute
differences or variances are not something fundamental, they are just
superficial. Due to the divergence in environmental conditions and
style, the approach differs. And that is all! For example, in the era of
darkness, i.e the pre-lslamic period, the dwellers of the Arabian
Peninsula, had extremely poor economy, and mainly due to economic
frustration, would kill their children, and sometimes for the
fulfillment of their desires, would slaughter them in the alter of their
idols!

The Holy Quran, while forbidding such act of "the slaughter of Sons and
daughters", terms it as a grave crime. Note the eloquence of Quran, that
along with the instructions for it's forbiddance, just in two words, it
reveal the old history, the customs and traditions of the Arabs, and the
real motive behind the intent of this men slaughter!

Allah Almighty says:

"Do not slaughter your children due to the fear of Poverty and paucity,
because We provide subsistence to you and as well as to them."33 Further
there is a verse in Surah Bani Israel:

"You should not slaughter your children due to the fear of destitution.
We are the one who provide subsistence to them, and also to you. Believe
it! to slaughter them is a grievous crime!"34 Did you notice that the
real motive behind this illegitimate murder, and loss of these petty
innocent lives, was nothing but the fear of "adversities and loss"? If
there would be children, from


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
33. Surah Ana'm, Verse: 152
34. Surah Bani Is~ail Verse: 31

where would they eat? and the lesser be their number , more would be
the savings in bread and butter!

Therefore to stop them from such mal-practices of brutality and
ferocity, they were told that the reasons of your ill luck is not
associated with the fortunes of these children. Note the words "the way
we are sustaining you, similarly we are responsible for the provision of
subsistence for your progeny (children)".

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Well the baseless notion regarding Arabs, which has gained popularity
is that, during the age of ignorance they only used to slaughter, their
daughters due to zealot and the concerns regarding the unbearable
economic burden, needs to be clarified, and also that in that society
the sons were considered as a gift of Allah!

The fact is that in the verses which prohibits the slaughter of
children, the word progeny (au'lad) is being used,which according to the
"current language" bears the meaning of both the boy and girl. That is
why the Greatest exegesist of our times Allama Sayed Muhammad Hussain
Tabataba'i has explained it in the following manner:

'In this verse and in other verses on the same topic the slaughter of
progeny from fear of poverty and destitution has been prohibited, and
because the word progeny is more generalized, so their is no reason
whatsoever to accept that this word is Only meant for girls."35

Besides this, the old history of the Arabs also reveals the same. For
reference we have a number of sources, and especially the two popular
works of this century, i.e. Sera't A1-Nabi'. VoI:6, page 229, which has
been compiled by Allama Syed Salman Nadavi, and the scholarly works of
Dr. Hussain Ha'j Hasan, Naqad Al-Hadi'th. In both of them they have at
length commented upon the economic conditions of the Arabs of the
Arabian Peninsula, regarding their culture and customs, and it
complements our stand.


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
35. Al-Miz'an fi Tafseer Al-Quran, Vol: 13, Page 85, Beruit.

The truth is, that those Arabs who were comparatively well off, had
cultivatable lands, animal rearing, home industry, and piracy etc, used
to breed (raise) Sons as a means of personnel power, but like most of
the other areas of the world, the majority of their population was
starving and poverty stricken.

Therefore the masses who were completely indigent (empty handed),
thought that since it is even difficult to sustain the relation of life
and bread for themselves, how can they bear the burden of their
children? Well, of course! the children are a source of satisfaction of
their heart and consolence for soul, but when it was "a matter of self
survival and existence" they were willing to give them up. Therefore in
the eradicating vision of insolvency, in utter be wilderness they
preferred to build the graves of their alive innocent children.

While referring to their intellectual bankruptcy and brutality the Holy
Quran mentions:

"Certainly those people remained in (total) loss,
who due to their ignorance and unawareness,
without any deliberation slaughtered their children. "36
Whereas the Islamic code of life, ascertains the sons of Adam: -

"There is no living creature on the face of Earth,
whose subsistence in not due upon Allah".37
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Well as far as the issue of depriving the girls from their right of
life is concern, we can term it as an involute egoistic craze of the
poverty striken Arabs of the age of ignorance. The Holy Quran, while
explaining the "psychology and approach" of these nomads, mentions:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
36. Surah Ana'rn Verse: 140
37 Surah Hu'd, Verse: 6.

"When someone of them was informed that to him a female baby has been
born to him, his face would turn pale, the eyes frown out with anger,
and then due to this dreadful news, would try to conceal himself from
his clan, and kept on thinking either he keep his daughter alive and
live in disgrace, or buries her alive? See, what an evil decision they
used to take."38

Also in Surah Takvi'r there is a mention regarding this ruthless
custom, which in the Arab society, was called va'd. The Islamic code of
life has termed it as the most barbaric tradition. It is mentioned:-

And when the girl who was buried alive would be questioned, as to what
was her crime that she was so deprived from her life."39 The mood of the
expression tells, that at the time of decision, the murdered would be
questioned instead of the murderer. As the poetic verse expresses:

Due to what sin did this brutality befell upon us? that is, the cruelty
of the brutal is proved, only the details of the story and the happening
from the innocent's viewpoint needs narration! Yes, all that would take
place on the Day of Judgment. Nothing would remain concealed, no action
would remain veiled! and how is it possible, when it is a question of
the disgrace of a human blood? As a poetic verse says:

"If the guilty would conceal his crime, the blood spots will themselves
reveal the truth!" Now, if someone asks, to forget about this dreadful
story! and argues that, it is a tale of the olden times; it was the
temperament of the dreadful desert inhibited Arabs, their miserable
environment and conditions, at that time all was quiet different, which
has no bearing with anything else. Well, this preposition is to some
extent true, but however both in the old


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
38 Surah Naha,'l, verse:58-59
39 Surah Takvi'r, Verse:8-9

and the modern societies the in-built lust for economic supersession
and social status is all the same! Till date, there has been no
difference in this attitude. Though the history has trotted on quiet a
long distance, but still the desire for boundless prosperity, and higher
status, has not changed. However, the only difference in the man, of the
olden periods and that of today is, that in the past he used to burry
his child alive, to support his economic well being, and to boast of
being prestigious in their society!

While in the "twilight of the present era", captivated by the gloss of
modern culture and civilization, the man does not commit "murder by
intent", by depriving his child from life! But, from the "outlook" of
the Islamic code of life, even now he willfully buries his beloved, the
hope of the future, in the mausoleum of mental and intellectual
annihilation!

\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*
What I intend to say is, that we fail to give our children the faintest
concept of the religious life, and with utmost confidence, willfully
hand-over these pious souls to such agencies, whose managers and
operators have yet to evolve an interest in understanding the Quranic
spirit!

The natural outcome of this 'situation is, that these unbloom buds and
half smiled roses of our lives, after passing their preliminary stages
in institutions like, kindergarten, nursery, montessori, preparatory,
convent or vernacular school, cross over to the western styled
universities, and start trotting along their practical lives, and
according to their capabilities and situations at hand, acquire the
places and positions of eminent bureaucrates, renowned technocrates,

excelling businessman, famous jurists competent doctor, expert
journalists learned educationists polished politicians, and well groomed
soldiers, but as a "believer of Allah" are completely incompetent of
meeting the collective needs of their society, because none of them ever
had a chance of fulfilling the requisites to develop into a well
informed, trustworthy Muslim! The fact is, that in accordance with the
basic environmental and educational (i.e. institutional) framework
provided, their brains got adapted accordingly to the given conditions!
and got accustomed to the prefabricated structure that they found. Thus,
what else could we expect as a result of their efforts to the future
"flowers" that would bloom and the "colours that would shape?

The height of plight is that even on knowing, that all this is the
outcome of our Western oriented society, and the non-Islamic styled
universities, we still have no aptitude towards the changing of our
present system of education, therefore the question to modify the
"philosophy of education", is a task of high dexterity.

Therefore, the only alternative left over is, to have an Islamic
environment right at our homes and in this regards to pay special
attention towards the temperaments, habits, approach, and spirits of our
elders, that it should be Islamic. Because the first environment which
affects the brain of a child is his home, and every deed and action of
the family member continuously and persistently keep on engraving its
carvings upon his lucid mind and brain.

So with full sincerity of truth and conscience, and keeping in view the
stated facts, we should fully prepare ourselves to undertake this
gigantic task of "educating our children". Even before we start it's
first stage, everyone of us must well understand the fact that there is
no difference between the "Pre-lslamic dark age" and the "age of
ignorance" of the twentieth century.

" Alas, all the heritage, of knowledge and wisdom, culture and
awareness, which we received from the Book of Allah, the Prophet of
Allah, and His (SAWAW) infallible progeny, has been placed in the dark
storages of obliviousness! and that is why we are neither left over with
anything which could be termed as the original Islamic civilization nor
culture. How appealingly has Mirza Ghalib put it in his following
verse:- literal meaning:

Even the pleasures of meeting or the rememberence of the beloved, is
not being leftover.
Such a fire overtook this house that, whatsoever was their, was burnt
to ashes.


Then is the determination of the aims and objectives of the
"educaticin", necessarily followed by the steadfastness to achieve the
objectives. We have to totally commit by our deeds and actions, that we
are resolute in making our children Muslims, so that their lives are
full of the blessings of Islamic life. They could easily reach the real
destiny and right objective of life, and feel satisfied on achieving
it.

Their thinking balanced, their hearts contended. By being an honest and
subtle servants of Allah, they should not only be a symbol, for their
homes, families and surroundings, but due to their high standards,
spotless character, decent attitudes. magnificent traditions and
legends, could successfully pass on their beneficial experiences
elegantly to the coming generations.

Now to tread along this surmountable path, we have to thoroughly
understand all the instructions, present in the Islamic wealth of
guidance, and in the wise and thought provoking sayings of the leaders
of this school, so that such a change manifest in our approach, that
wherever we cast our eyes, the thorny path turn into a bed of roses, and
every stone on our way, prove to be a milestone towards our destiny!

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
Oh well, I remembered!

We should have had at first explained the concept of "rights" and
'duties". Well, still their is time. Neither have we gone too far, nor
it is still too late. Well, rights are not just the progerative of the
elders, or duties just obligatory upon the youngsters. The factual
position is, that everything in this universe bears a relation with man.
It may be the decor of the earth, or the illumination of the skies, all
is for man and man alone:-

"It is He who has created for you, all that exists on the earth."40 Now
in this world of existence, when, we are the' only ones blessed with all
the assets of spirit and liveliness, from the

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
40. Surah A1-Baqarah, Verse: 29

fragrance of a rose to the sweet melodies of the nightingale, then
everyone of us needs to observe with a healthy mind and far sightedness
of wisdom, that a thing created for a purpose ought to be utilized for
the same. Moreover such an healthy and progressive environment be
created for the beneficial species and genus of the world, that they
have the security of existence and the guarantee for development and
progress.

Well that was all about it, i.e. every advantageous creation be
protected, this is it's "right". And anyone having rapport with it,
should compulsorily provide protection to it, this is his "duty". It
needs to be noted that the scholars of modern times, who are authority
on this subject, consider "rights and duties" to be only related to
social life.

But may Allah bestow upon His special benevolence upon Dr. Khawaja
Ghulam As-Sayadden, that He writes :-

The domain of ethics is even much wider than what exists between man
and man. The oriental scholars of ethics have divided these rights into
three parts, to which every person is responsible:-

First, Obligations to Allah, i.e. those rights which the Creator has
upon His creation, and without it's recognition and fulfillment them,
the man cannot understand his complete reality. Secondly: Obligations to
fellow human beings, i.e. those obligations which are due on us because
of our fellow species, and because of which all human beings are
mutually linked with each other.

Thirdly:

own soul. Obligation to our souls, i.e. those obligations which are due
on us because of our It's a moral obligation on man to honestly adhere
in fulfilling these three types of obligations.41

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
41. 'Usool-e-Talee'm Page: 388, Second Edition, Delhi

Besides mentioning the depth and details and significance of the rights
and duties.Islam has also arranged them in accordance with the degree of
closeness, relationships, feelings, perception and traditions. It has
graded them, and then in an extremely organized way, has presented them
to the world.

In this context the first ever guidance to mankind, on "the rights and
duties" regarding taking a step or it's abstention, and the relations
and associations in all the aspects of life, has been provided in the
Charter of guidance "Risa'la-e-Huqooq", by the minaret of guidance and
the elegance of divine submission Hazrat lmam Zain-ul-Abedee'n (ASWS)
(38-95 A.H.):

Memoir: From prayer and submission to the Creator of the soul and
universe, to the protection of body and soul; and from economy and
civics to the issues of state and politics, the Honourable Imam In this
first charter for the world, consisting of fifty articles, has conveyed
to us in profound depth and detail, all the types and kinds of "rights
and duties", to the human intellect.

It could be referred to, in the masterpiece works, titled Tuhf Alaqu'l
un Ale ar-Rasool (published in Beirut) page 184-198 of the renowned
researcher of the fourth century the Grand Shaykh Abu Muhammad Hasan bin
Shaba'h Hur'rani.

Further, it could also be referred to in the renowned publication
al-Ama'li of the Ra'is al- Muhaddaseen Abu Jaffer Muhammad lbne Babuiya
Al-Sadooqh (may Allah bless his soul). (for reference see page 301-306
al-Ama'li published in Beirut), and is also present in other books of
Sadooqh, as Alkhisa'I, vol 2, page 126; and in the basic collection of
traditions, Man'la Yahzurb aI-Faqih, page 233.

Concluding, after the explanation and commentary on the rights and
duties it is repeatedly stated that, as a number of rights of the
parents are due upon the children and their fulfillment is obligatory
upon them, so are a number of rights of the children for which the
"parents" are responsible, and their fulfillment is obligatory upon them
too. Let us now probe into them, in more details.
