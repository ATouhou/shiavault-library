Story no. 75: Disagreement of the children.
===========================================

Kiya was very unhappy, because he had lost his father and his mother had
re-married. The man, too, had lost his wife and had brought along with
him his two children, Sadiq and Qasim.  
 The man and woman were both choiceless in the matters of their
marriage, but the only cause of disagreement was the children. Kiya used
to think that if he wouldn’t have lost his father, he wouldn’t have been
caught in this situation, and Qasim and Sadiq thought that if their
mother would not be dead, they wouldn’t have to go in another house, and
meet a step brother. Their disagreement made their father and mother
unhappy.  
 Till one day, Qasim, who was the oldest of the three, gathered the
other boys and said “Although we were strangers yesterday, today we are
of the same family. Kiya’s mother is our mother, and our father the
father of all of us.So how good if we be kind to each other”.he
finished.  
 After that, he went out and bought some ice cream and divided it
between them.  
 Kiya, whenever went out, would bring sweets and whenever Sadiq returned
from school he bought a pen for each one of them.
