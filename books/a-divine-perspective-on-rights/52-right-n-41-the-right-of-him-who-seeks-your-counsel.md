***And the right of him who seeks your counsel is that you should give
him your counsel as much as you think he can bear. And you should talk
with him with such gentle words that he listens to you and you should
use such words that his intellect can understand. This is because for
each person’s intellect there is a certain way of talking that he can
comprehend and respond to. You should choose having mercy as your course
of action. And there is no power but in God.***

In short, Imam Sajjad states that one who seeks counsel has the right to
be advised as much as he can bear to hear. Advice should be given gently
to help the listener accept it. One should also be kind when giving
someone some advice. Giving counsel and wishing well are among the
important topics stressed in Islam. The Qur’an has stressed that the
Divine Prophets are social counselors. We read in the Chapter A\`raaf of
the Holy Qur’an that the Prophets give advice to people:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أُبَلِّغُكُمْ رِسَالاَتِ رَبِّي وَأَنصَحُ لَكُمْ وَأَعْلَمُ مِنَ
اللّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“I but fulfill towards you the duties of my Lord's mission: Sincere
is my advice to you, and I know from God something that ye know not.”
[The Holy Qur’an, al-A\`raaf 7:62]***

Prophets as Advisors
--------------------

The Prophet Noah said the following to his nation:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أُبَلِّغُكُمْ رِسَالاَتِ رَبِّي وَأَنصَحُ لَكُمْ وَأَعْلَمُ مِنَ
اللّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“I but fulfill towards you the duties of my Lord's mission: Sincere
is my advice to you, and I know from God something that ye know not.”
[The Holy Qur’an, al-A\`raaf 7:62]***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَتَوَلَّى عَنْهُمْ وَقَالَ يَا قَوْمِ لَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ رِسَالَةَ
رَبِّي وَنَصَحْتُ لَكُمْ وَلَكِن لاَّ تُحِبُّونَ النَّاصِحِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***So Salih left them, saying: “O my people! I did indeed convey to you
the message for which I was sent by my Lord: I gave you good counsel,
but ye love not good counselors!” [The Holy Qur’an, al-A\`raaf 7:79]***

The Qur’an says the following regarding the Prophet Shu’aib :

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَتَوَلَّى عَنْهُمْ وَقَالَ يَا قَوْمِ لَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ
رِسَالاَتِ رَبِّي وَنَصَحْتُ لَكُمْ فَكَيْفَ آسَى عَلَى قَوْمٍ
كَافِرِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***So Shu'aib left them, saying: “O my people! I did indeed convey to
you the messages for which I was sent by my Lord: I gave you good
counsel, but how shall I lament over a people who refuse to believe!”
[The Holy Qur’an, al-A\`raaf 7:93]***

All the Prophets of God were advisors to their nations. All men
naturally welcome being advised except those who have lost their purely
divine nature. Such people did not pay any attention to the Prophets and
were thus seized by a severe punishment. It is interesting to note that
even Satan uses giving advice as a means of fooling people. We read in
the following verse of the Holy Qur’an about Satan’s swearing to Adam
and Eve that he is their sincere advisor:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَقَاسَمَهُمَا إِنِّي لَكُمَا لَمِنَ النَّاصِحِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And he swore to them both, that he was their sincere advisor.” [The
Holy Qur’an, al-A\`raaf 7:21]***

Thus, we should realize that our enemies might sometimes approach us as
friends giving us advice in order to corrupt us. We learned that the
Prophets were advisors to their nations. There are several traditions
from the Immaculate Imams , which state that believers are also each
other’s advisors.

Believers Advise Each Other
---------------------------

There is a chapter in *Usul al-Kafi* on “Believer’s Advice.” Imam Sadiq
said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يجِبُ لِلمُؤمِنِ عَلى المُؤمِنِ أنْ يُناصِحَهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“It is incumbent upon a believer to give sincere counsel to a(nother)
believer.”*[^1]

The late Allameh Majlisi said in his book Mir’at al-Uqool: “What is
meant by advice is guiding them to improve their religious and worldly
affairs, and training the ignorant people to fend off harm from them and
bring them some benefits. If they do not accept your advice, you have
shown your good intentions by advising them to do good deeds and refrain
from evil acts.” The Noble Prophet of God said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لِينْصَحِ الرَّجُلُ مِنكُم أخاهُ كَنصِيحَتِهِ لِنَفسِهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Each of you should give sincere advice to your brethren just as you
give sincere advice to yourselves.”*[^2]

Advisors Are the Best of the People
-----------------------------------

Imam Sadiq quoted on the authority of God’s Prophet :

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ أعْظَمَ النّاسِ مَنْزِلَةً عِندَ اللهِ يَومَ القِيامَةِ أمشَاهُم
في أرْضِهِ بِالنَّصِيحَةِ لخَلقِهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The people of the highest rank near God on the Resurrection Day are
those who were the most active on His earth in counseling His
creatures.”*[^3]

This implies exerting efforts to advise the people and to improve their
conditions. Sufyan ibn Uyaynah narrated that he heard Imam Sadiq say:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَلَيكُم بالنُّصْحِ للهِ في خَلقِهِ فَلنْ تلقاهُ لِعَمَلٍ أفْضَلُ
مِنهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“It is prescribed for you to advise the people for the sake of God. You
will not find any better deed than this.”*[^4]

We see that advice given sincerely for God’s sake is highly valued, not
advice intended to corrupt the people or out of deceit or financial
expectations. There is no reward but deprivation for such advice. The
Noble Prophet of Islam delivered a sermon in Mina and said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ثَلاثٌ لا يَغِلُّ عَليْهِنَّ قَلبُ أمْرئٍ مُسلِمٍ: إخلاصُ العَمَلِ
للهِ وَالنَّصيحَةُ لأئِمَّةِ المُسلِمينَ وَاللّزُومُ لجَماعَتِهِم.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Three things for which a Muslim’s heart should have no malice: sincere
deeds for God, sincere advice and desiring what is good for the Imams of
the Muslims, and adhering to their community.”* [^5]

We note the importance of doing things for the sake of God, and the need
of the leaders to be advised mentioned by the Prophet in this tradition.

How to Advise
-------------

We learned that advice should be given for the sake of God to be
effective. It should also be as much as one being advised can accept. We
cannot advise people in any way we want. We must learn how to advise,
how to express our advice and how to influence the person being advised.
Imam Sajjad said: “You are not free to say whatever you wish, since the
Prophet of God has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
رَحِمَ اللهُ عَبداً قَالَ خَيراً فَغَنِمَ أو صَمَتَ فَسَلِمَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“May God have mercy on the servant who speaks well and benefits, or is
silent and remains secure.”*[^6]

Imam Ali said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إيّاكَ وَالكلامَ فيما لا تَعرِفُ طَريقَتَهُ وَلا تَعْلَمُ حَقيقَتَهُ،
فإنَّ قَولَكَ يَدُلُّ عَلى عَقلِكَ وَعِبارَتُكَ تُنبِئ عَن
مَعرِفَتِكَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Refrain from speaking about what you do not know how to do, and do not
know the truth about it. What you say is a sign of your intellect, and
your words inform others of the degree of your knowledge and
recognition.”*[^7]

One of the key elements in good advice is in its not being boring. Imam
Ali said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أحْسَنُ الكَلامِ ما لا تمِجُّهُ الآذانُ ولا يَتعَبُ فَهْمَهُ الأفهامُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“The best speech is that which the ears do not eject (through
forgetfulness), and the understanding of which does not fatigue the
intellect.”*[^8]

This has been expressed as one of the rights of him who seeks your
counsel by Imam Sajjad : “And you should talk with him in such gentle
words that he listens to you and you should use such words that his
intellect can understand.”

The Noble Prophet also said: “We the Prophets are appointed to talk to
the people according to their level of intellect.” Imam Sajjad advises
us to use mercy in dealing with the people we advise, and not use force,
frightening or threatening. This is because such acts have no influence
on the person being advised.

Mansour Seeking Advice from Imam Sadiq
--------------------------------------

Mansour, the Abbasid caliph, attempted to invite Imam Sadiq to his court
in order to claim to be a just ruler. He sent Imam Sadiq the following
message: “Why do you not associate with us in our court as other people
do?” He thought that the Imam would fear his might. But the Imam
replied: “O’ Mansour! We have nothing of this world for which to fear
you, and find nothing of the Hereafter near you to put any hopes in.
What is the benefit of my associating with you?”

Mansour felt bad receiving this response and sent another message
saying: “Then come associate with us to give us some advice.” Imam Sadiq
sent him the following response: “O’ Mansour! Whoever seeks (the
blessings) of this world would not advise you, and whoever seeks the
Hereafter would not associate with you,.”[^9]
