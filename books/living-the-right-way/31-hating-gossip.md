Hating Gossip
=============

One of the worst of actions is gossiping which is severely prohibited in
Islam. It sometimes causes social conflict and disorder among people.

The Holy Prophet Muhammad (S) said to his companions: *“Shall I not
inform you of the worst among you?’”* They said: “Yes, O Messenger of
Allah.” He said: *“Those who go to and fro bearing tales, who cause
separation between friends and who seek deficiencies in those who are
sound.”*

He (S) also said: *“The worst of people are those who hate the believers
and the believers in their hearts hate them, who go to and fro bearing
tales, who cause separation between friends and who seek deficiencies in
those who are sound. Allah will not look at them on the Day of
Resurrection and will not purify them.”*

He (S) also said: *“The talebearer will not enter paradise.”*

He (S) also said: *“The talebearer will not be relieved from the
punishment of Allah in the hereafter.”*

He (S) also said in his speech about the forbidden things that one
should not gossip nor should one listen to talebearers.

Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (a.s.) said: *“Murderers, habitual drunkards and
those who go to and fro bearing tales will not enter paradise.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“Paradise is forbidden for three kinds of people:
the talebearer, the habitual drunkard and the tame cuckold.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“Four kinds of people will not enter paradise: the
soothsayer, the hypocrite, the habitual drunkard and the talebearer.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“Surely the talebearer is a raise witness and a
companion of Satan in muting corruption among people.”*
