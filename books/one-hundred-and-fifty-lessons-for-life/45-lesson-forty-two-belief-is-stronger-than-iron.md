Lesson Forty Two: Belief is Stronger than Iron
==============================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ الْمُؤْمِنَ أَشَدُّ مِنْ زُبُرِ الْحَدِيْدِ إنَّ زُبُرَ
الْحَدِيْدِ إِذْا أُدْخِلَ النّارَ تَغَيَّرَ وَ إنَّ الْمُؤْمِنَ لَوْ
قُتِلَ ثُمَّ نُشِرَ ثُمَّ قُتِلَ لَمْ يَتَغَيَّرْ قَلْبُهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The believers are stronger than iron parts because when iron is exposed
to fire, it changes, but if the believers are killed and then revived
and again killed, there would be no change in their mentalities.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Life is a series of problems and complicated matters. Weak people
surrender to them very soon and escape from the field, whereas those who
are strong on account of their belief stand firm to tackle the
challenges.

They know that there will always be hindrances in complying with God’s
command, abstaining from sin, and achieving honors and credits. They
realize that self-control, self-sacrifice and resistance against
rebellious desires is required in order to succeed. True belief gives
them immense strength to continue their endeavor fearlessly in the path
of religion.
