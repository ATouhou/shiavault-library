The Medina before Getting the News about the Demise of Imam Hussain (Q)
=======================================================================

Indeed some of the relatives and friends of the Prophet (P) were aware
of the destiny of Imam Hussain (Q) in general, and that is through what
they had heard from the Prophet (P) directly or indirectly. Even though
they had missed the great victory and did not fulfill their duty in
supporting the son of their Prophetâ€™s daughter (Q), but this did not
stop them from living in a situation full of fear and worries while
being watchful for the coming events.
