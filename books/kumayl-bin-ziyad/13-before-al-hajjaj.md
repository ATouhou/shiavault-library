Before Al-Hajjaj
================

Kumayl's face was bright. His beard was white. His heart was certain.

Kumayl came into al-Hajjaj's palace. He saw al-Hajjaj sitting and his
guards standing around him. He saw a headsman carrying a sword.

Kumayl knew that al-Hajjaj would kill him, for Imam Ali had told him
about that.

Paying no attention to al-Hajjaj, Kumayl said:

*My master, Imam Ali [a] has told me that you will kill me. Allah's
enemy, do whatever you like! And know that Judgement Day will be after
killing.*

Al-Hajjaj said:

*Disown Ali to save your soul.*

Kumayl said:

*Show me a religion better than Ali's.*

Al-Hajjaj ordered the headsman to behead Kumayl.
