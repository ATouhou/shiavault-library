Lecture 3: The Culture of the Muslims in India
==============================================

 

*A lecture delivered at the Anthropology Department University* *of
California Santa Cruz, on Thursday, 29th October, 1987*

   
 As Professor Pandya has told you, I am supposed to speak on the Muslim
Culture in India. Although I know about religion, I do not know much
about culture. Therefore, whatever I will say, will be based not on book
knowledge, but on personal experience and observation.
