Lesson Thirteen: Fire of Anger
==============================

Imam Baqir (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إنَّ هَذا الْغَضَبَ جَمْرَةٌ مِنَ الشَّيْطانِ تُوْقَدُ فِى قَلْبِ
ابْنِ آدَمَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Anger and wrath are the burning flame of fire which is kindled inside
man’s heart by Satan.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

When an angry man performs something or makes a decision, in most cases
he will later regret and feel sorry because a burning fire of anger
causes him to disregard his wisdom and intellect. The nervous system and
muscles may cause him to inflict irreversible damage.

We should control and extinguish this satanic flame with utmost
precision and speed. Once anger turns into uncontrollable rage, it would
be too late to prevent it from burning and ruining our lives and those
of others.
