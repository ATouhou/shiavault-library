The Position of the Messenger of God With Respect To the Future of Islam
========================================================================

**( 19 )**

Lesson Two
----------

The Most Noble Messenger peace and blessings be upon him  
 and his family was well aware that after he had departed for  
 the proximity of his Exalted Lord the community would lose  
 its unifying foundation fall into a whirlpool of division and  
 dissent and be full of struggle and disorder.

The newly established Islamic community was composed  
 of the migrants - including the Bani Hashim die Bani  
 Umayyah 'Adiyy and Taym - on the one hand and the  
 Helpers (ansar)-subdivided into the Aws and Khazraj tribes-  
 on the other. Once the matchless leader that was the Prophet  
 had departed ambitions arose on every hand and instead of  
 being concerned with the interests of Islam men sought to  
 capture leadership and rule for themselves wishing to  
 transform divine leadership into tribal rule. The varying  
 aspirations and tendencies that arose left no firm unifying  
 bond in place among people a profound tragedy that the  
 Prophet had foreseen and to which he had alerted his  
 followers: "My ummali will divide into seventy three factions  
 only one of which will attain salvation the other factions being  
 destined for hellfire."[( 1 )](#p1)

The greatest blow that was struck against the unity of  
 Islam after the death of its founder sowing the seeds of  
 dissension among Muslims was the difference of opinion  
 relating to the question of rule and leadership. It led to wars  
 rebellions and bloody struggles sundering the unity of the  
  

**( 20 )**

Muslims and scattering their unified ranks.

If indeed the Prophet had not made some provision for  
 the painful situation - a situation he foresaw -; if he had not  
 attempted to prevent the emergence of the vacuum that would  
 have threatened the very existence of Islamic society quitting  
 this worldly stage without any plan for safeguarding his  
 ummah from misguidance would this not have created great  
 problems with respect to government and the administration of  
 affairs? The gravity of future problems was moreover  
 apparent even without the receipt of communication from the  
 Origin of Revelation and unseen agents.

How is it possible to imagine that Most Noble Prophet  
 peace and blessings be upon him and his family should have  
 neglected nothing in the proclamation of his message but paid  
 no attention to the future course of Islam and its culture to the  
 guardianship of the truth and the preservation of both religion  
 and society entrusting all this simply to the hand of fate and  
 whatever circumstances might later arise? Was it possible that  
 he should not select a captain to steer the ship of the  
 ummah away from the dangerous waves of dissension that he  
 expected it to encounter?

Those who say that the Prophet did not delineate any  
 form of government to succeed him remaining silent on the  
 subject and leaving his crisis-stricken ummah at a loss what to  
 do - how can they attribute such inappropriate silence and  
 such irresponsible laxity to one whom we know as the  
 Universal Intelligence? It must also be borne in mind that his  
 death did not come suddenly; he realized in advance that he  
 was about to leave the world. In his sermon of the Farewell  
 Pilgrimage (hijjatu 'l-wada') lie had proclaimed to the people  
 that he was about to depart from their midst and that he  
 would not be standing with them at the same place the  
 following year.

Islam was then young and a long path lay ahead of it if it  
 was to come to fruition. The standard bearer of its movement  
 had committed himself to uprooting all traces of the Jahiliyyah  
 and to erasing from the hearts and souls of the people any of its  
  

**( 21 )**

residue that might persist. He was threatened on two fronts.

Internally he was threatened by the Hypocrites who had  
 penetrated the ranks of the Muslims through outwardly  
 ranging themselves beneath the banner of prophethood and  
 were striving repeatedly to defeat the Prophet. In the ninth  
 year of the Hijrah when he had departed on the Tabuk  
 campaign he became anxious on account of their intrigues and  
 plotting and in order to prevent the occurrence of any  
 untoward event he named 'Ali peace be upon him as his  
 deputy in Madinah. Externally he was threatened by the two  
 great empires Byzantium and Persia and there was the  
 constant fear that at any moment either of those great powers  
 might attack the center of the Islamic movement.

It is evident that confronted with such grave problems the  
 Prophet was bound to place responsibility for the preservation  
 of the ummah in the hands of a person or persons who had the  
 capacity for it in order that the Islamic call might remain firm  
 and protected.

The first caliph felt a sense of responsibility for the future  
 of the Islamic state and was unwilling for it to be threatened by  
 a vaccum in the leadership. He did not leave the ummali to its  
 own devices and while on his deathbed instructed the people  
 as follows: "I appoint 'Umar b. al-Khattab as commander and  
 ruler over you; pay heed to his words and obey him."[( 2 )](#p2) The  
 caliph thus regarded it as his right to designate his own  
 successor and to enjoin obedience to him on the people.

The second caliph likewise realized the need to act quickly  
 once he had been fatally stabbed. He ordered a six-man council  
 to be convened which implies that he did not grant the  
 Muslims the right of appointing the caliph themselves  
 otherwise he would not have assigned the task to this council.

The Commander of the Faithful 'Ali peace be upon him accepted the
responsibility of the caliphate under extraordinarily complicated and
disturbed circumstances for he was fearful that popular disorder might
lead to a wholesale relapse into Jahiliyyah.

Taking all this into consideration is it at all possible that  

**( 22 )**

the Messenger of God peace and blessings be upon him and  
 his family should have overlooked the depth of the danger or  
 the sensetiveness of the situation despite the fact that society  
 had only just emerged from Jahiliyyah and that he should not  
 have drawn up a plan to confront the dangers he anticipated  
 after his death?

It would indeed be impossible to find any acceptable  
 explanation for a failure on the part of the Prophet to concern  
 himself with this matter. Likewise it is unimaginable that he  
 should have shown no concern for the future of the summons  
 he had launched not caring what might become of it after his  
 death.

On the contrary even on his deathbed and while sorely  
 vexed by the pains of sickness the Prophet was concerned for  
 the ummah and full of anxiety for its future to the degree that it  
 completely preoccupied his whole being.

During those sensitive and critical moments when  
 everyone was in a state of shock and bewilderment and some  
 of the Companions (Sahabah) including 'Umar b. al-Khattab  
 were gathered around his bed the Prophet said: "Bring me  
 paper and an inkpot; I wish to write instructions for you so  
 that you never go astray ."[( 3 )](#p3)

This effort of the Prophet peace and blessings be upon  
 him and his family preserved in a tradition on the authenticity  
 of which all are agreed is clear testimony to the fact that the  
 Messenger of God precisely at the time that he was spending  
 the last moments of his luminous life was concerned for the  
 future of Islam and was giving thought to the dangers that  
 would arise after his death. He wished to lay down a path for  
 the future in order to preserve the ummah from deviation and  
 society from degeneration for he understood these matters  
 better and more profoundly than anyone.

A matter that deserves particular attention is the question  
 of successor ship in heavenly religions and laws for all the  
 prophets of God selected deputies and successors in  
 accordance with revelation. For example Adam Ibrahim  
 (Abraham) Ya'qub (Jacob) Musa (Moses) and 'Isa (Jesus)  

**( 23 )**

peace be on them all selected their successors all of whom are known to
us by name.[( 4 )](#p4)

The Most Noble Messenger peace and blessings be upon him and his family
said: "Every prophet has a legatee (wasiyy) and an heir (warith) and
'Ali is my legatee and heir."[( 5 )](#p5)

Since according to the Qur'an the norms of God are fixed  
 and unchanging it follows that the Prophet of Islam must also  
 act in accordance with this immutable divine norm by  
 presenting his own deputy and successor to the Islamic ummah.

This indeed is what happened. In conformity with God's  
 command and as required by prophethood and the need to  
 perpetuate the message of Islam and implement its goals he  
 selected his legatee thus making its duty clear to the ummah.

All of this represents a belief that originates in the Book of God.

Muslims are unanimous in believing that the Prophet of Islam peace and
blessings be upon him and his family never made any mention of Abu Bakr
or the two caliphs that followed Abu Bakr as his caliphs and successors
nor is there any indication of their caliphate in the Qur'an and the
Sunnah.

The caliphate of Abu Bakr is thus a simple historical event not an
indisputable religious belief so that every Muslim has the right to
express an opinion on the matter in accordance with his own
understanding as simple logic requires.
