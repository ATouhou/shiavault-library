4. Emphatic Consonants
======================

Emphatic Consonants are a Semitic languages phenomenon. In Arabic there
are four which include**ص** **،** **ط** **،** **ظ** ** ** ** ض ،** .
These consonants are articulated by a process of velarization: the tip
of the tongue is lowered, the root of the tongue is raised towards the
soft palate (velum), and in the process the timbre of the neighboring
vowels is shifted towards a posterior realization.
