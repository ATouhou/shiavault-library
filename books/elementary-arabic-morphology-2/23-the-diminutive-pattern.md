======================

173. What is the diminutive pattern?

174. What are the rules of the diminutive pattern?

175. When is the letter after the diminutive *yā'* given a *fathah*?

173. The diminutive pattern is a form which indicates smallness,
degradation or love. For example: **وَلَد** (boy) becomes **وُلَید**
(small boy)

174. The rules of the diminutive pattern are:

• The first letter of the word must be given a *dummah*

• The second letter must be given a *fathah* and if it is a weak letter
it is put in its original form and then given a *fathah*

• Then the diminutive *yā'* is added after the second letter without any
vowel sign

• The next letter is given a *kasrah* except in some cases where it is
given a *fathah*

175. The letter after the diminutive *yā'* is given a *fathah* if it is
followed by a *tā'* or an *alif*. For example: **زُهرَة** (flower)
becomes **زُهَیرَة** (small flower).
