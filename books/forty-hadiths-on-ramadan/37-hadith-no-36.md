Hadith No. 36
=============

The Call of Allah
-----------------

Abdullah Ibn al-Abbas Ibn Abd al-Muttalib reports that he heard the Holy
Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) say: Every night, in the
month of Ramadan, Allah, The Blessed and The Exalted, calls out three
times: Is there one, who seeks from Me, so that I grant him his wish? Is
there one, who turns to me in repentance so that I turn to him (in
Mercy)? Is there one, who seeks forgiveness from Me so that I forgive
him?*Mustadrak al-Wasaail, vol. 7, pg. 429*
