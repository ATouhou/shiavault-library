Chapter 14 :the Basis of the Opinions of the Khawarij
=====================================================

The underlying root of Khawarijism is formed from the following four
things:

a) They regarded 'Ali, \`Uthman, Mu'awiyah, the fighters at the battle
of Jamal and those who accepted arbitration all as infidels, except
those who voted for arbitration but afterwards repented.

b) They regarded as infidels those who did not believe in the heresy of
'Ali, \`Uthman and the others mentioned in (a).

c) Faith was not for them only sincere belief, but putting the commands
into action and desisting from the prohibitions was also part of faith.
Faith was a compound thing made up of belief and action.

d) There was an unconditional necessity to revolt against an unjust
governor or leader. They believed that "bidding to good" and "forbidding
evil" are not conditional on anything, and that in all circumstances
this divine command must be carried out.

According to these opinions, these people started their existence from
the recognition that all men on earth were infidels, whose blood was of
no value and who were all condemned to the Fire.
