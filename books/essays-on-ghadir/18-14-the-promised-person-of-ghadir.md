14- the Promised Person of Ghadir
=================================

In that desert, in the land of Johfeh, beside Ghadir, and in presence
of that huge gathering the Messenger of Islam continued his speech by
describing Imam Mahdi (p.b.u.h.) and pointed out different aspects of
his honorable personality.

The significance of this part can be noticed from the way his holiness
calls people's attention by carefully repeating an alerting expression
for 18 times. In this part his holiness repeats several times the phrase
"Be aware" to show people the value, delicacy and importance of the
subject. .

In the beginning of this part, once again the Messenger refers to
connection between Nabovat (Prophethood), and Imamat (Leader ship). He
reminds that Ali holds beginning of this line and in the end stands
Hazrat Mahdi (p.b.u.h.). Then numbering 21 of main and notable
characteristics of Imam, the Messenger outlines programs, and tasks of
his divine state, in such a way that, by paying a little attention and
having a close look at these characteristics, we can get an
understanding of the subject.

The holy messenger (p.b.u.h.) said:

- O people, - "Be aware" that he will overcome the religions. "Be aware
that he will revenge on the cruel people.

"Be aware that he will conquer and ruin all the strongholds.
Be aware that he will defeat all the disbeliever tribes.
Be aware that he will avenge on bloodshed of God's friends.
Be aware that he is the friend of the God and His Religion.
Be aware that he is a skillful captain sailing across a deep ocean.
Be aware that he will recognize the wise by their wisdom and the
ignorant by their ignorance.
Be aware that he is God's selected believer.
Be aware that he is bestowed with the knowledge of all sciences and so
he is proficient in all of them.
Be aware that he speaks to you about his God and about how to have
faith in God.
Be aware that he is honest, benevolent, and firm in his beliefs and
deeds. Be aware that he is assigned by God to manage and administer the
people's affairs.
Be aware that all the preceding prophets have promised his final state.
Be aware that his holiness is the last proof of God, that the rights and
truths are thoroughly with him and the light and consciousness come with
him. Be aware that no one can overwhelm him.

Be aware that he is God's voice on the earth, and God's judge among His
people. He is God's trusted, and one who is fully aware of mysteries of
creation.

Let us have another careful look at these descriptions, to find out
that what motivates the messenger to illustrate main lines of that
divine system under leadership of his holiness, and give such a picture
of Hazrat Mahdi' s personality years before his birth and centuries
before his return. Inspiring hope and willing among generations,
preparing them to stand the hard time of absence, along with giving
correct understanding of this hard time and finally putting constant and
steady efforts in fulfillment of that bright future, can be the main
objective that stimulated the Messenger to give these messages.

If we do not assume this, then why the messenger gives such detailed
account of Imam Mahdi and future world, when there were only 3 of our
innocent Imams in life (Aniir ul Momenin, Imam Hassan and Imam Hossein).
A world, in which ignorance and wisdom will not be considered the same.
Wise people shall not be mixed with Ignorants, and hence they can be
easily recognized. Where, Imam Mahdi using his divine insight will
clearly distinguish between these two groups.

His revolution, in accordance with a clear and self explanatory
historic movement has been commented as a step during human civilization
periods. He fulfils the promises that preceding messengers made, and his
mission will be to put previous messenger's efforts into effect.

This honorable Imam is introduced a as symbol of divine knowledge and
power. The knowledge brings him an extraordinary insight and his blessed
power puts him in a position that allows no one to prevent him from
achieving goals of this divine plan.

If this holy revolution does not take place, creation may seem
imperfect and in vain, and the deceptive question may touches the minds
that whether the intention of life was to watch generations coming and
leaving, or to witness tyranny, cruelty, bloodshed, and lootings by
different governors of the history? In reply to this misleading
question, the Almighty God equips his strong leader, with wisdom and
power, to rule the world. God will assist him to help the oppressed
people, and fight infidelity and unbelief; He will support him in
respecting martyrs blood, revenging on the tyrant, and finally God
guides him to take control of unstable ship of humanity. He will lead
the mankind to their destination, where, we should wish to be blessed
with the chance to witness. Once we study this part of Messenger's
speech, we learn about noble personality of Imam of the age as well as
different dimensions of this divine plan, including some cultural,
historical, scientific, social and political sides, yet, longing to find
deeper understanding of the this age.

However, messenger brings his speech to an end by talking about
Forbidden and Lawful materials and behaviors, and reminds that this
issue is too wide to be discussed in one and during one speech.

Then he adds:

"I am ordered by Almighty God to ask you to take oath of loyalty to
Amir ul Momenin (p.b.u.h) and all the Imams after him, who are
descendant of same fathers as I am. Hazrat Mahdi is "Ghaem"21 of these
Imams, who will exist until doomsday and who's judgment will be honest
and fair."

And so the Messenger remembers Imam of the Age for the third time
during his speech, and these three places as you read were in addition
to the 11 times that his holiness, used the general word "Imam" to
introduce the leaders after him. \* He expressed their noble and
distinctive position by the phrase:"……."

And he has called these leaders ……. in another part of this speech,
where he referred to them as “Junior Treasure”22 that is placed beside
God's book, which is “senior Treasure”23. They have been known in
messenger's speech as trustees of God among His people, and several time
during the speech praised the Imams with regards to their relation to
Ali (p.b.u.h.) as my sons from his back: and similar expressions.

Now it is clear that why this articled is call "Promise of Ghadir",
because it gives an introduction of the name, way, and customs oflmam of
the Age (p.b.u.h.), which impresses minds, and hearths of the readers.
We hope that this would be a helpful guide to us too.
