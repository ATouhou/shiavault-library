73. Masculine Sound Plural
==========================

It was mentioned earlier that the**Masculine Sound Plural** (MSP) is
formed by suffixing (**ونَ** ) for the nominative case, and (** ـينَ** )
for the accusative and genitive cases, to the singular           form of
the noun.

**موَظـَّفٌ – موَظـَّفونَ / موَظـَّفينَ**
</p>

The final (**ـنَ** ) of this kind of plural is dropped when such a noun
takes the position of a first term of Idaafa. This rule applies
regardless of the case of the noun, whether it is nominative,
accusative, or genitive.
