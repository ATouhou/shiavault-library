(3) So Should We Not Discuss Historical Differences?
====================================================

by the Grand Ayatullah N. Makarim Shirazi
-----------------------------------------

“Some of the scholars of Egypt and Sunni brethren of the south [Iran]
have considered some historical serials of Iranian television [entitled
as “Mukhtar Nameh”] as an insult to the companions of the Prophet.
**They should realize that** ***insult*** **is one thing and**
***narrating history*** **is something else; these are fundamentally
different issues.**

“Can anyone doubt that there was a battle in Islam by the name of
Siffin? Can anyone doubt that some companions *(sahaba)* did not pledge
allegiance to the Imam of their time and fought against him in [a battle
in] which many were killed? Are you saying do not narrate the history?

**“We cannot close our eyes to history [and historical differences];**
***insulting*** **is one thing while** ***research*** **is something
else—these two should never be confused with one another. These brothers
should realize that historical issues cannot be forgotten; all books on
history of Islam are full of these events.** Even the historical books
of the Sunnis talk about the issue of Talha, Zubayr and ‘Abdullah bin
Zubayr.

“If history is researched objectively, then many realities and events
will become clear. In Islamic history, some companions *(sahaba)* were
steadfast in the path of the Prophet while some did not remain on that
path. If we look at the issues and events of history in an unbiased way,
then our duty will become clear. This means narrating the event, and
that should not be considered as an insult.”

An Example from Amirul Mu’minin ‘Ali (a.s.)
-------------------------------------------

During the Battle of Siffin, Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) saw some of his companions
hurling abusive words towards the Syrian forces. He advised them:

**“I dislike you starting to abuse them, but if you describe their deeds
and recount their situations that would be a better mode of speaking and
a more convincing way of arguing.**

“Instead of abusing them you should say, ‘O Allah! Save our blood and
their blood, produce reconciliation between us and them, and lead them
out of their misguidance so that he who is ignorant of the truth may
know it, and he who inclines towards rebellion and revolt may turn away
from it.’” (Nahjul Balagha, sermon 204)
