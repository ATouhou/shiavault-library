Laylatul Qadr, the Night of Power
=================================

The month of Ramadhan has been singled out for special worship
(\`Ibadat) and exclusive favours. It is a month unlike other months. One
reason for this, as defined by the Qur'an, is because the Holy Qur'an
was revealed in this month. Says Allah in Sura al­Baqarah: The month of
Ramadhan, that in which the Qur'an was sent down; a guidance for
mankind, and clear signs of guidance and distinction (2:185). In fact,
according to a hadith of the 6th Imam (a), the other holy books were
also revealed in this month.

Among the nights of Ramadhan is one special night, which is better than
a thousand months (HQ, 97:3). Good deeds performed on that single night
are equal to those performed over a thousand months. It is the Night of
Power (Laylatul Qadr), when the Qur'an was revealed. Some commentators
believe it was the night when the Qur'an was brought down from Baytul
M\`amur (Heavenly abode), for Jibrael to reveal in parts to the Prophet
(s). Others say it was the night when the Prophet received the entire
Qur'an, but was asked to transmit it as and when the occasion demanded.

Laylatul Qadr is a celebration to commemorate the arrival of the final
guidance for humans. It is a tribute to the commencement of the message
revealed to mankind by their Creator, a message which shows them the way
to achieve happiness in both the worlds. Just as the arrival of a child
is celebrated, on its birth and then every year, as a bringer of joy and
fulfilment for the family, Laylatul Qadr is celebrated as a bringer of
light and guidance for mankind. Unlike the birthday which is celebrated
with a feast for the senses, Laylatul Qadr includes a feast for the
spirit, a feast of worship and prayers.

Some Ahadith indicate that the fate of every believer for the coming
year is decreed on this night. That is why the Du\`as for this night ask
for special favours in the decree for the year. Believers are encouraged
to stay awake the entire night, and pray for blessings and forgiveness.
It is the holiest night of the year, and it would be unwise to be
heedless of the tremendous benefits of this night.

Common A\`maal for the three nights of Qadr
-------------------------------------------

It is reported in Hadith that whoever keeps awake on the nights of Qadr
shall have his/her sins forgiven, even if they equal the number of the
stars in the heaven.

It is also recommended to recite hundred rak\`aat (i.e. 50 namaz of 2
rak\`aat each) on these nights. The practice of performing Qadha prayers
on these nights has no origin in the books of Hadith. However, it is
emphasized to fulfil the Qadha prayers as soon as it is possible, and
some believers use this opportunity to perform Qadha prayers of six days
( 6 x 17 =102 rak\`aat).

Open the Qur'an and say:

***In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful***

O Allah bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.

O Allah I ask You,

for the sake of Your revealed Book,

and what is in it, and in it is Your greatest name,

and (all) Your beautiful names,

and what is feared and hoped for,

make me amongst those whom You have saved from the fire.

Place the Qur'an on the head and say:

O Allah,

for the sake of this Qur'an,

for the sake of the one You sent with it,

for the sake of every believer You have praised in it,

and for the sake of Your right over them,

for none is more aware of Your right over them than Yourself.

Common A'amal for all three nights of Qadr

On all three nights of Laylatul Qadr, i.e. the 19th, 21st, and 23rd of
Ramadhan, the following acts are

recommended:

a) Ghusl before sunset.

b) Two rak\`aat namaz; in each rak\`ah after Sura al­Hamd recite Sura

al­Ikhlas 7 times.

c) After the namaz say 70 times:

Astaghfirullaaha wa­atoobu ilayh

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

f) Du'a no.4 for the Night of Qadr

The effect of the Du'as recited on the night of Qadr can have a
tremendous impact on the coming year.

What we ask for on the night of decree can change our lives. That is why
believers are told to be aware of

the significance of this night, and spend the entire night in worship
and prayers. Allah has offered us a

chance to have a say in our fate, and such a chance will not come again
until the following year.

In the name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful.

O Allah bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.

O Allah,

let it be that when You decree and ordain

from the matters which are certain,

that when You distinguish in the matters which are wise

on the night of Qadr,

in the decree which cannot be reversed nor changed,

that You write me amongst those who will go

for pilgrimage (hajj) to Your holy House,

whose Hajj is approved,

whose efforts are appreciated,

whose sins are forgiven,

whose evil deeds have been pardoned.

And from what You decree and ordain,

let my life be lengthened,

and increase my sustenance,

and . . . (ask for your wishes)

f) Du'a no.4 for the Night of Qadr

This Du'a refers to Sura ad-­Dukhan, verse 4 which says : Therein You
make distinct every wise affair.

Thus we pray for what we want Allah to place in our decree. The affairs
which Allah will decree on Laylatul Qadr are described as wise. The word
is also taken to mean strong, firm.
