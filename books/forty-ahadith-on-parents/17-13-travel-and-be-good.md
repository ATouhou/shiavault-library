13. Travel and be Good!
=======================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قاَلَ رَسُولُ اللٌّهِ (ص): سِرْ سَنَتَيْنِ بَرَّ وَالِدَيْكَ سِرْ
سَنَةً صِلْ رَحِمَكَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his family) said: “Travel
even for two years to do good to your parents.  Journey (even) for one
year to establish bonds of kinship (with your relatives).”
