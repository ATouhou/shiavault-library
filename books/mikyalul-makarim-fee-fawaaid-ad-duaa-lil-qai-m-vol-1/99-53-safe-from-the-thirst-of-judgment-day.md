53. Safe from the thirst of Judgment Day
========================================

Since he would be of those whom the Messenger of Allah (S) would give
drinks. As mentioned in the tradition of the flag which will come to His
Eminence in *Qiyamat*:

“After that a flag will come to me whose people would be having bright
faces. I will ask them: Who are you? They will reply: We are monotheists
from the Ummah of Muhammad Mustafa (S) and we are the remnants of the
people of truth. We held to the Book of our Lord, and observed its
commands and prohibitions, we loved the progeny of our Holy Prophet (S)
and we helped them in every way possible; we fought the enemies in their
service. Then I will say to them: Glad tidings to you, I am your Prophet
Muhammad and indeed you were such as you say. Then I would give them
water from my cistern and they shall be quenched and express joy and
congratulate each other. Then they would enter Paradise and remain in it
forever.”

I say: The point of evidence in this tradition is as we mentioned
before, that *Dua* is a form of help and also there is another honor
stated in this tradition – and it is that they shall remain in Paradise
forever – this is also proved by it.
