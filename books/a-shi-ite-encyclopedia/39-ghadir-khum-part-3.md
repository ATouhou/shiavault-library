The Chains (Asnad) Of Narrations Of Ghadir Khum
-----------------------------------------------

The importance of the tradition of Ghadir Khum in history is reflected
in its widespread documentation and mentioned by the multitude of
personalities over the centuries. Although, some trivialized, only
listed the occurrence among the historical events without giving it a
thought, or discussed the matter in a mixture of emotional judgments,
none could deny the authenticity of these narrations. The essence of
what the Messenger of Allah (S) delivered on the day of Ghadir was not
disputed among any, even if they disagreed on its interpretation, for
reasons obvious to the alert.

Let us look at the lists of some of the Sunni traditions, commentators,
and historians who have documented the tradition of Ghadir Khum in

there was a young man next to me, with a handsome face and good
fragrance. He said to me: "O’ Umar, the Messenger of Allah has agreed to
an agreement. No one dissolves it except a hypocrite.”Then the Messenger
of Allah took my hand and said: "O’ Umar, it is not sons’ of Adam (i.e.,

Poetry
------

Many poems mention the event or are entirely about it. The first poem
was the famous companion, Hassan Ibn Thabit, the poet of the Messenger
of Allah. Immediately after the Prophet’s speech, Hassan asked for the
permission of the Prophet (S) to compose a few verses of poetry about  
 ‘Ali (as) for the audience. The Prophet said: "Say with the blessings
of Allah". Hassan stood up and said: "O’ people of Quraish. I follow
with my words what preceded and witnessed by the Messenger of Allah. He
then composed the following verses at the scene:

He calls them, (on) the day of Ghadir, their Prophet In Khum so hear
(and heed) the Messenger’s call, He said: "Who is your guide and leader?
(Mowlakum wa Waliyukum)”They said, and there was no apparent blindness
(clearly): "Your God, our guide, and you are our leader And you won’t
find from among us, in this, any disobedient,"

He said to him: "Stand up O’ ‘Ali, for I am pleased to announce you Imam
and guide after me, So whomever I was his leader, then this is his
leader So be to him supporters in truth and followers,”

There he asked (du’aa): "Allah? Be a friend and guide to his follower
And be, to the one who is ‘Ali’s enemy, an enemy"

“Abu Nu’aym al-Isbahani (d. 430), in "Ma Nazala min al-Qur’an fi
‘Ali”Here is the Arabic text of the above highlighted piece from the
poem of Hassan Ibn Thabit:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فقال له قم يا عليُّ فإنَّني
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
رضيتك من بعدي إماماً و هادياً

On The Occasion of Eid Al-Ghadir
--------------------------------

*In praise of Allah*  
*Be it Badr, Uhud or Khaibar,*  
*We hear the cry, Haidar - Haidar.*  
*We see his shining sword strike*  
*the ones who Allah dislikes.*

*All those who even dare*  
*to fight him and aren’t aware*  
*of his valor - can’t survive.*  
*They shall lose their lives.*  
*And there is one who claims to be*  
*the greatest warrior of Arabia - but see*  
*the mighty sword falls on him too.*

*Even though to challenge him were few.*  
*The Muslims are struck with terror.*  
*They can’t conquer the fort of Khaibar.*  
*Each attack they make is turned back.*  
*The will to fight they utterly lack.*  
*The one who Allah loves, then comes*  
*and out of fear the enemy is numb.*

*He takes the standard in one hand*  
*and leads this seemingly defeated band.*  
*A group of losers, say the books of history*  
*under his command proceed to their victory.*  
*His advances no one can ever cut short.*  
*Finally he conquers the impenetrable fort.*  
*In another battle the Prophet is betrayed.*  
*As his followers have become so afraid.*

*They leave him wounded and run away.*  
*Kufr still seems to hold it’s sway.*  
*But there is Haidar e Karrar to aid him.*  
*A lost battle, he will be able to win.*  
*Whenever Asadullah will be there,*  
*to fight Islam, no one shall dare.*

*These astonishing feats no one can hide,*  
*as time and again he turns the tide.*  
*A battle comes and a battle goes by*  
*Islam’s standard always remains high.*  
*So when in Ghadir - he is proclaimed*  
*Mawla - that Muslims should follow him.*

*The Prophet’s mission is complete. He alone*  
*can bear the burden of this throne.*  
*Only he can feel the Muslim’s needs,*  
*make sure they perform good deeds,*  
*and guide them to the path of salvation.*  
*He deserves the rulership of this nation.*  
*He has the understanding and wisdom*  
*to be the Imam in Allah’s kingdom.*

*He is the gateway to the city of knowledge*  
*and above all he has the most courage,*  
*which is seen by his extraordinary feats.*  
*With his scholarly skills none can compete.*  
*Admire his piety. He is not guided by greed.*  
*The Prophet of Allah - only he can succeed.*
