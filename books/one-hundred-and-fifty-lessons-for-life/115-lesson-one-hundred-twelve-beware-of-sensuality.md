Lesson One Hundred Twelve: Beware Of Sensuality
===============================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إحْذَرُوا اَهْوائَكُمْ كَما تَحْذَرُونَ أَعْدائَكُمْ فَلَيْسَ شَىْءٌ
أَعْدى لِلرَّجالِ مِنْ إِتِّباعِ أَهْوائِهِمْ وَ حَصائِدِ
اَلْسِنَتِهِمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Beware of sensual desires in the same way as you watch out for your
(obstinate) enemies because man has no enemies greater than following
sensual desires and the outcomes of his tongue![^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Undoubtedly, internal enemies are more dangerous than external foes.
Therefore, obstinate desires which affect man inwardly, are considered
as the most dangerous enemy for man. Sensuality blinds the eye and
deafens the ear. It extinguishes the light of wisdom, distorts the face
of truth and finally leads him to the precipice of corruption.
