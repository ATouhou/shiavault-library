Lesson One Hundred Seventeen: One Hour Of Justice
=================================================

The Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَدْلُ ساعَة خَيْرٌ مِنْ عِبادَةِ سَنَة!
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

One hour of justice is better than one year of worship.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Worship is the same relation of creature with creator and ‘possible’
with ‘necessary’ and paying attention to this relation and connection.
Those worships are important educational lessons which have an effective
role in correcting man’s spirit and mind.

However, we read in the above tradition, that one hour of justice is
better and higher than one year of (recommended) worship. These
expressions show the critical importance of justice and meditation, both
having a common origin. Wherever there is no justice, there is no
thinking, meditation and wisdom.
