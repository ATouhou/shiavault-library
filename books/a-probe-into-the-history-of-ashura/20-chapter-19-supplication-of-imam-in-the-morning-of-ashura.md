Chapter 19: Supplication of Imam in the Morning of Ashura
=========================================================

In the morning of the day of Ashura the horsemen of the enemy launched
an attack on the ranks of the Imam. The Imam raised his hands in prayer
and said: "O Lord! I depend on you in every affliction and am hopeful of
Your blessing in every hardship. In every difficulty with which I am
faced, You are my only remedy and resort.

There have been many embarrassments which weakened my heart and no
remedy for it was available. The friends did not assist me and the
enemies rejoiced at my misfortune. However, when I ceased to seek
assistance from everyone except You and sought the remedy only from You,
You provided me solace and relief and removed the difficulty. Every
blessing and goodness reaches us from You and everything should be
sought from You only".
