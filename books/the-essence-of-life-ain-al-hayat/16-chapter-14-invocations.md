Chapter 14: Invocations
=======================

The Superiority Of Invocations; The superiority of Tasbeehat or Sanctification of Allah
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is narrated from Imam Hasan (as) that a group of Jews came to the
presence of the Prophet of Allah (S) and their chief inquired about
several religious matters and got satisfactory replies. The entire group
embraced Islam. One of the questions asked by the Jew was about the
words that were taught to Prophet Ibrahim (as) at the time of the
construction of the Kaaba. The Prophet told him the pharse was as
follows:

<p dir="rtl">
سُبْحَانَ اللهِ، وَالحَمْدُ للهِ، وَلا إلَهَ إلاّ اللهُ، وَاللهُ
أكْبَرُ.
</p>

*Glory to Allah and praise to Allah and there is no God but Allah and
Allah is the most great.*

The Jew asked, “What rewards one could get if he recites this phrase
regularly?”

The Prophet of Allah said: When the sanctfier says*‘Subhan Allah’,* then
the angels under the Firmament too will repeat*‘Subhan Allah’.* And the
reciter will get ten times more reward. When the person says*‘Alhamdu
lillah’,* then Allah rewards him with the world and the Hereafter. These
are the words that will be on the mouth of the people who enter the
precincts of the Heaven because they used to recite the same words while
on the earth. When the person says,*‘La ilaha il Allah’,* Allah orders
awarding to him a place in the Heaven for uttering these words,
because*‘Hal jazaal ehsan illal ehsaan’. When the Jewish scholar heard
this, he said, “O Muhammad! You tell the truth!”*

Amir’ul-Mu’mineen (as) said: A group of beggars came to the Prophet of
Islam (S) and said, ‘Ya Rasool Allah (S)! The affluent have money and
they can perform the Haj. We don’t have the means to fulfill this
important tenet! They have slaves, whom they can free to earn Allah’s
goodwill. We can’t do that. They have wealth that they can do charity.
We cannot be charitable! They can go for Jehad, we cannot do that!’ The
Prophet of Islam (S) replied,’ One who repeats the words*“Allaho Akbar”*
a hundred times, he will get the reward equal to that for releasing a
hundred slaves. One who repeats the words*“Subhan Allah”* a hundred
times he will get the reward for a Haj in which a hundred camels had
been offered as sacrifice by him. One who repeats the words*“Al hamdu
Lillah”* a hundred times, he will get the reward for a Jehad for which
he had donated a hundred steeds. When a person repeats the words*‘La
ilaha il Allah”* a hundred times, the reward will be the maximum.’ This
news reached the affluent people and they too started reciting the
words. The beggars came back to the Prophet (S) and said, “O Prophet of
Allah! The rich too have started doing the same as you have asked us to
do!’ The Prophet (S) replied, ‘This is Allahs Bounty! He can give to
whoever He wishes to!’”

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (as) has said, “One who recites a hundred times each of
the following words,*’ Alhamdulillah’ ‘Subhan Allah’ ‘La ilaha il
Allah’* and says the Durood ‘*Allahu ma salle ala Muhammadin wa aale
Muhammad’* a hundred times, and later on says*‘Alla humma zawwijni min
al hoor il ain’* ,

Allah will grant him the Hur al-’Ayn in the Heaven. These five hundred
words will be the*Mehr (* alimony) for the Hur al-’Ayn. This is the
reason why 500 Deenar is fixed as the alimony for the*Mu’mina* women!”

### The Reward For Tahleel Or Declaration Of Allah’s Unity

###

The Prophet of Islam (S) has said: Allah told to Prophet Musa (as) that
if whatever is there on the earth and the sky is put in one pan of a
balance and in the other the words ’*La ilaha il Allah’* are put, the
pan in which these words are put will tilt to its side’. And said,
‘Reciting these words when one takes his last breaths would be of
immense advantage that the spirit would leave the body with ease.’

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) has said: The more these words are recited,
the more one will earn Rewards. This is an invocation whose superiority
is immeasurable. Every prayer has an end. When the five mandatory
prayers are offered, ones duty has been done! But there is no limit to
the recitation of*‘La ilaha il Allah’.* One can recite it, however much
he wishes to do it. Then the Imam recited the following verse,

<p dir="rtl">
﴿يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ ذِكْرًا كَثِيرًا.
وَسَبِّحُوهُ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلًا.﴾
</p>

*O” you who believe! remember Allah, remembering frequently And glorify
Him morning and evening”* (33:41-42)

(O believers! Talk of Allah a lot and do His invocation day and night.’

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (as) has said that Allah told to Prophet Nooh (as) that
when his ark was engulfed in high tide, he should recite the following
words a thousand times, “*La ilaha il Allah”* The Imam also said that
the recitation of these words will ward away penury and hardship and
also relieves one from the pressures of the grave. One who regularly
recites these words everyday, Allah will pardon his five thousand sins.
It will be like completing the recitation of the Qur’an twelve times
that day’

Therefore, bearing witness to the Unity of Allah by reciting,*“Ashaduan
la ilaha il Allah”* is a very important invocation and will be the cause
of ones deliverence.

It is authentically narrated that once Jibrael (as) came to Prophet
Yusuf (as) to the upper chamber of his royal palace. He noticed a
wayfarer in tatters on the street. Jibrael (as) said, “O Prophet of
Allah (S)! Do you know who that person is?” Prophet Yusuf (as) said,
“Please tell me who he is?” Jibrael (as) said that the person was the
one who bore witness to your innocence!’ Hearing this, Prophet Yusuf
(as) asked his men to fetch the persaon to his presence.

When the person was brought up, Prophet Yusuf treated him with great
deference, ordered his men to give him a nice bath, dress him in
expensive raiment and provide to him a chamber in the palace to live in
and get him married to a beautiful lass. When all this was accomplished
as per the wish of Prophet Yusuf (as), the person went away from there
in a state of happiness. Jibrael (as) then said, “O Prophet of Allah(S)!

How ungrateful is the human being that if he bears witness to the Unity
of Allah from the depths of his heart, Allah would give him palaces in
the Heaven, delicious food and*Hur al-’Ayn* to consort with! When a
creature of Allah could give all this to a person for bearing witness to
his innocence,

then no doubt the words*“Ashaduan la ilaha il Allahu”* are the key to
the Heaven!”

The Superiority Of Adhkar Or Invocations
----------------------------------------

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) narrates, “Whoever utters the words*‘La ilaha
il Allah,’* Allah will creat a rooster that will hover over his head
till the Day of Judgement and keep invoking Allah and the reward for
that would go to the person.

The Prophet of Allah (S) has said, “Ask your people on the verge of
death to recite*‘La ilaha il Allah* ,’ one whose last utterence are
these words will certainly land in the Heaven.”

It is narrated from Imam Ar-Ridha’ (as) that when prophet Nooh (as)
boarded the ark, Allah sent to him a Revelation, ‘When you feel the fear
of ship wreck, recite these words a thousand times,*‘La ilaha il
Allah.’*

It is narrated from Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) that whoever recites a
hundred times the words

<p dir="rtl">
لاَ إلَهَ إلاَّ اللهُ المَلِكُ الحَقُّ المُبِينُ.
</p>

*“There is no God but Allah, the king, the clear Truth”*

Allah would save him from penury and he will be provided safety from the
pressures of the grave. In this life he will become affluent.

It is narrated in another tradition that one who recites this invocation
32 times, will take a turn towards prosperity. Penury and difficulties
would desert him. He will be knocking at the threshold of the Heaven.

An authentic tradition narrates that whoever recites the following words
fifteen times,

<p dir="rtl">
لاَ إلَهَ إلاّ اللهُ حَقّاً حَقّاً، لاَ إلَهَ إلاّ اللهُ إيمَاناً
وَتَصْدِيقاً، لاَ إلَهَ إلاّ اللهُ عُبُودِيَّةً وَرِقّاً.
</p>

*I bear witness that there is no God but Allah indeed indeed, that there
is no God but Allah with belief and certainty, that there is no God but
Allah with slavery and ?*

Allah will have a Bounteous look towards him and till the person enters
the precincts of the Heaven, He will have an eye of Blessing on him.

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) narrates that if a person recites the
following invocation ten times every day,

<p dir="rtl">
أشْهَدُ أنْ لا إلهَ إلاّ اللهُ وحْدَهُ لا شَريكَ لهُ إلهاً واحِداً
أحَداً صَمَداً لَم يَتَّخِذْ صَاحِبةً وَلا وَلَداً.
</p>

*I bear witness that there is no God but Allah One that has no partner*
, no sons

his record of deeds will get entry of forty five thousand virtuous deeds
and delete the record of forty five thousand bad deeds. To the same
extent the person’s status would be elevated.

In another narration it is said that this invocation would save him from
the machinations of the Satan on the Day of Judgement. He will be
pardoned for the major sins committed by him. He will get the reward for
reciting the complete Qur’an ten times and would also get a place in the
Heaven.

The Superiority Of Tasbeeh Or The Rosary
----------------------------------------

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) says that when a*Mu’min* says

<p dir="rtl">
سُبْحانَ اللهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ، سُبْحانَ اللهِ العَظِيمِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ.
</p>

*Glory to Allah and praise to Him, glory and praise to Allah the most
great.*

Allah will enter three thousand virtuous deeds in his account and
deletes one thousand misdeeds from there. Allah will create a rooster
that will repeat this tasbeeh till the Day of Judgement and the reward
for this will go to the account of the person.

Amir’ul-Mu’mineen (as) has said that when a person says ‘*Subhan Allah*
,’ the angels would pray for him.

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) has said that one who recites

<p dir="rtl">
سُبْحانَ اللهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ، سُبْحانَ اللهِ العَظِيمِ.
</p>

Glory and praise to Allah*, Glory to Allah the Great.*

thirty times, Allah will remove penury and difficulties from him, make
him affluent and allot a place for him in the Heaven.

It is narrated from Amir’ul-Mu’mineen (as) that when Allah had created
the light (*Noor)* of the Prophet (S), He had kept it for twelve
thousand years under a curtain,*Hijab al-Qudrat* . The*Noor* used to
recite the following*Tasbeeh:*

<p dir="rtl">
سُبحانَ رَبّيَ الأعْلى وبِحَمدِهِ.
</p>

*Glory be to my Lord the High, and by His Praise,*

again for eleven thousand years the*noor* was under a curtain,*Hijab
al-Azmath,* when it recited the words,

<p dir="rtl">
سُبْحانَ عَالِمِ السِّرِّ.
</p>

***Glory to the one knowledgeable of all secrets,***

for another ten thousand years the*Noor* was under the*Hijab al Mann*
reciting,

<p dir="rtl">
سُبْحانَ مَن هُو قَائِمٌ لا يَلْهُو.
</p>

***Glory to Allah the alive who does not ,***

for another nine thousand years the*Noor* was under the curtain,*Hijab
al-Rehmat,* when it recited,

<p dir="rtl">
سُبحانَ الرَّفِيعِ الأعْلى.
</p>

***Subhan ar rabbi al aala,***

thereafter the*Noor* was under the curtain,*Hijab al Saadaat,* for eight
thousand years and it recited,

<p dir="rtl">
سُبحَانَ مَن هُوَ دَائِمٌ لا يَسْهُو.
</p>

*Subhana man huwa dayamun la yas-hu* ,

for the next seven thousand years the*Noor* was under the curtain,*Hijab
al Karamat,* and recited,

<p dir="rtl">
سُبحَانَ مَن هُوَ غَنِيٌّ لا يَفْتَقِرُ.
</p>

***Subhana man huwa ghaniun la yaftaghir,***

for the next six thousand years the*Noor* was under the curtain,*Hijab
al Manzila,* when it recited,

<p dir="rtl">
سُبحَانَ العَلِيمِ الكَرِيمِ.
</p>

***Subhan il aleemul kareem,***

for the next five thousand years the*Noor* was under the curtain,*Hijab
al Hidayat,* when it recited,

<p dir="rtl">
سُبْحانَ ذِي العَرْشِ العَظِيمِ.
</p>

***Subhana zil arshil azeem,***

for the next four thousand years the*Noor* was under the curtain,*Hijab
an nabbuwa,* when it recited,

<p dir="rtl">
سُبْحانَ رَبِّ العِزَّةِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ.
</p>

***Subhana rabbil izzate amma yasefoon,***

for the next three thousand years the*Noor* was under the curtain,*Hijab
ar rafaa,* when it recited,

<p dir="rtl">
سُبْحانَ ذِي المُلْكِ وَالمَلَكُوتِ.
</p>

***Subhana zil mulke wal malakoot,***

then for the next two thousand years the*Noor* was under the
curtain,*Hijab al-Haibat,* when it recited,

<p dir="rtl">
سُبْحانَ اللهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ.
</p>

***Subhan allahi wa behamde,***

finally for one thousand years the*Noor* was under the curtain,*Hijab
ash Shafaat,* when it recited,

<p dir="rtl">
سُبحانَ رَبّيَ العَظِيمِ وبِحَمدِهِ.
</p>

***Subhana Rabbil azeeme wa behamdehi***

Superiority of Tahmeed Or Praising Allah
----------------------------------------

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) was asked what act was the best in the
consideration of Allah? He replied, ‘Praising Him!’

Imam ‘Ali bin Husayn (as) said: One who uttered*‘Al hamdu lillah* ,’ he
thanked Allah for all His Bounties.

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (as) said that the Prophet of Islam (S) has observed that
Allah gives His Bounties to a person who remembers and praises Allah.
One who experiences delays in getting his sustenance, he should
do*Asthagfar* (seek Allah’s forgiveness). If a person is engrossed with
difficulties, he should say,

<p dir="rtl">
لاَ حَوْلَ وَلاَ قُوَّةَ إلاّ بِاللهِ.
</p>

***La haula wa la quwwata illa billah.***

Whenever the Prophet of Allah (S) was pleased with anything, he used to
say,

<p dir="rtl">
الحَمْدُ للهِ الّذِي بِنِعْمَتِهِ تَتِمُّ الصّالِحَاتِ.
</p>

***Alhamdu lillahil lazi benematehi tatam as saalehaat***

and whenever there was a sad event he said

<p dir="rtl">
اَلحَمْدُ للهِ عَلَى كُلِّ حَالٍ.
</p>

***Al hamdu lillahi ala kulle haal.***

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) has narrated from the Prophet of Allah (S)
that he used to praise Allah every day. He used to recite, as much as
his physical condition permitted, the following words,

<p dir="rtl">
الحَمْدُ للهِ رَبِّ العَالَمِينَ كَثِيراً عَلَى كُلِّ حَالٍ.
</p>

*Al hamdu lillahi rab il aalameen katheeran ala kulle haal.*

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq has said that one who says,

<p dir="rtl">
الحَمْدُ للهِ كَما هُوَ أهْلُهُ.
</p>

*Alhamdu lillahi kama huwa ahlehi,*

the chroniclers of deeds will tell to Allah that they were tiring
recording good deeds in his*Nama al-Aamaal.* Allah will say, “Write
whatever my creature is saying. Leave his record of deeds for Me to
update!”

The Superiority Of Astaghfar-Seeking Allah’s Forgiveness
--------------------------------------------------------

Amir’ul-Mu’mineen (as) has said that the smell of sins is warded off by
the fragrance of repentence. Seeking Allah’s forgiveness (*Astaghfar)*
becomes the cause of enhancement of one’s sustenance.

Imam Zain-ul-’Abidin (as) has said that a person who has the habit of
saying

<p dir="rtl">
أسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ رَبّي وَأتُوبُ إلَيْهِ.
</p>

***Astaghfar Allah Rabbi wa atoobe alaih***

will never be proud and conceited.

Whichever group the Prophet of Allah (S) visited, he used to spend more
time in saying the*Astaghfar.*

It is narrated that the Prophet of Allah used to say the*Astaghfar* a
hundred times every night, although he was a*Masoom* (innocent) and not
susceptible to commit any sins.Therefore, saying*Astaghfar* in itself is
a abig invocation, whether one has committed any sin or not.*Astaghfar*
is liked by the Creator and His Prophet (S).

It is narrated from Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) that when a person commits
a sin, he gets a respite of seven hours to repent and seek Allah’s
forgiveness by saying the*Astaghfar* three times. If he does this, then
the sin will not be entered in his*Nama al-Aamaal.* The*Astaghfar* is

<p dir="rtl">
أسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ الّذِي لا إلَهَ إلاّ هُوَ الحَيُّ القَيُّومُ وَأتُوبُ
إلَيْهِ.
</p>

*Astaghfarullah allazi la ilaha illa huwal hai al qayyumo wa atoobu
ilaihi.*

Then the Imam (as) said, “Whoever repeats*Astaghfar Allah* a hundred
times in a day, Allah will forgive seven hundred sins of his.Remember,
there is no virtue in a person who can commit seven hundred sins in a
day!”

It is narrated from Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) when a*Mu’min* commits
forty sins in a day and night, and in repentence recites the following
invocation:

<p dir="rtl">
أسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ الّذِي لا إلَهَ إلاّ هُوَ الحَيُّ القَيُّومُ بَدِيعُ
السَّمَاواتِ وَالأرْضِ ذُو الجَلالِ وَالإكْرَامِ وَأسْأَلُهُ أنْ
يُصَلِّيَ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَأنْ يَتُوبَ عَلَيَّ.
</p>

*Astaghfarullah allazi la ilaha illa huwal haiulqayyumo badeeus samawate
walarz zul jalale wal ikrame waasaalahu an yusalli ala muhammadin wa
aale muhammadin wa atoobo alayya,*

then Allah will pardon his sins.

Miscellaneous Invocations
-------------------------

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) has said that he was surprised why a person
who is scared of an enemy doesn’t recite the following:

<p dir="rtl">
حَسْبُنا اللهُ وَنِعْمَ الوَكِيلُ.
</p>

***Hasbanallaha wa naimal wakeel***

Because Allah has said that those who utter these words have acquired a
great Bounty.

The Imam (as) was surprised that why people don’t recite the following
words that Prophet Yunus (as) recited while he was in the belly of the
fish:

<p dir="rtl">
لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنْ الظَّالِمِينَ.
</p>

***La ilaha anta subhanaka inni kunto min azzaalemeen***

Because Allah says that He heard the prayer of Yunus and gave him relief
from his trouble.

The Imam (as) wondered that when a person’s enemies are deceitful
against him, he doesn’trecite these words

<p dir="rtl">
أُفَوِّضُ أَمْرِي إِلَى اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَصِيرٌ بِالْعِبَادِ.
</p>

***Ufawwazo amri ilallahi innallaha baseerum bilibaad***

Because Allah says, thereafter, that when the*Mu’mins* of the Tribe of
Pharo recited these words, He protected them from the deceit of their
enemies.

The Imam (as) wondered that when a person aspires for wealth and
property, why doesn’t he recite the following words

<p dir="rtl">
مَا شَاءَ اللهُ <p dir="rtl">
لا حَوْلَ وَلا قُوَّةَ إلاّ باللهِ.
</p>
</p>

***Maasha Allaha lahaula wala quwwata illa billahi***

Because thereafter, Allah has promised to answer the*Mu’min’s* prayers.

One person complained to the Prophet (S) about fears and the burden of
debts. The Prophet (S) advised him to recite the following words

<p dir="rtl">
تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى الحَيِّ الّذِي لا يَمُوتُ، وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي
لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ شَرِيكٌ فِي الْمُلْكِ وَلَمْ
يَكُنْ لَهُ وَلِيٌّ مِنْ الذُّلِّ وَكَبِّرْهُ تَكْبِيرًا.
</p>

***Tawakkalto alalhai al lazi la yamooto wal hamdu lillahil lazi lam
yattakhizo sahebatan wa la waladan wa lam yakunlahu shareekun filmulke
wa lam yakunlahu waliun min azzulle wakabirrehu takbeera***

The prophet of Islam (S) narrated that prophet Adam (as) complained to
Allah about fears and uneasiness. Jibrael (as) came and said that if he
recited the following words, his fears would vanish

<p dir="rtl">
لا حَوْلَ وَلا قُوَّةَ إلاّ باللهِ.
</p>

***La haula wa la quwwata illa billahi***

Also the Prophet of Allah (S) said that Allah will shower His Bounties
on a person who recited the words

<p dir="rtl">
الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ.
</p>

***Al hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen***

The person who is engulfed in sorrow and difficulties should recite

<p dir="rtl">
لا حَوْلَ وَلا قُوَّةَ إلاّ باللهِ الْعَلِيِّ العَظِيمِ.
</p>

***La haula wala quwwata illa billahil alil azeem***

The Prophet (S) also said that one Night of*Meraj* Allah has sent the
following words through a Revelation

<p dir="rtl">
لا حَوْلَ وَلا قُوَّةَ إلاّ باللهِ وَلا مَلْجَأَ مِنْكَ إلاّ إلَيْكَ.
</p>

***La haula wala quwwata illa billahi wala maljaam minka illa ilaika***

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) has said that when a person recites the
following words, while offering supplications, his prayers will
definitely be answered:

<p dir="rtl">
مَا شَاءَ اللهُ <p dir="rtl">
لا حَوْلَ وَلا قُوَّةَ إلاّ باللهِ.
</p>
</p>

***Maasha allaho lahaula wala quwwata illa billahi***

The Imam (as) also said when a person recites the following words seven
times

<p dir="rtl">
يَا أرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِينَ.
</p>

***Ya arham ar rahemeen***

The angels say, ‘your voice has been heard by the*Arham ar Rahemeen* and
whatever you have wished for will be granted by Him!’

And when a person repeats ten times the words

<p dir="rtl">
يَا اَللهُ.
</p>

***Ya Allaho***

Then Allah says, ‘Ask for whatever is required by you!’

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (as) said: When a person is afflicted with difficulties
he should continuously recite

<p dir="rtl">
يَا رَؤُفُ يَا رَحِيمُ.
</p>

***Ya Raoofo ya Raheemo***

It is narrated from Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) when one recites the
verses of “*Qul hu walla* ,” “*Inna anzalna* ” and “*Ayat al Kursi* ”

Facing the Kaaba, Allah will definitely answer his wishes because these
contain the*Ism al-Azam* (the ineffable words).

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (as) has said the following are Ineffable Words

<p dir="rtl">
يَا حَيُّ يَا قَيُّومُ.
</p>

***Ya haiyo ya Qayyum***

It is narrated from Imam ‘Ali bin al Husayn (as) that the following
supplication is based on Ism al-Azam and reciting it will get the
prayers answered:

<p dir="rtl">
يَا اَللهُ يَا اَللهُ يَا اَللهُ وَحْدَكَ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَكَ أنْتَ
المَنَّانُ بَدِيعُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ ذُو الجَلاَلِ وَالإكْرَامِ
وَذُو الأَسْمَاءِ العِظَامِ وَذُو العِزِّ الَّذِي لاَ يُرامُ،
﴿وَإِلَهُكُمْ إِلَهٌ وَاحِدٌ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الرَّحْمَانُ
الرَّحِيمُ.﴾ وَصَلّى اللهُ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِهِ أجْمَعِينَ.
</p>

***Ya allaho ya Allaho ya Allaho wahdaka wahdaka la shareeka laka antal

ajmaeen***

It is narrated from Sakeen bin Ammar that one night he was asleep in the
city of Mecca. He saw a person in the dream asking him to awaken and see
that a person was reciting Invocations to Allah. He awoke from the
sleep, but fell asleep again. He saw the same dream a second time. He
awoke and fell asleep again. When he saw the dream again, he heard a
loud voice saying that Imam Musa bin Ja’far (as) reciting the Ism
al-Azam. He took a bath, wore fresh clothes and went near the*Hajr
al-Aswad.* He found a revered person prostrating toward the Kaaba. He
went and stood near him. When he heard intently, the following words
were audible to him:

<p dir="rtl">
يَا نُورُ يَا قُدُّوسُ
</p>

*Yanooro ya quddooso (three times)*

<p dir="rtl">
يَا حَيُّ يَا قَيُّومُ
</p>

*Ya haiyo ya Qayyumo (three times)*

<p dir="rtl">
يَا حَيُّ لاَ يَمُوتُ
</p>

*Ya haiyo la yamooto (three times)*

<p dir="rtl">
يَا حَيُّ حِينَ لاَ حَيُّ
</p>

*Ya haiyo heena la haiyo (three times)*

<p dir="rtl">
يَا حَيُّ لاَ إلَهَ إلاّ أنْتَ
</p>

*Ya haiyo la ilaha illa anta (three times)*

<p dir="rtl">
أسْأَلُكَ بِأَنْ لاَ إلَهَ إلاّ أنْتَ
</p>

*Asaloka be-an la ilaha illa anta (three times)*

Sikeen says that the Imam (as) repeated the words so many times that he
could memorise them.

Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir (as) says that one who recites the following
words will certainly get his prayers answered:

<p dir="rtl">
يَا أسْمَعَ السَّامِعِينَ، وَيَا أبْصَرَ النّاظِرِينَ، وَيَا أسْرَعَ
الحَاسِبِينَ، وَيَا أرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِينَ، وَيَا أحْكَمَ الحَاكِمِينَ.
</p>

***Ya asma as saame eena wa ya absaran naazereena wa ya asraul
haasebeena ya arham ar raahemeena wa ya ahkamul haakemeena***

The Timings For Special Invocations
-----------------------------------

### The Invocations After The Mandatory Prayers Of The Mornings And Evenings

###

Imam Musa al-Kadhim (as) narrates that when you have finished the
evening (*Maghrib)* prayer, then without talking to anyone, say the
following a hundred times:

<p dir="rtl">
بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ وَلاَ حَوْلَ وَلاَ قُوَّةَ إلاّ
بِاللهِ العَلِيِّ العَظِيمِ.
</p>

***Bismillahir Rahmaan ir Raheem la haula wa la quwwata illa billahil
‘Ali il azeem***

Do the same after the morning (*Fajr)* prayers. Allah will ward away a
hundred evils from you because there is*Ism al-Azam* in these words.

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) has said: When a person recites the following
ten times before the sunrise and before the sunset every day, all his
sins committed on that day will be pardoned:

<p dir="rtl">
لاَ إلَهَ إلاّ اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ المُلْكُ وَلَهُ
الحَمْدُ، يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ، وَيُمِيتُ وَيُحْيِي، وَهُوَ حَيٌّ لاَ
يَمُوتُ، بِيَدِهِ الخَيْرُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ.
</p>

***La ilaha il Allaho wahdahu la shareeka lahu lahul mulko wa lahul
hamdo yohi wa yumeeto wa yohi wa huwa hayyun la yamooto be yadahil
khaire wa huwa ala kulle shaiyin qadeer***

Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir (as) has said, “One who recites the*Salawat on
Muhammad and his progeny* ten times at dawn and repeats the following
words

<p dir="rtl">
سُبْحَانَ اللهِ.
</p>

*Subhan Allah (35 times)*

<p dir="rtl">
لاَ إلَهَ إلاّ اللهُ.
</p>

*La ilaha il Allah (35 times)*

<p dir="rtl">
اَلحَمْدُ للهِ.
</p>

*Alhamdu lillah (35 times)*

And repeats the same at dusk, then he will be counted as those who are
busy supplicating to Allah throughout the day. And one who says*allaho
Akbar* a hundred times at dawn and at dusk, he will get Reward equal to
releasing a hundred slaves.

It is narrated that the Prophet of Allah (S) used to revite three
hundred and sixty times every dawn and dusk the following

<p dir="rtl">
اَلحَمْدُ للهِ رَبِّ العَالَمِينَ كَثِيراً عَلَى كُلِّ حَالٍ.
</p>

***Alhamdu lillahi rabbilaalimeen kateeran ala kulle haalin***

He (S) said that there are 360 veins in the human body. Of them 180 are
mobile and the other 180 are static. If, even one mobile vein becomes
static, or any of the static veins becomes mobile, then the person
doesn’t get the sleep and remains restless the whole night. He should
therefore regularly recite the invocation mentioned above.

It is narrated from Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir (as) that one should recite
the following invocation in the mornings:

<p dir="rtl">
أصْبَحْتُ بِاللهِ مُؤمِناً عَلَى دِينِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَسُنَّتِهِ وَدِينِ
عَلِيٍّ وَسُنَّتِهِ وَدِينِ الأوْصِياءِ وَسُنَّتِهِمْ، آمَنْتُ
بِسِرِّهِمْ وَعَلانِيَتِهِمْ وَشَاهِدِهِمْ وَغَائِبِهِمْ، وَأعُوذُ
بِاللهِ مِمَّا اسْتَعَاذَ مِنْهُ رَسُولُ اللهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ
وَآلِهِ وَعَلِيٌّ وَالأوْصِياءُ صَلَواتُ اللهِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأرْغَبُ إلى
اللهِ فِي مَا رَغَبُوا إلَيْهِ وَلاَ حَوْلَ وَلا قُوَّةَ إلاّ بِاللهِ.
</p>

***I have risen with belief in Allah and on the faith of Mohammad and
his tradition and the faith of ‘Ali and his his Asbahto billahi moomenan

It is also narrated from the Prophet of Allah (S) that one who recites
the following supplication before the sunrise, an angel will take it on
its wings and go to the Firmament. When it arrives there, the other
angels ask him what it was carrying. It says that it was carrying the
supplication of a*Mu’min.* The angels then pray to Allah for the
acceptance of the*Mu’min’s supplication.* Similarly all the angels and
the people of the Firmament will pray on his behalf. This supplication
is treasured with the record of the good deeds of the*Mu’min.*

<p dir="rtl">
اَللهُ أكْبَرُ اللهُ أكْبَرُ كَبِيراً، وَسُبْحَانَ اللهِ بُكْرَةً
وَأصِيلاً، وَالحَمْدُ للهِ رَبِّ العَالِمِينَ كَثِيراً لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ
وَصَلَّى اللهُ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِهِ.
</p>

*“Allah is the Most Great, Allah is the Most Great, and Glory to Allah
in the morning and sunset, and plenty of praise to Allah the Lord of the
worlds, He has no partner, and may Allah send his blessings upon
Mohammad and the children of Mohammad?”*

Prophet Ibrahim (as) used to recite the following supplication thrice
every morning. Allah used to keep him safe from all calamities the whole
day:

<p dir="rtl">
أصْبَحْتُ وَرَبِّي مَحْمُودٌ، أصْبَحْتُ لا أُشْرِكُ بِاللهِ شَيْئاً وَلا
أدْعُو مَعَ اللهِ إلَهاً وَلا أتَّخِذُ مِنْ دُونِهِ وَلِيّاً.
</p>

*“I have risen in praise to my Lord, I have risen and I do not accept
parteners with Allah and I do not seek with Allah another lord and I do
not see any guardian but Him?”*

It is narrated from Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir (as) that before talking to
anyone in the morning, one should recite the*Sura al-Qadr* and blow on
the Aqeeq stone (cornelian) and then recite the following supplication:

<p dir="rtl">
آمَنْتُ بِاللهِ وَحْدَهُ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَكَفَرْتُ بِالجِبْتِ
وَالطّاغُوتِ وَآمَنْتُ بِسِرِّ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلانِيَتِهِمْ
وَظَاهِرِهِمْ وَبَاطِنِهِمْ وَأوَّلِهِمْ وَآخِرِهِمْ.
</p>

*“I believe in Allah alone without any partner and I disbelieve in idols
and false deities and I believe in what is kept safe and secret and what
is*

*announced by the children of Mohammad and by what they reveal and hide,
and in the first and last amongst them. ?”*

Then Allah will save him from all calamities that day.

It is narrated from Amir’ul-Mu’mineen (as) that anyone who recites the
following verse three times at the time of*Maghrib* prayer, till the
next morning he will not suffer any loss and he will be safe from
natural calamities:

<p dir="rtl">
فَسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ حِينَ تُمْسُونَ وَحِينَ تُصْبِحُونَ. وَلَهُ
الْحَمْدُ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَعَشِيًّا وَحِينَ تُظْهِرُونَ
</p>

***“So glory be to Allah when you enter the night and when you enter the
morning and unto Him be praise in the heavens and the earth! - and at
the sun's decline and in the noonday.”– 30.18***

Amir’ul-Mu’mineen has said that anyone who recited three times the
following words every morning and evening, then Allah will certainly
enter him into the Heaven:

<p dir="rtl">
رَضِيتُ بِاللهِ رَبّاً وَبِالإسْلاَمِ دِيناً وَبِمُحَمَّدٍ صَلّى اللهُ
عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ نَبِيّاً وَبِالقُرْآنِ بَلاغاً وَبِعَلِيٍّ
وَالأَوْصِياءِ مِنْ وُلْدِهِ أَئِمَّةً.
</p>

*“I am satisfied to have Allah as my Lord and Islam as my faith and
Mohammad, may Allah send His blessings upon him and his children,as a
prophet, and Qur’an as a warner, and ‘Ali and the appointed ones among
his children as Imams.?”*

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) has said that one who recites the following
words 25 times every day, then Allah will write one virtue in the names
of all the*Mu’mins* from Adam (as) till the Day of Reckoning and to that
individual he will Reward equal to that of all the*Mu’mins:*

<p dir="rtl">
اَللّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِلمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالمُؤمِناتِ وَالمُسْلِمِينَ
وَالمُسْلِماتِ.
</p>

*“O Allah bestow your forgiveness to the believers(men and women), and
to muslims(men and women).”*

Halqam asked Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as), ‘Ya Bin Rasool Allah (as)! Teach
me a supplication that will be beneficial for me now and also in the
Hereafter.” The Imam said: After the*Fajr* prayer, till the dawn, recite
the following:

<p dir="rtl">
سُبْحَانَ اللهِ العَظِيمِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ، أسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ وَأسْأَلُهُ
مِنْ فَضْلِهِ.
</p>

*“Glory is to Allah the great and praise is to Him, I seek forgiveness
from Allah and I ask Him His grace.? ”*

### Supplications After Every Mandatory Prayer

###

In the supplications to be recited after eyery mandatory prayer, the
best is the*Tasbeeh al-Fatima (as).* It requires reciting:

<p dir="rtl">
اَللهُ أكْبَرُ
</p>

*Allaho Akbar, Allah is the Greatest (34 times)*

<p dir="rtl">
اَلحَمْدُ للهِ
</p>

*Alhamdu lillah, Praise is for Allah (33 times)*

<p dir="rtl">
سُبْحانَ اللهِ
</p>

*Subhan Allah, Glory is to Allah (33 times)*

Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir (as) has said that after every mandatory prayer,
there is no better invocation than the*Tasbeeh al-Fatima (as)* . If
there was any other, more effective, way of Praising Allah, the Prophet
(S) would most certainly haveinstructed his daughter about that.

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq has said that reciting the*Tasbeeh al-Fatima (as)*
after every compulsory prayer is better than performing a thousand
genuflections. One should say once after reciting the*Tasbeeh* the
following words:

<p dir="rtl">
لاَ إلَهَ إلاّ اللهُ
</p>

*La ilaha il Allah, There is no God save He*

Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir (as) has said, One who sits quietly after each
mandatory prayer and recites thrice the following words, Allah will
pardon all his sins:

<p dir="rtl">
أسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ الّذِي لاَ إلَهَ إلاَّ هُوَ الحَيُّ القَيُّومُ ذُو
الجَلالِ وَالإكْرَامِ وَأتُوبُ إلَيْهِ.
</p>

*“I seek forgiveness from the Lord (testifying) There is no God other
than Him The Living and the Everlasting Of Majesty and Splendour And I
turn to Him In Repentence!”*

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq has said that if a person recites thirty times the
following words after each compulsory prayer, all his sins will be
pardoned:

<p dir="rtl">
سُبْحانَ اللهِ
</p>

*Subhan Allah, Glory is to Allah*

It is narrated from Amir’ul-Mu’mineen (as) if one desires to depart from
this world as innocent as he was at his birth, then he should recite
the*Sura al-Iqlaas* twelve times after every compulsory prayer and then
raise his hands towards the sky and recite the following invocation:

<p dir="rtl">
اَللّهُمَّ إنِّي أسْأَلُكَ بِاسْمِكَ المَكْنُونِ المَخْزُونِ الطّاهِرِ
الطُّهْرِ المُبَارَكِ، وَأسْأَلُكَ بِاسْمِكَ العَظِيمِ وَسُلْطَانِكَ
القَدِيمِ، يا وَاهِبَ العَطايَا وَيَا مُطْلِقَ الأسَارَى وَيَا فَكَّاكَ
الرِّقَابِ مِنَ النّارِ، أَسْأَلُكَ أنْ تُصَلِّيَ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ
مُحَمَّدٍ وَأنْ تَعْتِقَ رَقَبَتِي مِنَ النّارِ، وَأنْ تُخْرِجَنِي مِنَ
الدُّنْيا آمِناً، وأنْ تُدْخِلَنِيَ الجَنَّةَ سَالِماً، وأنْ تَجْعَلَ
دُعائِي أوَّلَهُ فَلاحاً وَأوْسَطَهُ نَجاحاً وَآخِرَهُ صَلاحاً إنَّكَ
أنْتَ عَلاَّمُ الغُيُوبِ.
</p>

*“O Allah, I ask You by Your hidden, safeguarded, pure, purifying and
blessed name, and I ask You by Your great name and Your everexisting
power, O Giver of gifts and unleasher of captives, who unties necks from
the hellfire, I ask you to send blessings on Mohammad and the children
of Mohammad, and to free my neck from the hellfire, and to save my faith
in this world and to let me into paradise, and to help me ask for wishes
that start with prosperity, and continue in success, and end with
goodness. إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ عَلامُ الغُيُوبِ ). You are indeed the Knower
of the Unseen”*

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (as) was asked about the method of offering salutations
to the Prophet (S) and his*Ahl-ul-Bayt (as)* after the mandatory
prayers. The Imam (as) asked one to say the following:

<p dir="rtl">
اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ،
اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنَ عَبْدِاللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ
يَا خِيَرَةَ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا حَبِيبَ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ
عَلَيْكَ يَا صفْوَةَ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا أمِينَ اللهِ،
أشْهَدُ أنَّكَ رَسُولُ اللهِ، وَأشْهَدُ أنَّكَ مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ
عَبْدِاللهِ، وَأشْهَدُ أنَّكَ قَدْ نَصَحْتَ لأُمَّتِكَ، وَجَاهَدْتَ فِي
سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ، وَعَبَدْتَهُ حَتّى أتَاكَ اليَقِينُ، فَجَزاكَ اللهُ يَا
رَسُولَ اللهِ أفْضَلَ مَا جَزَى نَبِيّاً عَنْ أُمَّتِهِ، اَللَّهُمَّ
صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ أَفْضَلَ مَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى
إبْرَاهِيمَ وَآلِ إبْرَاهِيمَ إنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ.
</p>

*“Peace be upon you O Messenger of Allah and His mercy and blessings be
upon you, Peace be upon you O Mohammad son of Abdullah,* *Peace be upon
you O Elect of Allah,* *Peace be upon you O Beloved of Allah, Peace be
upon you O Preferred by Allah, Peace be upon you O Trustee of Allah , I
testify that you are His Messenger, and you are Muhammad son of
Abdullah; and I testify that you had advised your community (Ummah) and
that you have strived in the path of your Lord, and that you have
worshipped Him until the end,so may Allah reward you, O Messenger of
Allah, with the best reward a Prophet or a Messenger ever received on
behalf of his Community, O Allah send blessings on Mohammad and the
children of Mohammad more pleasant than the blessings on Ibrahim and the
children of Ibrahim, verily You are worthy of praise and glory.”*

It is narrated from Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) that after every mandatory
prayer he continued sitting at the place of the prayer till he cursed
four accursed men andfour accursed women of the*ummat.*

### Invocations After Zuhr Prayer

###

It is narrated from Amir’ul-Mu’mineen ‘Ali (as) that the Prophet of
Allah (S) used to recite the following supplication after the*Zuhr*
prayer.

<p dir="rtl">
لا إِلهَ إِلا اللّهُ الْعَظِيمُ الْحَلِيمُ، لا إِلهَ إِلا اللّهُ رَبّ
الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمُ، الْحَمْدُ لِلّهِ رَبّ الْعَالَمِينَ. اللّهُمّ
إِنّي أَسْأَلُكَ مُوجِبَاتِ رَحْمَتِكَ، وَعَزَائِمَ مَغْفِرَتِكَ،
وَالْغَنِيمَةَ مِنْ كُلّ بِرّ، وَالسّلامَةَ مِنْ كُلّ إِثْمٍ. اللّهُمّ
لا تَدَعْ لِي ذَنْبًا إِلا غَفَرْتَهُ، وَلا هَمًّا إِلا فَرّجْتَهُ، وَلا
سُقْمًا إِلا شَفَيْتَهُ، وَلا عَيْبًا إِلا سَتَرْتَهُ، وَلا رِزْقًا إِلا
بَسَطْتَهُ، وَلا خَوْفًا إِلا آمَنْتَهُ، وَلا سُوءً إِلا صَرَفْتَهُ،
وَلا
</p>

<p dir="rtl">
حَاجَةً هِيَ لَكَ رِضًا وَلِيَ فِيهَا صَلاحٌ إِلا قَضَيْتَهَا يَا
أَرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِينَ، آمِينَ رَبّ الْعَالَمِينَ.
</p>

*“In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.*

*There is no god But Allah, the Great, the Clement: there is no god but
Allah, the Lord of ‘Arsh (the throne) of Grace; and all praise is for
Allah, the Lord of the worlds: O’ Allah I beseech Thee for all that time
which is the cause of Thy Mercy, and that which ascertain Thy
Forgiveness: and the benefit of every virtue, and safety from every sin:
O’ Allah leave not any sin on me but that You forgive it, and any
affliction but that You remove it, and any illness but that You heal it,
and any defect but that You conceal it, and*

*any subsistence but that You increase it, and any fear but that You
protect (me) from it; and any evil but that You repel it, an any of my
need in which is Thy pleasure and which is beneficial for me, but that
You grant it; O’ that Most Merciful, grant me my supplication, O’ the
Lord of the worlds”*

### The Supplication After Asr Prayer

###

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq has said that a person who says*Asthgfar* seventy
time after the Asr prayer, Allah will pardon his seven hundred sins. If
he doesn’t have so many sins in his account, Allah will pardon the sins
of his parents or other relatives.

The Prophet of Allah (S) has said that the person who recites*Astaghfar*
once after the Asr prayer, Allah will forgive all his sins.
The*Astaghfar* is as follows

<p dir="rtl">
أَسْتَغْفِرُ اللّهَ الّذِي لا إِلهَ إِلا هُوَ الْحَيّ الْقَيّومُ
الرّحْمنُ الرّحِيمُ، ذُو الْجَلالِ وَالاكْرَامِ، وَأَسْألُهُ أَنْ
يَتُوبَ عَلَيّ تَوْبَةَ عَبْدٍ ذَلِيلٍ خَاضِعٍ فَقِيرٍ، بَائِسٍ
مِسْكِينٍ مُسْتَكِينٍ مُسْتَجِيرٍ، لا يَمْلِكُ لِنَفْسِهِ نَفْعًا وَلا
ضَرًّا وَلا مَوْتًا وَلا حَيَاةً وَلا نُشُورًا.
</p>

*“I ask forgiveness of Allah, (who is) "There is no god save He,"
everliving, eternal, beneficent, merciful, owner of might and majesty. I
beseech Him to accept my repentance, the repentance of a
servant-insignificant, submissive, destitute, needy, worried and
helpless seeking protection, who, on his own, neither can win nor lose,
nor die, nor live, nor come to life again.”*

### The Invocations After The Late Night Prayers

###

Imam Muhammad Taqi (as) has said that one who recites the verse*Inna
anzalna* after the mandatory maghribain prayers, he will remain in the
care of Allah till the morning.

Sheik Toosi has said that after the late night prayer (*namaz al-Shab)*
one should recite ten times*Surat Al-Fatiha, Sura Qul huwalla, Sura Qul
auzu berabbil naas, Sura Qul auzu Berabbil falaq.* Also recite ten
times*Tasbeehaat al-Arba and the Salawat.*

### Sajda al-Shukr- The Prostration Of Thanksgiving

###

Prostration of thanksgiving after every mandatory prayer was the
practice (*Sunna Mu’akkada* ) of the Prophet (S).

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) has hinted at it’s being mandatory and said
that when a person makes a prostration of thanksgiving, Allah addresses
the angels and tells them that a sincere creature is doing the*Sajda
al-Shukr.* He asks the angels to suggest what Reward must be given to
the person. The angels would suggest that Allah keep His Blessings with
the person for his act. Allah will again ask them what else should be
the Reward for the person?

The angels say, ‘O Sustainer! Give him a place in the Heaven!’ Allah
will again ask the angels,’ What else?’ The angels reply, ‘O Allah! Give
a place in the Heaven for the person’s parents and children, as well!’
Allah will again ask the angels to suggest some more Reward for the
person. The angels would reply,’ We have made suggestions to the best of
our

knowledge! We have nothing else to suggest! You know everything!’ Then
Allah would say, ‘The person has thanked Me in all sincerity and
humility, therefore, in return, I too shall thank him!’

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (as) has said that while making the prostration of
thanksgiving, a person should say*Shukran lillah* atleast three times.
Also he should say a hundred times*Afwan or Shukran.* Either in
prostration he should first say a hundred times*Afwan or Al-afu Al-afu.*
Then he should keep the right cheek at the place of prostration and s
make any supplication as, for example,*Ya Allaho, Ya Rabbaho, Ya
Syedaho.* Similarly he should keep his left cheek at the place of
prostration and say the same words. In the end he should place his
forehead at the same spot and repeat*Shukran Shukran ya Shukran Allah* a
hundred times.

Remember that this prostration is not a part of the mandatory prayer.
This is only a*Sunna.* While doing this, the person should place his
chest and the tummy on the ground, spread his arms and keep his kness
flat on the ground. He should pray for the welfare of himself and all
the*Mu’mineen* with tearful eyes. Allah likes his creatures imploring
Him for help in this manner.

Our Imams (as) used to make long prostrations of thanksgiving. Specially
Imam Musa al-Kadhim (as) used to do the*sajda* after completing
his*fajr* prayer which stretched well into the sun up. When he was asked
about his*Sajda al-Shukr,* the Imam (as) said, one should recite the
following supplication while doing the*Sajda:*

<p dir="rtl">
اَللَّهُمَّ إِنّي أُشْهِدُكَ وَأُشْهِدُ مَلائِكَتَكَ وَأَنْبِيَائَكَ
وَرُسُلَكَ وَجَمِيعَ خَلْقِكَ أنَّكَ اللهُ رَبّي وَالإسْلامَ دِينِي
وَمُحَمّدًا نَبِيِّي وَعَلِيّاً وَالحَسَنَ وَالحُسَيْنَ وَعَلِيَّ بْنَ
الحُسَيْنِ وَمُحَمَّدَ بْنَ عَلِيٍّ وَجَعْفَرَ بْنَ مُحَمَّدٍ وَمُوسَى
بْنَ جَعْفَرٍ وَعَلِيَّ بْنَ مُوسَى وَمُحَمَّدَ بْنَ عَلِيٍّ وَعَلِيَّ
بْنَ مُحَمَّدٍ وَالحَسَنَ بْنَ عَلِيٍّ وَالحُجَّةَ بْنَ الحَسَنِ
أَئِمَّتِي بِهِمْ أَتَوَلَّى وَمِنْ أعْدَائِهِمْ أَتَبَرَّأُ.
</p>

*“O Allah I bear witness to you, your angels and your prophets and your
messengers and all your creations, that you Allah, is my Lord and Islam
is my religion and Muhammad is my prophet, ‘Ali, Hasan, Husain, ‘Ali son
of Husain, and Muhammad son of ‘Ali, Jaffer son of Muhammad, Musa son of
Jaffer, ‘Ali son of Musa, Muhammad son of ‘Ali, ‘Ali son of Muhammad,
Hasan son of ‘Ali and the Proof, son of Hasan , are my Imams and I
follow them and denounce their enemies.”*

Then the person should recite*Shukran* a hundred times and also say
the*Salawat.*

Afterwards he should say thrice:

<p dir="rtl">
اَللَّهُمَّ إنِّي أَنْشُدُكَ دَمَ المَظْلُومِ.
</p>

***Allahumma inni unshudaka dam al mazloom***

Then repeat the following thrice as well:

<p dir="rtl">
اَللَّهُمَّ إنِّي أَنْشُدُكَ بِإيوَائِكَ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ لأعْدَائِكَ
لَتُهْلِكَنَّهُمْ بِأيْدِينَا وَأيْدِي المُؤْمِنِينَ، اَللَّهُمَّ إنّي
أنْشُدُكَ بِإيوَائِكَ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ لأوْلِياءِكَ لَتُظْفِرَنَّهُمْ
بِعَدُوِّكَ وَعَدُوِّهِمْ أنْ تُصَلِّيَ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى
المُسْتَحْفَظِينَ مِنْ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ.
</p>

***Allahumma inni unsheduka bayuaayeka ala nafseka leaadayeka
letuhlaknahum beaidiana wa aidial Mu’mineena allahumma inni ansheduka
beyuaieka ala nafseka leauliyaeka letuzfera behim beaduweka wa aduwwehim
antusalle ala Muhammadin wa alal mustahfezeena min aale Muhammadin***

Then he should recite the following thrice:

<p dir="rtl">
اَللَّهُمَّ إنّي أسْأَلُكَ اليُسْرَ بَعْدَ العُسْرِ.
</p>

***Allahumma inni asalukal yusra baadal usre***

Then he should keep his right cheek at the place of prostration and
repeat thrice the following:

<p dir="rtl">
يَا كَهفِي حِينَ تُعيِينِي المَذاهِبُ وَتَضيقُ عَليَّ الأرْضُ بِما
رَحُبَتْ وَيا بَارِئَ خَلقِي رَحْمَةً بِي وَكُنْتَ عَن خَلقِي غَنِيّاً،

***Ya kahufi heena tuainil mazahiba wa tuzeeqa alalarze bema rahubato wa

Then the left cheek is kept at the place of prostration and the

### The Supplications Before Going To Bed

###

Before sleeping it is adv’Isable to do the ablution. One should sleep on
the right arm. And keep the face towards the*Kaaba.* It is better to
recite the*Tasbeeh al-Fatima* before going to bed that he doesn’t get
disturbing dreams.

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) has said that before going to bed one should
recite the sura*Inna anzalna* eleven times and also sura*Iqlas* eleven
times. One who does this, will be pardoned his sins during the next
fifty years. If someone sees disturbing dreams, he should recite
the*maoozatain,* that is,*Qul aaoozo berabbil falaq and Qul aaoozo
Berabbil Naas* before going to bed.

Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir (as) says that when one turns in the bed, he
should say:

<p dir="rtl">
اَلحَمْدُ للهِ وَاللهُ أكْبَرُ
</p>

*Alhamdu lillah wallaho akbar*

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) has said that when a person wishes to wake up
at a particular time in the night, he should recite the following before
going to bed:

<p dir="rtl">
اَللّهُمَّ لا تُنْسِنِي ذِكْرَكَ وَلا تُؤَمِّنِّي مَكْرَكَ وَلا
تَجْعَلْنِي مِن الغَافِلِينَ وأَنْبِهْنِي لأَحَبِّ السَّاعَاتِ إلَيْكَ
أدْعُوكَ فِيها فَتَسْتَجِيبَ لِي وَأسْأَلُكَ فَتُعْطِيَنِي
وَأَسْتَغْفِرُكَ فَتَغْفِرَ لِي إنَّهُ لا يَغفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إلاّ أنْتَ
يا أرْحَمَ الرّاحِمِينَ.
</p>

*Allahumma la tunsini zikraka wa la tumani makruka wa la tajalni min al
ghafeleena wa anabbehuni leuhibbul saa aate ilaika adooka fiha
fatastajeebo li wa asaluka fatuhtaini wa astaghferuka fataghfirli innahu
la egferul zunooba illa anta ya arham ar rahemeen*

Syed Taoos has quoted from Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) that if a believer
wishes to see the Prophet (S) in his dream, then after the*Isha* prayer
he should take a bath of purification, offer four genuflections of
prayer and in each of these genuflections he should he should recite
Sura*Hamd* once and*Ayat al Kursi* a hundred times. After the prayer he
should offer*Durood* on the Prophet (S) and His Holy Progeny (as) a
thousand times. The person then should sleep in a dress free of any
impurity. He should keep his right hand under his head while lying down
to sleep and say a hundred times:

<p dir="rtl">
سُبْحَانَ اللّهِ، وَالْحَمْدُ للّهِ، وَلا إِلهَ إِلا اللّهُ، وَاللّهُ
أَكْبَرُ، وَلا حَوْلَ وَلا قُوّةَ إِلا بِاللّهِ.
</p>

*Subhan allah wal hamdu lillah wa la ilaha il Allaho wallaho akbar wa la
haula wala quwwata illa billah*

And he should say a hundred times these words before sleeping:

<p dir="rtl">
مَا شَاءَ اللهُ
</p>

*Masha Allah*

He will witness the Prophet of Allah (S) in his dream.

And if a person wishes to see Amir’ul-Mu’mineen (as) in his dream, he
should recite the following supplication before going to bed:

<p dir="rtl">
اَللَّهُمّ إنّي أسْألُكَ يَا مَنْ لَهُ لُطْفٌ خَفِيٌّ وأيَادِيهِ
باسِطَةٌ لا تَنْقَضِي أسْأَلُكَ بِلُطْفِكَ الَّذِي مَا لَطُفْتَ بهِ
لِعَبدٍ إلاّ كُفِيَ أنْ تُرِيَنِي مَولايَ أمِيرَ المُؤمِنِينَ عَلَيهِ
السَّلامُ في مَنامِي.
</p>

*Allahumma inni asaluka ya man lahu lutfun khafiun wa ayadaihe basitatun
la tanquzi asoluka belutfekal khafi allazi ma latafta behi leabdil akfa
an turiani maulaya ameeralMu’mineena fi manayaa*

If someone wishes to see a dead and departed relative in his dream, he
should do the ablution, recite the*Tasbeeh al-Fatima* , and then recite
the following invocation

<p dir="rtl">
اَللَّهُمّ! أنْتَ الحَيُّ الّذِي لا يُوصَفُ وَالإيمَانُ يُعْرَفُ مِنْهُ،
مِنْكَ بَدَتِ الاَشْياءُ وَإلَيكَ تَعُودُ، فَما أقْبَلَ مِنْها كُنْتَ
مَلْجَأَهُ وَمَنْجاهُ، وَما أدْبَرَ مِنهَا لَمْ يَكُنْ لهُ مَلْجَأٌ وَلا
مَنْجًى مِنْكَ إلاّ إلَيْكَ، وَأسْألُكَ بِلا إلَهَ إلاّ أنْتَ،
وأسْأَلُكَ بِبِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ وَبِحَقِّ حَبِيبِكَ
مُحَمَّدٍ صَلّى اللهُ عَلَيهِ وَآلِهِ سَيِّدِ النَّبِيِّينَ وَبِحَقِّ
عَلِيٍّ خَيْرِ الوَصِيِّينَ وَبِحَقِّ فَاطِمَةَ سَيِّدَةِ نِسَاءِ
العَالَمِينَ وَبِحَقِّ الحَسَنِ وَالحُسَيْنِ الَّذَيْنِ جَعَلْتَهُما
سَيِّدَيْ شَبابِ أهْلِ الجَنَّةِ عَلَيْهِم أجْمَعِينَ السَّلامُ أنْ
تُصَلِّيَ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِهِ وَأنْ تُرِيَنِي مَيِّتِي فِي الحَالِ
الَّتِي هُوَ فِيهَا.
</p>

*“Oh Allah, you are the Alive who can not be describedand faith is known
by you, you are the origin of things and everything goes back to you,
whoever has worked for your sakeyou were their refuge and savior, and
whoever has not has not refuge or salvation from you except you, and I
ask you with*

Amongst the most popular supplications is the*Namaz
al-Amir’ul-Mu’mineen.* This requires one to offer four genuflections of
prayer and two*salaams (benedictions).* In every genuflection (*Rakat)*
after reciting the*Sura al-Fateha* one should recite the*Sura al-Ahad*
fifty times. When a person completes this prayer, all his sins would
have been pardoned by Allah!
