The Limited Obedience
=====================

The Father
----------

My child! As important as it is to obey your father and mother, you
should know that is is not an absolute must. In instances where the
parents are corrupt and they encourage the child in doing wrong and
illegal actions, one ought not obey them. Nevertheless, treating them
with respect is always recommended. The almighty Allah says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَإِنْ جَاهَدَاكَ عَلَىٰ أَنْ تُشْرِكَ بِي مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ
فَلَا تُطِعْهُمَا ۖ وَصَاحِبْهُمَا فِي الدُّنْيَا مَعْرُوفًا ۖ
  </p>
</blockquote>

 ***“But if they strive to make thee join in worship with me, things of
which thou hast no knowledge, obey*** ***them not, yet bear them company
in this life with justice (and consideration)”*** **(The Holy Qur'an
31:15)**

Imam ‘Ali (as) in Nahjul-Balaghah, which after the Glorious Qur'an is
the best guide for mankind, says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ان للوالد على الولد حقا ... فحق الوالدان يطيعه في كل شىء الا في معصية
الله سبحانه.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“An obligation of a child to his father is to obey him in all but not
sinfulness actions.”* [^1]

The Child
---------

Yes, what you are saying is absolute truth. Of course, breaking Allah's
rules even upon the instant of father and mother is wrong.
