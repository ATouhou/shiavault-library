Method of Reciting Iqama
========================

Recite the following:

Allahu Akbar (God is the greatest) two times Ashhadu al la ilaha illa
llah ( I testify there is no god other than Allah ) two times Ashhadu

Qad qamatis salah (The prayer has begun) two times
Allahu Akbar (God is the greatest) two times

**Performing one s prayer silently and loudly**

There are some prayers which are recited aloud while others are recited
silently. If a person deliberately recites those prayers silently which
are suppose to be performed aloud or recites those prayers aloud which
should be read silently, then his prayer is invalid. You must remember
this important point. Fajr (dawn), first 2 rakats of maghrib (evening),
and isha (night) prayers are performed aloud. All the rakats of zuhr
(noon), asr (afternoon), and the 3r d rakat of maghrib (evening) and
last two rakats of isha (night) are performed silently. In those prayers
which are performed silently, takbir tul al ahram and bismillah al
rahman al raheem are read aloud.

**Place of Prayer**

Despite of the importance of prayer, there are conditions on what place
prayer can be performed in. It cannot be performed in every place.

1. The place where you ar e going to pray should not be usurped.
2. You should not pray in a place which is filled with danger such as a

that its wetness can reach your body or dress.
6. If the place where you will put your forehead is najis (impure),even

**Method of Prayer**

Qayyam (standing) The meaning of qayyam is to stand for prayer. Its
method is standing while facing towards Kaaba. There are different
conditions regarding males and females. When a male stands:

1. He must be standing alert. No part of his body should be bent. His
shoulders should be back.
2. Your feet should not be together. They should be kept a slight
distance apart.
3. Both hands should be upon your thighs above your knees. You should
be looking towards the place where you will perform sajda
(prostration).

**When a female stands:**

1. She should not stand as a male does. Her body should be pulled into
itself and slightly bent.
2. Her feet should be kept together. There should be no distance
between them.
3. Place both of her hands upon her chest.

**Takbira tul Ahtram**

When one stands for prayer and completes qayyam, then raise both of
your hands to the sides of your face with your palms facing towards
Kaaba. Make your niyyat at this time. After making your niyyat, then
immediately say "Allahu Akbar" and put your hands back down.

When you say "Allahu Akbar" with a loud voice, this is what is called
takbira tul ahtram. If someone forgets to say takbir, then his prayer is
invalid. It is enough to say Allahu Akbar once, but it is better to say
it three or seven times. Women should say takbir silently.

**Niyyat (intention)**

Intention is related to one s heart. It is not compulsory to say any
words aloud. For the intention of prayer, say the following words in
your heart: " I am making my intention for the prayer of "Zuhr" wajib
qurbatan illallah". This niyyat is done when you are an adult. If you
are not an adult, then you will say mustahab instead of wajib. If you
are performing a recommended prayer, then you should say Sunnah instead
of wajib.

**Recitation**

When you complete your qayyam, make your niyyat, and recite takbir,
then you must recite Sura al Hamd. Fajr, maghrib, and isha prayers
should be recited aloud. The other prayers are recited silently.

You must say Bismillah al rahman al raheem aloud in every prayer
whether its recitation is aloud or silent. However, females always
recite their prayers silently even those parts which are suppose to be
read aloud. Any sura can be recited after Sura al Hamd, such as Sura
Inna anzalna, Sura Kawthar, or Sura Ikhlas, but it is wajib to read Sura
Ikhlas in the second rakat after Sura al Hamd. One should remember
prayer is invalid without proper recitation. If you are performing
prayer in a gathering, you should say " Alhamdulilah rabil al almeen"
after Sura al Hamd. Never say "ameen" after Sura al Hamd.

In third and fourth rakats, only recite Sura al Hamd. Do not recite any
other sura after it. You can also recite "SubhanAllah,wa Alhamdulilah,
wa La illaha illalah wa Lahu Akbar" instead of Sura al Hamd, but it is
better to recite Sura al Hamd.

**Rukoo**

The first important aspect of prayer is rukoo. One who forgets to
perform rukoo must repeat his whole prayer. When you finish recitation
of Sura al Hamd, then raise your hands and say Allahu Akbar then perform
rukoo. Its method is to bend over while placing both hands upon your
knees and push your knees until they are locked straight. You should put
your right hand first then your left. Stretch your back so it is
parallel with the floor. Keep your neck straight so your head does not
hang down. Then say "Subhana rabbi al- Azeem wa bi hamdih". Reciting it
once is wajib, and if you recite it more than once, it is mustahab.
Although, it is better to recite it three times.

After you have recited this, you cannot immediately go into sajda. You
must first complete your rukoo by again standing in qayyam. So that you
are in the same position as you were before you went into rukoo.

Maintain this position for at least one breath. Then say, "Sami a llahu
liman hamidah". Raise your hands to the sides of your face and say
Allahu Akbar. Then perform your sajda. You should remember you must put
your hands down first upon the floor before your knees. The method of
rukoo for a female is to put both of her hands upon her thighs above her
knees. When she goes into sajda, she should first place her knees and
then her hands upon the floor. She must sit in a way that her body does
not become exposed.

**Qunoot**

In the second rakat of every prayer after reciting Sura al Hamd and
Sura Ikhlas, raise your hands to the sides of your face and say Allahu
Akbar. Then spread them apart with palms facing up in front of your face
and recite dua. This act of prayer is called qunoot. You should read
this dua in qunoot:

Allahu mma ghfirla-na wa-rham-na wa-a fi-na wa-fu "an -na fi-dun ya wal
akhira. Innaka ala kulli shayin qadir. Other than this, you can read any
dua in any language if Arabic is not your mother tongue. After reading
qunoot, raise your hands to the sides of your face and say Allahu Akbar
and then go back into sajda.

**Sajda**

Sajda is performed using seven parts of the body. If you miss one part,
the prayer will become invalid.

1.Forehead
2. & 3. both palms
4 &5 . both knees
6 &7 the big toe of both of your feet

It is wajib (compulsory) to put these seven parts of the body upon the
floor whilst performing sajda, but putting the nose on the ground is the
most beloved act by the Masoomeen (as) even though it is not wajib. If
you love Ahlul Bayt (as), you will consider it just as wajib as the
other parts. Only these eight parts of the body can touch the ground. No
other part of the body should be touching the ground. However, sajda e
shukr, which is a mustahab sajda, whilst performing you can place your
elbows, chest, and stomach on the ground. Basically sajda is performed
on clay especially the clay of Karbala. It is an act filled with
uncountable blessings and reward. If clay is not available, then sajda
can be performed upon other things, such as

1. thin bricks
2. grass but only if your forehead touches the soil
3. on paper that has no writing on it
4. charcoal
5. on the back of your hand
6. wood
7. leaf which cannot be eaten

Apart from these, sajda cannot be performed on any other thing. The
method of performing sajda is different for males and females. W e will
explain these differences. When you perform sajda, put both knees
together and spread your hands wide apart. Do not put your elbows on
your knees. Spread them a little far from your body. Hands should be
beside your shoulders. They should not be in fr ont of your knees.
Spread your hands away from your body on the gr ound. Do not spread your
fingers apart. Keep them closed tightly in your hands. When a male
performs sajda, he should spread his body wide. When a female performs
sajda, she should keep her parts of the body close together and only her
hands should be place far apart.

There are two sajdas in each rakat of prayer. During sajda, read
"Subhanna rabbi al-A la wa-bi-hamdi- h". Reading it once is wajib. If
you read it more than once, it is mustahab.

Although, it is better if you read it three times. While performing
sajda, you can pray for anything in any language r egardless if it is a
w ajib or mustahab prayer. When you raise your head from sajda, before
performing the second sajda, read this: "Astarfghullah rabbi wa atubu
ilay-h" . Then say takbir and return to sajda.

**Sitting**

When you sit, both of your knees should be touching the ground. There
must be a slight distance between them. The top of your left foot should
be touching the ground. The top of the right foot should be laid on top
of the instep of the left foot. Your backside should be touching the
ground. When you stand, stand by using your palms. Say this as you
stand: "Bi-hawli llahi wa-quwwati-hi aqumu wa-as ud" .

When a female sits, she should put her knees together. Her ankles
should be above the ground. (she should be sitting on her feet) When she
gets up, she should stand without placing her hands upon the ground. She
should stand easily. She should not lift the back part of her body
first.

**Tashahud**

The meaning of tashahud is testifying. You must remember Allah has
ordered us to give three testimonies. These three testimonies apply at
all times and in every occasion. The way it is wajib to give three
testimonies in kalima, adhan, and iqama, it is also wajib to give three
testimonies in the tashahud of prayers.

If you deliberately or unintentionally leave out just one of the three
testimonies, then your prayer will be invalid. Tashahud is read after
the completion of two rakats and after the completion of the last rakat
of each prayer. We read tashahud once in fajr prayer and twice in all
other prayers. When you finish the second sajda of the second rakat and
the second sajda of the last rakat, you sit and read tashahud.

" Ashhadu al la ilaha illa llahu wahahu la sharika la-h. W a-ashhadu
anna Muhammadan abdu-hu wa rasool. Wa ashhadu anna Ameerul Momineen wa
Imam ul Muttaqeen Aliyun waliullah W a Aulada Masoomeen Hujajallah wa
Auliyallah. Allahuma salla ala Muhammadin wa Aal e Muhammad." You should
remember at the end of tashahud it is wajib to send durood on Muhammad
(saw) and Aal e Muhammad (as). If you leave it out, your prayer will be
invalid.

**Salam**

In or der to complete one s prayer, in the last rakat after reciting
tashahud, one must recite salam. The prayer is finished after reading
salam. You should read salam in this way: "As -salamu alay-ka ayyuha
nabiyu wa- rahmatu "llahi wa-barakatu-h. Assalamu ala Aimmah tul
rashadeen ul muhadeen. Assalamu alayna wa ala ibadi llahi salihin.
Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatu llahi wa barakatu."

After reading the salam, while raising your hands, say Allahu Akbar
three times. This is the end of the prayer. You must remember it is
compulsory to raise your hands three times while saying Allahu Akbar.
Some people only raise their fingertips without actually lifting their
palms from their thighs. This is the wrong way.

**Jummah and Eid Prayers**

Jummah and Eid prayers are wajib, but in the absence of Imam Zamana
(ajf) both prayers are suspended. The first condition of both prayers is
the apparent rule of the Imam (ajf). In the absence of Imam (ajf), if
someone performs these prayers, then he becomes an oppressor of Imam
(ajf) and has disobeyed Allah. Only Imam (ajf) can lead these prayers
and deliver the khutbat (sermon). This is the reason our Fourth Imam
(as) cursed those people who:

1. Leads these prayers themselves instead of Imam (ajf)
2. People who read these prayers behind a non masoom
3. People who do not lead or perform these prayers themselves but are
pleased with those who do

**Description of Prayer**

So far we have mentioned all the rules regarding prayer and have
explained how to perform prayer. Now we will briefly explain the truth
of prayer. The briefest logical explanation of prayer, which must always
be kept in your mind, is prayer is nothing except the wilayat of Ameerul
Momineen (as). As Moula Ali (as) Himself said, "Anna salatul momineen".
(I am the prayer of momin). Now we will discuss every aspect of prayer
briefly.

Adhan and Iqama

As you have read, while saying adhan and iqama, we call prayer by three
names; salat, falah, and khair ul amal. As you know in Ghadeer when
people were called towards the wilayat of Moula Ali (as), they were
called by saying " Hayya ala khair ul amal". This khair ul amal is
wilayat of Ameerul Momineen (as) as well as a name for prayer. So it has
been proven prayer and wilayat of Moula Ali (as) are the same thing.
This is the reason Moula Ali (as) said, "One who establishes My wilayat
has certainly established prayer." Moula Ali (as) said further, " I am
"hayya ala salah . I am "hayya ala falah . I am "hayya khair ul amal
."

Another very important aspect is when you say the iqama, you say these
words: "Qadqama tis salah". Its translation is "Certainly prayer has
begun". Even though you have not made your niyyat, said takbir, nor read
your prayer, so you must think how is it possible without doing any of
these acts the prayer has begun? Its quite clear that at the time you
testify to the wilayat of Ameerul Momineen (as) the prayer is
established. After reading that whatever you do is simply obeying the
orders of Allah.

**Facing towards Kaaba**

Kaaba is a house made of rocks and cement. It is called the House of
Allah. In Arabic there are two words which are used for house; "darr"
and "beit". Darr is used for every building. Beit is that house in which
a person has spent at least three nights. If you think about this, you
will realize Allah is houseless nor can you even imagine a house for
Him. Then who is He who spent three nights in Kaaba and this is why it
is called "Beit" (House of Allah)? The history of Kaaba is itself a
witness as to why Allah calls this house as His.

No one else except our Moula (as) and His Holy Mother (as) has spent
three nights in the Holy Kaaba. The Kaaba is not the house of Allah
because He is far above the need of a house. This is the house of Moula
Ali (as). This is the will of Allah that when we face Kaaba in prayer,
we must keep remembering Moula Ali (as) in our minds during prayer.

**Absolute Attention**

This word "tawajja is made from wajja. Wajja means face. If you talk to
someone and you turn your face in another direction, it is a very huge
insult. Whenever we speak with someone we turn our face towards them.
This act is called attention. It means you look at the face of the
person who is in front of you.

During prayer, we talk to Allah. Its wajib to turn our face towards the
face of Allah. Every person on this earth knows "W ahjullah" (face of
Allah) is Moula Ali (as). If you do not pay absolute attention towards
Moula Ali (as) in your prayer, then you will be declared an insulter and
disobedient towards Allah. Your prayer will be thr own back in your
face.

**Niyyat (Intention)**

When you make your niyyat for pr ayer and say "qurbatan ilallah , it
means "for the nearness of Allah". W hen you say this , it means you are
performing this prayer to gain the nearness of Allah. Ever y single
person is aware of the fact that inorder for you to be near or far from
someone, they must be in a particular place for you to be near or far
from. However we cannot even imagine a specific place for Allah. Doing
so is absolute kufr (disbelief).

Before making your intention for prayer, you must think what is that
place of Allah which is the reason for our reading this prayer to become
close to Him. If you read Ziarat e Jamiah, it is clearly stated that the
place of Allah is our Twelve Imams (as). Imam Muhammad Baqir (as) said,
"I swear by Allah, there are seventy lines of angels in the heavens. If
all the people who live on this earth, wished to count them, they will
be unable to do so. They all gain the nearness of Allah through Our
wilayat." So "qurbatan ilallah means to gain the nearness of Imam Zamana
(ajf). If your prayer brings you close to Ahlul Bayt (as), then
certainly this is the true and real prayer. If your prayer takes you far
from Ahlul Bayt (as), then certainly such a prayer will take him into
the hell.

**Qayyam**

Qayyam in prayer reminds us that when Imam Zamana (ajf) will reappear,
He will stand and fight against munafiqeen. The purpose of qayyam in
prayer is to prepare for jihad and show our Imam (ajf)we are ready to
help.

Recitation

The meaning of "salat is dua. If we ponder, we will see in all of the
wajib acts of prayer, this is that act where we make dua. The dua is
"Ahadena Siratul Mustaqeem". "O my Lord! Keep me on the true path." The
Sir atul Mustaqeem is the wilayat of Moula Ali (as).

Rukoo

During qayyam we stand and during sajda we place ourselves on the
ground. Rukoo is an act between these two conditions. Quran called Ahlul
Bayt (as) as "Ummah tul Wasta". It means the sacred personalities are
wasila between Creator and creation. Rukoo reminds us about Ahlul Bayt
(as).

Sajda

Who is such a momin on this earth who performs sajda and does not
remember the last sajda of Imam Hussain (as) in Karbala? This is proof
the spirit and truth of our sajdas to remember that sajda which saved
tawheed until the day of judgment. May our live be sacrificed on the
shaheed e Karbala and the one who was brutally murdered on the plains of
Karbala.

We briefly have explained all the aspects of prayer n this book. If you
want to read the details, then pleas e read our book "Kashaful Masail".
I pray to Imam Zamana (ajf) may He accept this ordinary attempt and make
this book useful for the youth of my nation. So that they become momin
and a part of Imam (ajf) s army and helpers. I pray may Allah protect
all the momineen and mominat from the tricks of shaitan and the doubts
which munafiqeen have created will not take their iman from them.
Ameen.

This book "Kashaful Salat" is completed today 11th of August 2006. 15
Rajab 1427 Hijra. on Friday at 5 pm. With the help of Allah and the
blessings of Imam Zamana (ajf).
