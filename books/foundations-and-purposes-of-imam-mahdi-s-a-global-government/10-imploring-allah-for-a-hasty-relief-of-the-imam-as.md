Imploring Allah For a Hasty Relief of the Imam (as)
===================================================

Ahl al-Bait (AS) have emphasized that during the time of occultation we
should make much supplication to Allah that He would hasten the relief.
In his letter to his special deputy, Imam al-Mahdi (AS) wrote:

"As for the manifestation of relief, it depends on Allah and those who
specify time for it are liars... Increase your Du'aa for hastening the
Relief (al-Faraj), for this is indeed your relief..."[^61]

There are two meanings for the above tradition. The first meaning is
that the relief of Imam al-Mahdi (AS) would result in relief from our
sufferings. The other meaning is that the very act of praying for the
relief of Imam al-Mahdi (AS) would be recompensed with personal relief
from our problems even before the advent of Imam al-Mahdi (AS) (i.e.,
before the time for general/universal relief).

There is a famous supplication from Imam al-Sadiq (AS), known as "The
Supplication of the Covenant (Du'aa al-Ahd)", which is to be recited in
every morning. The Imam (AS) said that the one who recites and calls
upon Allah by this covenant for forty mornings, will be of the soldiers
of al-Qa'im (AS), and if he dies before his rising, Allah will resurrect
him from his grave during his advent, and will also give him the reward
of 1000 good deeds and removes 1000 of his sins for each word of this
supplication. The last sentences of this precious supplication are as
follows:

"O Allah! Show me the rightly guided face (of Imam al-Mahdi (AS)), the
praiseworthy brightness (of his face), and enlighten my vision by
looking at him. Hasten his reappearance, make his arrival smooth, widen
and clear his path, and make me tread on his way. Implement his kingdom
and strengthen his back.

O Allah! Give life to Your cities by him and revive Your servants
through him, for surely You have said-and Your word is truth-"Corruption
prevailed on the land and the sea because of what men's hand have earned
(30:41)" Thus, O Allah, manifest for us Your friend and the son of Your
Prophet's daughter, whose name is the same as that of Your Apostle, so
that he does not prevail anything from falsehood except that he tears it
to pieces, establishes the truth, and makes it real.

O Allah! Appoint him as a refuge for Your oppressed servants and a
helper for the one who does not find any helper for himself except You.
Make him the one who renews what has been suspended/abolished of the
laws of Your book, and the one who re-erects the science of Your
religion and the customs of Your Prophet, Allah's blessings be upon him
and his family. O Allah! Make him among those whom you have protected
from the evils of the aggressors.

O Allah! Delight Your Prophet Mohammed, Allah's blessings be upon him
and his family, by making him visible and (delight) the one who follows
him on his call, and have mercy on our poverty after his
(disappearance). O Allah! Remove this sorrow (of occultation) from this
nation by his presence, and hasten for us his reappearance. Certainly,
they [i.e., the disbelievers] consider it far-fetched while we consider
it near. By Your mercy O the most merciful!" Then you say, "Hasten!
Hasten! O my master, O the master of the era!"[^62]

Thus, during the period of disappearance of Imam Mahdi (AS), the most
important supplication of the believers to Allah is to ask for his
reappearance and the manifestation of his kingdom over the earth by
which all problems of humanity will be resolved. The sentence, "the
disbelievers consider it far-fetched while we consider it near" shows
that the believers expect this kingdom in a very near future and only
the disbelievers consider this expectation unrealistic.

Moreover, the sentences such as "O Allah! Hasten his reappearance, make
his arrival smooth, widen and clear his path" in this supplication shows
that Allah may change the decreed situation at the time of his
reappearance, may lesson the hardship of his mission due to the change
in situation, and may bring near his arrival. By asking Allah to hasten
his reappearance from the bottom of our heart, Allah may make Badaa and
advance his mission, just as He advanced the mission of Prophet Musa
(AS). In a very inspiring and thought-provoking Hadith, Fadhl Ibn Abi
Qurra narrated:

Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, "When the period of punishment on the Children
of Israel was prolonged, they wailed and cried to Allah for 40 mornings.
Thereupon, Allah revealed to Moses (AS) and Aaron (AS) to release them
from the Pharaoh, and in this way, He reduced their punishment 170
years." Then, the Imam (AS) continued, "This is the case for you too,
and if you do the same Allah shall certainly relieve us. However, if you
avoid it, this matter [i.e., the calamity before al-Faraj] shall surely
continue up to its last stage."[^63]

The suffering is a hint to the believers that they should implore Allah
with humility. Allah said in Quran:

"Before thee We sent towards many nations, and We afflicted them with
suffering and adversity, that they might call/beseech (Us) in humility.
(6:42)"

If the majority of people on the earth decide to sincerely seek relief
(al-Faraj) from Allah and drop their hope from all the fallible leaders,
Allah may decide to allow the early rise of Imam Mahdi (AS) without need
for the occurrence of any of the reported definite signs. Notice that we
say, "Allah may decide that way", which means this is not an urgent
reaction to people's action; it is rather a matter of choice for Allah
as is the case for all other actions of Allah.

He does what He will. In fact, the traditions of Ahl al-Bait (AS) imply
that to the time that people look for other global solutions for their
problems, and have hope in other leaders for implementing justice, Allah
may delay the rising of al-Qa'im (AS). Hisham Ibn Salim narrated:

Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, "This kingdom shall not appear until every
claiming class/group amongst people rule over people so that no one
would remain to say, 'Had we ruled we would have implemented justice'.
Thereafter, al-Qa'im (AS) shall rise for truth and justice."[^64]

This way, those who claim to be able to implement justice will have
chance to rule and will subsequently show their scandalous failure in
practice. When people become hopeless from any other alternatives, they
will desperately seek for relief (al-Faraj) from Allah from the bottom
of their hearts, and it is at that time that they will be ready to
receive Imam al-Mahdi (AS). Thus, the sooner people come to their
senses, the earlier will be their relief. However, this still depends
upon Allah's decision, and He may commence the mission of al-Qa'im (AS)
sooner than the time of full global awareness if He wills. Due to His
grace, Allah may initiate mercy without people being worthy of it. In
one of his supplications, Imam al-Sajjad (AS) prayed to Allah:

"O the initiator of the bounties before becoming worthy of it."[^65]

The grace of Allah does not have any necessary requirement, and Allah
may initially bestow it to people if He wills. However, due to His
justice, Allah never initiates wrath unless people deserve it by their
misconduct. This custom of Allah is also stated in a number of verses in
the Quran. For instance:

"(Their manner) is like the manner of the People of Pharaoh and of
those before them. They rejected the Signs of Allah, and Allah caught
them for their sins; for Allah is Strong and Strict in punishment. That
is because Allah will never change the bounty that He hath bestowed on a
people until they change that which is in their souls (from obedience to
disobedience), and (that is) because Allah is He Who hears and knows
(all things). (8:52-53)"

Finally, more than thinking for our relief, we should have sympathy for
the loneliness of Imam al-Mahdi (AS) who is forgotten by people in this
period, and should pray to Allah to relieve him from the prison of
occultation, which was the result of people's evil actions. Asbagh Ibn
Nabata narrated:

The Leader of the faithful (AS) said, "The master of this kingdom is
the forsaken, the deserted, and the lonely one."[^66]


**Conclusion**

In this work, we have shown that the existence of al-Badaa plays a
central role in our way of expecting al-Qa'im (AS). Due to the
possibility of Badaa, the fore-told signs are subject to change, the
Imam (AS) may reappear at any moment, and our good actions and our
supplications for the early arrival of the Imam (AS) may be answered.
Having faith in al-Badaa by Allah, everyone would keep himself ready all
the time to receive the Imam (AS).

According to the traditions, awaiting al-Qa'im (AS) at any moment is
the best deed and the most significant act after the recognition of the
Imam (AS) and his rights. Moreover, Ahl al-Bait (AS) have instructed us
to pray to Allah to make smooth the advent of al-Qa'im, to simplify it,
and to lessen the hardships prior and during his mission. Such
instructions are meaningful only when the changes in the aforementioned
signs are possible.

The signs were not given for the purpose of predicting the time of
reappearance, or for encouraging people to search the scientific data to
estimate the time of the occurrence of the sign itself. They, rather,
become a reminder for people only after they occur miraculously. Once a
sign occurs, the believers will realize that it was amongst the signs
that they were foretold, and thus, their faith and confident will
increase, and they will realize that the time of reappearance is closer
than ever. All the mentioned signs before his arrival, even if they
finally occur, they may happen miraculously in an unpredictable
manner.

According to the traditions, once Allah let Imam al-Mahdi (AS) rise,
all people around the world, believers and disbelievers likewise, will
become aware of him immediately and without any shadow of doubt. Thus,
the opposition against Imam Mahdi (AS) is not due to people's failure in
identifying him. It is rather due to their disbelief in the original
laws of the religion, their overlooking of the transmitted traditions,
and their following man-made ideas and opinions in the domain of
religion.

If the Imam (AS) has not yet started his mission, it is not because
certain signs did not take place, but because people have deserted Ahl
al-Bait (AS) and are hopeful in other alternative solutions. Allah has
assigned for people a leader who is ready to relieve them, but they have
turned away from him and left him alone. The only way for an early
relief is that people of the world come to the understanding that they
should turn to him and to his instructions so that Allah may waive the
remaining time of occultation.

In the last section, we discussed some of the instructions of Ahl
al-Bait (AS) that would help an early relief. Acting upon these
commandments, among others, prepares us, makes us eligible for receiving
Imam al-Mahdi (AS), and paves the way for the implementation of the
kingdom of justice over the earth, by the leave of Allah.

O the Lord of al-Husain! heal the bosom of al-Husain by the
manifestation of al-Hujja.
O the Lord of al-Hujja! heal the bosom of al-Hujja by the manifestation
of al-Hujja.
O the Lord of the faithful! heal the bosom of the faithful by the
manifestation of al-Hujja.

Ameen
