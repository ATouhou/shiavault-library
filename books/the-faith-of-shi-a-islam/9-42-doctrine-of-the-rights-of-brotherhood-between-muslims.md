42. Doctrine of the Rights of Brotherhood Between Muslims
=========================================================

One of the highest and most excellent instructions of Islam to all
Muslims is brotherhood without distinction of birth, rank or position.
But, unfortunately, Muslims have always neglected this. One of the
smallest duties of Islamic brotherhood is that a Muslim should wish for
his brother what he wishes for himself, and that he should not wish for
his brother what he does not wish for himself, as we shall point out in
a tradition from Imam Sadiq.

One must study this duty well, and it is accounted a very small one in
the opinion of the Descendents of Muhammad. One sees that Muslims find
it difficult to fulfil this small duty, for their morals and behaviour
are not in accordance with the Islamic spirit. Concentrate carefully on
this small responsibility; if people were to respect it, neither
oppression, nor enmity, nor theft, nor falsehood. nor back-biting, nor
informing would be found anywhere among them. If they realised the
result of this and were careful in carrying out this duty, oppression
and enmity would disappear; they would live as brothers with each other
and attain the height of happiness among themselves. Madinah
al-Fadilah[^10] of the ancient philosophers would become a reality, no
government would be needed, no court of law, no police, prison or
criminal law. they would be free from colonisers and tyrants; oppressors
could not force their iniquity on them; and the earth would become
paradise.

Furthermore, if Islamic brotherhood reigned among people, as Islam has
said it should, then the word justice would disappear from our
dictionaries; justice and its laws would not be needed, and brotherhood
alone would suffice to ensure goodness, peace, happiness and pleasure
among us. For humanity, in such a situation, would have no need for
justice and its laws; these are only needed when there is a lack of love
between people. A mother is kind and good towards her children because
of her love and compassion, not because of the commandments of justice.
We can understand why a man loves only himself and that which is
agreeable to him; it is impossible for him to love something or someone
unless it belongs to him. And when he does love something or someone, it
is impossible for him to give them to someone else whom he dislikes.
unless there exists a principle which is stronger than his desires, like
a belief in justice and kindness, and in this case, he may devote his
interests to someone else whom he does not like.

Such an ideal, when it dwells in the human mind, keeps it in a position
above all material things, so that it is able to realise the superiority
of justice and goodness. and to show kindness to others. It will be seen
that man needs such superior ideals when there is no kindness and
brother hood between him and his fellow men. That is to say that as long
as he lacks the feeling of brotherhood - and the fact that he does is
because of his egotism and desires as long as this feeling is missing,
he must believe in the goodness of justice and kindness, following the
guidance of Islam. And if he fails to believe in this as well, then he
does not deserve to be thought of as a Muslim; such a man. even in name,
is not a friend of Allah; he has done nothing for the sake of Allah. as
we shall see in the tradition of the Imam which follows. Usually human
desires overcome man, and it is difficult for him to prepare himself
even to believe in justice, and so it is much more difficult for him to
attain that perfect belief through which he can vanquish his desires.

We can see that the brotherhood of man is very difficult to obtain as
long as its desirability is not sensed. For this reason, Imam Sadiq did
not wish to explain to al-Mu'alla ibn Khunays more than he could
understand, because Ja'far was afraid to teach him what he could not put
into practice. Mu'alla asked:

'What does one Muslim owe another?'
'There are seven duties incumbent upon him. Should he neglect but one
of them. he is not a friend or servant of Allah. and truly he has done
nothing for the sake of Allah.'
'What may these things be?'
'I feel compassion for you. I am afraid lest you learn them, but you
neglect to put them into practice, or you cannot. There is no power but
in Allah.'

Mu'alla then relates that the Imam told him the seven:

'First. the smallest duty is that you should wish for your brother what
you wish for yourself, and that you should wish that what you do not
desire for yourself should not befall your brother.'

So, this is a small duty'. Do we find this easy? That is to say, we
present-day Muslims? May those who call themselves Muslims but do not
act in accordance with this small but strict duty find themselves
disgraced.

It is amazing that the backward state of the Muslims should be ascribed
to Islam, while the only reason for it is the behaviour of the Muslims,
that is those who call themselves Muslims but do not carry out this
humble duty.

Having reminded ourselves and mentioned our present circumstances, we
shall now list the seven duties as related by Mu'alla from Imam Ja'far
(A.S.).

(a) Wish for your brother what you wish for yourself, and wish that
what you do not desire for yourself should not befall your brother.
(b) Do not make your brother angry, but seek to please him and obey his
wishes.
(c) Help him with your soul, your tongue, your hands and your feet.
(d) Be his eye to see by, his guide to lead him and his mirror.
(e) Do not eat your fill when he is hungry, nor drink and clothe
yourself when he is thirsty and naked.
(f) If he has no servant, but you do, it is incumbent on you to send
your servant to him to wash his clothes, cook his food and spread out
his mattress.
(g) Accept his promise and his invitation; visit him when he is sick,
attend his funeral, and see to his needs before he asks you, hurrying to
do them if you can.

When he had finished, Imam Ja'far said:

If you fulfil these duties you can call yourself his friend, and he
will be your friend also.

There are many traditions told from our Imams, and most of them are
collected in 'Kitab al-Wasa'il'il in the relevant sections.

Some people have imagined that the Imams meant brotherhood only among
the Shi'a, but if they were to read the traditions they would understand
that their imagination is deceiving them, although the Imams did
strongly repudiate those whose way was against the Shi'a and who did not
follow their guidance. Let us mention here the conversation of Imam
Sadiq with Mu'awiyah ibn Wahab.
'How should we treat those who do not follow our ways?'
'Look to your Imams whom you obey, and obey them and imitate them. They
visit them (i.e. those who are not Shi' a) when they are sick, go to
their funerals, give evidence for or against them. and repay their
trust.'

No, the brotherhood that the Imams envisaged among their followers is
higher than ordinary Islamic brotherhood, and it has been mentioned
briefly in the introduction. It will suffuce to read the following
conversation between Imam Sadiq and Aban ibn Taghlab.

Aban relates: While I was circumambulating the Ka'bah with Imam Sadiq,
one of our friends signalled to me that I should immediately go with him
to help him. The Imam noticed and said to me:

'O Aban, does he mean you?'
I replied: 'Yes.'
'Does he believe in what you believe in?'
'Yes.'
'Then go with him and break your circumambulation.' I asked if it was
incumbent on me to do so, and he said that it was. Then I went with the
man to help him, and after doing so I returned to the Imam and asked him
about the rights of the believers.
'Do not ask me concerning them,' he said.
But I insisted.
'Give your brother half of what you own,' he told me, and looked at me.
He understood my surprise and said: 'O Aban! Do you know that Allah
admires those believers who prefer others to themselves?'
I replied: 'Yes.' 'When you give your brother half of what you own you
do not prefer him above yourself, but only when you give him the other
half do you really prefer him above yourself.'

If we feel shame at this, then really we should not call ourselves
believers. We are quite remote from the teachings of the Imams. Everyone
who reads this tradition becomes astonished as did Aban, but then he
pays no further attention to it and forgets it, as if he were not the
person addressed, and as if he were not responsible.
