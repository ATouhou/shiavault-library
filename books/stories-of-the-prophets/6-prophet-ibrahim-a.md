Prophet Ibrahim (a)
===================

Many years ago a boy

called Ibrahim lived

in Canaan.

he was very clever and was always asking questions.

Most of the people he knew

worshipped idols but

Ibrahim did not.

The people had

forgotten the messages

that Adam, Hud, Nuh

and Salih had

brought them.

Instead of praising

Allah they worshipped

statues.

Ibrahim told his father

he didn't think people should

worship objects they had

made themselves. His father

was angry and told him

not to say anything about

the gods again.

Ibrahim decided he must

show the people they were

wrong so he thought of a

plan.

One night he sneaked into

the place where all

the statues were

kept. With an axe

he chopped off the

heads from all but

one of the statues.

The biggest one

he left.

The next morning the

people were very angry

and upset at what had

happened. They were

sure Ibrahim had done it.

They gathered in the

public square and asked

him if he had done it.

Ibrahim told them to ask

their big idol if he

knew who was responsible.

But, of course, the statue

could not speak and the

people knew it was only

stone. Ibrahim shouted at

them and asked how

they could worship lumps

of stone. The bad people were

even more angry.

They started to collect wood

for a fire. They were

going to burn Ibrahim

to death.

They made a big bonfire

and put Ibrahim on the top.

Everyone came to watch. They

lit the wood. The fire burned,

the flames grew higher and

higher. The people had to

back away from the heat

of the flames.

Ibrahim was a good

person. He believed in Allah.

Allah would protect him.

Allah would not let the

fire harm him. When the

flames dies down the people

could not believe their eyes.

They saw that Ibrahim

was alive and the flames

had not harmed him at all.

How had this happened?

They all knew this was a

great miracle and they

fell to their knees.

This wonderful thing had

made them believe in Allah.

Some people would still not

listen. They thought

Ibrahim was just a magician

Nimrod, the king of Canaan,

heard all about Ibrahim.

He wanted to talk to him.

He asked Ibrahim about Allah.

Ibrahim told him that

Allah could do all things.

He could give life and death.

Nimrod said that he too

could do that.

His soldiers brought

two men in. Nimrod

ordered one to be

killed and the

other to be saved.

Nimrod thought that

this made him like Allah.

Ibrahim told him that

Allah brings the sun

every morning from the

East.

He asked Nimrod if

he could bring the sun

from the west next

day, of course, Nimrod

was unable to do that.
