109. An adjective is a form derived from an intransitive verb that
slightly indicates an actor, except that it does not indicate the action
of the actor, rather it indicates an established characteristic of the
actor. For example: **وَلَدٌ** **حَسَنٌ** (a nice boy) or **رَجُلٌ**
**کَریمٌ**(an honorable man). These adjectives are established
characteristics found in the boy and man.

110. There is no rule in forming adjectives from triliteral verbs. They
are formed in numerous forms. For example: **طاهر** (purified),
**عطشان** (thirsty) and **ظریف** (delicate).

111. The adjective formed from triliteral verbs that indicate color,
defect or decoration is put into the form **أفعل**. For example:
**أسمَرالوَجه** (a brown face), **أعمیَ** **القَلبِ** (a blind heart)
and **أهیَفُ** **القَد** (a slender physique).

112. The adjective is formed from non-triliteral verbs by using the
active participle form.
