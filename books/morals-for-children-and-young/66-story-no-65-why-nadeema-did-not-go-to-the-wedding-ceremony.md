Story no. 65: Why Nadeema did not go to the Wedding ceremony.
=============================================================

The family was invited to the wedding ceremony. The card said for Mr.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and family. But on the foot of the card was
written â€œYour children are to be invited later. Which meant that
children were not supposed to be coming with their parents. Still, some
of the children insisted on coming with their parents.  
 But eight year old Nadeema told the children that we are not supposed
to go with our parents because we are not invited. If we go, we will act
against morality.

Bravo to those children who have good understanding and follow and obey
the orders of morality.
