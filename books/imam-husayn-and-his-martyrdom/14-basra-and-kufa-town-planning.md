Basra and Kufa: town-planning
=============================

In Mesopotamia the Muslims did not base their power on old and effete
Persian cities, but built new outposts for themselves. The first they
built was Basra at the head of the Persian Gulf, in the 17th year of the
Hijra. And what a great city it became!

Not great in war and conquest, not great in trade and commerce, but
great in learning and culture in its best day, - alas! also great in its
spirit of faction and degeneracy in the days of its decline! But its
situation and climate were not at all suited to the Arab character.

It was low and moist, damp and enervating. In the same year the Arabs
built another city not far off from the Gulf and yet well suited to be a
port of the desert, as Karbala’ became afterwards. This was the city of
Kufa, built in the same year as Basra, but in a more bracing climate. It
was the first experiment in town-planning in Islam. In the centre was a
square for the principal mosque.

That square was adorned with shady avenues. Another square was set apart
for the trafficking of the market. The streets were all laid out
intersecting and their width was fixed. The main thoroughfares for such
traffic as they had (we must not imagine the sort of traffic we see in
Charing Cross) were made 60 feet wide; the cross streets were 30 feet
wide; and even the little lanes for pedestrians were regulated to a
width of 10.5 feet. Kufa became a centre of light and learning. The
Khalifa Hazrat ‘Ali lived and died there.
