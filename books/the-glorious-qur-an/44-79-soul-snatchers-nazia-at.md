79: [soul-]snatchers (nazia'at)
===============================

This chapter of 46 early Meccan verses was revealed after Prophets 21
and before Bursting Apart 82. Its soaring message is mystic in content
and poetic in form.

Moses and Pharaoh are discussed in section I, while II concerns creation
and the final Hour.
