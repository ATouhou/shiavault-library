5) Kinds Of Piety
=================

Some people may have the impression that piety means to avoid committing
sins only. Therefore in many cases, piety has come to mean fear of God
and abstinence from committing sins, whereas it means self-restraint and
safeguarding of oneself from opposing the orders of God. Hence, piety is
not solely restricted to self-restraint against sins, rather it has
other kinds too. Taqwa is sometimes related to ideology (monotheism,
prophethood, Imamate and the Day of Judgment) and at other times it is
not related to ideology. The latter includes piety in theory and in
practice. When piety is related to practice, it is sometimes
religion-based and at other times not based on religion. When it is not
based on religion, piety is sometimes related to individual and at other
times to society. In society too, it is sometimes moral and at other
times non-moral. Each of these will be discussed separately.
