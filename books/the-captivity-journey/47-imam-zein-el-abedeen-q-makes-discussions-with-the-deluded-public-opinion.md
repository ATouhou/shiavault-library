Imam Zein El-Abedeen (Q) Makes Discussions with the Deluded Public Opinion
==========================================================================

Imam Zein El-Abedeen (Q) took interest in enlightening the thoughts and
exposing the facts more than any other thing. We had mentioned parts of
his words, conversations and speeches that dealt with this aspect. Thus,
a man from Sham came to him and said: "Are you Ali bin Al-Hussain?"

He (Q) said: "Yes".

He said: "Your father had killed the believers!"

So the Imam (Q) cried then wiped his face and said: "Woe

to you, how did you decide that my father had killed the believers?"

He said: "by his saying that our brothers had wronged us, so we fought
their oppression".

So he (Q) said: "Do you read the Quran?"

He said: "Yes, I do read it"

He (Q) said: "did you not hear His saying: (And to the ‘Ad people (We
sent) Hud, one of their own brethren…And to the Thamud people (We sent)
Saleh, one of their own brethren…And to the Madyan people (We sent)
Shuaib, one of their own brethren )... "24

He said: "Yes, indeed"

So he (Q) said: "Was he their brother from the same community or from
the same religion?"

He said: "from their community".

He (Q) said: "you have relieved me, may Allah relief you as well".
