Telling Lies
============

'Anas-ibn-Mlaik narrates from the Messenger of Allah (S) who said:
"Accept six things from me, then I will accept (and guarantee) the
entrance of Heaven for you:

1. When you speak, tell no lies.

2. When you promise, do not break it.

3. When you are trusted (by others), be honest.

4. Lower your eyes (from committing sin).

5. Guard your modesty.

6. Hold your hands and tongues."

Khisal al-Saduq, p. 321

Imam Abi-Muhammad-al-al-’Askari, the eleventh Imam, (‘a) said:
"Wickedness was put inside a house, and the key (of its door) was
rendered to be lies."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 72, p. 263

Imam Sajjad (‘a) said: "Avoid telling lies irrespective of small or
great, whether it is in earnest or joking, because when a person tells a
lie in small (things), he dares to tell a lie in great things, too."

Tuhaful-Uqul, p. 201

Once Imam Amir-ul-Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) was asked about the distance
between the truth and untruth and, while he (‘a) was showing the
distance between his eye and ear with his four fingers in order to
illustrate this distance as his answer, he said: "What your eyes see is
'truth' and what your ears hear is for the most part 'untruth'."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 75, p. 196

Imam al-Baqir (‘a) said: "Verily, Allah, the exalted, has put some locks
on vices, the key of which He has put in wine, but the vice of lying is
worse than wine."

Al-Kafi, vol. 2, p. 339

Imam Ridha’ (‘a) said: "Be truthful and avoid telling lies."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 78, p. 347
