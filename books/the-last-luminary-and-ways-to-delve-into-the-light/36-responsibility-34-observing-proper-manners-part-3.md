Responsibility 34: Observing Proper Manners Part 3
==================================================

Another responsibility of the believers is that when they hear or see
the name of Imam al-Zaman or any of his titles, they should immediately
show the appropriate form of respect. In addition, as a sign of
acknowledging his status, they should stand up when they hear his
blessed title, al-Qa\`im.

One day, a person was in a gathering with Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad
as-Sadiq (as) when another person took the name of Imam al-Zaman (ajtf)
and out of respect to the 12th Imam, the 6th Imam stood up![^1]

Once, a companion named Di’bil, who lived in the later part of the
Islamic history, recited a poem which he had composed in which he
mentioned Imam al-Hujjah (ajtf) to the 8th Imam, ‘Ali b. Musa al-Rida
(as). When he mentioned the 12th Imam, Imam al-Rida (as) stood up and
placed his right hand on his head as a form of respect to the final Imam
and prayed for his speedy arrival![^2]

The philosophy behind standing up when one hears the blessed name or
title of the Imam, especially al-Qa\`im (ajtf) is that we are showing
our readiness to rise to help and assist the Imam.

Indeed, whenever and wherever the name of the Imam is taken, he
immediately makes himself present in that gathering and looks with
attention towards the people (who have taken his name) and therefore, it
is recommended to show respect to the Imam by standing up whenever his
name is mentioned.
