Trust in God
============

Trust in God is an admission of our shortcomings and a reliance on Him
for success. It is a duty of the faithful to trust in Allah and to
believe that their success depends on His Will.

Allah the Most High said: ***“Allah, there is no god but He; and upon
Allah, then, let the believers rely.”***

He also said: ***“And whoever trusts in Allah, He is sufficient for
him.”***

He also said: ***“Those only are believers whose hearts become full of
fear when Allah is mentioned, and when Our communications are recited to
them they increase them in faith, and upon their Lord do they rely.”***

He also said: ***“And Allah loves those who rely.”***

The Holy Prophet Muhammad (S) said: *“He who likes to be the strongest
should trust in Allah.”*

He (S) also said: *“He who likes to be the most virtuous should trust in
Allah.”*

Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (a.s.) said: *“Indeed riches and honour wander
about; when they come across trust, they dwell with it.”*
