Lesson 17 : Some Special Salaat
===============================

In addition to the daily waajib Salaat, there are some prayers in Islam
that hold special significance. Let us look at these different Salaat
and the circumstances regarding them.

**1. Salaatul Jama'at**

In our previous studies, we have seen that Islam emphasizes
participation in Salaatul Jama'at (Congregational Prayers) because it
helps to create bonds of brotherhood and unity amongst the Muslims.

The equality brought about by standing together to pray to One God is
what Islam is base on. Therefore, to miss congregational prayers without
a good reason is Haraam. We have discussed Salaatul Jama'at in detail
before, so we will now look at only a few general rules regarding its
performance.

i)The Imam leading the Jama'at must be Aadil (Just), Pious and known
not to commit any big or small sins.

ii)The Imam can be followed in any of his daily prayers by the ma'moon
(followers).

iii)If you do not know whether the Imam is praying wajib or mustahab
prayers, you cannot join him.

iv)If you pray behind the Imam and later wish to change to your niyyah
to furaada (Individual) you can do so during the salaat only.

v)If a person wished to join the Jamaat in the 3rd or 4th Rakaat but is
not sure whether he can recite his surahs of the first rakaat in the
time the Imam finishes reciting Tasbihate Arb'ae then he should wait
until the Imam goies to ruku and join the salaat from there.

vi)Ma'moon must wait until the Imam finishes reciting his Takbiratul
Ehram before they recite theirs. They cannot start while he is in the
middle.

vii)It is recommended that the lines in Jama'at be straight and the
people shoud stand shoulder to shoulder. Also, a person should not stand
alone, as long as there is place in a row.

viii) It is makrooh for the ma'moon to recite dhikr so loudly that the
Imam can hear them.

**2. Salaatul Jumu'ah**

Friday is the greatest day of the week for Muslims. It is the favoured
by Allah (S.W.T.) and one of the special acts of ebadat for this day is
the praying of Salaatul Jumu'ah. This prayer is preceded by a sermon
where the Imam is required to update the Muslim Ummah about issue that
concern them.

Apart from moral and religious facts, he should also try to speak of
the social and political situations facing the Muslims worldwide.
Through these Friday Khutba (Sermons), the Muslims learn about each
other and become more aware of Islam.

The Khutba is part and parcel of Salaatul Jumu'ah and maintaining
silence during the sermon is Ehtiyate Mustahad. Every Muslim should try
and attend the prayer early enough to listen to it but in the event that
they miss it, they can still join in the Salaat either in the first or
second rakaat.

**How to Pray**

Salaatul Jumu'ah has 2 rakaats just like Subh. It is mustahab to recite
the surahs loudly when praying and especially to recite Sura Jumu'ah
after Sura al-Hamd in the first rakaat and Sura Munafiqoon in the
secondd rakaat. There are two Qunoots in the prayer - one in the first
rakaat before Ruku and the other in the second rakaat after Ruku and
before going into Sajdah. Note:

A person who joins in Salaatul Jumu'ah does not have to pray Dhohr but
it is Ehtiyate Mustahab for him to do so.

**3. Salatul Eidayn**

The term Salaatul Eidayn refers to the prayers performed in
congregation on the days of the two great Eids in the Islamic Calendar
i.e. Eid-ul-Fitr which marks the end of Ramdhan and Idd-ul-Adha which is
celebrated after the completion of Hajj. The prayer consists of two
rakaats just as Salaatul Jumu'ah and the main difference between them is
that the sermon in the Salaatul Eid is given after the prayer not
before.

Some important facts about these prayers are as follows:

i) Salatul Eidayn is waajib only during the presence of the divine Imam
(a.s.) and otherwise it becomes mustahab.

ii) It recommended that a person breakfast on dates before going for
Eid prayers on Eid-ul-Fitr. On the day of Eid-ul-Adha, it is mustahab
for him to eat a portion of the meat he has slaughtered, after finishing
the prayers.

**How to Pray**

Salaatul Eid has two rakaats and can be performed at any time from
sunrise to noon on the day of Eid.

- In the first rakaat, after reciting Sura al-Hamd and another sura,
the Imam recites 5 takbirs. Each takbir is followed by a Qunoot. After
the 5th qunoot, the Imam proceeds with the steps of ruku and sajdah.

- The second rakaat is prayed as the first one except that it has 4
takbirs and Qunoots. The prayer in completed with tashahhud and salaam
as usual.

**4. Salaatul Ayaat**

The universe around us is full of marvels that are signs of the
existence of Allah (S.W.T.). The moon, the sun, plants, water,
mountains, stars - all are wondrous creations and provide constant
amazement for the human intellect.

However, it is also human nature that when a person is exposed to a
certain object or process repeatedly then it looses its initial appeal
and no longer fascinates him constantly. This is what happens to us in
our daily lives. Because we see the sun rise and set every day and the
moon shines on us every night, we tend to forget the power and
complexity of these celestial bodies and the forces that control them.
It all becomes ordinary to us.

In order to remind us of Him and to prevent us from taking things for
granted, Allah (S.W.T.) sometimes causes certain event to take place
which are out of the ordinary and which remind us that we have no power
over the world around us.

When events such as sun eclipses, moon eclipses, earthquakes and other
natural phenomena occur, they serve as an alarm bell to mankind and
remind people to turn back to the only All-Powerful entity.

At such times, one should turn back to Him in praise and seeking
forgiveness. For this reason, we pray Salaatul Ayaat (Prayer of the
Signs) after experiencing any such event.

Salaatul Ayaat becomes waajib when one of 4 things happen:

a) Sun eclipse - partial ?
b) Moon eclipse - even if it is only a partial eclipse
c) Earthquakes - even if it is too mild to invoke fear
d) Lightning, hurricanes, tornadoes, red and black cyclones, volcanoes
and other natural disasters that bring fear in the hearts of people.

For the first two cases, a person should perform the Salaat between the
time the eclipse starts and the time it ends. It is recommended NOT to
delay the prayer until the eclipse begins to clear.

In the case of earthquakes, thunderstorms and the like, it is wajib to
perform the Salaat as soon as possible since delaying it is haram. In
any case, you must perform it with the niyyah of Ada - not Qadha - at
whatever time in your life you manage to pray it.

**How to Pray**

Salaatul Ayaat, like the other special prayers, also has two rakaats.
In every rakaat there are 5 ruku's. It should be performed as follows:

- Make niyyah
- Recite Takbiratul Ehram
- Recite Sura al-Hamd and any other surah. Then go into ruku and recite
dhikr. Stand up and repeat the above until you perform the 5th ruku.
After this complete the rakaat with sajdah and stand up for the second
rakaat.
- Perform the second rakaat in the same manner as the first but finish
the namaaz with tashahhud and salaam.

Another method of praying Salaatul Ayaat is to replace the recitation
of a different second surah with one surah of 5 ayatas divided into
ayats. This means that in every Qiyam, you recite one verse of the
selected surah after reciting Sura la-Hamd. You thus complete it in the
5 qiyams that you stand for per rakaat - this is especially possible
using Sura Ikhlaas, which has 5 verses (including Bismillah).

**5. Salaatul Qadha**

When a person recompenses for a missed prayer, this Salaat is called
Qadha. It means that he did not pray it at the allocated time but is now
replacing it after a lapsed period. It may be prayed in the following
circumstances:

i) When a person misses his waajib prayers.

ii) When a person realises that he had not performed his salaat
properly but the time has lapsed for that particular prayer.
