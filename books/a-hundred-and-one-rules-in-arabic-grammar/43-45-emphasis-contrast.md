45. Emphasis/Contrast
=====================

Since verb form indicates the person,

gender, and number of the subject any use of a subject pronoun is
considered redundant. If, however, you want to emphasize or contrast two
objects Arabic allows you to use the subject pronoun in such a
linguistic environment.
