Story no. 29: Jamaal and the hurt cat.
======================================

Jamaal was coming home from school with his friends.  
 On the way, the children saw a cat and Jamaal’s friends began to hurt
it with stones from a far distance.  
 Jamaal became very angry seeing this action of theirs.  
 He came in front and with the help of his friends, shooed the children
away from the sick animal, and facing them, said “Have you not heard
that you should not pester animals because they too have a life”.
