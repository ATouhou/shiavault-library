Our Need for Raising the Question
=================================

Our need to put forth such a question springs from numerous reasons
among the most significant of which is probably Islam’s rejection of
capitalism and Marxism, the two systems that rule the world nowadays.
Islam’s negation of both of these systems obligates the Muslim
individual to expect Islam to bring a substitute for them to regulate
the economic life, since the Muslim society cannot do without a method
for such organization, no matter what form it may have.
