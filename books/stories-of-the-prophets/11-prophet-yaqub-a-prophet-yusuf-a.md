Prophet Yaqub (a) & Prophet Yusuf (a)
=====================================

Yaqub was also

known as Israil.

Israil's children could

see that Yusuf was their

father's favourite. This

made them very jealous.

They became so jealous,

some of them actually

wanted to kill him.

The jealous brothers

finally decided

to throw Yusuf

into a deep well.

They went to Israil, their

father, to ask if they could

take Yusuf out with

them; they said they would

teach him to be a good

shepherd. Israil would

not let Yusuf go because

he thought the others

were planning to do

something bad.

One day Yusuf went to

Israil and said that he

had had a strange dream.

In the dream Yusuf

had seen the sun, the

moon and eleven stars

bowing down to him!

Israil felt that

the dream had a

message, Yusuf was

going to have a

great future. He

told Yusuf not to

tell his brothers

about the dream.

Israil's son were

still thinking of their

plan to kill Yusuf.

They pestered Israil

to let them take

Yusuf with them

to their work.

At last Israil agreed,

but he made them promise

to look after him.

They were so bad they

knew they would break

their promise.

At the end of the day

they asked Yusuf to take

off his shirt. They killed

a sheep and put blood all

over Yusuf's shirt; then they

threw Yusuf into a well.

They went home and

showed the shirt to Israil.

Pretending to be very upset;

they told their father that Yusuf

had got left behind and a

wolf had eaten him!

Israil was very

upset but he

did not believe

the story.

He knew that one

day Allah would

bring Yusuf back

to him.

Poor Yusuf spent the

night in the well.

The next morning, when

someone put the

bucket down the

well to get water,

he sat in the bucket.

The man had to get help

to pull the bucket up.

He was very surprised to see

a boy in it.

The man was a merchant.

The merchant decided

to take Yusuf with

him to Egypt and to

sell him as a slave.

When they arrived in

Egypt, one of the noble

families bought Yusuf.

The man who

bought him told

his wife that they

should take care of

him, as he was a

good-looking child

and they had no

children of their own.

Yusuf became one

of the family.
