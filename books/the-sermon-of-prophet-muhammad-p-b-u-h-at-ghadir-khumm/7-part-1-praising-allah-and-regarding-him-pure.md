Part 1 : Praising Allah and Regarding Him Pure
==============================================

Praise belongs to Allah Who is exalted above (all the creation) in His
Oneness,1

and is near (to His creation) in His loneliness.2 Sublime is His
authority, and great are the pillars3 of His (names).

1 While He is matchless and thus cannot be compared with His creation
by the term “being above”, He is exalted.

2 While nothing is beside Him, He is close to everyone.

3 According to the traditions, Allah has created twelve pillars out of
His three major names. These pillars are, in turn, the foundations of
120 names of Allah. cf. al-Kafi, vol. 1, p. 112, Hadith 1.

His knowledge encompasses everything while He is lofty in status.1

He subdues all the creation through His power and evidence.

He has always been praiseworthy and shall always be praised.

[He is the glorified Whose glory has no end. He begins and repeats (the
creation),2

1 This means that Allah does not need to move into the places of the
objects to encompass them in knowledge. It can be proven by reason that
Allah has no place, for He is the creator of place. He does not need His
creation, and He was eternally existent before any of His creation. Imam
al-Ridha (PBUH) said, “… Certainly, Allah formed the quality, and thus
He is without quality.

He positioned the place, and thus He is without place.” (al-Tawhid, p.
125, Hadith 3; Bihar al- Anwar, vol. 4, p. 143, Hadith 13). Therefore,
the word “Makan”, in the sermon, refers to “Makanah” or “Manzilah”,
which means lofty position in terms of importance and magnificence, and
not physical place.

Implying the same meaning, one may possibly return the pronoun in the
second sentence to “everything” instead of Allah. Then, the phrase is
translated as: “His knowledge encompasses everything while everything is
in its own place.” 2 cf. the Holy Quran, Chapter 30, Verse 11.

and to Him all affairs are returned.

He is the maker of what has been elevated (i.e., heavens),

the expander of what has been spread out (i.e., the earth),

and the dominator of the planets and the heavens.

He is holy and exalted above all purifications, the Lord of the angels
and the spirit.

He grants to all that He created.

He prolongs His grace to all that He originated.

He sees all eyes, and eyes do not see Him.

He is generous, forbearing, and patient.

He made His mercy encompass everything,2

endnotes.
2 cf. Chapter 40, Verse 7 of the Holy Quran.

and He favored them by His grace.

He does not hasten His revenge,

nor does He take the initiative on what (He knows) they deserve of His
punishment.

He comprehends the secrets, and knows what the hearts conceal.

Hidden things are not concealed from Him,

nor do they make Him doubtful.

He encompasses (in knowledge) and dominates everything,

and has strength and power over everything.

Nothing is like Him1, and He is the establisher of “the thing” when it
was nothing.

1 cf. Chapter 42, Verse 11 of the Holy Quran.

He is everlasting [and free of need]., who acts justly;

He is exalted beyond being grasped by visions, while He grasps all
visions, and He is subtle, well aware (of all things).2

None can reach His description by seeing Him, nor can anyone find out
how He is, secretly or openly, and (He is not known) except by what
Allah, the mighty and the majestic, has made as the signs of Himself.3
.Uae.B.G.5

1 cf. Chapter 3, Verse 18 of the Holy Quran.

2 cf. Chapter 6, Verse 103 of the Holy Quran. The word "visions"
mentioned in this verse is not limited to seeing by eyes. It covers all
types of vision and perception as it is used in a plural form in the
verse. Under the commentary of this verse, Imam al-Ridha (PBUH) said:
“Verily, thinking or imagination of the mind is greater than the vision
of the eyes. Thus, (the verse means) minds can not reach Him, and He
reaches to all minds.” (al-Kafi, vol. 1, p. 98, Hadith \#10; Bihar
al-Anwar, vol. 4, p. 39, Hadith \#16).

3 The recognition of Allah for us is only through His signs, not by
grasping His Essence. Imam al-Ridha (PBUH) said, “Anything that is known
by itself (i.e., by the comprehension of its essence) is a created
thing.” Imam al-Ridha (PBUH) also said, “Allah is recognized by the
signs and is proven by the indications.” Furthermore, Imam al- I testify
that He is Allah, Whose holiness overspreads all ages,

Whose light overwhelms perpetuity1,
Who enforces His command without consulting an advisor.

There is no partner with Him in (His) planning, nor is there any
discrepancy in (His) management.

He shaped whatever He originated without a preexisting model, Baqir
(PBUH) said, “Allah is not recognized by analogy (between the
creations), nor is He perceived by senses, nor does He resemble people.
He is introduced by signs and is recognized by marks.” See: al-Tawhid,
p. 35, Hadith 2, p. 47, Hadith 9, and p. 108, Hadith 5, respectively.

1 It refers to what Allah sustains in the Hereafter forever. This
cannot be compared to His Eternity, as He has no similarity whatsoever
with His creation, including His light, which is the light of the
Prophet (PBUH&HF) and His family (Ahl al-Bait (PBUT)).


and created whatever He created without getting assistance from anyone,
burdening Himself, or having any need to find out a solution.

He originated it (in His will), thus it came into being, and He formed
it (in His intention), thus it became distinct.1 So, He is Allah, the
One that there is no god but He,

Who is proficient in skill, and beautiful in action.

He is the just Who never oppresses, and the most generous to Whom all
affairs are referred.2

I further testify that He is [Allah]¦ that before His magnificence
everything is lowly, before His might everything is humble,

1 For the explanation of the will and the intention of Allah towards
His creation, see al-Tawhid, p. 334, Hadith 9; Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 5,
p. 102, Hadith 27.

2 cf. Chapter 57, Verse 5 of the Holy Quran.

before His power everything surrenders, and before His awe everything
yields.

He is the king of all domains, the turner of the heavenly bodies in
their orbits,

the dominator of the sun and the moon, each of which pursues its course
to an appointed time. He makes night overtake day, and day overtake
night, (each one) seeking the other rapidly1.

He is the destroyer of every stubborn tyrant, and the annihilator of
every rebellious Satan.

Neither has there been any opposing power beside Him, nor any peer.

1 cf. verses 39:5 and 7:54 of the Holy Quran.

He is Unique and impenetrable. 1 He never begets nor is He begotten,
and none can ever be a match for Him.2

He is the only God, the glorious Lord, Who wills, and thus carries out,
Who intends, and thus decrees, Who knows, and thus takes into account.

He causes death and gives life. He impoverishes and enriches.3 He makes
(men) laugh and makes (them) weep.4 [He brings near and drives away.].
He denies and grants.

For Him is sovereignty, so is praise. In His hand is all goodness, and
He is powerful to do everything.5

1 Allah is impenetrable (al-Samad) meaning that there is no way to
comprehend His Essence. On the meaning of al-Samad, Imam al- Sadiq
(PBUH) said, “It means the One that there is no entry in Him.” (Bihar
al-Anwar, vol. 82, p. 53).

2 cf. Chapter 112 of the Holy Quran.

3 cf. Chapter 39, Verse 52 of the Holy Quran.

4 cf. Chapter 53, Verses 43-44 of the Holy Quran.

5 cf. Chapter 64, Verse 1, and Chapter 3, Verse 26 of the Holy Quran.
He lets night enter the day, and day enter night;1 there is no god but
He, the mighty, the oft-forgiving.

He is the responder to supplication, open-handed in granting, the
enumerator of breaths, and the Lord of the Jinn and the humans.

Neither does anything bring difficulty for Him, nor does the cry of
those who appeal for help annoy Him, nor does the insistence of those
who insist exhaust Him or force Him to assent.

He (is Who) protected the righteous, and gave success to the
prosperous.


He is the guardian of the faithful, and the Lord of the worlds, Who
deserves that all His creations thank Him and praise Him [in any
situation. 1 cf. Chapter 57, Verse 6 of the Holy Quran. I (therefore)
praise Him and thank Him]¦ in joy and sorrow, and in hardship and
comfort. I believe in Him, His angels, His books, and His messengers.

I listen to His command, obey Him, proceed towards whatever pleases
Him, and submit to what He decreed, longing for His obedience and
fearing His punishment,1

for He is Allah against Whose schemes no one should feel secure, nor
should anyone be in fear of injustice from Him.

1 This phrase, among many other pieces of evidence from the Quran and
the traditions, proves that, despite some unfounded claims, even the
best human beings were obeying Allah while fearful of His punishment,
though their major goal in worship was to thank Allah for His blessings.

and 32:16 of the Holy Quran concerning the fear of Allah’s best servants
from His punishment.
