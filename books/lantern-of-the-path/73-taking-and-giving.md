Taking and Giving
=================

A person who prefers taking to giving is deluded, because in his
heedlessness he thinks that what is now is better than what is to come.
It behooves the believer, when he takes something, that he should take
it rightfully. If he gives, it should be for a right purpose, in a right
way, and from his rightful possessions. How many a taker gives up his
faith, but he is not aware of that! How many a giver brings down on
himself the wrath of Allah!

The matter is not just a question of taking and giving, however; rather
he is saved who fears Allah when taking and giving, and who holds tight
to the rope of righteousness.

In this regard people are of two types: the elite and the common. The
elite considers with painstaking caution and does not take until he is
certain that it is permissible. If it is unclear to him, he will only
take when it is absolutely necessary. The common man considers only the
outward form: he takes whatever he does not find to be stolen or
extorted, and says, 'There is no harm in this: it is permissible for
me.' Here the matter is clear, and he takes it by the judgement of
Almighty Allah and spends it in His pleasure.
