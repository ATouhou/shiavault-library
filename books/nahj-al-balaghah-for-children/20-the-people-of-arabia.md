The People of Arabia
====================

![](/sites/default/files/arabia.gif)

Allah sent Muhammad, may Allah bless

him and his Household, as a warner for

all the worlds,

and as the trustee of His revelation,

while you, **the people of Arabia**,

followed the worst of creeds

and were the most ill placed.

You lived amongst harsh rocks

and venomous serpents.

You drank muddy water

and ate coarse food.

You shed each others blood

And broke the ties of kinship.

Idols stood amongst your midst

And sins held you in their bondage.

(Sermon 26)
