Account N. 16 : Al-mufid
========================

The last writer in the list of authorities is Shaykh al-Mufid. In his
work Kitab al-Irshad[^65], hepresents an account of the martyrdom of the
Imam al-Husayn. He claims that his authorities are Ibn al-Kalbi and
al-Mada'ini. In fact, he seems mostly to have used Ibn al-Kalbi in
al-Tabari's recension. On one occasion he uses an alternative to Ibn
al-Kalbi which al-Tabari has provided concerning Ibn Ziyad's entry into
Kufa[^66], but without indicating a different source. Al-Mufid does,
however, make the beginning of the story clear by giving those events
prior to Mu\`awiya's death which al-Tabari has omitted.

The historiographical study of this event shows how the martyrdom of
the Imam al-Husayn became an important subject for historians from an
early time. Despite attempts by some to diminish the stature of the
Imam, the historical tradition has, by and large, preserved the general
picture of heroism and sacrifice. The reality, in the simpler stories,
has conveyed a more profound effect than the embellishments of some
later writers. It was the martyrdom that gave rise to the historical
writings, and the historical writings have carried on the tradition of
the martyrdom to inspire men throughout the years since the tragic
event.
