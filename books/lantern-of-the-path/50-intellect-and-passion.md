Intellect and Passion
=====================

The man of intellect submits to what is true and is just in his speech;
he shrinks from what is false but opposes it in his speech. He leaves
this world behind, but does not leave his faith.

The proof of the man of intellect lies in two things: truthful words
and correct actions. The man of intellect does not say something which
the intellect rejects, neither does he expose himself to suspicion, nor
abandon the help of those who have been tested. Knowledge guides him in
his actions; gnosis is his certainty in the paths he treads, and
forbearance is his companion at all times. Passion, however, is the
enemy of the intellect, the opponent of truth and the companion of
falsehood. The strength of passion comes from worldly appetites, and its
initial manifestation is caused by doing what is forbidden, neglecting
obligations, making light of the sunnah and engrossing oneself in
amusements.
