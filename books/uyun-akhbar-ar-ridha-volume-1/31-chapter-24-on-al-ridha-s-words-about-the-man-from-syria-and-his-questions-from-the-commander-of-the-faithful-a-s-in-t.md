24-1 Abul Hassan Muhammad ibn Amr ibn Ali ibn Abdullah al-Basri in Ilaq
narrated that the preacher Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Ahmad
ibn Jabala quoted on the authority of Abul Qasim Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn
Amer Al-Ta’ee, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Ali
ibn Musa Al-Ridha’ (a.s.), on the authority of his father Musa ibn
Ja’far (al-Kazim) (a.s.), on the authority of his father Ja’far ibn
Muhammad (as-Sadiq) (a.s.), on the authority of his father Muhammad ibn
Ali (a.s.), on the authority of his father Ali ibn Al-Husayn (a.s.), on
the authority of his father Al-Husayn ibn Ali (a.s.), “Ali ibn Abi Talib
(a.s.) was in the Jami’a Mosque of Kufa. A man from Syria stood up and
said, “O Commander of the Faithful! I have several questions.” The Imam
(a.s.) said, “Ask in order to understand. Do not ask in order to bother
us.” All the people were staring at them. The man asked, “Let me know
what was that which the Sublime God created first.” The Imam (a.s.)
said, “It was light.” The man asked, “What are the heavens made of? “
The Imam (a.s.) said, “From water vapour.” The man asked, “What is the
Earth made of? “ The Imam said, “From the foam on top of the water.” The
man asked, “What are the mountains made of?” The Imam (a.s.) said, “From
the waves.” The man asked, “Why have they called Mecca the mother of the
towns?” The Imam (a.s.) said, “Because the Earth has expanded out from
beneath it.” The man asked, “What is the sky of this world made of?”

The Imam (a.s.) said, “It is made of a restricted wave.”

The man asked, “What is the width and length of the sun and the moon?”

And the man asked why cows stare at the ground and never raise their
head up towards the sky. The Imam (a.s.) said, “They are ashamed of the
Honorable the Exalted God. The cows keep their heads down from the time
when the people of Moses (a.s.) worshipped the calf.”

And the man asked about marrying two sisters at once. The Imam (a.s.)

sisters in wedlock at one and the same time…’*[^3]

The man asked, “Why was Adam named Adam?” The Imam (a.s.) replied,
“Since he was created from the Earth’s expanse that is called *“Adeem”*
in Arabic.”[^4]

The man asked, “Why does a man inherit twice that of a woman?” The Imam
(a.s.) replied, “It is because of the wheat branch which had three
seeds. Eve ate one and gave two to Adam. That is why men inherit double
the amount that women do.”

The man asked, “Which of the Prophets (a.s.) did the Honorable the
Exalted God create circumcised at birth?” The Imam (a.s.) replied, “The
Honorable the Exalted God create Adam, Seth, Idris, Noah, Shem the son
of Noah, Abraham, David, Solomon, Lot, Ishmael, Moses, Jesus, and
Muhammad (a.s.) circumcised”[^5] The man asked about the age of Adam
(a.s.). The Imam (a.s.) said, “He lived for 930 years.”

The man asked, “Who was the first poet? The Imam (a.s.) answered, “It
was Adam.” The man asked, “What was the poem about?” The Imam (a.s.)
said, “When Adam was cast down to the earth he saw the extent of the
earth and its air. When Abel killed Cane, then Adam said,

The land and its residents have changed vastly;

The appearance of the earth has turned black and ugly;

Whatever had a taste and color has changed;

And the freshness of those good looks has diminished;

I see my life span filled with sorrow;

May I get rid of this life tomorrow?

Why should I not cry while Cane is in the grave;

Abel killed his brother Cane so brave;

O sorry! I have lost that good-looking son!

Then Satan - may God damn it - replied,

Get away from this land and its residents

As there is no more room for you anymore in this expanded Paradise

You and your spouse were living in peace

And from the troubles of the world was your heart at comfort.

But you could not escape my tricks and plots

Until you lost that valuable thing

And God gave the people tamarisk[^6] and bitter ‘*khamt*[^7]

Instead of Paradise and its open gates

And had I not received the Mercy of the Omnipotent

You would not have lost Paradise now.”

The man asked about Adam crying in Paradise and how much he (a.s.)
cried. The Imam (a.s.) said, “He cried one hundred years and tears
flowed down his right eye like the Tigris River and from his right eye
like the Euphrates River.” The man asked, “How many times did Adam
(a.s.) perform the *Hajj* pilgrimage?” The Imam (a.s.) said, “He
performed it seventy times on foot. On the first visit the Shrike[^8]
accompanied him and showed him where there was water. It had come out of
Paradise along with him. Adam (a.s.) was admonished against eating
shrikes and swallows.” The man asked, “Why does a swallow not walk on
the Earth?” The Imam (a.s.) replied, “Because it lamented over the Bayt
al-Maqdis[^9] and cried over it for forty years. It always cried along
with Adam (a.s.) and stayed with him in several homes. It carried along
nine of the verses of the Honorable the Exalted God’s Book which Adam
(a.s.) had recited in Paradise, still has them and will have them
forever. The verses were the first three verses from the beginning of
Al-Kahf, three verses from Bani Israel - that are verses [The Holy
Quran: Bani Israel 17:45-47] , and three of the verses of Ya Sin
starting with ‘*And We have put a bar in front of them and a bar behind
them, and further, We have covered them up; so that they cannot
see.’*”[^10]

The man asked about the first atheist and the initiator of atheism. The
Imam (a.s.) answered, “It was the damned Satan.” The man asked about
Noah’s name. The Imam (a.s.) said, “His name was As-Sakan. He was called
*‘Noah’* because he lamented for his people for 950 years.”[^11] The man
asked about the width and length of Noah’s Ark. The Imam (a.s.) said,
“It was eight-hundred arm-lengths in length and five hundred arm-lengths
in width and eighty arm-lengths in height.”

the Earth.” The Imam (a.s.) replied, “It was called *‘Al-Osaje*. The
cane of Moses (a.s.) was also made of the same tree.” The man asked
about the first plant that grew on the Earth?” The Imam (a.s.) said, “It
was pumpkin that is a gourd.” The man asked, “Who was the first of the
people of the heavens and the Earth who performed the *Hajj*
pilgrimage?” The Imam (a.s.) said, “It was Gabriel.” The man asked about
the first part of the Earth that was leveled during the flood?” The Imam
(a.s.) said, “It was the location of the *Kaaba* that was fresh
chrysolite green in color.” The man asked about the noblest valley on
the Earth. The Imam (a.s.) said, “It is a valley called “Sarandib” where
Adam descended to from Paradise.” The man asked about the worst valley
on the Earth. The Imam (a.s.) said, “It is a valley in Yemen called
“Barahut” and it is one of the valleys of Hell.” The man asked about the
prison which carried its own prisoner. The Imam (a.s.) said, “It was the
fish which carried Yunus ibn Matta (Jonah) with it.” The man asked about
the six creatures which were not born from the womb. The Imam (a.s.)
answered, “Adam, Eve, the sheep of Abraham, the cane of Moses, the
she-camel of Salih, and the bat which Jesus (a.s.) - the son of (the
Blessed Lady) Mary (a.s.) - made and it flew with the permission of the
Honorable the Exalted God.”

ِAnd the man asked about the accused thing which is neither human nor of
the genies. The Imam (a.s.) replied, “It is the wolf which Joseph’s
brothers accused.”

The man asked about the thing to whom God had revealed something but is
neither human nor of the genies. The Imam (a.s.) replied, “It is the bee
to which God had revealed something.”

The man asked about the purest spot on the Earth on which one cannot
pray. The Imam (a.s.) replied, “It is the roof of the *Kaaba*.”[^12]

The man asked, “What part of the Earth felt the sunshine for a portion
of one day but will never again feel it?” The Imam (a.s.) said, “It is
that part of the sea which God split apart for Moses (a.s.) and the sun
shined at its depth. Then the water covered it again and the sunshine
will never reach there again.”

The man asked about the thing which drank while it was alive and ate
while it was dead. The Imam (a.s.) replied, “It was the cane of Moses
(a.s.).”

his father - that is the one who raised him not his real father - is
Abraham (a.s.). The one who flees from his wife is Lot (a.s.). The one
who flees from his son is Noah (a.s.) fleeing from his son Kan’an.” The
man asked, “Who was the first one to undergo a sudden death?” The Imam
(a.s.) said, “It was David (a.s.) who died on the pulpit on a
Wednesday.” The man asked, “What are the four things that never get
satiated with another four things?” The Imam (a.s.) said, “The Earth
never gets satiated with rain. The female never gets satiated with the
male. The eyes never get satiated with looking and the scientist never
gets satiated with knowledge.” The man asked, “Who was the first man to
coin *Dinar* and *Dirham*?” The Imam (a.s.) said, “It was Nimrood, the
son of Kan’an after Noah (a.s.).” The man asked, “Who was the first one
to do the acts of the people of Lot (homosexuality)?” The Imam (a.s.)
said, “It was Satan who offered himself.” The man asked about the
meaning of the sound of the dove called ‘Ra’ebia?” The Imam (a.s.) said,
“It is cursing those who are people of musical instruments, singing
maidens, clarinets and lutes.” The man asked about the nickname of
*Al-Boraq*. The Imam (a.s.) said, “Its nickname is Aba Hilal.” The man
asked, “Why was the king of Tobba called Tobba?” The Imam (a.s.) said,
“He was a young writer who used to write for the king before himself. He
used to start writing by writing, “In the Name of God who created the
wind and the cry.” The king asked him to start by writing, “In the name
of the king of lightning.” But he refused to do so and said, “I will
only start writing in the Name of my Worshipped One. Then I will
consider your needs.” Then the Honorable the Exalted God thanked him for
that and granted him the kingdom of that king and the people obeyed him.
That is why he was called “Tobba.” The man asked, “Why is a goat’s tail
upwards and his private parts can be seen?” The Imam (a.s.) said, “When
Noah (a.s.) wanted to have it get on the Ark, it disobeyed Noah (a.s.).
Therefore, Noah (a.s.) used force to push it into the Ark and its tail
broke. The private parts of sheep are covered since it got on the Ark by
itself. Then Noah (a.s.) caressed it and the private parts got covered
with fat.”

The man asked him about the language of the people in Paradise. The Imam
(a.s.) replied, “The people in Paradise speak in Arabic.” He asked him
about the language of the people in the Fire. The Imam replied, “They
speak in Magi.”[^18]

The man asked him about the various ways to sleep. The Commander of the
Faithful (a.s.) said, “There are four ways to sleep. The Prophets (a.s.)
sleep on their back. Their eyes do not go to sleep and await revelations
from their Lord - the Honorable the Exalted. The believers sleep on
their right side and face the *Qibla*.[^19] The Kings and their children
sleep on their left side so that they can enjoy what they eat. Satan,
his followers, mad and ill persons sleep on their stomach.”

Then the man sat down. Another man stood up and said, “O Commander of
the Faithful! What is your opinion about Wednesdays having bad omen?”
The Imam (a.s.) said, “It is the last Wednesday of the month on which
the moon is wane. It was on that day that Abel killed his brother Cane.
Abraham was thrown into the fire on Wednesday. He was put in a catapult
on Wednesday. God drowned Pharaoh on Wednesday. The Honorable the
Exalted God destroyed the people of Lot. God sent the ‘furious
wind’[^20] to the people of ‘Ad on Wednesday. The ‘*(garden) became, by
the morning, like a dark and desolate spot, (whose fruit had been
gathered)’*[^21] on Wednesday. The Honorable the Exalted God had the bug
overcome Nimrood on Wednesday. Pharaoh wanted to kill Moses on
Wednesday. The roof fell down upon one of the pagan tribes in the past.
Pharaoh issued the order to kill baby boys on Wednesday. The Bait
ul-Moqaddas was ruined on Wednesday. The mosque of Solomon, the son of
David, in Astakhar was burnt on Wednesday. John, the son of Zacharias,
was killed on Wednesday. The punishment started to overtake the people
of Pharaoh on Wednesday. Jacob (a.s.) lost his family, wealth and
children on Wednesday. Joseph was taken to prison on Wednesday. God said
‘*..., that We destroyed them and their people, all (of them)’*[^22] on
Wednesday. The heavenly cry overtook them on Wednesday. The people of
Thamud slaughtered the she-camel on Wednesday. Stones fell down like
rain on the people of Lot on Wednesday. The Prophet’s (a.s.) head and
tooth broke on Wednesday. The Amaliqa[^23] took the Ark of Covenant from
the Children of Israel on Wednesday.” The man asked the Imam (a.s.)
about the days of the week and what can be done on them. The Commander
of the Faithful (a.s.) said, “Saturdays are for deceit and trickery.
Sundays are for planting and building. Mondays are for war and
bloodshed. Tuesdays are for traveling and making requests. Wednesdays
are for pessimism and bad omen. Thursdays are for visiting the chiefs
and Fridays are for proposing to and getting married.”[^24]

24-2 Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Mutawakkil -may God be pleased with him-
narrated that Abdullah ibn Ja’far al-Himyari quoted on the authority of
Ibrahim ibn Hashem, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Aamir Al-Ta’ee, “I
heard Abul Hassan Ali ibn Musa Al-Ridha’ (a.s.) say, ‘Wednesdays are bad
days with a bad omen. Whoever performs a phlebotomy (blood-letting) on
that day should fear that it leaves a bruise behind. And whoever removes
his hair, wool, or bristles on that day should fear to get leprosy.’”

[^1]: The word Farsakh in Arabic means extended and uninterrupted. It is
only used in Persian to denote a unit of distance. It is not clear why
the talk that is being carried out in Arabic is mixed up with Persian
words. This points out to the weakness of this tradition and its
unreliability.

[^2]: Chrysolite, a certain green transparent gem is a well-known gem
that is a kind of expensive gem similar to but more expensive than
emerald, which is dark green.

[^3]: Qur’an, 4:23

[^4]: Adam is in Hebrew

[^5]: We also see similar accounts in the Bible. Midrash Psalms 9,7
accounts thirteen people in the Biblical period who were born
circumcised. Although there is no allusion in the Hebrew Bible that
these men were born in such a condition or even that they were (or were
not) circumcised by their fathers or anyone else, the rabbis deduced
this from several verses, “And two peoples shall be separated from your
bowels (Gen 25,23), one circumcised, and the other not circumcised. From
this verse you can learn that Jacob was born circumcised.

[^6]: Any of a genus of chiefly desert shrubs and trees having tiny
narrow leaves and masses of minute flowers with five stamens and a
one-celled ovary.

[^7]: Lote-trees: A large tree (Celtis australis), found in the south of
Europe. It has a hard wood, and bears a cherrylike fruit. Called also
nettle tree. As we read in the Holy Quran, “But they turned away (from
God), and We sent against them the Flood (released) from the dams, and
We converted their two garden (rows) into "gardens" producing bitter
fruit, and tamarisks, and some few (a.s.tunted) Lote-trees.” [Qur’an,
Saba 34:16]

[^8]: Any of numerous usually largely gray or brownish oscine birds
(family Laniidae) that have a hooked bill, feed chiefly on insects, and
often impale their prey on thorns.

[^9]: Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem

[^10]: Qur’an, 36:9-11

[^11]: Noah in Arabic means lamentation.

[^12]: The way to pray on the roof of the Kaaba has been described in
Kafi and Man La Yahdharohu al-Faqih and other books on Islamic
jurisprudence. This question does not appear in a similar tradition in
Bihar al-Anwar. It may be that it is said as such here because the
narrator of this tradition is one of the adherers to the Sunni sect.

[^13]: Refer to the Chapter ‘Al-Naml of the Holy Quran.

[^14]: Qarun or Korah. Ibn Ab’bas - may God be pleased with him - held
the opinion that Qarun (Korah) was a paternal cousin of Moses (a.s.).
This view is supported by many other narrators, including Ibn Juraij,
who added that he was Qarun Ibn Yashar Ibn Qahith, while Moses was the
son of Imran Ibn Hafith. Ibn Juraij went further and rejected the
viewpoint of Ibn Ishaq that he was a paternal uncle of Moses (a.s.).
Qatadah said that Qarun was called An-Nur (the light) for he had a
melodious voice while reciting the Torah (Taurat), but he became a
hypocrite just like As-Samiri. Thus, Qarun was destroyed because of his
transgression due to the wealth and riches he had. Shahr Ibn Haushab
said that he dragged his garment (i.e. wore it long and trailing) out of
pride and arrogance. God the Almighty mentions the abundance of his
wealth and riches so that its keys would have been a burden to a body of
strong men. It was also said that the keys were made of leather and that
they used to be carried on sixty mules. God knows best! However, Qarun
was advised by the godly men from among his people: {Do not exult.
Verily God likes not those who exult (with riches, being ungrateful to
God). “But seek with that (wealth) which God has bestowed on you, the
home of the Hereafter}. That is, do not be arrogant or conceited with
riches, being ungrateful to God the Almighty. They advised him to direct
his endeavors to gain Divine Reward in the Hereafter, as it is the best
of all rewards. But he should take from his money what is lawful to him
and have the possible lawful joys of this present life. {…and forget not
your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world}. And they advised him:
{do good as God has been good to you}, that is, do good to the Creation
of God Who has been good to you. And {seek not mischief in the land},
that is, do not harm the people regarding whom you were commanded to do
good. If you harm them, God will punish you and take back what He has
granted you. {Verily, God likes not the Mufsidun (those who commit great
crimes and sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischief-makers, corrupters)}.
Qarun’s answer to this good advice of his people was nothing but: {He
said, This has been given to me only because of the knowledge I
possess}. In other words, I do not need what you have said or referred
to, as God only gave me this because He knew that I deserve it and I am
really qualified for it. Moreover, were it not that He loves me, He
would not grant me this. However, God the Almighty refutes his statement
saying: {Did he not know that God had destroyed before him generations,
men who were stronger than him in might and greater in the amount (of
riches) they had collected? But the Mujrimun (criminals, disbelievers,
polytheists, sinners) will not be questioned of their sins (because God
knows them well, so they will be punished without being called to
account)}. In other words, We have destroyed before him generations
because of their sins and bad deeds, and they were stronger than Qarun
and they had more riches and children than he. So, if what he said was
true, We would not punish anyone of those who had more riches than he
has, and his wealth and riches would not be a proof of Our love or care
for him. God the Almighty says elsewhere in Qur’an, {It is not your
wealth nor your sons, that will bring you nearer to Us in degree: but
only those who believe and work righteousness - these are the ones for
whom there is a multiplied Reward for their deeds, while secure they
(reside) in the dwellings on high! [Qur’an, Saba 34:37). And God says,
“Do they think that because We have granted them abundance of wealth and
sons, We would hasten them on in every good? Nay, they do not
understand.” [Qur’an, Al-Mu’minun 23:55-56]. God’s answer to Qarun’s
claims confirms our interpretation of Qarun’s saying, {This has been
given to me only because of the knowledge I possess}. But as for those
who claimed that he was an alchemist, or that he knew the Greatest Name
of Allah the Almighty, or that he used it to collect wealth, all these
are fallacies and not true. For alchemy cannot change the reality of
something, and the Greatest Name is of no effect if it is pronounced by
a disbeliever. And, Qarun was inherently a disbeliever and apparently a
hypocrite. Moreover, the context of the advice given by his people and
his answer to them do not support that claim. God the Almighty says: {So
he went forth before his people in his pomp}. Many interpreters
mentioned that he went forth before his people in great luxuries, with
servants, rich clothes, and riding animals. When those who were desirous
of the life of this world saw him, they wished to have the same and
wondered, “What a great fortune he has!” When their saying reached the
ears of the godly righteous men they said to them: {Woe be to you! The
Reward of God is better for those who believe and do righteous good
deeds}. That is, the Reward of God in the Hereafter is better and higher
than this. Almighty God says: {and this none shall attain except those
who are As-Sabirun (the patient in following the truth)}. In other
words, none shall attain this advice regarding the Hereafter in the
presence of the joys of this present life, except those who are guided
and those whose hearts are fixed and minds made stable by the Almighty
God’s Grace. And nothing is better than the saying of some of our
earlier scholars who said, “Verily, God loves penetrative insight in the
time of suspicious matters and perfect reasoning in the time of the
presence of desires.” God the Almighty says: {So, We caused the earth to
swallow him and his dwelling place. Then, he had no group or party to
help him against God, nor was he one of those who could save
themselves}. When God the Almighty mentions his setting forth in his
pomp, He says {So, We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling
place}. Ibn Ab’bas (may Allah be pleased with him) and as-Sadiy narrated
that Qarun gave a prostitute a sum of money to accuse Moses (a.s.),
while he was in the company of others, of committing adultery with her.
It is said that she did it and, consequently, Moses (a.s.) trembled with
fear and performed two units of prayer and then said to her, “By God!
Tell me, who hired you to do this?” She replied, “It was Qarun who hired
me to do that.” Then, she sought God’s Forgiveness and repented to Him.
Upon that, Moses (a.s.) prostrated himself and invoked God against
Qarun. God the Almighty revealed to him that He had subjugated the earth
to obey him. Moses (a.s.) commanded the earth to swallow Qarun and his
dwelling place. And so it was! God knows best! It was also said that
when Qarun went forth before his people in his pomp, with guards, mules
and fine clothes, he passed by Moses (a.s.) while he was reminding the
people of God. When the people saw Qarun, most of them turned their
faces towards him. Moses (a.s.) called to him, “Why do you do this?”
Qarun replied, “O Moses! You have been favored with prophethood and I
have been favored with riches. If you want, you may go forth and invoke
God against me, and I will invoke Him against you.” At that, both of
them went forth and Moses (a.s.) said, “Would you like to begin?” Qarun
said, “Yes,” and he made his invocations, but they were not answered.
When Moses (a.s.) invoked God the Almighty against him saying, “O God!
Command the earth to transgress today,” God revealed to him that He did.
Then Moses (a.s.) said, “O earth! Take them!” And it took them to their
feet. Then he said, “Take them!” And it took them to their knees. Then
he said, “Take them!” And it took them to their shoulders. Then he said,
“O earth! Bring their riches and treasures!” They were brought till they
saw them, then Moses (a.s.) pointed with his hand saying, “Go, you sons
of Laui!” And they sank into the earth. It was narrated from Qatadah
that he said, “They will sink into the earth till the Day of
Resurrection.” Ibn Ab’bas - may God be pleased with him - said, “They
sank into the earth till they reached the seventh earth. Allah the
Almighty says: {Then he had no group or party to help him against God,
nor was he one of those who could save themselves}. He could not help
himself or get help from others. God the Almighty states, “(Man) will
have no power, and no helper.”[Qur’an, at-Tariq 86:10] When the people
saw what happened to Qarun and his treasures, sinking into the earth and
completely destroyed, those who had desired for a position like his
position the day before regretted and thanked God the Almighty. They
said, {Had it not been that God was Gracious to us, He could have caused
the earth to swallow us up (also)! Know you not that the disbelievers
will never be successful}. Then, God the Almighty informs us that {That
home of the Hereafter}, that is, Paradise, is prepared only for those
{who rebel not against the truth with pride and oppression in the land
nor do mischief by committing crimes}. And then He says: {And the good
end is for the Muttaqun (the pious and righteous persons)}. This story
of Qarun might have taken place before they got out of Egypt, for God
the Almighty says, “ So, We caused the earth to swallow him and his
dwelling place”. Or it might have taken place after the exodus from
Egypt. God knows best! However, the Almighty God mentions the dispraise
of Qarun in several verses in the Glorious Quran. God says, “Of old We
sent Moses, with Our Signs and an authority manifest, to Pharaoh, Haman,
and Qarun; but they called (him)" a sorcerer telling lies!" [Qur’an,
Mu’min 40:23-24]. And in Chapter al-Ankabut, after mentioning \`Ad,
Thamud, Pharaoh, Haman and Qarun, He says, “(Remember also) Qarun,
Pharaoh, and Haman: there came to them Moses with Clear Signs, but they
behaved with insolence on the earth; yet they could not overreach (Us).
Each one of them We seized for his crime: of them, against some We sent
a violent tornado (with showers of stones); some were caught by a
(mighty) Blast; some We caused the earth to swallow up; and some We
drowned (in the waters): It was not Allah Who injured (or oppressed)
them, “They injured (and oppressed) their own souls.” [Qur’an, Ankabut
29:39-40]. The one who was swallowed by the earth was Qarun, and those
who were drowned were Pharaoh, Haman and their troops because they were
sinful. [Source:
