Story no. 7: The Door Bell
==========================

The door bell rang.  
 Little Fatima opened the door and said “Mamma the laundress has come”
.  
 Fatima’s mother got angry and said “Why did she come? I didn’t call
her. I’m fed up of her”.  
 Meanwhile the laundress entered and greeted her.  
 Fatima’s mother greeted her back and said “Ho! Welcome! Last night I
dreamt that I embraced you, come, I’ll embrace you.”  
 Fatima understood at once that double-facedness does exist.

O fathers and mothers! Come let us be away from double facedness, bring
it in practice and not remind our children of it.
