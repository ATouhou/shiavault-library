Supplication By Jesus Whereby He Brought the Dead Back To Life
==============================================================

As regarding his supplication whereby he used to cure the sick and
bring the dead back to life, it was as follows:

Lord! You are the Lord of those in the heavens and those on earth;
there is no god in them except You. You are the Omnipotent in the
heavens and the Omnipotent on earth; there is no Omnipotent in them
except You. You are the King of those in the heavens and the King of
those on earth; there is no king in them except You. You are the Judge
of those in the heavens and the Judge of those on earth; there is no
judge in them except You. Your Might on earth is the same as it is in
the heavens; Your Authority on earth is the same as it is in the
heavens; I plead to You by Your Glorious Attributes, for You can do
anything at all.

And here is another supplication of his for the kind reader:

Lord! I have dawned unable to avoid what I hate to face; I do not have
the benefit of what I wish to have, and the decision is out of my hands.
I have become pawned by my deeds, so none is more in need than I am.
Lord! I invoke You not to make my foe feel pleased at my own expense,
nor a friend of mine to think ill of me, and do not cause me to undergo
a catastrophe related to my creed, and do not make the life of this
world the greatest of my concerns, and do not place me at the mercy of
one who will have no mercy on me, O ever-Living One, O
self-Sustaining!
