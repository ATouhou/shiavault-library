Foreword by the Translators
===========================

Efforts to translate this book began two and one half years ago. Its
completion was delayed due to the difficulties in finding appropriate
words for Dr. Shariati's unique and sophisticated language which conveys
his important message. This translation is not the most perfect
translation of the original text. However, the purpose is to transmit
the author's views and understanding of Hajj and not to produce a
literary replica of the original.

It is highly recommended that this book be completed in one reading and
not in intervals so as to maintain continuity in one's train of
thoughts. The essence of the book will be more easily projected and
comprehended if this approach is used.

The Qur’anic verses and Hadith from the original text have been
translated into English for the benefit of the reader. Marmaduke
Pickthall's translation of the Qur’an is the source for translation of
Qur’anic verses. Also, in some instances the author's opinions have been
further explained by the translator in the form of footnotes.

Because of its universal message, this book will be appealing to
all- -Muslims or non-Muslims! Its subject matter deals with issues and
teachings which relate to mankind. The contents will be useful to all in
their pursuit to understand the concept of mankind as he/she "should be"
in contrast to what he/she "is" today.
