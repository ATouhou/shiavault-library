41: [signs] Spelled Out (ha Mim)
================================

This chapter of 54 Meccan verses is arranged in six sections. It was
revealed in sequence after the previous one called The Believer 40 and
before the next one on Consultation 42. When the Prophet's uncle
\`Utbali ibn-Hisham heard this, he is said to have exclaimed: "By God. I
have heard a recitation such as I have never heard before! It is neither
poetry, nor magic, nor divination... Leave this man alone," referring of
course to his nephew.

The chapter deals with creation (II) and what one may expect as a reward
for his actions. The role of the prophets who were sent to the ancient
Arabian peoples of \`Ad and Thamud is mentioned (II), the Golden Rule in
its Islamic context is also stated (V); and then at the very end, the
Qur'an itself is described. The alternate title for the chapter is
Ha-Mim on Worship".
