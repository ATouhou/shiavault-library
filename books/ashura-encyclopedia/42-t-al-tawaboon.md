After the martyrdom of Imam Husayn, the Shi'a of Karbala realized their
mistake and were determined to do something to avenge the death of the
Imam and ask forgiveness for their wrongdoings. They chose Sulaimaan Ibn
Sard Alkhoza'eey as their leader and secretly started gathering weapons
and money in order to be able to fight.

During this period, Yazeed Ibn Muâ€™awiyyah died. When they felt they had
a good enough army, they publicized their movement during Marwan Ibn
Al-Hakam's reign and declared their army of about 4000 people.

They walked all the way to Imam Husayn's resting place asking Allah for
forgiveness. Finally they went to Al-Shaam, the area encompassing Syria,
Palestine, Lebanon today, and there they fought one of the bloodiest
battles ever. They could not beat the powerful Army of Al-Shaam, so they
came back to Kufa at night. Amongst the martyrs in the battle in
Al-Shaam were: Sulaimaan Ibn Sard, Abdullah Ibn Sa'ad Al Azdi, Abdullah
Ibn Wa'el, and Rifa'ah Ibn Shadad.
