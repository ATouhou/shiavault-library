The Attempted Murder of Imam Zien El-Abedeen (Q)
================================================

Imam Zein El-Abedeen and Sayyed Al-Sajjadeen Ali bin Al-Hussain (Q) was
present in Karbala with his father, but he was sick, and it was not
documented in the historical references how long did his sickness last,
but it was understood from some of the historical indications that he
(Q) was still very sick and weak even when they reached Damascus.

Yet, Shamer Bin Zi Al-Jawshan entered the tent where Imam Zein
El-Abedeen (Q) was, while he was resting down on a mattress and said:
"Kill this one!" A man among his soldiers said to him: "Praised Be
Allah! Do you want to kill such a young and sick man who did not fight
you?"

Just then Sayyeda Zeinab (O) came to him and said: "By Allah, he shall
not be killed unless I am killed first! So stay away from him".

Here, it is important to point that his sickness (Q) even though it was
a helping factor in driving the enemies away from killing him, since
they thought he is very close to being dead due to his sever sickness,
but it was not the main reason that had stopped them. Indeed, it was the
great heroic stand of his aunt, Sayyeda Zeinab (O) when she held him and
said to Shamer: "You had enough of our blood! By Allah, I shall never
separate from him, if you want to kill him you shall kill me as well!"
She (O) had repeated this great heroic act in many occasions.
