37: (drawn Up In) Ranks (saffat)
================================

This chapter contains five long sections arranged in 182 Meccan verses.
It was revealed after the chapter on Livestock 6 and before Luqman 31.
Here we find a vivid description of what men can expect to meet after
Doomsday (I): eternal bliss, or the Infernal Tree (II). We also hear the
story of several prophets in rapid narrative: Noah, Abraham and Isaac
(III); Moses, Aaron. Elijah and Lot (IV); and finally Jonah (V), each
summed up by a unifying refrain:' Thus We reward those who act kindly...

The angels "drawn up in ranks"" finally speak out in V. 165, and we are
told at the very end that God is not a father (V). The word Jahim is
used rather consistently for 'Hades, \` and not Jahannam or 'Hell', in
an alliterative effect.

The whole chapter provides a very moving picture.
