71: Noah (nuh)
==============

These 28 later Meccan verses were revealed after Bees 16 and before
Abraham 14. The chapter concerns Noah's mission.

The end of the first section tells how the Universe was formed; this
section really consists of a short sermon. As usual in these shorter
early chapters in this part of the Qur'an. this one also has a rhyme.
