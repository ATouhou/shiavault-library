Part 4: Regarding the Qualities and special merits of Imam al-Zamana (as) due to which it becomes incumbent to pray for him
===========================================================================================================================

Here we have mentioned some points that even if one of them is present
in a person it becomes obligatory for us to pray for him, according to
the dictates of reason or religious law or human nature or animal
instinct.

While it is a fact that all these points are present in the holy being
of the Imam of the time (aj), I have arranged some of them in
alphabetical order, invoking the Almighty Allah to assist me in this
matter and include me among the sincere followers and slaves of the seal
of the successors and his repected forefathers, indeed Allah is the
hearer of supplications.
