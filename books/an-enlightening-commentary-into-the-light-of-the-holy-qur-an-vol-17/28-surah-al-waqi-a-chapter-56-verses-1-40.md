***In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.***

The Chapter was revealed in Mecca and it has 96 Verses. The title of the
Chapter, Waqi‘a, is a designation of Resurrection whose imminence is
prognosticated in the opening Verse. The majority of the blessed Verses
of the Chapter treat of Resurrection, its qualities and happenings, and
division of mankind into peoples of Hell and Paradise on that Day. Thus,
recitation of the Chapter is awakening.

Merits of Recitation of the Chapter
-----------------------------------

Numerous traditions are to be found in Islamic sources concerning the
recitation of the Chapter an instance of which is a Prophetic tradition
according to which:

***"One who recites Surah al-Waqi‘a will be excluded from the
neglectful."***[^1]

The blessed Verses of the Chapter are so shocking and awakening that no
room is left for human neglect. It is narrated from Imam Sadiq (as):

*"Whoever recites Surah al-Waqi‘a every Friday night, God Almighty will
like him and will make him to be loved by all people. He will never
suffer hardships, poverty, destitution, and other worldly afflictions.
He will be amongst the friends of the Commander of the Faithful, Imam
‘Ali (as)."*[^2]

It goes without saying that such Blessings may not fall into the lot of
one who merely recites the blessed Verses of the Chapter without
attending to their significance, but recitation is supposed to follow
intellection and acting upon Divine Injunctions.

***1. When the Great Event [Resurrection] befalls.***  
***2. There can be no denial of its befalling.***

As reflected in numerous Qur’anic Verses, the Events of Resurrection are
initially accompanied by great and shocking happenings.

The blessed Chapter in question focuses on Resurrection and similar
Events are being enumerated in its opening Verses, e.g.

***"When the Great Even befalls, There can be no denial of its
befalling"***

since the Events preceding Resurrection shall be so shocking and
awakening that their manifestations shall be reflected in all the
constituent elements of the world.

The Arabic word waqi‘a:

***("event")***

alludes to Resurrection, since it is inevitable. The word is also
regarded as one of the designations of Resurrection. Some Qur’anic
exegetes maintain that the Arabic word kadhiba is employed in the
infinitive sense connoting that befalling of Resurrection shall be so
crystal clear that it leaves no room for denial and discussion.

Some Qur’anic exegetes hold that it is used in its literal present
participial sense saying that it reflects that befalling that Day is
inevitable and there shall be no denial of the same.

It is worthy of note that following the blessed Qur’anic Verses on
Divine Graciousness as attested in Chapter 55 (Surah al-Rahman) serve as
a reminder of Resurrection which is owing to His Attribute of
Graciousness and also designates that the posthumous survival of man
constitutes the most exalted Emanation of His Graciousness.

According to some Qur’anic exegetes, the designation of the blessed
Chapter alludes to the multiplicity of hardships to be inflicted at the
Time. It is a source of encouragement for people to prepare themselves
for such hard Day.

Surah al-Waqi‘a - Verses 3-4

***3. That Event lowers and elevates the system of creation and makes it
upside down thus lowers the evil and elevates the good.***  
***4. When the earth shall be shaken with a terrible shake.***

Resurrection makes alterations in both the world and mankind. Thus, the
blessed Verse 3 is saying that Resurrection lowers some people and
elevates some others.

The arrogant, the disobedient, and the wrong-doers shall be denigrated
whereas believers and righteous good-doers shall be elevated to the
zenith of glory. The mighty shall be humiliated and sinners shall be
cherished with no reason.

Some people shall fall into the depth of Hell and some others shall
abide in the most exalted levels of Paradise. They are all the
consequences of Divine Great and Encompassing Revolution.

In this vein, a tradition is narrated regarding the exegesis of the
blessed Verse in question from Imam ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn (as):

*"Resurrection shall be lowering since by God Almighty! Enemies of Allah
shall be cast into Hellfire and it shall be elevating, since by God
Almighty! The friends of Allah shall be elevated to the higher levels of
Paradise."*[^3]

Honor and humility and exalted and lower ranks shall become crystal
clear on that Day as great figures have said that true poverty and
affluence shall be manifest upon presenting the record of deeds before
God Almighty.[^4]

The blessed Verse 4 further treats of such Events, saying that
Resurrection shall befall when the earth shall be shaken with a terrible
shake as the occurrence of Resurrection and its terrible earthquakes is
indubitable.

The word idha

***("when")***

is herein employed to connote inevitability.

Surah al-Waqi‘a - Verses 5-6
----------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَبُسَّتِ الْجِبَالُ بَسًّا
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَكَانَتْ هَبَاء مُّنبَثًّا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***5. And the mountains shall be powdered to dust.***  
***6. Therefore, they shall become scattering dust particles.***

The blessed Verses 5 and 6 are saying that the earthquake shall be so
enormous that it shall pulverize mountains into scattering dust
particles. The Arabic word bussat derives from b-s-s denoting "grind by
water."

The Arabic words haba’ and munbath denote

***"dust"***

and

***"scattered"***

respectively. By haba’ minute dust particles are intended which scatter
and suspend in the air and are normally invisible unless one looks at
them in sunlight penetrating into some dark place.

Now one may understand that the earthquake and the explosion are so
enormous that they may pulverize colossal mountains proverbial for
solidity into scattered dust particles and the shout heard from such
enormous explosion shall be even more horrible. In short, Qur’anic
Verses present different depictions as to different stages of the
enormous explosion of mountains.

It is needless to say that only God Almighty is All-Aware of the course
of such events which may not be describable in our own terms. However,
such meaningful allusions all reflect the enormity of such enormous
explosion.

It is worthy of note that the earth which is our abode and resting place
on which we strive to make our sustenance shall be perturbed and
restless on that Day such that an unprecedented earthquake shall
severely agitate the earth and.

The same motif is to be found elsewhere in the Holy Qur’an[^5] as well:

***"O mankind! Fear Lord and be dutifully to Him! Indeed, the earthquake
of the Hour [of Resurrection] shall be a terrible thing."***

Thus, we are supposed to obedient and do righteous good deeds such that
we may restrain ourselves from committing sins in order to avoid
entanglement in torment on such Day.

***7. And you shall be in three groups on that Day.***  
***8. Therefore, people on the Right Hand are as if they are
personifications of happiness.***  
***9. And people on the Left Hand, how unfortunate shall they be because
of their vices and unhappiness.***

Depiction of the Great Event of Resurrection is followed by a treatment
of the conditions of people on that Day.

They are divided into three groups;

***("And you shall be in the three groups on that Day").***

The Arabic word jawj is not only applied to feminine and masculine but
also it connotes similar objects.

Since certain people shall be similar on the Day of Resurrection, the
blessed Verse 8 treats of the first group, namely

***the people on the Right Hand (ashab al-maymana)***

whom are being referred to as fortunate, since the record of their deeds
are given to their right hands.

They symbolize the saved believers doing righteous good deeds. They
shall be granted Divine Rewards. The Arabic word maymana is cognate with
yumn which denotes happiness. Thus, the first group includes the happy
and the fortunate.

The blessed Verse 9 makes mention of

***the people on the Left Hand (ashab al-mush’ama)***

who are the unfortunate people.

How unfortunate they are that the records of their deeds shall be given
to their left hands owing to their misery and unhappiness. They
symbolize those who committed sins and did wrong.

The expression:

***"people on the Left Hand"***

reflects their utmost misery and unhappiness.

***10. And those foremost in doing righteous good deeds shall be
foremost in receiving Rewards.***  
***11. These shall be the nearest Divine Threshold.***  
***12. In the Gardens abounding in Blessings.***  
***13. A multitude of those shall be from the ancients and former
nations.***  
***14. And a few of those shall be from later generations.***

Taking the lead in matters of faith and doing righteous good deeds is
meritorious. Those who take the lead in doing righteous good deeds in
this world shall be foremost in receiving Divine Rewards. Depicting the
third group, the blessed Verses 10 and 11 are saying that "those
foremost shall be nearest to Divine Threshold."

The Arabic word sabiqun is ad hoc applied to those who are not only
foremost in matters of faith and belief, but are also foremost in doing
righteous good deeds and in matters of human ethics. They serve as
people's role models and leaders as a consequence of which they are
nearest to Divine Threshold.

Therefore, different Qur’anic exegetes interpret their being foremost
owing to their being foremost in obedience to Allah, establishing the
five daily prayers, embarking upon jihad and emigration, repentance, and
the like. Thus, Qur’anic exegetes address different aspects of such
broad sense.

According to Islamic traditions, the Arabic word sabiqun is applied to
Habil (Abel), the believer among the family of Pharaoh, Habib Najjar,
and the Commander of the Faithful, Imam ‘Ali (as) owing to their being
foremost in their own communities, for instance Imam ‘Ali (as) was the
first man who converted to the Islamic faith.

Such instances do not restrict the semantic application of the word.

It is also worthy of note that Ibn ‘Abbas narrates from the Messenger of
Allah (S) that he asked the Noble Prophet of Islam (S) concerning the
exegesis of the blessed Verse in question and he replied:

*"Gabriel said unto me that they are ‘Ali (as) and his followers who
shall be foremost in being admitted to Paradise and they shall be
nearest to Divine Threshold owing to the respect accorded them by God
Almighty."*[^6]

These are actually the manifest and perfect instances of the aforesaid
concept encompassing all who have been foremost in all nations and
communities.

The blessed Verse 12 tersely depict the exalted state of:

***"those nearest to Divine Threshold"***

in the Gardens of Paradise abounding in Divine Blessings, saying that
different material and immaterial Blessings of Paradise are in store for
them. The depiction may also reflect that the Gardens of Paradise
constitute the only place where Divine Blessings may be found. They
stand in contrast against the gardens in this world which are the means
of living and toil for mankind.

In like manner, the state of those nearest to Divine Threshold in this
world is different than that of the Hereafter, since their exalted state
in this world is accompanied by responsibilities, whereas the Hereafter
is their resting place abounding in Blessings.

It goes without saying that "nearest" herein reflects their exalted
state rather than spatial nearness, since God Almighty does not exist in
space and is nearer to us than ourselves.

The blessed Verse 13 treats of the manner of diving people in former
nations and the Muslim community, saying that:

***"a multitude of those shall be from the ancients and former
nations."***

The blessed Verse 14 is saying that:

***"and a few of those shall be from later generations"***

in which the Arabic word thulla designates "group, multitude" and some
Qur’anic exegetes maintain that it denotes "piece, part" which ad hoc
connotes "enormous part."

According to the blessed Verse, a great multitude of those nearest to
Divine Threshold are from former nations and few of them are from the
Muslim community.

It is also worthy of note that certain believers may not be amongst
those foremost in matters of belief, but they may possess certain
qualities and characteristics thereby they may be on a par with "the
foremost" in terms of being granted Divine Rewards.

In this vein, traditions have been narrated from Imam Muhammad Baqir
(as) who said:

*"We are the foremost of the foremost and we are the last ones."*[^7]

It is narrated from Imam Sadiq (as) that addressed to a number of his
followers, he said:

*"You are the first and the last of those foremost in loving us in this
world and the foremost in being admitted to Paradise in the
Hereafter."*[^8]

It is also worthy of note that some Qur’anic exegetes interpret the
foremost and the last as the first and the last Muslim communities that
are accordingly the nearest to Divine Threshold.

***15. On thrones laid side by side adorned with precious stones.***  
***16. Reclining thereon, face to face.***

The blessed twain Verses treat of the material and immaterial Blessings
granted to those nearest to Divine Throne on the Day of Resurrection.
Such Blessings are innumerable, they are depicted in the blessed Verses
in question such that man with his limited intellectual capacities be
able to comprehend them.

The blessed Verses are saying that thrones shall be prepared for those
nearest to Divine Throne, thrones adorned with different jewels like
rubies, diamonds, and emeralds. The blessed Verse 16 is saying that the
people of Paradise shall recline upon those couches and thrones while
they shall be face to face enjoying each other's society without being
bored of loneliness.

It might be a reference to numerous thrones laid together thus according
further glory to their majestic mansions. The Arabic word surur is the
plural form of sarir denoting throne and mawdhuna designates a special
fabric adorned with pearls and rubies.

***18. With cups, jugs, and a glass of flowing springs of Paradise [or
pure wine],***  
***19. Wherefrom they shall get neither any aching of the head, nor any
intoxication.***

The first two blessed Verses in question are saying that the people of
Paradise reclining on those magnificent thrones are in a safe place
around whom boys and youths of fair face and good character possessing
utmost beauty move. They were originally created in Paradise and are
immortal.

They serve the people of Paradise with jugs and glasses with or without
handle, namely all kinds of vessels. The third blessed Verse is saying
that the people of Paradise drink from bowels filled with the wine of
Paradise and pure water which may allude to the water of springs flowing
in Paradise, or pure wine mingled with camphor and ginger.

Such wine causes neither headache nor intoxication. The Arabic word
akwab is applied to jugs without handles and narrow mouths, similar to
mundane jugs. The Arabic word abariq is the plural of ibriq denoting a
vessel with a handle and a narrow mouth. Ka’s designates a glass
brimming with wine or other drinks.

Ma’in is applied to drink. The verbal form yusadda‘un denotes headache.
The verbal form yunzafun derives from n-z-f originally denoting gradual
extraction of water from a well but it ad hoc connotes "driving mad."

***21. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.***

The blessed twain Verses further treat of the material Blessings in
store for the people of Paradise who are nearest to Divine Throne,
saying youths in Paradise shall make available to them whatever kinds of
fruits and the flesh of fowls which they desire. It is worthy of note
that the precedence of fruit over flesh is that the former is healthier
and consumption of fruit before meal is far better.

***22. And fair females with wide, lovely eyes,***  
***23. Like pearls in shells.***  
***24. A Reward for what they used to do.***

The first twain blessed Verses are saying that the people of Paradise
shall have spouses from amongst huris with fair complexions and wide
black eyes who are preserved like pearls in shells. The Arabic word hur
is the plural form of hawra’ and ahwar, denoting those whose pupils of
eyes are raven black and the whiteness of their eyes are quite
transparent.

The Arabic word ‘ayn, the plural forms of which are ‘ayna’ and a‘yan,
denotes "wide-eyed." The emphasis is owing to the fact that most of the
beauty of mankind lies in their eyes. In other words, the spouses in
Paradise are so beautiful that eyes shall be astonished by looking at
them. The Arabic word maknun denotes "concealed" and it herein connotes
being preserved in shells, since pearls are more transparent and more
beautiful while they are still lying untouched in their shells.

The expression may connote that they are totally preserved from other
people's eyes, since they are untouched and unseen by others.

The third blessed Verse is saying that the Divine Blessings shall be
bestowed upon them because of their righteous good deeds, such that one
may not falsely imagine that such innumerable Divine Blessings of
Paradise shall be bestowed upon anyone with no reason, but being
accorded such Blessings requires unfaltering belief and constant doing
of righteous good deeds.

***25. No vain talk shall they hear therein, nor any sinful speech.***  
***26. But only the saying of peace, peace!***

The Arabic word laghw denotes vain talk and ta’thim is applied to
ascribing committing of sin to others. There shall be no psychological
pain in Paradise. Mundane pleasures usually entail vain talk and
committing sins, but it is different in Paradise since it is the abode
of peace and serenity.

Vain talk and sin may not penetrate a peaceful and serene community. The
people of Paradise shall not hear anything but the sayings of Peace by
God Almighty, the angels nearest unto Him, and the salutations and
greetings exchanged amongst them.

They shall attend sessions brimming with enthusiasm, friendship, love,
and purity.

Paradise is the Abode of Peace, Serenity, and Security:

***("For them shall be the Home of Peace with their Lord. And He shall
be their Protector and Helper because of what they used to
do,")***[^9]***.***

***28. [They shall be] among thornless lote trees,***  
***29. And among fragrant talh trees beautiful of color and abundant in
leaves.***

Following depictions of material and immaterial Blessings bestowed upon
those nearest to Divine Threshold, the blessed Verses in question treat
of the people of the Right Hand. They shall be the happy group whose
brilliant record of deeds shall be given to their right hands.

The blessed Verse 27 makes mention of their exalted state saying that
the people of the Right Hand are so fortunate. This is the best
expression of their state connoting indescribable attributes. The
blessed Verse 28 is saying that they shall rest beneath thornless lote
trees.

It is actually the best depiction possible for human perception
regarding trees in Paradise. It is narrated that a Bedouin asked the
Noble Prophet (S) regarding the exegesis of the blessed Verse.

The Noble Prophet of Islam (S) replied:

*"God Almighty has cut off the thorns of this tree and has made fruits
instead of thorns, such that the different fruits are unlike each
other."*[^10]

The third blessed Verse is saying that they rest in the shade green,
fragrant trees which are beautiful of color. Some Qur’anic exegetes say
that banana trees are being intended which have quite broad, green, and
beautiful leaves and sweet and delicious fruit. The Arabic word mandhud
denotes "dense."

***30. And in shade long extended,***  
***31. And by waterfalls,***  
***32. And fruit in plenty,***  
***33. Whose supply is not cut off, nor are they out of reach,***

The four blessed Verses further depict heavenly Blessings like long
extended shades. Some Qur’anic exegetes interpret the long extended
shade as a state between the twain risings when shades encompass
everywhere.

According to a tradition narrated from the Noble Prophet of Islam (S),

***"long extended shade"***

connotes that the people of Paradise shall never be harmed by sunlight,
but they shall rest in extended and pleasant shades at all times.[^11]

The blessed Verse 31 is saying that the people of Paradise abide by
quite beautiful waterfalls. The Arabic word maskub denotes flowing and
since waterfalls create the most beautiful landscapes and its whispers
gives delight to the soul and its scenery pleases the eyes, it is
regarded as one of the Divine Blessings bestowed upon the people of
Paradise.

The blessed Verse 32 is saying that such trees and flowing water are
accompanied by different fruits. Thus, the blessed Verse 33 is saying
that fruits of Paradise are different from those of this world in that
they are never cut off nor are they out of reach.

Fruits of this world are limited to certain seasons and solely appear on
branches for a few weeks or months. Besides heavenly fruits never entail
harms for certain people, namely, unlike fruits of this world, they
possess general availability.

***35. Indeed, We created them of a novel creation.***  
***36. And made all of them virgins.***  
***37. Loving their husbands and of equal age, fluent, and sweet of
tongue.***

Referring to another Blessing, the blessed Verse 34 is saying that the
people of Paradise have cherished women. The Arabic word furush is the
plural form of firash originally denoting any kind of bed spread for
rest.

It is narrated from the Commander of the Faithful, Imam ‘Ali (as) that
concerning the exegesis of the blessed Verse he said:

*"Precious carpets are herein intended which are spread on their
couches."*

Some Qur’anic exegetes maintain that by furush, women are intended,
since woman is termed thus in the Arabic tongue. The adjective marfu‘a
connotes their exalted state in terms of beauty and endearment.

The blessed Verses 35-37 enumerate four characteristics for huris in
Paradise. Firstly, they are women in Paradise who have been created in
Paradise rather than in this world. Secondly, they are virgins.

Thirdly, they love their husbands. Fourthly, they are thirty three years
of age. According to some traditions, all the people of Paradise are
fair of complexion, pure, and hairless of body and have black eyes and
very beautiful hair.

***39. A multitude of those [on the Right Hand] shall be from former
nations.***  
***40. And a multitude of those [on the Right Hand] shall be from the
later generations.***

All these Blessings are in store for the people on the Right Hand who
are righteous good-doing believers. Since the records of their deeds
shall be given to their right hands and they shall be called the
fortunate and the happy, they are designated as the people on the Right
Hand.

It is worthy of note that the state of those nearest to Divine Threshold
may not be compared to that of the people of the Right Hand, because the
former abide within the proximity of God Almighty whereas the latter
dwell in the affluence of Blessings.

The Arabic word thulla in the third and the fourth blessed Verses in
question originally denotes a piece of wool, though it connotes large
number and multitude. Qur’anic exegetes differ as to the contextual
meanings of "a multitude from former nations" and "a multitude from the
later generations.

The majority of the exegetes, based on the contents of certain
traditions, maintain that

***"former nations"***

and

***"later generations"***

both refer to those nations living before the Noble Prophet's (S)
community. However, some Qur’anic exegetes hold that the former
designates pre-Islamic nations and the latter refers to the community of
the Noble Prophet of Islam (S) whose population is twice the former.
