Introduction
============

In the year eleventh of Hijra the vicissitude played its first
performance; turned a page among the pages of the glorious history of
Islam that were worded by the Divine light -- all of them faith, truth,
'JIHAD', sacrifice, pride, power, honor, glory, justice, mercy,
brotherhood and humanity.

Such a page glaring with good and superiority was turned aside by the
vicissitude as soon as that hallowed light was extinguished from the
earth. And the page with a blurred script received the Muslims from its
BOOK.

Says God:

"If he died or were slain, will you then turn back on your heels?"
(Chap. 3-Verse 139)

Indeed, who believes Quran a Divine Revelation, and he who brought it
does not speak incited by lust, would carry no doubt that in that great
historical event or that celestial thunderbolt in the death of the
Savior of humanity there was a boundary separating the two periods-each
completely differing from the other; that one, drawing the person and
the precious near to God; and this one, turning against Him backward.

Then, we now face a thing already happened;

The Prophet has died!

Perhaps the Muslims turned back on their heels. All of them? Now I know
not. -- But..., curse on this but, anyway --the event was evident of
this upset.

I beg your attention, my reader! Please think openly and find out for
me an even of import took place immediately after the Prophet's death
and overtook all the Muslims its drizzle. Do you find other than the
event of SAQIFA? Do you know that the Shia purport this very event in
their interpretation of the holy Quranic verse?

If we delve into SAQIFA, we are searching into the greatest happening
that befell in Islam, the first one after the Prophet's passing away;
and this verse has a bearing thereon.

Therefore, I told in the introduction that a group came out of that
while others sank down. The centipede of the event gave raise to beliefs
and propensities in phases several and various tiresome for a seeker of
Truth. Before I enter into the dispute of SAQIFA I do not see wrong if I
claim that the interpretation of this Quranic verse covers the events of
"RADDA"1 during the caliphate of Abu Baker.

But, I can not coast certainty for this assumption because the verse
clearly indicates the change that happens after the Prophet's death
immediately besides the plural form in which it addresses to all
Muslims. AHL AL-RADDA (the people of rejection) was very few.

They did not constitute even a minority. In whatever a way we suppose;
yet, they were still in most maximum the least minimum.

Above all, we find them -- the cardinal ones whom we call the people of
1- "RADDA" means reject on. In history the events are recorded under the
name RADDA. Those who rejected Abu Baker's caliphate are Known by The
people of Rejection" (AHL ALRADDA) and all of them were massacred by
Khalid Bin Waleed. (TRANSLATOR)

rejection' -- those who had claimed prophet hood and those who were
their followers. Muailama and his followers, Taliha and his associates;
all of them were in the days of the Prophet. Their affair flourished
after the Prophet's death. The only exemption goes to Sajah al-Tamima.

She did not enjoy any importance and later she united with Musailama.
As for Al-Aswad al-Anasi, he was killed in the Prophet's days. His
sympathizers adopted his way later on. As for Alqama Bin Alaye, he
became a pagan in the very days of the Prophet. Om Rafal Bint Malik and
her associates too had a similar fate.

This being the case, it does not sound wise to say: "These were the
people who reverted back after the Prophet's death." It is far from
justice to conclude in that way. No one will agree who is blessed with a
salubrious thought and a free opinion.

As for Malik Bin Nowaira; he compromised Sajah as Ka'ab al-Qarzi had
done with the Prophet -- to maintain peace and renounce war. But the
compromise had no bearing on 'RADDA'. It was in the interests of Muslims
that there should be no assault by Sajah on those lands remote from the
Muslims' centre. This was a desired thing much aspired for.

If at all that compromise was a fault; it was repented by him and his
people as did Wakee and Sama'a who too had compromised with Sajah. And
the Muslims who were fighting accepted their repentance.

Abu Baker atoned for the murder of Malik by paying blood money when
Khalid murdered him and slept with the wife of the murdered in the same
night of the murder. Then, the reversion, the gist of the verse, how
could be interpreted?

Malik, if at all could be counted among 'The people of rejection' (AHL
AL- RADDA), can not be considered at fault. But, it is upon them to
defend the deed and extenuate the act of his murderer because the
murderer was that day the hero of Muslims and their leader.

Let Malik be a pagan deserved the murder; it is not our concern to
blame Malik what he deserved and what he was deprived of as long as the
prestige of Khalid is protected and he guarded from censure! Omar Bin
Khattab wanted to punish Khalid for murdering Malik and debauchery with
the wife of the murdered. But Abu Baker refrained from doing so.

The excuse he put forward was this: "Khalid endeavored but erred." The
error of the endeavorers should be respected? This is from the early
pages of a long record of Abu Baker. He openly violated the law of
Islam.

Mutam'mam, brother of Malik, upbraided Abu Baker in these lines:

"You called him to God;
Then killed him for what?
Had he called you by any odd?
Have never used a cheating rod."
Abu Baker only lied in reply: "I did not call him nor did I kill
him."

The history extenuates Malik. But some of the writers of this time
insist upon his pagan hood because of their insistence to defend
Khalid.

Well, who are the 'People of Rejection' other than those?

Those who refused the 'ZAKAT!'

Who are they? Their names? Names of their tribes? I wish one had
pointed them to me. I delved in history. The history gathers, groups,
gleans, and sifts; but no name comes out other than the already
mentioned ones.

There is a well-known saying of Abu Baker: "If I am restricted by tying
my knees; yet, I shall fight them for it."2 He uttered these words to a
delegation of Taliha (who had claimed the prophet hood) to announce
their compromise which was that they eschew the ZAKAT but perform the
prayers.

Accordingly it could be supposed that there might have had been other
several unknown groups too who did not undergo the yoke of ZAKAT while
they did perform the prayers.

It is just disobedience; and not pagan hood or disowning God. Had it
been so they would have not prayed either? When they prayed; they have
worshipped God. So how can they be termed as pagans? There is no proof
to indicate their disowning the ZAKAT as obligation.

As such they can not be said to have rejected the essentialities of
religion and, therefore, can not be classified as pagans. The thing that
is known about them (if ever they existed other than those who had
claimed prophet hood) was their unwillingness to pay the ZAKAT.

But all this can not obtenebrate the claim that they rejected to yield
to the authority of Abu Baker which had sprung without consultation of
the Muslims, a popular base, as said by Omar Bin Khattab himself.3 His
authority and his leadership were not acknowledged. So, why to pay the
ZAKAT and to whom? Perhaps they demanded the caliphate should go to him
whom the Prophet had desired. But, the history ignored their demand.

These possibilities neither lose their credibility nor could they be
obliterated by history. The Shias have stored in them their claim. What
is the proof for us to believe them? As the history has neglected their
names and their tribes let us better ignore the very existence of
them.

However, if a writer could establish the reversion at the first
happening in Islam, the position of the subsequent happenings does not
concern him. The first incident is sufficient enough to him to cater the
analysis.

First of all I see myself as desperate as my reader to see what the
Prophet did to solve die difference when he would be no more; whether a
will Suggesting his successor, or a ground to be resorted to, or the
matter left to itself and along with they too. This dispute has a strong
hold on the subject of our discussion depending on the analysis of many
incidents. So, in these four premises shall run our pen?

One: The Prophet's stand towards the caliphate
Two: The Prophet's intention to avoid the difference
Three: Yielding to SAQIFA
2- The pronoun 'it' refers to ZAKAT. (TRANSLATOR)
3- Yielding to the authority of Abu Baker was a tawdry. God shielded
its evil/ mischief. (TRANSLATOR)
