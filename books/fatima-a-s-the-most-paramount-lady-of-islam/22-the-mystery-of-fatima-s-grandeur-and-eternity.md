The Mystery of Fatima’s Grandeur and Eternity:
==============================================

Fatima (peace be upon her) is grand and eternal on the account that she
has been united with Allah. She has absorbed her self in His.

She is greater than the great, because she is acquainted with Allah, who
is the greatest, and she is eternal forever until Doomsday, because she
is acquinted with the Eternal.

Fatima (peace be upon her) is a woman, whose grandeur cannot be inserted
in expression and words, because we cannot analyze the infinite with our
finite conception. When she is called “Sedigheh” [truthful], it is
different from the Sedigheh, applied to others; all her members of body
and thought are truthful. It is impossible to describe her grandeur
through writing, speaking, and hearing, because all her attributes are
in full and infinity. Her faith, her morals, devotion, soul elevation,
grandeur, knowledge all are in utmost perfection.
