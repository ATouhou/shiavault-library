In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful All praise belongs
to God, and his greetings and salutations be upon His Prophet Muhammad
and his Household, the best and the purest creatures (p.b.u.h.).

The tragedy of Ashura has been a shock to the souls and consciences of
human beings, and raised the emotions of the Muslims to expand their
social activities.

In that event the emotions and reasons of people were injured. The
tears and mourning run through their faces; the hearts were drowning
towards the place of martyrdom of the sons and househoulds of the holy
Prophet and divine messenger. The love and affection of the Muslims, all
those who trusted in the message of their grandfather, the holy
Muhammad, were directed toward them; and caused the people to come
nearer to each other.

This terrible tragedy has always injured the souls of the pure human
beings during the history, which will never recover. By the passage of
time, more dimensions of the calamity become apparent. And, at the same
time, the divine virtues and characteristics of the martyred innocent
persons becomes more apparent to the generations and communities more
and more.

The Muslims reminded of the meaningful word of their holy Prophet who
said, "Hussain is from me, and I am from Hussain!" This valuable
tradition was a witness about the beginning and continuation of the pure
religion of Islam. It began with the divine message brought by the holy
Prophet, and continued by the terrible martyrdom of Imam Hussain
(p.b.u.h.). By that great sacrifice of the holy Imam, his household, and
his prominent companions, he guaranteed the future survival of Islam.

The holy Imam Hussain had in minded the considerations, problems, and
difficulties of the Islamic nation. He was also looking for the
establishment of a just and successful Islamic state. He expressed his
intention at the time of movement to Kufa:

My movement is not a revolt, nor for seizing just the power. It is
rather an evolutionary conduct in the nation of my grandfather, Muhammad
(p.b.u.h.).

The progressive experience of "Ashura" reveals the honest crusade and
clarity of his view. It had a tremendous and successive reaction in the
long history of the Islamic world. On the opposite side, the enemies of
the Ahlul Bayt (the infallible household of the holy Prophet) have
always tried to change the true meaning of the message of Karbala, and
take it away from the minds of the Muslims. "But the Almighty God will
survive His light, even though the disbelievers do not like it."

From the time of occurrence of the event of "Karbala" till now, many
books have been written about it by different persons, of different
views or schools of thoughts, and in different languages. They are
generally named as "Maq'tal". There are just some names remained from
those books of Maqtal. The oppressors and cruel governments robbed,
burnt, or destroyed those books, in order to cause the communities to
forget his name (and teachings). Although they could not achieve their
target.

Altogether, there are very few ancient Maq'tal available, with their
original texts. Only traces or some parts of them have been narrated and
transmitted through the historical texts and literatures.

It seems that the first writer, who compiled a text about the events of
Karbala and Ashura, was Asbaq Ibn Nobata. He was one of the close
friends, and sincere companions of Amirul Momenin Ali (p.b.u.h.). His
death has been in the early years of the second century after hejrat.

The second writer was Abu Mekh'naf Lut Ibn Yahya Azdi, who was
contemporary to Imam Sadiq (p.b.u.h.), and wrote the book, "Maq'tal
al-Hussain (p.b.u.h.)".

During the 2nd and 3rd centuries of hejrat, some other traditions and
historians wrote and compiled books about the tragic event of Karabala,
and martyrdom of Imam Hussain and his beloved disciples. Some of those
writers are:

" Abdul Aziz Ibn Yahya Jalloudi.
" Jaber Ibn Yazid Jo'afi.
" Muhammad Ibn Umar Waqedi.
" Muammar Ibn Mosanna Taimi.
" Nasr Ibn Mozahem Menqari.
" Abdullah Ibn Ahmad Bin Abi Donya.
" Ibn Wazeh Yaqoubi.
" Muhammad bin Zakaria bin Dinar Ghalaei.

In the next stage, some of the Shia and Sunni scholars wrote books
about the martyrdom of Imam Hussain (p.b.u.h.). They are:

" Shaikh Muhammad bin Hasan Tousi (died in 460 A.H.)

" Mowaffaq Ibn Ahmad Kharazmi (died in 568 A.H.)

" Ibn Shahr Ashoub (died in 588 A.H.) " Mah'moud bin Mobarak (died in
592 A.H.) " Jafar bin Najib bin Nama Helli (died in 645 A.H.)

" Ezzuddin Abdul Razzaq Jazari (died in 661 A.H.), and " Ali bin Mousa
bin Jafar, Ibn Tavoos, (died in 664 A.H.) who is the author of this
book.

Seyed Ibn Tavoos has reminded of this book, in his two other books. In
his books Iqbal and Kashful Mahajja has said, "My book "al-Malhoof ala
Qat'lalTofouf" is about the martyrdom of Imam Hussain (p.b.u.h.), which
is organized in a wonderful order, which has been a kindness of God, Who
guided me to write it."

The late Allamah Majlesi, in Beharul Anwar (vol 107, P. 42) has stated
that Seyed Ibn Tavoos has mentioned in his book, "al-Ejazat", "I have
written the book "al-Malhoof ala Qatlal Tofouf" in an order which is
new. Anyone who reads it will know about its preferences over similar
books".

From the writings of the writer, Seyed, it becomes clear that the
original title of the book has been "Malhoofâ€¦" but in the old
manuscripts it is called as "Lohoof".

Lohoof, in its Arabic language, has been published more than 20 times
in Iraq, Iran, and Lebanon. Some of the clergy translators have
translated it in to Persian, such as Mirza Reza Qoli Khan, Ahmad Najafi,
M.E. Nawab, and Seyed Ahmad Fehri.

Recently, Naba cultural organization has translated Lohoof in to
English, and decided it to be published as one of the works of the
library and publishing house of the holy Shrine of Imam Hussain
(p.b.u.h.). It is the third published work of that library. I pray God
to bless all those who work and cooperate with Naba cultural
organization, and may He support and protect the translator and all
those who participated in preparation of this book. And, at last, may
the blessings and greetings of God be upon all you kind readers!


**Preface**

A. About the Author

Seyed Razi - Uddin Ali bin Musa, knows as Ibn - e- Tavoos (589-664
A.H., equal to 1150- 1225 A.D.) is one of the greatest Shia scholars in
the 13th A.D. century. He was born in Hella city in South of Iraq. He
learnt different Islamic science from his father S?dussin Musa, his
grand father Varram bin Abi Foras, and some Shia and non- Shia
scholars.

The grand family of Ibn- e- Tavoos was interested at scholarship and
knowledge fields. Some of them have written books, and have their names
in the history. For more information about them, you may refer to
"Encyclopedia of Tashayyo", P. 339, and Vol: 1, title Ibn- e- Tavoos.

During his 75 years old life, Ibn- e - Tavoos traveled to different
cities. He wrote more than 50 books in many fields of Islamic studies,
such as commentary of Quran, history, hadith, prays, astronomy, ethics,
bibliology, biography, Shia thoughts. Half of them are preserved and
available. Even after the long time of about 800 years, most of them are
reliable and unique. In addition to his scientific position, he had the
social leadership of Shia community at his chaotic period. And it is
interesting that with such occupations, he grew very polite, well
educated, and learned children, so that all his sons and daughters were
among the scholars of their age.

B. The book

Seyed Ibne Tavoos had prepared the book "Mesbah -u- Zaer" with the
subject of visiting (Ziyarat) the holy shrines of the prophet Muhammad
(p.b.u.h.), and the infallible Imams (p.b.u.h.). Then he thought and
found it wise to write a small book about the biography of Imam Hussain
(p.b.u.h.), the Ashura calamity, and the tragic events thereafter; so
that those who go on pilgrimage of that innocent martyred Imam may get
the necessary knowledge about the subject, the holy respected Imam, and
his brutal enemies.

Seyed Ibn Tavoos has divined the book of Lohoof in to 3 parts.

1- The events and happenings before the day of Ashura (10th of Moharram
of 61 A.H.);

2- The events occurred in the evening before Ashura, and during the day
of Ashura;

3- The events after the day of Ashura, with regards to Imam Hussain
(p.b.u.h.), his family, and his enemies;

What we can see in these parts, are very exact and accurate narrations
which from one side, show the clear, humanistic, and infallible view
from Imam Hussain, and on the other hand, reveals the tyranny, cruelty,
and crimes of the enemies of the family of the prophet of Islam
(p.b.u.h.).

C. The importance of the Book

There are thousands of books written about Imam Hussain, and the Ashura
calamity. However, those words, which have been narrated and transmitted
by the wise and learned scholars, through a correct and clear way, are
credited and reliable. At the same time, we should know that the life
and history of Imam Hussain (a.s.), just like other infallible Imams
(p.b.u.t.) is like an open book of guidance that should be studied and
considered. It is obvious that when we are going to introduce our noble
Imams (that the holy prophet has called them as the "Lights of
Guidance", and the "Ships of Rescue"), if we refer to uncredited and
unknown references, we will not get a fair result from our efforts.

The importance of the books such as Lohoof lies in its right, just and
authentic references and accurate narrations, which reveal the aspects
of the 14 centuries old history.

Now, let us read the book of Lohoof, which is the book of life, and
guidance, and is like a light that would enlighten the roads of lives of
the people.

This book should be read more than once! And we should keep it not only
in our memory, but also in our mind, and spirit. We should read the
words and teachings of Imam Hussain and his beloved friends at the pages
of this book, and hear them from the stars of the sky of Karbala, that
witnessed the nights of Muharram of the year 61 A.H. We should take in
to the "Ship of Rescue" in order to reach the safe shore. And we should
walk through the light of this "Light of Guidance" in order to depart
from the darkness of the world.

Lohoof is a favorite partner in a spiritual journey for the respected
reader, and we invite you to pay due attention to every word of this
noble book.
