Prospects
=========

Muslims are now fully aware of these problems. Now they are awake.
Perhaps their biggest difficulty is the lack of unified leadership.
Nowadays a tug of war is going on among various groups of the Muslim
intelligentsia here because of their having allegiance to this or that
Middle Eastern country and trying to pull the Muslim ummah in this or
that direction.

However, there is a feeling that before exposing their children to the
above-mentioned unhealthy environment, they must immunize them through
proper religious education and training.

Steps have been taken in some big cities as well as some small places to
establish religious schools. The mosque is a center of Islamic
activities, and now there are hundreds of mosques in U.S.A. and
Canada.
