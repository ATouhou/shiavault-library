The Last Will
=============

In his last hours, the Prophet of Allah (s.a.w.) said to his companions
who gathered in his house:

"Bring me an inkwell and a shoulder-blade so that I will write for you
a letter with which you will never go astray..."

Then owing to the heaviness of his sickness, he fainted. One of those
who were sitting by his bed noticed that and said: "The man speaks
deliriously".

"Shall we bring you an inkwell and a shoulder-blade?," they asked him
shortly after he came around. The Prophet (s.a.w.) turned down their
offer saying: "After what you have said? But I would like you to behave
kindly to my family..."

When he felt he would presently depart he confided to Imam Ali (a.s.)
all his personal affairs and those related to the ummah, as his last
will. Then he calmly and serenely closed his eyes and died, with his
head was in the lap of Imam Ali (a.s.).(l08)

Imam Ali (a.s.) and his family made all the arrangement for his ritual
bathing. Then they prayed on him.

Imam Ali (a.s.) ordered the Muslims to go in and pray on their great
Messenger (s.a.w.) and pay tribute over him.

Prayers having been offered, the Commander of the Faithful Ali (a.s.)
and the family of the Prophet (s.a.w.), in the presence of a number of
his companions, laid the Prophet (s.a.w.) to rest in the very room he
had passed away.

Thus, humankind lost the greatest among the guides, and the most
glorious mentor ever to walk on the earth.

May Allah send His blessings to him on the day be was born, on the day
he became the means of guiding people and on the day he departed
yearning to meet his Lord.

And all praise is due to Allah.
