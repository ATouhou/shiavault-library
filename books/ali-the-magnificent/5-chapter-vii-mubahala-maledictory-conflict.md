Chapter Vii: Mubahala (maledictory Conflict)
============================================

Towards the close of the nineth year of Hegira, embassies from all
parts of Arabia came uninterruptedly to the Holy Prophet at Medina, to
profess Islam and to declare the adherence of their tribes to Prophet
Muhammad. (Mention is made in the Holy Quran about this in Sura CX ANN
ASR) (The Help).

Uptill now, the Christians of Najraan (a city in the province of Yemen)
had kept themselves aloof. The Holy Prophet sent a letter, inviting them
to embrace Islam. In response to that letter the Christians counselled
among themselves as to what their course of action should be and
ultimately sent a representative deputation of fourteen members to
Medina to study the facts pertaining to the Prophet of Islam and his
Mission. The deputation was headed by three scholars of repute. These
were Abdul Maseeh Aaquib, Sayeed and Abdul Haris.

When these deputies reached Medina, they changed their clothes which
they had worn on the journey, dressed themselves in silken garments, put
rings of gold on their fingers and went to the mosque to greet the
Prophet. All of them greeted the Prophet traditionally, but the Apostle
of God did not respond and turned his face away from them. They left the
mosque and approched Osman and Abdul Rahman Ibn Auf, complaining "your
Apostle wrote to us and invited us, but when we went to see him and
wished him, he neifter reciprocated our wishes nor replied to us. Now
what do you advise us to do? Should we go back or wait for another
opportunity?" Osman and Abdul Rehman could not comprehend the situation.
At last they took r deputationists to Ali, who advised them to

remove the clothes of silk and the rings of gold that they were wearing
and to put on their priestly robes. The Holy Prophet would then
willingly see them. Thereupon the Christian delegates changed into
humble garments and presented themselves to the Apostle who then
responded to their salutations and said, "By the Lord who has appointed
me His Messenger, when they first came to me they were accompanied by
Satan".

Thereafter the Apostle preached to them and requested them to accept
Islam. They asked, "What is your opinion about Jesus Christ?" The
Apostle said, "You may rest today in this city and after being refreshed
you will receive the replies to all your questions from me." The Apostle
was awaiting a revelation in this matter, and the next day the verses of
the Holy Quran Sura 3 (A I-E-Imraan) verses 58-59-60 were revealed to
him to show the true nature of Jesus Christ.

Verses 58 and 59 read as follows :
"Surely the likeness of Jesus is with Allah as the likeness of Adam;
He created him from dust, then said to him 'Be', and he was.
This is the truth from your Lord, so be not one of the disputers."

When they reappeared before the Holy Prophet, he informed them of the
above verses, explaining that Jesus Christ was a Prophet like Adam, he
was created from dust and therefore could not be the son of God. After
this, the Holy Prophet invited them to embrace Islam. The Christians
would not agree and refused to be convinced. Thereupon the following
verse No. 60 from Sura 3 was revealed :-

"If anyone disputes in this matter with thee, now after (full)
knowledge hath come to thee say: Come! Let us gather together, our sons
and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves; Then
let us earnestly pray and invoke the curse of God on those who lie!"

The unexampled sinlessness and purity of Ali and his family was clearly
proved by their selection for the contest out of the entire community of
the Muslims.

When the Holy Prophet had informed the deputation of what had been
revealed to him by God, he again urged them to accept Islam. As they did
not believe his words, he challenged them to a 'Mubahala'. 'Mubahala'
means a 'maledictory conflict', and is derived from its Arabic root
'bahlah' meaning 'Curse'. So literally 'Mubahala' means cursing one
another. After private consultations, the Christians agreed to the
challenge.

At the appointed time and place, when the Christians saw that not only
Muhammad, but his daughter Fatima, his son-in-law Ali, and his grandsons
Hasan and Husain, (styled as the Holy Panjetan) also came out for this
maledictory conflict, they were dismayed and overwhelmed. "Verily I see
a divine light on the face of our combatants," said the leader of the
deputation to his fellow-priests. "Truth shines in their eyes, I am sure
that should they pray for anything, God would hearken to their
solicitations, and even move mountains if they ask for it. I sincerely
advise you to refrain from this 'Mubahala'. To invoke the curse of God
with people like these is to invite sure death."

Having thus changed their minds, they went to the Holy Prophet and
informed him of their inability to proceed

with the contest. The Holy Prophet again extended to them the
invitation to accept Islam. The Christians replied, "We have not the
conviction of your faith, nor the strength to fight against you. Let us
make a compromise and come to terms." At last a treaty was signed by
which the Christians of Najraan agreed to pay annual tribute to the
Muslims, in the shape of two thousand garments of the value of forty
Dirhems each, thirty camels and thirty horses, thirty coats of arms, and
thirty lances, every year.

Authentic Proofs. are quoted below regarding the Ayat of the Holy
Quran-Sura 3-verse 60 as given on page 73 Imam Fakhruddin Razi writes in
his 'Tafseer-e-Kabeer' (Volume 2) : "When this verse was revealed to the
Holy Prophet, the Christians of Najraan accepted the challenge of
'Mubahala' and the Holy Prophet took along with him Imam Hasan, Imam
Husain, Janab-e-Fatima and Hazrat Ali to the field of 'Mubahala' ".
Alama Zamakhshari writes in his 'Tafseer-e-Kashshaf : "There can be no
more authentic and stronger evidence for the holiness of Ashah-eKisa,
i.e., Hazrat Ali, Janab-e-Fatima, Imam Hasan and Imam Husain, than this
Quranic verse. For in compliance with the order of God, the Holy Prophet
summoned his Ahl-ul-Bait, took Imam Husain in his arms, grasped Iman
Hasan's hand in his own, asked Janab-e-Fatima to follow him, and Hazrat
Ali to follow her. This proved that the Holy Ahl-ul-Bait were those to
whom the Quranic verse was directed."

Saad Ibne Waqqas relates : "When this verse was revealed, the Holy
Prophet sent for Hazrat Ali, Janab-eFatima, Imam Hasan and Imam Husain,
and prayed to God thus: "O my God! These are the very Ahl-ul-Bait of
mine." (Sahih Muslim, volume 1, Sahih Tirmizi)

It. is maintained by the generality of Muslims that only these members
of the Prophet's house comprised of his permanent or unchangeable
family, whom the Prophet loved dearly and who were distinguished from
the rest of the Muslim world, on account of their having been declared
purified by God as sinless and faultless in the revelation contained in
Sura XXXIII-33, "It has always been the Will of Allah to keep off from
you all stigma (of sin, ignorance and disbelief), 0 people of the house,
and to purify you with the most perfect purification." This verse is
meant as a guarantee and a reassurance regarding the purity of the
Ahl-ul-Bait, so that all Muslims should recognise their excellence.


**CHAPTER VIII: MISSIONARY ACTIVITIES IN YEMEN
**

In 632 A.D. the Holy Prophet deputed Ali to undertake the task of
propagating Islam in Yemen. For six months Khalid bin Walid laboured in
vain to bring the Yemenites to accept Islam. These people were proud of
their heritage and culture, and took the greatest pride in their
traditions and institutions. The Jewish and Christian colonies around
Yemen were notable for their scholars who were well read in the
scriptures and were an authority in matters of religion.

Before Ali left, the Holy Prophet personally inspected the three
hundred Mujahirs and Ansar volunteers, who had gathered at Qoba, near
Medina, to accompany Ali, and presented "The Lion of God" with a black
Standard. He then tied a turban on Ali's head with his own hands saying
to him, "Now proceed to Yemen and preach among its inhabitants the
divine laws of Islam. - You have to

enlighten the people in the Commandments of God as revealed in the Holy
Quran, to teach them the methods of prayers and extend to them the
invitation to accept Islam." As Ali made ready to leave, the Holy
Prophet said, "I swear by God that one conversion at your hands is far
nobler and better for Islam than all the wonders of nature on which the
Sun rises and sets."

Ali proceeded to Yemen, and there read the Prophet's letter to the
people and delivered his sermon according to the dictates of the
Prophet, preaching the doctrines of Islam to the multitudes, with the
result that the entire tribe of Hamadanis embraced Islam in a single
day. (Ibn Athir, Kamil V. II).

Ali proved as good a preacher as he was a swordsman, and his Mission to
Yemen saw his emergence as a religious scholar of the first order. The
Christian priests and the Jewish Rabbis who had settled in Yemen held
daily discourses with him on religious doctrines and dogmas, and Ali's
illuminating sermons on the Unity of God and the Islamic exposition of
the values of life made a great impression on those who heard him. After
one of his sermons, the Christian priest Ka'b accepted Islam. Ka'b was a
distinguished scholar and critic, renowned for his piety and learning.
His example was soon followed by many others and soon many Rabbis
followed suit. Other neighbouring tribes also embraced Islam, and it
clearly proved that "The exposition of Islam and the tongue of Ali were
co-related like hand and glove, or like a soul in a body."

**CHAPTER IX: THE FINAL PILGRIMAGE OF THE HOLY PROPHET


AND THE LAST DECLARATION AT GHADIR-E-KHUM

**
It was in the month of Zilhajj 10 A.H. when the Holy Prophet becoming
intuitively aware of his approaching end, decided to make a farewell
Pilgrimage to Mecca. As the time for the Pilgrimage approached, he
started to make preparations for the journey. Hazrat Ali who was in
Yemen was asked to complete his work and join the Prophet in Mecca.

The Prophet reached Mecca on Sunday the 4th of Zilhaji 10 A.H. Soon
after his arrival, Ali, who hastened back from Yemen ahead of his men,
joined the Prophet, who was very glad to see him and affectionately
embracing him asked what vow he had taken for the pilgrimage. Ali
replied, "I have taken upon me a vow to perform the same pilgrimage as
the Prophet, whatever that might be, and I have brought thirty-four
camels for the sacrifice". The Prophet joyfully exclaimed,
'Allah-o-Akbar', (Great is the Lord), and said he had brought sixty-six.
He added, that in all the rites of the Pilgrimage, as well as in the
sacrifice, he (Ali) would be his partner. Thus Ali also performed the
Greater Pilgrimage along with the Prophet.

Before completing the rites of the Pilgrimage, the Holy Prophet
addressed the assembled multitude from the top of the Jabal-ul-Arafat in
words which yet live in the hearts of Muslims. As the various ceremonies
were to be treated as models for future guidance, the Prophet observed
rigorously each rite, whether in compliance with revelations or in
accordalce with the patriarchal usage. Thus,

when the hundred camels were to be sacrificed, they were offered by him
and Ali conjointly. A repast, prepared from the meat of the sacrificed
camels was served, the Prophet sat down with no other but Ali to partake
of it. The ceremonies of the pilgrimage ended with shaving of the heads
and paring of the nails after the sacrifice of animals. The pilgrim's
garb was then removed and Ali, who rode on the Prophet's Duldul,
proclaimed that the restrictions of Pilgrimage were over.


The Sermon at Ghadir-E-Khum and the Last Declaration
Bidding farewell to his native city of Mecca, the Prophet set out for
Medina on the 14th Zilhajj, 10 A.H., accompanied by the same
congregation of Muslims.

Now as his swift camel sped on with its long swinging strides, a life
of tireless toil was nearing its end, a mission of mercy and devotion
was approaching its culmination and the seeds of Divine dispensation
were about to begin to bear fruit. His mien and bearing showed the signs
of sublime peace, coupled with an overwhelming sense of gratitude and an
insatiable yearning for his Creator and Cherisher.

Yet on close scrutiny, his serene features could not have failed to
disclose the signs of deep contemplation as if he was weighing the pros
and cons of some momentous decision.

What could be the cause of this restlessness? Had he not accomplished
all that he had set his mind to do? The Unity and Justice of God had
been convincingly instilled into the hearts of men; the belief in the
angels, the

Scriptures, the Prophets, the resurrection of the dead, and the Day of
Judgment had all been authoritatively expounded.

But with the meticulous thoroughness of his genius, Prophet Muhammad
realised that the most important part of his task still remained
unfulfilled, and it was this which made him restless at the moment of
his greatest triumph. He saw that the sands of time were running out and
the cup of his life was filled almost to the brim. This being so, the
most important task was to ensure the continuity of his life's work by
someone endowed with all the moral values which he had upheld, or else
all his miraculous achievements during the twenty-three years of his
apostolic ministry stood in danger of being irretrievably undone. It was
a matter of prime importance that Divine guidance should continue after
him and that the Divine sovereignty should be exercised by the chosen
ones of God, to be appointed by the Prophet.

He had already designated his Ahl-ul-Bait on several occasions, as the
Ark of Noah, the strong rope of God, the door of forgiveness, the
purified ones, and made the love of these holy ones incumbent upon his
followers. He had similarly, on many occasions, pointed out Ali as "My
brother and Successor", "The door of the city of knowledge", "The most
equitable judge", "The embodiment of faith", and having the position in
relation to himself as "Aaron was to Moses".

Were these pronouncements in the course of time going to be forgotten,
misinterpreted or ignored by his followers after him? Could the Prophet
allow them to be set aside by power-seekers? He knew that he had to make
a final and unchallengeable declaration regarding his successor. The
choice of the appropriate moment,

however, depended not on him but on Divine Inspiration. With these
thoughts in his mind he marched on towards Medina.

As he arrived at Ghadir-e-Khum, suddenly the signs of a revelation
appeared. The voice of Archangel Gabriel was heard saying :

"O thou esteemed Messenger, impart the guidance that has been revealed
unto thee",\* and in order to impress the urgency of the command,
Gabriel went on to say :
"For if thou doeth it not, thou hast not imparted His Message at
all";

and again in the same breath to allay his fears and misgivings the
angel added :

"God will protect thee from the evil designs of men". (Ch. 5 verse
67)

It is held that the Prophet had already been commanded to proclaim Ali
as his successor, but he had postponed the announcement for some
suitable occasion to avoid misinterpretation. 1

\* It refers to the Commandment contained in Sura xclv of theo Quran,
which says

1. Have We not opened thy breast for thee?
2. And put off thy burden from thee,
3. Which galled thy back?
4. And have We not raised thy name for thee?
5. Then verily, with trouble cometh ease,
6. Verily, along with trouble cometh ease;
7. And when thou art eased, set up (thy successor),
8. And turn to thy Lord with fervour.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 Tafsir Kabir ; Tafsir Durr-al-Manthur ; Tafsir Neshapuri;
Sirat-al-Halabia.
In the 7th verse, God has commanded the Prophet to appoint his
successor.

On hearing this imperious command, the Prophet made up his mind
instantly. He motioned the muezzin Bilal to stop and recite the Azan
with the words, "Hayya' ala Khair il'amal" (hasten cowards the best of
deeds). for. surely the acceptance thereof was to he a crucial event
upon which the perpetuity of the Prophet's Mission depended.

As the Prophet pulled up his reins, the whole entourage came to a halt.
Those who had gone ahead were summoned back and those who followed
gathered round casting inquiring glances at each other. The Prophet soon
dismounted and ordered his followers to clear the ground. The pebbles
and thorns that lay scattered about were promptly brushed aside. Others,
on receiving his express directions, began to untie the saddles from the
backs of their camels, and to pile them one on top of another. so as to
make a pulpit. The arrangements thus completed, the throng squatted upon
the bare ground, some spreading their cloaks below to protect themselves
from the burning sand, others holding up their handkerchieves to shield
their eyes from the sun's glare, for it was nearly midday.

The people having clustered round the pulpit, the Prophet stepped
forward and on his right was Ali, whose turban, black in colour, with
its ends hanging over both of his shoulders, was arranged by the Prophet
himself. Then obeying the Divine Injunction to the letter, he addressed
the multitude in the following memorable words. 1
"All praise belongs to God. In Him do I put my faith and from Him do I
crave support. Him do I trust and His

protection seek against the malice of our souls and evils of our deeds.
The misguided have no guide save Him, and those who are guided by Him
can never go astray. I bear witness that there is no one worthy of
worship save Him and that I, Muhammad, am His slave and Messenger."

"O ye folk, behold, the All-knowing God hath informed me that the days
of my life are coming to an end and the time is fast approaching when I
shall be called away from your midst towards the eternal abode. But you
and I, each one of us is answerable unto God for all things are due unto
Him from us. What then do you say?"

And the listeners answered, "we bear witness that thou hast done thy
duty and never stinted to guide and advise its according to the Divine
Will."

"Then do ye bear witness", asked the Prophet, "to the Unity of God and
the Apostleship of this servant of God, who now speaks to you by His
command, and do ye not hear witness that the resurrection and judgment,
heaven and hell and the life hereafter are certainties?"

And they all answered, "Yea, verily Yea."

"Now then", continued the Prophet, "Listen to me carefully; I have been
commanded to tell you that I will soon be taken away from your midst,
but I leave unto you my Legacy of two grand precepts, each of which
surpasses the other in its grandeur-God's Holy Book (The Quran) and my
Ahl-uI-Bait (my irrevocable Progeny, consisting of Ali, Fatima, Hasan
and Husain). Never shall they separate from one another until they reach
me in Heaven at the Fountain of Kausar, and so long as you will adhere
unto both my legacies, you will never be led astray after me. Therefore,
0 ye folk, it is my last Will and Testament unto

you that you should always remain faithful to the Holy Quran and my
Ahl-ul-Bait as true Muslims until death."

By these portentous words all those who loved their teacher and
benefactor were moved to tears.

And he continued, "Do not lag too far behind them and do not walk ahead
of them, for in either event you will go astray. But follow them and
walk in their footsteps and they will guide you along the Straight
Path."
Then he asked, "Who do you think is more worthy of obedience than your
souls?"

And they answered, "God and His messenger know best."

And he continued, "Lo! God is my Master, and am I not worthy of
obedience from you?"

And they all said, "Yea, verily Yea."

Then the Prophet bent down and lifted up Ali in his hands, showing him
to the crowds on all sides of the pulpit, and proclaimed,


من كنت مولاه فهذا علي مولاه
"Man Kunto Maulaho fa haatha Ali-yun Maulah"

"Of whomsoever I am the Master (Mania), this Ali is his Master
(Maula)". So saying the Prophet raised up his hands heavenwards and
prayed, "O our God, love those who will love Ali, despise those who will
despise him; support those who will support him; and reject those who
will reject him. 1"
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 Suyuti has reported thus : "O God ! Befriend him who is a friend of
Ali, and be an enemy to him who is an enemy to Mi."

Announcing this thrice, he got down from the raised platform, and
seated Ali in a tent, where the people did him homage. Omar bin
Al-Khatab was the first to congratulate Ali and to acknowledge him
'Guardian of all Believers' 1

Saying:

"Bakhin bakhin laka ibne Abi Talib Asbahta Maulayee
Wa Maula kulla Momineen wa Mominaatin."
"Greetings be to thee 0 son of Abu Talib!
Thou hast dawned as my Leader and the Leader of all faithful men and
women."

After the men, came all the women to congratulate Ali. At the
conclusion of this installation ceremony, the Holy Prophet asked the
congregation, 'Have I not truly and faithfully delivered unto you the
Message?"

And they answered, "Yea, verily Yea."

Then the Prophet said, "Go now, and let those who have been present
here today repeat and convey to those who are absent all that they have
seen and heard."

At this moment the Divine Inspiration again descended upon our Holy
Prophet with the memorable words that read, "This day have I perfected
unto you your religion and completed upon you My Blessings, and I am
well-pleased with Islam as your religion." (Ch. 5, Verse 3).

The tone and purpose of these two religious revelations, firstly, the
verse commanding the Prophet to deliver the Message with the warning
that any omission on his part would be a complete failure of his
mission, and secondly, this last revelation, declaring the Lord's
pleasure at the
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

fulfilment of the task, clearly indicate that they relate to some
matter of prime importance and not merely to some abstruse detail of
ritual. It is only in the light of the Hadith-e-Ghadir that these two
passages of the Holy Quran can be properly understood in their true
importance and full significance. By consensus of the exegesis these two
verses were revealed after the Prophet's last pilgrimage.


Authentic Proofs
In Mishkat, a tradition of Bara'a Bin Azib and Zaid is quoted here for
further clarification from the Musnad of Ahmed Ibn Hanbal : The
Companions state, "We were accompanying the Apostle on his journey. When
we reached the oasis of Ghadeer-e-Khum, the announcer called 'Assalato
Jamia', (come to congregational prayer). The earth under the trees was
swept for the Apostle. Then after the Zohar prayer was over, the Apostle
held the hand of Ali Ibn Abi Talib and said, "O people! Do you know that
according to every believer I am superior to his soul?" All of them
replied, 'It is a fact, 0 Messenger of Allah! To every believer you are
superior to his soul'. Then the Apostle said, 'Ali is also the Lord of
him whose Lord I am. 0 Allah! Befriend him who befriends Ali and be
alien to him who is alien to Ali.' Thereafter Omar met Ali and, said,
"Hail to thee! 0 son of Abu Talib, today you become the Lord of all
believing men and women."

Wahidee in Asbab-un-Nuzool; Suyuti in Tafseer-eDurr-i-Mansoor; Shaukani
in Tafseer Fathul Qadir and Sideeq Hasan Khan in Fathul Bayan mention a
tradition noted by Ibn Abi Hatim and other scholars from Abu Saeed
Khudri in which it is stated that the verse "O Messenger! Make known
what has been revealed unto you by


your Lord and if you do not do so you have not made known your
message." The Quran Ch. 5, verse 67-was re aled on the occasion of the
event at Ghadir-e-Khum in h n our of Ali. Moreover in another tradition
which has been quoted by Aini in his annotation of Saheeh Bukharee, this
verse is paraphrased as "O Messenger ! Proclaim the order which your
Lord has passed and revealed unto you in honour of Ali lbn Abu Talib."
So when this verse was revealed the Apostle held Ali by his hand and
said, "Ali is also Lord of him who has taken me as his Lord."

Many similar quotations are given by historians and the names of a few
are mentioned below:-

Abul Fida, Ibn Khallakan in Wafiyat-ul-A' yaan; Hakim in his Mustadrak;
Nasaee in Kitabul Khasais; lbn Hajar Makki in Sawaiq-i-Muhriqa;
Rawdzat-ul-Ahbab; Naishapuri in Tafseer Gharaibul Quran, Hafiz Ibn
Mardwaih and Hafiz Abu Naeem from Abu Saeed Khudri.

Muhammad Ibn Saalim Hanafi remarks in his marginal note on Sirajul
Muneer-i-Azeezee, an annotation of Jam'i Sagheer of Suyuti, that when
the Apostle delivered his speech "Ali is also the Lord of him who has me
for his Lord, and some of the people inquired of the Holy Prophet, "Was
it not sufficient for us to profess the 'Creed of evidence, say our
prayers and give alms with strict regularity, that the superiority and
Lordship of Abu Talib's son is now being imposed upon us? Do you
commission us in this matter of your own accord, or is it ordered by
Allah?" The Apostle replied, "By Him other than whom there is no one to
be worshipped, this is the order of Allah".

Tafseer-o-Sa'labi, Noor-ul-Absar, Seerat-ul-Halabiyah and Mustadrak
relate that when on that day a man named

Haris, son of No'man Filth refused to acknowledge Ali as his leader and
disputed with the Holy Prophet on this matter and said, "O Allah! If
this be truly Thy Command then either rain down stones from heaven upon
Muhammad or punish us." A large stone fell upon him from heaven so that
he was killed, just as the army of Abraha and their elephants had been
killed before.

The following verse was revealed on that occasion:
"A questioner asked for the inevitable punishment to befall the
disbelievers which no one can avert". (Chapter 70 Verse 1-2.)

The great research scholar, Allama Sayed Hamid Hussain Kintoori, has
written a book in two volumes called Abaqatul-Anwar on the investigation
of the innumerable sources through which the Hadith-e-Ghadir has come
down to us. In recent years the eminent Alim, Ayat-Ullah Shaikh Abdal
Husain-al-Ameeni of Najaf has listed the names of one hundred and ten
companions of the Holy Prophet who have reported this tradition as
eye-witnesses and eighty-three Tabe'in who heard it from their elders
and three hundred and fifty-nine Ulema of all sects, arranged
chronologically through each of the centuries since the time of the
Prophet up to the present -day, who have recorded the sermon of
Ghadir-e-Khum in their books and acknowledged its authenticity.
Ayatullah-al-Aminis major opus 'Al-Ghadir', is a classic of erudition
and painstaking research. The book establishes beyond doubt, whatever
the criterion of verification adopted, the overwhelming
incontrovertibility of the event of Ghadir i.e. the nomination of AIL It
also firmly prescribes the injunction that if ever any tradition is to
be believed, the Hadith-eGhadir holds the first claim to acceptance.

It will be readily vouched by every scholar of the Arabic language that
the word 'Maula' in its meaning is far superior to the word Caliph. A
Caliph is only a successor to one in any office, but a 'Maula' means the
Lord and Master of everything. In using the word 'Maula' for Ali, the
Apostle of God intended to convey the Divine Will that after him Ali
should be held in the same position as he himself was for the people.

The Holy Quran says:
"And neither doth he speak of (his own) inclination; It (the wording)
is naught but a revelation revealed (unto him)." (Chapter 53, Verse 3
and 4).

Ali was undoubtedly the chosen and declared successor of the Holy
Prophet from the beginning of his Prophetic Career. Now he had the
distinction of being to the Muslims what the Holy Prophet was to them;
which meant that Ali was to be treated in place of (Successor to) the
Prophet after his death. 1
Shah Ali Hasan Jaisi, a great celebrated Sunni Sufi, has made the
meaning of the word 'MAULA' as implied in the declaration, very clear in
his couplet in Persian:

<p dir="rtl">
عبث در معني مو كنت مولي ميروي هر سو
علي مولي به آن معني كه پيغمبر بود مولي
</p>

"Abus dar maanee-ay mun kunto Maula mee ravee hersoo, Ali Maula ba-on
manee keh Paigamber boo-ood Maula".
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 Tabari; Ibne Athir; Abul Fida, Amir Ali

Translation:

"In vain doth thou wander in all directions in interpreting the word
Maula (Master),
Ali is in the same sense Maula (Master) as was the Holy Prophet Maula
(Master)."

Philosophers, commentators of the Quran, poets, historians and seekers
of truth all unanimously acknowledge this vital tradition as an
established fact. The valley of Ghadir-e-Khum owes its fame to this
single, unique and unforgettable event, on it the survival of the
guidance of Islam depends, and so long as there remains a single grain
of sand from that parched and arid wilderness, it will rise and proudly
describe how the Prophet of Mercy once trod upon that ground, how he
lifted up the worthiest of his disciples and proclaimed him as the
Amir-ul-Mominin, for there was no one worthier than him and his
descendants the eleven Imams, to defend, expound and propagate Islam's
immortal teachings to the world.

The Holy Prophet has said :
"I am the last of the Apostles of Allah (Khatam-unNabeeyeen) O Ali,
whilst you are the last of the successors to the Prophets."
(Khatam-ul-Waseeyeen).
