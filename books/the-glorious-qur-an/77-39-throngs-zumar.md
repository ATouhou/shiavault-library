39: Throngs (zumar)
===================

This rapidly moving chapter was revealed after Sheba 34 and before the
next one called The Believer or The Forgiving [God] 40. It consists of
eight sections of 75 Meccan verses except for VV. 52-54 (V-VI) which may
date from Madina.

The chapter begins with an admonition against the sin off associating
anything or anyone in our pure worship of God (I), and then it shows how
such intercession is void (V). A majestic picture paints God's role in
the world (VI). Watch for its dramatic ending which describes Heaven and
Hell as the "Throngs" march there in two separate companies, the saved
and the damned (VIII).
