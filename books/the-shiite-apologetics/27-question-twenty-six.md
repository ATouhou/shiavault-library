Question Twenty-six
===================

### Isn't commemorating the birthday of the saints an innovation in religion and polytheism ?

Answer:
-------

The necessity of commemorating people who are worthy in the eyes of
God - such as celebrating their birthday - is clear to men of vision.
However, the following arguments can help removing doubt in this regard.

1. Celebration: a Sign of Love
------------------------------

The holy Quran invites Muslims to love the Prophet and his Ahl al-Bayt,
saying, "I do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near
relatives. (42:23). Commemorating the saints is, no doubt, a
manifestation of people's love to them sanctioned by the Quran.

2. Celebration: Paying Homage to the Prophet
--------------------------------------------

The Quran introduces two criteria to attain salvation and happiness:
helping the Prophet and revering his position: (as for) those who
believe him and honor him and help him, and follow the light which has
been sent down with him, these it is who are the successful. (7:157).
This verse clearly shows that Islam considers it good to commemorate the
Messenger of God, and that God is pleased with ceremonies that keep the
Prophet's memory alive and honor

him. According to the verses cited successful people have the following
characteristics:

a. belief: those who believe in him

b. follow the light: and follow the light which has been sent down with
him

c. help the Prophet: *and help him*

d. revere the Prophet's rank: *and honor him*

3. Holding Ceremonies Is Obeying God
------------------------------------

God praises the Prophet in the Quran and says: and *We exalted Thy
name*. It is thus understood that God desires to have the Prophet's
celebrity spread universally, and He Himself has glorified the Prophet
in different parts of the Quran. To show that we also follow the Lord of
the worlds and our divine book, we do institute dignified ceremonies to
honor the Prophet as the apex of perfection and moral excellence. What
the Muslims intend to achieve through such ceremonies is nothing but
exalting the holy Prophet.

4. Divine Revelation Is Not Inferior to the Heavenly Food
---------------------------------------------------------

Said Jesus son of Mary, *God, our Lord, send down to us food from heaven
so that it may be a recurring feast for us, both for the first of us and
the last of us, and a sign from Thee. And provide us; Thou art the best
of providers.* (5:114).

Prophet Jesus had asked God for heavenly food so that they might
celebrate the day; the food is, nevertheless, material and an enjoyment
for the body. Now, can the ceremonies the Muslims hold on the day the
Qur'an was revealed or on the birthday of the Prophet be considered as a
sign of polytheism, or an innovation in religion ?

5. Muslim's Life Style
----------------------

Muslims have for long been holding celebrations in the memory of the
Prophet of Islam. *Tarikh al-Khamis*, a history book written by Husayn
ibn. Muhammad Diyarbakri, mentions that Muslims all over the world
celebrate the month in which the Prophet was born. During the days they
arrange banquets and at nights they pay the poor their dues, express
their joy, do good deeds of different kinds, and read poems written on
the occasion. They are showered in manifest blessing because of the
Prophet's birthday. [1]

The above statements convey the general verdict derived from the Quran
and the Muslims way of life concerning the permissibility of holding
celebrations in memory of the saints. Thus, what comes to light is the
baselessness of the claim of those who consider it an innovation in
religion to hold celebrations for God's saints. Innovation in religion
virtually means a behavior unsupported by the Quran and the Sunnah,
whereas the general verdict for the question raised at the beginning can
be derived from the Quran and the permanent life style of the Muslims.
The celebrations under discussion are held specifically in honor and
praise of those who are meritorious servants of God and are believed to
be in need of the Lord of the world. This is in conformity with the
principle of Oneness of God.

The claim of those who consider the commemorating of saints of God a
cause for polytheism and duality is thus proved to be baseless.
