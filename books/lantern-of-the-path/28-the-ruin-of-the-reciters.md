The Ruin of the Reciters
========================

Someone who recites without knowledge is like a vain man who has
neither property nor wealth; for people do not hate someone for his lack
of possessions, but they detest him for his vanity. He is always at odds
with creation in that which is not obligatory upon him, and he who
contests creation in what he is not commanded to do is contesting the
process of creativity and absolute lordship.

As Allah said,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَادِلُ فِي اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَلَا هُدًى
وَلَا كِتَابٍ مُّنِيرٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>



***Among men is he who disputes in respect of Allah though having no
knowledge, nor guidance, nor a book giving light.*** (31:20)


None will have a harsher punishment than someone who claims a right to
the mantle of knowledge without having either the truth or the meaning
of it.

Zayd ibn Thabit said to his son, 'My son, do not let Allah see your
name in the register of the vain reciters.' And the Holy Prophet said,
'A time will come for my community in which hearing the name of the man
who recites will be considered better than studying, and studying will
be considered better than doing the thing with experience ... The
greatest number of hypocrites in my community are among the reciters of
the Qur'an.'

Be where the faith recommends you to be, and where you are commanded to
be. Conceal your inner state from other people as much as you can. Make
your acts of obedience to Allah have the same relationship as your soul
has to your body, so they become an indication of the state you have
attained between yourself and your Originator. Seek Allah's help in all
your affairs, and beseech Allah humbly at the end of the night and at
the end of the day. Allah said,


<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ادْعُواْ رَبَّكُمْ تَضَرُّعًا وَخُفْيَةً إِنَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ
الْمُعْتَدِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>



***Call on your Lord humbly and secretly; surely He does not love those
who exceed the limits.*** (7:55)


Transgressing is one of the attributes, indeed, one of the hallmarks,
of the reciters of our time. Be fearful of Allah in all your affairs, so
that you do not fall into the arena of desire and destroy yourself.
