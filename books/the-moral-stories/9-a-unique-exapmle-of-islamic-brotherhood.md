A Unique Exapmle of Islamic Brotherhood
=======================================

Uhud is a wellknown place a few miles outside Medina. One of the
hardest battles of Islam was fought at this place. It was in defence of
Islam against the enemies - the non-believers who had come from far away
places.

In this battle the Muslim fighters had set noble examples of
self-sacrifice. Many of them were martyred having fought bravely against
the enemies.

Among them seven were fatally wounded and were breathing their last.
All of them were also suffering from the pangs of thirst.

Someone came to them with a cup of water hardly sufficient to quench
the thirst of one man. On offering the water to one of them, the
water-bearer was directed towards another injured fighter lying besides
him.

This second fighter sent him to the third one near him, this third
directed him to the fourth, and so it went on till he reached the
seventh warrior. When the seventh fighter was approached, he told him
that since the first fighter was very thirsty, he should be given the
water first.

The water-bearer then returned to the first injured fighter fend found
him already dead. He then went to the second thence to the third,
finding each already dead.

This happened also with the remaining fighters, all having died by the
time he reached. All of them departed from this world thirsty leaving
behind in history a golden example of Islamic brotherhood and
self-secrifice for others.

Islam has laid much stress on the importance of mutual help,
co-operation and sacrifice among Muslims. The Holy Quran dictates:

"The believers are but brethren, therefore make peace between your
brethren and be careful of (your duty to) Allah that mercy may be had on
you." (49:10) The Holy Prophet had said:

"One who starts his day without care for the affairs of Muslims is not
a Muslim And Hazrat Ali (A.S) had said:

"Helping fellow Muslim brothers increases one's sustenance ".

A non-believer had just embraced Islam at the hands of the Holy
Prophet. He complained of hunger and the Prophet sent someone to bring
food from his house. But unfortunately none was then available. The
Prophet then asked his companions, "Who can host this newly converted
Muslim brother tonight?"

Hazrat Ali (A.S.) came forward and offered to do so. Holding the new
convert's hand, he took him to his house. He asked Hazrat Fatima if any
food was available. She replied: "Only a little provision, enough for
the children".

Hazrat Ali (A.S.) in response said "The guest must come first before
ourselves and the children"

Hazrat Fatima (A.S.) persuaded the children to sleep hungry that night.
And Hazrat Ali (A.S.) reduced the light of the lantern. He then invited
the guest to the meal in the semi-darkened room. He sat with him
pretending as if he was also eating but in fact he did not eat lest the
guest went hungry.

Hazrat Ali - Fatima and their children fed the guest for the pleasure
of Allah while remaining hungry themselves. This self-sacrifice was so
much appreciated by Allah that the following ayat in the Holy Quran was
revealed in their praise:

"And those who made their abode in the city and in the faith before
them love those who have fled to them, and do not find in their hearts a
need of what they are given, and prefer (them) before themselves though
poverty may afflict them, and whoever is preserved from the
niggardliness of his soul, these it is that are the successful ones."
(59:9)


**A Splendid Example of Staunch Faith**

Abu Baseer was one of the faithful companions of Imam Jaffer Sadiq
(A.S.) he relates that once sitting with the Imam, a woman came in to
ask a question :

"I am suffering from a disease. Doctors in Iraq have prescribed alcohol
as the remedy. Do you, Oh Imam, permit me to drink alcohol?" The Imam in
reply asked her:

"According to what you say, doctors have prescribed alcohol as medicine
for your sickness, why then don't you drink?" The woman responded by
saying:

"I am your follower, if you permit me to take alcohol, I shall do so.
If not, I shall not. Because if tomorrow on Day of Judgement I am asked
by Allah, I shall say I did so with the permission of my Imam." Imam
Jaffer Sadiq'(A.S.) on hearing this turned to Abu Baseer and said:

"Do you hear what this woman has to say?"

In other words, do you not wonder and appreciate the staunch faith of
this woman? Despite her illness, she does not follow the doctor's order
to take alcohol but seeks our permission first.

Thereafter the Imam said:

"By the name of Allah, I do not permit you to drink even a drop of that
because it is Haram. And should you drink, you will repent at that
moment when your soul reaches here." So saying, the Imam pointed to his
throat. And three times he asked: "Do you understand what I say?" And
the woman said "Yes".

Despite the fact that alcohol was prescribed as a treatment of her
illness the woman refused to touch it lest she broke the Shariat of
Islam and sought the permission of the Imam - the rightful
representative of Allah on earth.

Alcohol drinking ultimately brings regret at time of death. One used to
drinking suffers extreme agony at time of.death. The soul does not
depart easily from the body. True faith with good action is the primary
requisite of a Muslim. Faith is the seed and good deeds the offshoot.

"One who consumes intoxicants will meet the Lord at death like a
worshipper of idols."
