Most Dangerous Disease
======================

Satisfaction with one’s spiritual performance is one of the most
dangerous diseases of soul. What are the symptoms of this disease? The
patient has a feeling that he has got the monopoly of the spiritual
perfection and no one else is worthy of the mercy of God. According to
his thinking, whatever is done by him is always correct and justified;
and whatever is done by others is always based on wrong motive and,
therefore, wrong.

For example: if he remains aloof from public, it is because he likes to
avoid the chances of sin and mistake. If other are aloof, it is because
they are proud. If he mixes with the people, it is because he loves the
children of God. If others mix with the masses, it is because they want
to ensure their political future. If he berates a man, it is because it
is his divine duty to point out that man’s mistakes to him. If others do
the same, it is because they are prejudiced against that man. If he
commits a mistake, it is because to err is human. If others commit the
same sin, it is because they are ignorant and irreligious. If he sleeps,
it is because the body needs some rest. If others sleep, it is because
they are lazy.

When a soul is caught in this invisible snare of Satan, only the Mercy
of Allah can save it from eternal disgrace.
