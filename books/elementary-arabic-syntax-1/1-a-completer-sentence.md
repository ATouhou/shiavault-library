A Completer Sentence
====================

1. Can a sentence be made up of only one word?  
 One word is insufficient to express one's intended meaning. One must
use two or more words to convey a complete sentence.

2. What is an example of a complete sentence?  
 An example of a complete sentence is: **العِلمُ** **نافعٌ** (knowledge
is beneficial.)

3. What does a sentence consist of?  
 A sentence is made up of single words which are divided into three
categories: verbs, nouns and prepositions.

4. Does every sentence have a verb, noun and preposition?  
 A sentence is not conditional on always having a verb, noun and
preposition. Instead it can be made up of:  
 • Two nouns: **اللهُ عادلٌ** (Allah is just.)

• A verb and a noun: **اِنطَفا** **سِراجٌ** (A lamp died out.)
