Moses said:

“O my Lord, surely I have need of

whatever good you may send

down upon me.”

And by God,

he asked Him only for bread to eat,

because he used to eat **herbs**

of the earth

and the greenness of the herbs

could be seen

under the skin of his belly

due to his leanness!

(Sermon 160)
