Story no. 56: Iqbal’s recommendation about brushing teeth to Fatih
==================================================================

In school, some students sat together.  
 Similarly, Iqbal and Fatih sat together. But Iqbal kept on looking at
Fatih’s defected teeth. They were yellow in colour.  
 Iqbal, who was raised in a religious family and was aware of the
recommendations of Islam, said to Fatih “Why don’t you brush your teeth?
They have turned yellow!  
 Some days ago, I went to the mosque with my father.  
 There, the preacher said “I have heard that the prophet (saw) used to
brush his teeth three times before going to bed”.  
 Is’nt it very good, Fatih, if we too follow in the footsteps of the
great leaders of Islam.
