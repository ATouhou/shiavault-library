Art

The arts are one of the few areas in the 20th century where the cultured
elite were ‘permitted’ to some degree to retain an interest in the
spiritual. The contemporary composer John Cage and video artist Bill
Viola have no difficulty in airing their commitment to Buddhism, while
it seems that the Sufi poet Jelaluddin Rumi has reached the best-seller
lists in the US, and is read by many thinkers and media figures
including the popular singer Madonna. Looking further back we find
strong spiritual interests amongst the American Abstract Expressionists
in the 1950s, and before WW1 many abstract painters were drawn to new
spiritual movements such as Theosophy, Anthroposophy and the teachings
of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky.
