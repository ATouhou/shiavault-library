Ayats and Traditions Praising the World
=======================================

1 - Imam Moosa bin Ja'far (a.s.) said: Every person who strives to
obtain Halaal sustenance or provision is like a fighter in the path of
God.

2 - Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said: Three groups of people will enter the
paradise without accounting: 1: A just ruler, 2: A truthful trader, 3:
An old man who spent his life in the way of Allah.

3 - The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said: Worship is of seventy kinds. The
best of them is earning permissible provision.

4 - Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said: Good is not in one does not like to earn
money through permissible path so that he may save his honour and repay
his debts.

5 - The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said: The one who makes efforts to earn
money to maintain his family is like the one who has fought in the way
of God.

6 - The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said: It is the compulsory duty of
every Muslim man and woman to seek permissible Halaal provision.

And these are samples from tens of narrations calling upon a Muslim to
strive for getting his provision and maintenance.

Conclusion: If one pays the least attention to these narrations one can
conclude that what has been condemned is:

1 - Affection for world: Therefore we read in Traditions: The seed of
every trouble is love for world.

2 - Happiness with worldly wealth: And they rejoice in this worlds
life, and this worlds life is nothing compared to the Hereafter but a
temporary enjoyment.

3 - The world which becomes the cause of indulging in playfulness: so
we read in the Quran: O you who believe! let not your wealth, or your
children, divert you from the remembrance of Allah, and whoever does
that, these are the losers.

4 - giving preference to world over Hereafter: We read in Quran: Say:
If your fathers and your sons and your brethren and your mates and your
kinsfolk and property which you have acquired, and the slackness of
trade which you fear and dwellings which you like, are dearer to you
than Allah and His Apostle and striving in His way, then wait till Allah
brings about his Command; and Allah does not guide the transgressing
people.

5 - Amassing wealth and being stingy in expense: The Holy Quran says:
and as for those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it in
Allah's way, announce to them a painful chastisement on the Day when it
shall be heated in the fire of hell, then their foreheads and their
backs shall be branded with it; this is what you hoarded up for
yourselves, therefore taste what you hoarded.

6 - Selling the Hereafter in exchange of this world: This has been
condemned. The opposite of it has been praised as we read in the Holy
Quran:

These are they who buy the life of this world for the Hereafter, so
their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped.

And in narrations too we read: Do not buy this world in exchange of
your Hereafter.

7 - Extravagance: it is said in the Quran: eat of its fruit when it
bears fruit, and pay the due of it on the day of its reaping, and do not
act extravagantly; surely He does not love the extravagant.

Difference between extravagance and waste: Waste applies to mindless
expending and it is extravagance when the expending is more than the
limit of moderation.

8 - Restraint in spending: Hazrat Ali (a.s.) says: O son of Adam: In
whatever you have earned beyond your needs, you are a trustee treasurer
of other.

9 - Not to rely on the world: Surely those who do not dope in our
meeting and are pleased with this worlds life and are content with it,
and those who are heedless of our communications: As for those, their
abode is the fire because of what they earned.

**Praise for benefiting from the permissible things in the world**

Hazrat Ali (a.s.) once heard a man condemning the world. He said: O the
one who condemns the world who has been tricked by the conspiracies of
the world and has been fooled by its deceptions! Do you get deceived by
the world and again condemn it? Know that the world is the house of
truth, for the one who can understand, it is a centre of needlessness
for the one who saves from it and it is a place of advice and admonition
for the one who has the qualification for getting admonition. It is the
place for prostration for the friends of God and a place of seeking
pardon of God for the angles of God and the place for the coming down of
the Divine Revelation and a trade center for the companions of God who
earned Divine mercy therein and profited by paradise.

**The world which is beneficial for the Hereafter**

The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said: Being needless is good and befitting
for the God fearing.

It has been recorded from Hazrat Ali: The good of this world and the
Hereafter is in two attributes: needlessness and Piety freedom from want
and Fear of God and the evil of the present world and the next life is
in two attributes: poverty neediness and sins. From this discussion we
conclude that there is no contradiction between the ayats and Traditions
of the first and second kind. In other words we come to know that denial
of the world applies when what is mentioned above applies to it.
Otherwise, as the first subject topic this world is both Grace and Mercy
of God for the pious and the Faithful.


**Lesson: 12 : Jealousy and its harmfulness**

One of the undesirable evil attributes is jealousy that can be
discussed in several categories:

1 - Meaning of jealousy and its difference from envy
2 - Kinds of jealousy
3 - Its censure and prohibition and whether the prohibition covers all
kinds of jealousy or it is limited to some of this kinds?
4 - Signs of jealousy.
5 - Marms??? of jealousy from the viewpoint of an individual a society
and the religion.
6 - Causes leading to jealousy.
7 - Remedy of this dangerous disease.

**Meaning for jealousy and its difference from envy**

The meaning of jealousy is that man desires that a blessing may be
removed from his faithful brother though he knows that the said comfort
is befitting him and hence the title. But envy means: to desire the
comfort possessed by others without a wish that blessing may go away
from others. In other words, an envious person ones not want a halt the
progress of others but makes effort to equal others. Perhaps this
attitude can be divided into five kinds:

Kinds of Jealousy: That man desires that the comfort enjoyed by his
fellow Muslim brother may be taken away from the his even if thereby he
himself does not get any benefit. This is the worst kind of jealousy.

B: man wants that others bounty may be removed from him and may be
given to him.

C: Sometimes man does not want that someone's ease may be taken away
from him but wants the same ease for himself and since it does not reach
him he entertains a desire for the other man's down fall and possibly,
if he gets such strength, he removes the said ease from the other person
.

D: In the beginning one does not want that the other man should lose
his bounty but since he does not have the ability to reach it he desires
the downfall of the other person, but without an intention to seize the
other persons bounty even if he is able to do so. As he considers
himself religiously responsible and duty bound.

E: His heart would feel happy if the other prosperity vanishes but, at
the same, he is also angry with his own heart due to such wish and also
condemns scolds it.

It can be said that, possibly, the ayats and traditions apply to all
the aforesaid kinds. But the fifth kind, from both logical and
traditional viewpoint, deserves demarcation.

**Condemnation and Prohibition of Jealousy**

Ayats and Traditions censuring and banning jealousy are many. For
example we suffice to quote the following few:

1 - Many of the followers of the book wish that they could turn you
back into unbelievers after your Faith, out of envy from themselves.

2 - Or do they envy the people for what Allah has given them of His
Grace? But indeed We have give to Ibrahim's children the Book and the
wisdom, and we have given them a grand kingdom.

3 - If good befalls you, it grieves them, and if am evil afflicts you,
they rejoice at it; and if you are patient and guard yourselves, their
scheme will not injure you in any way; surely Allah comprehends what
they do.

4 -And do not convert that by which Allah has made some of you excel
others.

5 - Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said: Indeed envy and jealousy burn down Faith
just as fire burns down timber.

6 - Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said: Jealousy, self-centeredness and egos are
calamities for Faith.

7 - Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said: When the Arc of Noah settled on ground,
Satan approached him Nooh -AS and said: No one has as much right as you
have on me, because, it was a result of your prayer that this criminal
group of people has vanished and I feel happy. I recommend you two
attributes if you keep away from them you will benefit: 1 - Keep
distance from jealousy, because it was due to jealousy that I have been
driven out of the divine out of the divine position court. Be away from
envy calamity which has afflicted humanity was because of envy.

**Signs of Jealousy**

Obviously everybody imagines himself to be better and thinks that his
thoughts and manners are better and as mentioned in the Holy Quran: Man
is evidence against himself, through he puts forth his excuses.

Yet, along with this description the infallible and pure progeny of the
Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) have mentioned some signs. Here is an example:
it has been narrated from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that Luqman told to his son:
A jealous man has three signs: 1: While not facing him he backbites him,
2: When in front of him praises and feels happy himself.

**Harms of Jealousy**

Jealousy is the fountainhead of many individual and social evils some
of them being.

A: It can be said that jealousy is a kind of criminal motives observed
in the world and if an investigation is made in the real factors behind
murders, thefts, excesses etc we shall find that a significant number of
them is based on jealousy and, perhaps, that is why jealousy has been
compared with a spark of fir which can endanger both individuals and
societies. We see in narrations that:

A: 1 Jealousy can be close to blasphemy or disbelief and it is likely
that jealousy may turn off the life and future of man In other words,
sometimes destines of a family and a community change due to jealousy
and in history, such happenings are found like the events of the sons of
Adam and the sons of Yaqoob (a.s.).

B: A jealous person spends away all or most of his energy, be it
physical or mental, which otherwise could help in the progress of the
society, By losing it a jealous man spoils both his personal as well as
the collective assets, of the society. C: Over and above all this,
jealousy leaves very undesirable effects on the body of man and his
health. Usually jealous persons are seen to be almost ill and restless
both physically and mentally because, today it has been established that
many physical illnesses are due to nervous causes or psychics causes. In
today's field of medicine we see detailed discussions under the title of
illnesses related to physical ??? Now pay attention to the following
narrations:

1 - Ali (a.s.) said: Less jealousy, more health.
2 - Ali (a.s.) said: It is surprising that jealous people are totally
careless about their physique.
3 - Also we read: Liar has no virility and a jealous no rest.
4 - So also: The jealous is in grief and the miser is rebuked.
5 - Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said: A miser cannot have peace nor a jealous
pleasure.
6 - Amirul Mo-mineen (a.s.) said: One who does not suppress jealousy
makes his body his own grave.

D: Jealousy drives away man's religion, that is, man, through jealousy,
does things that drive away his religion. Hence we read that jealousy is
a calamity for religion.

Sometimes it so happens that a man whom God has given a bounty becomes
an enemy of either God or of that bounty and consequently becomes an
unbeliever, for example, Habeel.

The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said: Verily there are enemies of the
Divine bounties. It was asked who is an enemy of Gods bounty? He
replied: One who became jealous of those whom god has given bounty. It
has been mentioned in some Qudsi hadiths: In fact a jealous person is my
enemy and he becomes angry against my decision. He is not happy with
distribution among my servants.

In summary, we should seek whether of the Lord from this wicked vice.

**Causes of Jealousy**

May be all of these three or anyone or all of these three things causes
jealousy:

1 - Sometimes it so happens that due to dirt in heart or internal
blindness man is unable to look at Gods servants whom He has given
bounties. So Imam Sadiq (a.s.) says: Jealousy and ill will is due to
darkness in heart and blindness of soul which gets rooted due to denial
of Divine bounties and these two vices blind-heartedness and
fault-finding in Divine distribution are two wings of kufr blasphemy and
hence it was due to jealousy that the son of Adam drowned down in a
perpetual regret and fell into a ruin from which he never gets freed…

2 - Enmity between two persons often becomes the cause of jealousy.

3 - And sometimes longing for power, desire for position and pride and
self-centredness become the cause of jealousy. Hence the Holy Quran
Quotes the Al Kafirs of Quraysh saying: and they say: Why was not this
Quran revealed to a man of importance in the two towns? Valeed and
Habeeb of Mecca and Ta'if.

Yet at another place it says: They said: You are naught but mortals
like ourselves.

And as regards the third, it mentions: What! Shall we believe in tow
mortals like ourselves … and if you obey a mortal like yourselves, then
most surely you will be losers.

In any case, we must strive so that the causes and reasons of it are
removed and this is easier than, trying afterwards, to get rid of
jealousy.

**Remedy for this Dangerous disease**

The best procedure of removing this dangerous disease is:

First: Keep in mind the individual, social and otherworldly harms of
it.
Second: Seek its practical remedy and remove it from heart by
discipline.
Third: Man must think for a while whether he can, through jealousy,
grab a bounty from others where as the fact is that whatever God
Almighty has decided is bound to reach him. So he says: And there is
measure with him of everything.
And in respect of the other says: For every term there is an
appointment.


**Lesson: 13 : Greed and its harms**

One of the vices which degrade man and make him world-worshipper is
greed. Many times it so happens that man, due to greed, sells out his
personality and his religion also and makes himself disgraceful in the
society.

In this discussion, first of all, let us understand what is greed?

Secondly, what are its signs?

Thirdly, what are its individual, social collective and spiritual
harms.

Fourthly, what is its remedy?

1 - Greed: means to keep an eye on others wealth. This in itself is a
branch of worldly love. So many are people who do not have enough bread
to eat and yet they never look at the wealth of others, and like the
proverb, keep their cheek rosy by slapping it. Also there are
millionaires and are still greedy. In this matter we read in
narrations:

No richness can equal the content or needlessness of the heart.

In another hadith we read: Keep away from greed as greed is sure
poverty

2 - Signs of Greed: Man talks flatteringly with the wealthy and the
powerful and lowers himself before them and sometimes he presents
himself as a slave and as asserted by the Amirul Mo-mineen (a.s.): Greed
is a permanent slavery or a greedy man is bound by disgrace

3 - Harms of Greed: Greed lowers the value of man in the sight of God
and in the society. How disgraceful it is for a man for whom the Lord
Almighty has used names like or vicegregent.

Or says about him: And surely we have honoured the children of Adam.
Makes himself downgraded and looks greedily at the wealth or status of
others. Society knows such persons and people do not give any respect to
them. They are like mosquitoes being swept away in the direction of the
wind. In the words of Amirul Mo-mineen (a.s.): No thing destroys
religion like novice and no thing corrupts human personality like greed
Contrary to it there are also some people who are not wealthy from the
worldly viewpoint and yet they are respected by the society as the
society knows that they do not entertain any tined of greed and that
they represent the type who, in the words of the Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.s.): If anybody wants to become the richest man he should pay
more attention to what is in the hand of God and not what is in the
possession of other Imam Sadiq (a.s.) also says: One who rests content
at what God has provided for him is the richest of all men Greediness is
of no value from the religious point of view. Here we draw your
attention to some hadiths about it:

A: Saadaan says: I asked Imam Sadiq (a.s.): What strengthens the Faith
of man? He replied: Piety. And what drives man out of religion? He said:
Greed.

B: And Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said: Be pious and save yourselves from
showing yourselves as needy and know that the one who lowers himself
before the officer of a tyrant king or in front of his opponent in the
matter of religion for seeking mater at benefits of this transient
world, God makes him valueless in the eyes of the society and considers
him as His enemy.

C: Amirul Mo-mineen (a.s.) has, reportedly, said: One who approached a
wealthy man just for the sake of his wealth and thereby, gives him
respect loses two-third of his religion

4 - Cure for this Dreadful Illness: Man should look at its harms. He
should notice where did greed lead the people who fell pray to a greed
for status or lust for riches. Man must also read history and ponder
over it and take note that people like Ibne Saad or ulemas who were
greedy approached the courts of kings and consequently fell in the eyes
of the society. In this way man can easily remove this dirty vice from
himself. One should also think deeply into the might of the Lord of the
worlds only one God and believe that He has power over everything. He
must not show his needs to anyone except only one God until he becomes
needless except that of Almighty Allah and frees himself from the
slavery of any human being and reaches perfection of spirit.


**Lesson: 14 : Covetousness and its harms**

One of the branches of materialism is covetousness. It sometimes shows
itself in the form of greed for status and sometimes in the form of
eagerness to hoard wealth and sometimes it takes the shape of passions
and desires. The root of this attribute too, like all other human
attributes, is desirable, but it also, like other things must be kept
under control so as to benefit from it. In this connection the Holy
Quran says: Surely man is created of a hasty temperament; being greatly
grieved when evil afflicts him, and niggardly when good befalls him,
except those who pray.

In this verse Lord Almighty mentions man as greedy except those who
have permanent closeness to God and this man, if he does not keep
himself under control becomes so greedy and covetous that he does not
become contented even if the entire world is given away to him. In the
same reference the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) and the infallible Imams
(a.s.) have given admonition to man through impressive examples and
parables. Here are some:- 1 - It is reported from the Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.s.): If the son of Adam had two valleys full of gold, in fact, he
would remain in search of a third one and nothing but dust can fill the
belly of the son of Adam and God forgives everyone who repents.

2 - Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said: In truth, it has been revealed from the
Heavens that if the son of Adam had in his possession two valleys of god
and silver he will nevertheless seek a third one. O son of Adam: In fact
your belly is a river among rivers and a forest among forests which do
not get filled but by dust.

3 - Imam Baqir (a.s.) has been quoted like this: The parable of a
covetous person is that of a silk worm. The more it creates silk around
himself the more its way out gets away until it dies in frustration In
conclusion, the infallible Imams (a.s.) through such words of wisdom
went mankind to understand that they should not follow this attribute of
covetousness greed for worldly wealth and status because following it is
fatal for them.

**The way of remedying this dangerous disease**

First our certainty trust regarding the attributes of Almighty Allah
must be strengthened and we should know that he is Razzaaq Provider and
He has guarantied provision for all the creatures.

It is mentioned in the Holy Quran: And there is no animal in the earth
but on Allah is the sustenance of it. In another verse He says: and
whoever is careful of his city to Allah, me will make for him an outlet,
and give him sustenance from he thinks not. Secondly a covetous person
must think over the fact that the aim of his covetousness and greed is
accumulation of wealth and that this wealth remains here but he himself
passes away from here. Yet it is for him to give an account of that
wealth before the Lord in the Hereafter.

Thirdly, we should read with care the narrations in this regard so that
the wise and precious words of wisdom from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.)
and his pure and infallible family may prove effective for us. For
example:

1 - The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) has said: Among the causes of dryness
of eyes and toughness of heart are covetousness for obtaining provision
and insistence on sin.

2 - Someone asked Amirul Mo-mineen (a.s.): Which is the biggest
disgrace? He said: Greed for the material world.

3 - It is recorded from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) The son of Adam
becomes old, yet his two attributes remain: one agreed and another
lengthy ambitions.
Fourthly, The more a man becomes covetous the more he deprives him-self
of peace of mind and falls in more grief and anger and burns in the
internal fire. raging in his own heart.


**Lesson: 15 : One of the branches of worldly love is a lengthy
ambition**

This attribute is though desirable yet it also requires to be
controlled with conditions and planning. Religious leaders have given
many admonitions in this regard to their followers. Here are some of
them:-

1 - Amirul Mo-mineen (a.s.) said: Beware: My biggest worry about you is
in two matters: 1 - Following your desires and 2 - Lengthy ambitions
because slavery of desires prevents you from truth and entertaining
lengthy ambitions results in unmindfulness of the Hereafter life after
death.

2 - The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said: Indeed the welfare of a nation is
in piety and Faith and its destruction is in greed and long ambitions.

3 - Amirul Mo-mineen (a.s.) is reported to have said: In truth, if one
sees the speed with which ones death approaches him he will abhor long
ambitions and will give up worldly love.

**Result of high ambitions**

It is reported from Amirul Mo-mineen (a.s.): The result of long
ambitions is evil deeds of man.

He has also said: One who lengthens his ambitions worsens his deeds.

Perhaps it can also be said that: wickedness in our deeds reveals the
lengthiness of our ambitions.

**Remedy for This illness**

First man must look at the speed with which his death is approaching
him and then study history to know what kind of ambitions people had
entertained and took all of them only to graves. Thirdly, he should plan
for its remedy and should see towards the events of the family members
of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) so that he may clean himself in the light
of their guidance.


**Lesson: 16 : One of the branches of worldly love is stinginess**

Stinginess is a vice that moves man away from the Lord of the worlds
and makes him valueless in the eyes of society and the nation.

As a proof we divide the discussion of this lesson in four parts for
contemplation:

1 - Meaning of stinginess and a miser
2 - Verses and narrations condemning miserliness
3 - Individual and collective harms of misery.
4 - Remedy for stinginess and some events of the misers

Miser according to dictionary is keeping or holding up wealth in
conditions requiring its donation and bestowing and sometimes a man is
called miser who does not help when asked for it even though he is able
to help the needy. From the viewpoint of Shariat one is called a miser
when he does not fulfil his duties. It is said in a narration: Miser is
one who shows stinginess in spending as per Gods orders.

It is narrated from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.): One who pays up the
poor tax from his wealth and helps people in times of trouble is not a
miser. Misery is really in one who does not pay zakat and not the one
who helps his community in trying times.

But possibly, it can be said that help is a common usage and what is
mentioned in the narrations is describing some particular thing. Hence
some other meaning is also conveyed in some hadiths. For instance Imam
Sadiq (a.s.) has been quoted as saying: Bakhael miser is one who shows
stinginess in saying salaam Some rivayyats have explained its complete
applicability. Just as the latter narration does. In this connection
there are many verses and narrations. For example:

We read in the Holy Quran: and let not those deem, who are niggardly in
giving away that which Allah has granted them out of his Grace, that it
is good for them; nay, it is worse for them; they shall have that
whereof they were niggardly made to cleave to their necks on the
resurrection day.

2 - Those who are niggardly and bid people to be niggardly and hide
what Allah has given them out of His Grace; and we have prepared for
unbelievers a disgraceful chastisement.

3 - If you control the treasures of the Mercy of my Lord, then you
would withhold them from fear of spending, and man is niggardly And now
we read in narrations:

1 - The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said: Allah has said paradise is
forbidden to one who shows favours and the one who is niggardly.

2 - Imam Baqir (a.s.) said: Three things destroys people: 1 - Misery
and jealousy sprouted from misunderstanding about God, 2 - Following
desires and 3 - Self-conceit and self-centredness.

1 - The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said: Misery and jealousy and faith can
never stay together in man's heart
4 - Imam Sadiq (a.s.) says: A generous yet sinful youth is dearer to
God than an old and jealous men
5 - According to traditions the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) was one engaged
in circumambulation of the Holy Kaaba when he saw a man who was clinging
to the cover cloth of the Holy Kaaba and was seeking bath from God for
forgiving him because of the holiness of the Kaaba. The Holy Prophet
asked him: What is your sin?

The man replied: O Messenger of god: My sin is too serious to be
mentioned.
The Messenger: Woe unto you! Is your sin great or the earth?
Man: My sin is greater.
Prophet: Is your sin bigger or the mountains?
Man: My sin is bigger than mountains.
Messenger: In your sin big or the sea?
Man: My sin is bigger then them.
Messenger: Is your sin larger or the sky?
Man: My sin is larger.
Messenger: Is your sin greater or the Throne of the Lord Almighty?
Man: My sin.
Messenger: Is your sin great or God Himself?
Then the Holy Prophet said: Now tell me what is your sin?

The man said: I am a wealthy man. When a needy beggar approaches me I
feel as if a flame of fire is about to burn me. The Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.s.) said: Keep distance from me. Do not burn me with your blazing
fire. By the Lord who has appointed me! If you die with this vice of
misery, God will hurl you into Hell even if you pray for a thousand
years between these Holy places of Rukn and Maqaam and even if rivers of
tears flow from your weeping eyes. Woe unto you! Have you not read in
the Holy Quran: And whoever is niggardly is niggardly against his own
soul.

So also says the Lord: And whoever is preserved from the niggardliness
of his soul, these it is that are the successful ones.

**Harms of Niggardliness**

A miser man, from a psychic angle, always remains restless and all of
his worry is about hoarding wealth. Sometimes he also indulges in evil
and unlawful activities just for earning money. Hence Amirul Mo-mineen
is reported to have said:

Niggardliness is the root of all evils, it is a bridle that drives man
toward every evil.
And Ali (a.s.) also said: A miser has no rest nor a niggardly person
can be joy good taste.
The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.): A generous man is near God, society and
paradise whereas a stingy person is away from God and society but near
Hell. However, religious losses of niggardliness are obvious as it
prevents man from fulfilling his religious and desirable duties and as a
result he becomes the subject of the verses and narrations condemning
misery.
