Ghadir Khum (part 3 of 3)
=========================

**The chains (asnad) of narrations of Ghadir Khum**

The importance of the tradition of Ghadir Khum in history is reflected
in its widespread documentation and mentioned by the multitude of
personalities over the centuries. Although, some trivialized, only
listed the occurrence among the historical events without giving it a
thought, or discussed the matter in a mixture of emotional judgments,
none could deny the authenticity of these narrations. The essence of
what the Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HF) delivered on the day of Ghadir was
not disputed among any, even if they disagreed on its interpretation,
for reasons obvious to the alert.

Let us look at the lists of some of the Sunni traditions, commentators,
