Story no. 42:Unhappiness of Miss Zahra
======================================

Farida went to her neighbour, Zahra’s house and greeted her.  
 Zahra answered and said “ I am very unhappy”.  
 Farida asked “why? You should not be sad!”  
 Zahra answered “I am sad because since two days my parents have gone on
a trip and I am alone at home with my Grandmother and brother.  
 Farida said “ Excuse me, but this is not a thing to be sad about!”  
 Zahra said “Actually I love my mother and father very much so
separation from them is very hard for me.”  
 Yes, blessed are the children who have such an attachment with their
parents and respect their parents’ pleasure, because the pleasure of
parents comes under the pleasure of God.
