Greed
=====

It is said that Ka'b al-Ahbar was questioned about what is soundest and
what is most corrupt in faith. 'The soundest thing is scrupulousness and
the most corrupt is greed,' he replied.

Avarice is the wine of Satan, which he gives to his chosen ones with
his own hand. Whoever becomes drunk upon it sobers up only in the pain
of Allah's punishment in the proximity of the one who gave him the
drink. If there were no other reason for Allah's wrath with respect to
greed except man's preferring this world to faith, that would still be a
sufficiently severe chastisement. Allah said,


<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرُوُاْ الضَّلاَلَةَ بِالْهُدَى فَمَا
رَبِحَت تِّجَارَتُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُواْ مُهْتَدِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>



***These are they who buy error for the price of right guidance, and
chastisement for forgiveness.*** (2:16)


The Commander of the Faithful said, 'Be gracious to whoever you wish
and you are his prince. Seek help from whoever you like and you are his
equal. Be in need of whoever you like and you are his prisoner.' He who
is greedy is stripped of his belief without feeling it, for belief
prevents the bondsman from being greedy in creation. He also says, 'My
friend, the vaults of Allah are full of marks of honour, and He does not
neglect to reward of someone who acts well.'

Whatever a person might possess is tarnished by defects. Belief makes
him rely on trust, moderation, forsaking desire, clinging to the
obedience of Allah, and despairing of people. If he does that, then he
is keeping close to his belief and he has acted correctly. If he does
not, belief parts company with him and leaves him to his bad nature.
