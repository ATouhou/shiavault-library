Rewarding the Guards
====================

The daughters of Ali had thanked all the people who had took care of
them while in their way from Sham to Medina. And there was a guard who
had always asked how they were doing, was nice to them in all the
conditions, and did not make the journey hard for them till they arrived
to Medina. So Fatima, the daughter of Ali, said to her sister Zeinab O:
"This man was nice to us, so would you give him a reward?" So she (O)
said: "By Allah, we do not have anything to reward him with except for
these jewelry". so she said: "kindly do then".

So they grabbed for him two bracelets and two bangles

and sent it to him, but he returned them and said: "If I had done what I
did for the sake of this worldly life, I would have accepted what is
much less than that, but I swear to God, I had only did it for the sake
of Allah, and because of your kinship with the Messenger of Allah (P)‚Äù.

Thus Imam Zein El-Abedeen (Q) had insisted on rewarding him, so after he
had rejected the jewelry, Imam Zein El-Abedeen (Q) took a small black
stone and stamped it with his personal stamp then said: "Take it and do
ask whatever you need from it. As by Allah, who had sent Mohammad with
the truth, I used to ask it to light the house so it would lighten in
the darkness, and put it on the locks to open for me, and I do take it
with me to meet the Sultans and see of them only what pleases me".
