Lesson Twenty Five: A Healthy Social Life
=========================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لوْ أَنَّ النَّاسَ أَدَّوْا حُقُوقَ أَمْوَالِهِمْ لَكانُوا عايِشِينَ
بِخَيْر"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

If people honor the rights of each other and fulfill requirements of the
poor, they will enjoy a good and satisfactory life.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The above tradition emphasizes the wisdom of the Islamic obligations
placed on the rich to pay to the poor out of their property and savings
and the obligation on everyone to respect and honor the rights of
others. It clarifies that this is not merely a matter of morality or
religious compliance. Rather it is an extremely important social
principle with a strong bearing on the peace and prosperity of society.

One only has to look at the turmoil in the world today to appreciate the
value of this gem from the treasures of Islamic knowledge. Dangerous
reactions of the poor masses caused by class exploitation and unfair
concentration of wealth in the hands of a few are tearing at the fabric
of societies today. Peace and love are in short supply, violence and
misery abound.
