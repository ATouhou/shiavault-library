O ***son of*** the Commander of the Faithful

The apparent import of this verse signifies that Imam al-Husayn (AS) is
the son and offspring of Amir al-Mu’minin (AS). This is a historical
fact and we would not like to go into details about the same. However to
reveal how brilliant is the origin of Imam al-Husayn (AS) verses 19-20
of Surat al-Rahman come to mind:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ يَلْتَقِيانِ.بَيْنَهُما بَرْزَخٌ لا يَبْغِيانِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***He merged the two seas, meeting each other. There is a barrier
between them which they do not overstep. (55:19-20)***

Yahya bin Sa’id narrates:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
سَمِعْتُ أَبَا عَبْدِ اللهِ يَقُوْلُ فِيْ قَوْلِهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ:
مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ يَلْتَقِيانِ بَيْنَهُما بَرْزَخٌ لا يَبْغِيانِ‏
قَالَ: عَلِيٌّ وَفَاطِمَةُ، بَحْرَانُ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ عَمِيْقَانِ لاَ
يَبْغِي أَحَدُهُمَا عَلىَ صَاحِبِهِ‏ يَخْرُجُ مِنْهُمَا اللُّؤْلُؤُ
وَالْمَرْجانُ، اَلْحَسَنُ وَالْحُسَيْن.
  </p>
</blockquote>

I heard Aba ‘Abdillah [al-Sadiq] (AS) saying the following about the
verse of Allah “He merged the two seas, meeting each other. There is a
barrier between them which they do not overstep.”: ***‘Ali and Fatima
are two deep seas*** ***of knowledge***, none of who oversteps the
other. From them emerge the pearl and the coral, who are al-Hasan and
al-Husayn (AS).[^1]

The appellation Amir al-Mu’minin was conferred to Imam ‘Ali (AS) by
Allah Himself in the higher levels of existence prior to this material
world. Consider the following traditions:

1. Shaykh Saduq narrates in his *Al-Khisal*:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَنِ النَّبِيّ قَالَ: فِي اللَّوْحِ الْمَحْفُوْظِ تَحْتَ الْعَرْشِ
عَلِيُّ بْن أَبِيْ طالِبٍ أَمِيْرُ الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

The Holy Prophet (S) is reported to have said: In the Guarded Tablet
under the Divine Throne is [written] ‘Ali bin Abi Talib is Amir
al-mu’minin (Commander of the faithful) (AS).[^2]

2. Al-Kulayni in his *Al-Kafi* narrates with his chain of narrators:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَنْ جَابِرٍ عَنْ أَبِي جَعْفَرٍ قَالَ قُلْتُ لَهُ لِمَ سُمِّيَ
أَمِيرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ قَالَ اللَّهُ سَمَّاهُ وَهَكَذَا أَنْزَلَ فِي
كِتَابِهِ وَإِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ مِنْ بَنِي آدَمَ مِنْ ظُهُورِهِمْ
ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَأَشْهَدَهُمْ عَلى‏ أَنْفُسِهِمْ أَ لَسْتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ
وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّداً رَسُولِي وَأَنَّ عَلِيّاً أَمِيرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Jabir reports[^3]: I said to Abu Ja’far [al-Baqir (AS)]: Why was Imam
‘Ali (AS) named Amir al-Mu’minin? He (AS) said: Allah is the One who
named him, and this is how He revealed it in His Book: “When your Lord
took from the children of Adam, from their loins, their descendants and
made them bear witness over themselves, [He said to them,] Am I not your
Lord (7:172) and isn’t Muhammad My Messenger and ***‘Ali Amir
al-mu’minin (the commander of the faithful)?***.[^4]

3. Furat bin Ibrahim in his *Tafsir Furat al-Kufi* narrates the
following tradition:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَنْ أَبِيْ جَعْفَر قَالَ: لَوْ أَنَّ الْجُهَّالَ مِنْ هَذِهِ
الأُمَّةِ يَعْلَمُوْنَ مَتَى سُمِّيَ عَلِيٌّ أَمِيْرَ الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ
لَمْ يُنْكِرُوْا وِلاَيَتَهُ وَ طاعَتَهُ قَالَ فَسَأَلْتُهُ وَمَتَى
سُمِّيَ عَلِيٌّ أَمِيْرَ الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ‏؟ قَالَ حَيْثُ أَخَذَ اللهُ
مِيْثَاقَ ذُرِّيَةِ آدَم...
  </p>
</blockquote>

Imam al-Baqir (AS) is reported to have said: If the ignorant of this
nation would know when Imam ‘Ali (AS) was named Amir al-mu’minin, they
would not reject his guardianship and obedience. The reporter said: I
asked him (AS): And when was Imam ‘Ali (AS) named Amir al-mu’minin? He
replied: ***It was when Allah took the covenant with the progeny of
Adam..***.[^5]

Some traditions clearly tell us that the Holy Prophet (S) called Imam
‘Ali (AS) Amir al-mu’minin (AS) on different occasions during his life
time. Consider the following:

1. When Hadhrat Fatima bint al-Asad, the noble mother of Imam ‘Ali (AS),
comes out of the Ka’ba with her exalted offspring ‘Ali (AS), the
following is reported to have transpired:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ عَلِيٌّ أَلسَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكَ يَا أَبَهْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللَّهِ
وَبَرَكَاتُهُ ثُمَّ تَنَحْنَحَ وَقَالَ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمنِ
الرَّحِيمِ قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ ...فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ
قَدْ أَفْلَحُوا بِكَ أَنْتَ وَاللَّهِ أَمِيرُهُمْ تَمِيرُهُمْ مِنْ
عِلْمِكَ فَيَمْتَارُونَ وَأَنْتَ وَاللَّهِ دَلِيلُهُمُ وَبِكَ
وَاللَّهِ يَهْتَدُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Imam ‘Ali (AS) said: Peace be unto you, O father and may Allah’s mercy
and blessings be upon you. Thereafter he coughed a little and recited
[the following verses of Surat al-Mu’minun]: ***In the name of Allah,
the All-Beneficent, the All-Merciful. Indeed the believers have become
victorious (23:1)...*** Thereupon the Messenger of Allah said: Surely
they have gained victory by you; ***You are, by Allah, their Amir
(commander)***, you provide them from your knowledge, and hence they
gain knowledge; and I swear by Allah you are their Guide, and I swear by
Allah they attain guidance through you.[^6]

This tradition has so many allusions worthy of contemplation. Not only
does the Holy Prophet (S) call Imam ‘Ali (AS) as the commander of the
faithful, but also informs us the close relationship between one’s
commandership of the faithful and one’s vast knowledge. In clearer
words, since Imam ‘Ali (AS) is the commander of the faithful he
practically serves as the source and treasure trove of their knowledge.
And that is why he provides them with the knowledge they require.

Another allusion worthy of consideration is that Imam (AS) upon birth
already manifested an ocean of knowledge. Perhaps it alludes to the
Muhammadan Light (*al-Nur al-Muhammadi*) where he unites with the Holy
Prophet (S). For, any kind of grace, whether knowledge or otherwise, is
conferred to the creation through this very reality. This truth is
elicited from a tradition narrated from Jabir bin Abdillah al-Ansari:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْتُ لِرَسُوْلِ اللهِ:أَوَّلُ شَيْءٍ خَلَقَ اللهُ تَعَالَى مَا هُوَ؟
فَقَالَ:نُوْرُ نَبِيِّكَ يَا جَابِرُ، خَلَقَهُ اللهُ، ثُمَّ خَلَقَ
مِنْهُ كُلَّ خَيْرٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

I asked the Messenger of Allah (S): What is the first thing that Allah
created? He (S) said: The light of your prophet O Jabir. Allah created
it; ***thereafter He created from it every good***.[^7]

2. ‘Amr bin Husayb, the brother of Burayda bin Husayb is reported to
have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بَيْنَا أَنَا وَأَخِي بُرَيْدَةُ عِنْدَ النَّبِيِّ إِذْ دَخَلَ أَبُو
بَكْرٍ فَسَلَّمَ عَلَى رَسُولِ اللَّهِ فَقَالَ لَهُ انْطلِقْ فَسَلِّمْ
عَلَى أَمِيرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ فَقَالَ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَمَنْ
أَمِيرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ؟ قَالَ: عَلِيُّ بْنُ أَبِي طالِبٍ. قَالَ عَنْ
أَمْرِ اللَّهِ وَأَمْرِ رَسُولِهِ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ. ثُمَّ دَخَلَ عُمَرُ
فَسَلَّمَ فَقَالَ انْطلِقْ فَسَلِّمْ عَلَى أَمِيرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ
فَقَالَ: يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَمَنْ أَمِيرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ؟ قَالَ:
عَلِيُّ بْنُ أَبِي طالِبٍ. قَالَ: عَنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ وَأَمْرِ
رَسُولِهِ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

While I and my brother Burayda were in the presence of the Prophet (S),
Abu Bakr entered and greeted the Messenger of Allah (S), and he (S)
said: Go and greet Amir al-mu’minin. *Abu Bakr asked: O Messenger of
Allah, and who is Amir al-mu’minin? The Prophet (S) said:’Ali bin Abi
Talib (AS)*. Abu Bakr asked: Is this by the command of Allah and the
Apostle of Allah? The Prophet (S) said: yes. Thereafter ‘Umar entered
and greeted, and the Prophet (S) said to him: Go and greet Amir
al-Mu’minin (AS). ‘Umar said: O Messenger of Allah, and who is Amir
al-mu’minin? The Prophet (S) said: ‘Ali bin Abi Talib (AS). Umar asked:
Is this by the command of Allah and the Apostle of Allah? The Prophet
(S) said: yes.[^8]

3. Imam al-Ridha (AS) is reported to have narrated from his fathers from
Imam al-Husayn bin ‘Ali (AS):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ لِي بُرَيْدَةُ: أَمَرَنَا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ أَنْ نُسَلِّمَ عَلَى
أَبِيكَ بِإِمْرَةِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ .
  </p>
</blockquote>

Burayda said to me: The Messenger of Allah commanded us to greet your
father ***with the name Amir al-mu’minin***.[^9]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَابْنَ اَمِيْرِالْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

O son of the **Commander of the Faithful**

The appellation Amir al-mu’minin, according to different traditions, has
different meanings, all of which aptly befit the exalted personality of
Imam ‘Ali (AS). Therefore in reality there is no contradiction. The most
well-known meaning of this appellation is ‘commander of the faithful’.
The word *amir* comes from the word *amr* (order, command). Imam ‘Ali
(AS) manifesting faith in its utmost purity in all the dimensions of his
being qualified to be the *amir* of the faithful.

One of the milestomes of history that brilliantly manifested this
reality is the battle of Khandaq, when after having permitted Imam ‘Ali
(AS) to fight against *‘Amr bin ‘Abd Wudd*, the Holy Prophet (S) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بَرَزَ الإيْمَانُ كُلُّهُ إِلى الشِّرْكِ كُلِّهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Faith in its totality has come out to fight*** with polytheism in its
totality...[^10]

The Holy Prophet (S) in calling Imam ‘Ali (AS) *al-iman kulluh (faith in
its totality)* resonated a wealth of information, which only the
comprehending ears (*al-udhun al-wa’iyah*) were able to appreciate. It
is such epitomization of faith that makes the entity of ‘Ali emanate
nothing but instructions of faith and makes him worthy of being the
commander of the faithful.

Unfortunately those who later branded themselves with this title were
oblivious of the simple reality that ‘*faqid al-shay’ la yu’tih*” (one
who lacks something cannot confer the same). One who clearly disobeys
Allah and usurps the right of others becomes a laughing stock when he
names himself Amir al-mu’minin. This is because only one who totally
submits to Allah (SwT) and personifies faith can confer injunctions and
directions of faith. In an interesting tradition narrated from ‘Umar bin
al-Khattab we are told:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
سَمِعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ يَقُولُ إِنَّ السَّمَاوَاتِ السَّبْعَ
وَالأَرَضِينَ السَّبْعَ لَوْ وُضِعَتْ فِي كِفَّةٍ وَوُضِعَ إِيمَانُ
عَلِيٍّ فِي كِفَّةٍ لَرَجَحَ إِيمَانُ عَلِيٍّ
  </p>
</blockquote>

I heard the Messenger of Allah (S) say: Surely if the seven heavens and
the seven earths were placed in one of the palms of the scale, and the
faith of ‘Ali bin Abi Talib placed on the other, the faith of ‘Ali would
be heavier.[^11]

In another tradition the Holy Prophet (S) vocally informs us that the
yardstick of the belief of the believers is the radiant being of ‘Ali.
In one of his conversations with Imam ‘Ali (AS), the Holy Prophet (S)
says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَوْ لاَ أَنْتَ لَمْ يُعْرَفِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ مِنْ بَعْدِي...
  </p>
</blockquote>

If you were not there, the believers would not be known after me...[^12]

Therefore Imam ‘Ali (AS) serves as the scale of faith (*mizan al-iman*).

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ياَ بْنَ اَمِيْرِالْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

O ***the edifice of*** the Commander of the Faithful

As explained in the previous verse, the word اِبْن *ibn* can either
refer to the meaning ‘the son of’ or ‘the product of’. Hence, Imam
al-Husayn (AS) is both the physical edifice[^13] of his noble father as
well as his spiritual artifact. And if we consider the genitive
construction *Amir al-mu’minin* to mean ‘commander of the faithful’ then
he becomes an edifice of one who deserves to command the faithful, and
consequently inherits and acquires the same qualities.

Due to his infallibility in thought, speech, and action, and ability to
bear the Divine Leadership (*imama*), Imam al-Husayn (AS) is qualified
to command the faithful. In the radiant salutational recital *Ziyarat
al-Jami’a* narrated from Imam al-Hadi (AS), we address the Imams of the
Ahl al-Bayt (AS) as follows:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
...وَعِبَادِهِ الْمُكْرَمِينَ لاَ يَسْبِقُوْنَهُ بِالْقَوْلِ وَهُمْ
بِاَمْرِهِ يَعْمَلُوْنَ ..
  </p>
</blockquote>

And His ennobled servants who do not advance Him in speech, and **act
according to His Command**...[^14]

And in another place of the same *Ziyarat* we say:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَاِنّي لَكُمْ مُطيْعٌ، مَنْ اَطاعَكُمْ فَقَدْ اَطاعَ اللهَ، وَمَنْ
عَصَاكُمْ فَقَدْ عَصَى اللهَ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

So indeed I am obedient to you; **whosoever obeys you has obeyed
Allah**, and whosoever disobeys you has indeed disobeyed Allah...[^15]

There are other traditions too that clearly depict that the Imams of the
Ahl al-Bayt (AS) are the *ulu al-amr* (those worthy to command)
mentioned in the following verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذينَ آمَنُوا أَطيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطيعُوا الرَّسُولَ
وَأُولِي الأََمْرِ مِنْكُمْ فَإِنْ تَنازَعْتُمْ في‏ شَيْ‏ءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ
إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ
وَالْيَوْمِ الآخِرِ ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْويلاً
  </p>
</blockquote>

***O you who have faith! Obey Allah and obey the Apostle*** **and those
among you who hold command.** ***And if you dispute concerning anything,
refer it to Allah and the Apostle, if you have faith in Allah and the
Last Day. That is better and more favourable in outcome. (4:59)***

Jabir al-Ju’fi narrates: I heard Jabir bin ‘Abdillah al-Ansari say:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَمَّا أَنْزَلَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ عَلىَ نَبِيِّهِ مَحَمَّدٍ: يَا
أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ
وَأُولِي الأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ قُلْتُ: يَا رَسُوْلَ اللهِ، عَرَفْنَا اللهَ
وَرَسُوْلَهُ، فَمَنْ أولُو الأَمْرِ الَّذِيْنَ قَرَنَ اللهُ طاعَتَهُمْ
بِطاعَتِكَ؟ فَقَالَ: «هُمْ خُلَفَائِيْ- يَا جَابِرُ- وَأَئِمَّةُ
الْمُسْلِمِيْنَ مِنْ بَعْدِيْ، أًوَّلُهُمْ عَلِيُّ بْنُ أَبِيْ طالِب،
ثُمَّ الْحَسَنُ، ثُمَّ الْحُسَيْن، ثُمَّ عَلِيُّ بْنُ الْحُسَيْن،
ثُمَّ مُحَمَّد بْن عَلِي الْمَعْرُوْف فِي التَّوْرَاةِ بِالْبَاقِرِ،
سَتُدْرِكُهُ- يَا جَابِرُ- فَإِذَا لَقَيْتَهُ فَاقْرَأْهُ مِنِّي
السَّلاَمَ، ثُمَّ الصَّادِقُ جَعْفَر بْن مُحَمَّد، ثُمَّ مُوْسَى بْن
جَعْفَر، ثُمًَّ عَلِيّ بْن مُوْسَى، ثُمَّ مُحَمَّد بْنِ عَلِيّ، ثُمَّ
عَلِيّ بْن مُحَمَّد، ثُمَّ الْحَسَن بْن عَلِيّ، ثُمَّ سَمِيِّي
وَكُنْيَي حُجَّة اللهِ فِي أَرْضِهِ، وَبَقِيَّتُهُ فِي عِبَادِهِ ابْن
الْحَسَن بن عَلِي، ذَاكَ الَّذِيْ يَفْتَح اللهُ تَعَالَى ذِكْرَهُ
عَلىَ يَدَيْهِ مَشَارِقَ الأَرْضِ وَمَغَارِبَهَا...
  </p>
</blockquote>

When Allah revealed unto His Prophet Muhammad (S) the verse *“O you who
have faith! Obey Allah and obey the Apostle* ***and those among you who
hold command**”*(4:59). I asked [the Prophet (S)]: O Messenger of Allah,
we know about Allah and His Messenger. But who are the *Ulu al-Amr*
(those who hold command) whose obedience Allah placed in line with your
obedience?

He (AS) said: *They are my successors*, O Jabir, and the leaders of the
Muslims after me. The first among them is ‘Ali bin Abi Talib (AS), then
comes al-Hasan (AS), and then al-Husayn (AS), then ‘Ali the son of
al-Husayn (AS), then Muhammad the son of ‘Ali (AS) who is well-known in
the Torah as al-Baqir (the cleaver). Soon you will meet him, O Jabir!
And when you meet him convey to him my salams (greetings). Then comes
al-Sadiq Ja’far bin Muhammad (AS), then Musa bin Ja’far (AS), then ‘Ali
bin Musa (AS), then Muhammad bin ‘Ali (AS), then ‘Ali bin Muhammad (AS),
then al-Hasan bin ‘Ali (AS), then one whose name and teknonym (*kunya*)
would be like mine, the proof of Allah on the earth and His remnant
among His servants, the son of al-Hasan bin ‘Ali (AS). He is the one by
whom Allah will conquer the easts and wests of the earth...[^16]

Therefore all the Imams of the Ahl al-Bayt (AS) qualify in the universal
sense to be *Amir al-mu’minin* (commander of the faithful).

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَابْنَ اَمِيْرِالْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

O edifice of the Commander of ***all the*** Faithful

A grammatical allusion worthy of consideration, can be understood by
looking at the article ‘*al*’ prefixed in the plural “*al-mu’minin*”
(the faithful) above. One the well-known grammatical laws is that when
the article ‘*al*’ precedes a plural, it signifies that all the
extensions of the plural are taken into consideration.

In our case, when we say *al-mu’minun*, we mean “all the faithful”.
Therefore, the appellation Amir al-mu’minin signifies that Imam ‘Ali
(AS) is the commander of *all the faithful*. In a tradition the Holy
Prophet (S) after informing Imam ‘Ali (AS) how Allah Himself named him
Amir al-mu’minin, says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
...فَأَنْتَ يَا عَلِيُّ أَمِيْرُ مَنْ فِي السَّماَءِ وَأَمِيْرُ مَنْ
فِي الأَرْضِ وَأَمِيْرُ مَنْ مَضَى وَأَمِيْرُ مَنْ بَقِي فَلاَ
أَمِيْرَ قَبْلَكَ وَلاَ أَمِيْرَ بَعْدَكَ لأَنَّهُ لاَ يَجُوْزُ أَنْ
يُسَمَّى بِهَذاَ الاِسْمِ مَنْ لَمْ يُسَمِّهِ الله ُتعَاَلىَ بِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

...Therefore, you, ***O ‘Ali, are the commander (amir) of those in the
heavens and the commander (amir) of those in the earth, and the
commander (amir) of those who have passed, and the commander (amir) of
those who remain. Hence there is no amir prior to you, nor is there any
amir after you.*** For it is impermissible to name someone with this
name whom Allah has not named.[^17]

Consequently his edifice, Imam al-Husayn (AS), who is *ibnu Amir
al-mu’minin* is also the *amir* of all the believers.

Amir Al-Mu’minin – An Exclusive Apellation
------------------------------------------

It should be known that the appellation ‘*Amir al-mu’minin*’ although
widely employed by different people in history, is exclusively for Imam
‘Ali (AS). The other Imams (AS) would not allow their followers to use
it for them. Observe the following narrations:

1. Imam ‘Ali (AS) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ لَمَّا أُسْرِيَ بِي إِلَى السَّمَاءِ كُنْتُ مِنْ
رَبِّي كَقَابِ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنى‏ فَأَوْحَى إِلَيَّ رَبِّي مَا
أَوْحَى ثُمَّ قَالَ يَا مُحَمَّدُ اقْرأْ عَلَى عَلِيِّ بْنِ أَبِي
طالِبٍ أَمِيرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ السلام فَمَا سَمَّيْتُ بِهِ أَحَداً
قَبْلَهُ وَلاَ أُسَمِّي بِهَذَا أَحَداً بَعْدَهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

The Messenger of Allah (S) said: When I was made to ascend to the
Heavens, I was at a distance from my Lord that was like the length of
two bows or nearer. So my Lord Revealed unto me what He Revealed. Then
He said: O Muhammad send your greetings to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, Amir
al-mu’minin (AS). *Indeed I have not named anyone with this appellation
before him, and will never name anyone with it after him*.[^18]

2. ‘Allama Majlisi in his *Bihar al-Anwar* narrates:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ رَجُلٌ للصَّادِقِ: يَا اَمِيْرَ الْمُؤْمِنينَ فَقَالَ: مَهْ
فَإِنَّهُ لاَ يَرْضَى بِهَذِهِ التّسْمِيَة أَحَدٌ إِلاَّ ابْتَلاَهُ
ببَلآء اَبيْ جَهْل.
  </p>
</blockquote>

A man called Imam al-Sadiq (AS) ‘O Commander of the faithful! whereupon
the Imam (AS) said: Stop! For surely no one approves being named so,
save that he is tried with the trial of Abu Jahl.[^19]

3. Shaykh al-Kulayni in his al-Kafi narrates the following tradition:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
سَأَلَهُ رَجُلٌ عَنِ الْقَائِمِ يُسَلَّمُ عَلَيْهِ بِإِمْرَةِ
الْمُؤْمِنِينَ قَالَ لاَ ذَاكَ اسْمٌ سَمَّى اللَّهُ بِهِ أَمِيرَ
الْمُؤْمِنِينَ لَمْ يُسَمَّ بِهِ أَحَدٌ قَبْلَهُ وَ لاَ يَتَسَمَّى
بِهِ بَعْدَهُ إِلاَّ كَافِرٌ قُلْتُ جُعِلْتُ فِدَاكَ كَيْفَ يُسَلَّمُ
عَلَيْهِ قَالَ يَقُولُونَ السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بَقِيَّةَ اللَّهِ
ثُمَّ قَرَأَ بَقِيَّتُ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

A person asked Imam al-Sadiq (AS) about [Imam] Al-Qa’im (AS), whether it
is proper to greet him with [the appellation] Amir al-Mu’minin, and he
said: No. That is a name that Allah named Amir al-Mu’minin with it, none
before him was named with it, and none will name himself with it after
him save a disbeliever. The person said: may I be made your ransom, how
should one greet him? He (AS) said: They should say: Peace be unto you,
O remnant of Allah (*Baqiyyat Allah*). Thereafter he A read the verse of
Qur\`an, “*What remains of Allah’s provision is better for
you...*”(11:86)[^20]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَابْنَ اَمِيْرِالْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

O the Edifice of **the Provider of the Faithful**

Another meaning of ‘*Amir al-mu’minin*’ is the ‘one who provides
knowledge to the believers’. This is when the word Amir stems from the
infinitive مِيرْ ‘*mir*’ which means جَلْبُ الطعَامِ ‘*jalb al-ta’am*’
(to draw food). Al-Turayhi in his *Gharib al-Qur\`an* says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يُقَالُ : فُلاَنٌ يَمِِيْرُ اَهْلَهُ اِذَا حَمَلَ إِلَيْهِمْ
اَقْوَاتَهُمْ مِن غَيْرِ بَلَدِهِمْ مِنَ الْمِيْرَة بِكَسْرِ الْمِيْمِ
وَسُكُوْنِ الْيَاءِ طعَامٌ يَمْتَارُهُ الإِنْسَانُ اَيْ يَجْلُبُهُ من
بَلَدٍ اِلى بَلَدٍ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

It is said: *Fulan yamiru ahlahu* (So and so provides his family) when
he carries to them their provisions from another town. It comes from
*al-mira* which is food that a person obtains or takes from one town to
another.[^21]

And food in this case does not only refer to ‘physical food’ that
satisfies one’s stomach, but fundamentally to spiritual food that
elevates the human being. Under the verse of the holy Qur\`an that says
‘***Then let man look at his food*****’(80:24).**

Imam al-Sadiq (AS) explains to Zayd al-Shahham[^22], one of his
companions that food here refers to knowledge, and that the human being
is told to reflect on his knowledge and its origin. Likewise, as we
shall soon see, the ‘*mir’* referred to in this case is interpreted by
the infallible Imams of the Ahl al-Bayt (AS) to mean knowledge. Consider
the following narrations:

1. ‘Allama Majlisi in his *Bihar al-Anwar* reports :

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَنْ جَابِرٍ عَنْ أَبِي جَعْفَرٍ قَالَ قُلْتُ جُعِلْتُ فِدَاكَ: لِمَ
سُمِّيَ اَمِيْرُ الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ اَمِيْرَ الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ؟ قَالَ:
لاَنَّهُ يَمِيْرُهُمْ اَلْعِلْمَ، اَمَا سَمِعْتَ كِتَابَ اللهِ
عَزَّوَجَلَّ ونمير أهلنا؟
  </p>
</blockquote>

Jabir is reported to have said: I asked Abi Ja’far (al-Baqir (AS)): “May
I be made your ranson; why was Amir al-Mu’minin (Imam ‘Ali (AS)) known
as Amir al-mu’minin?” The Imam (AS) said: ‘It is because he provides
them (*yamiruhum*) with knowledge; haven’t you heard the Book of Allah
‘*wa namiru ahlana*’ (.*..**we will get provisions for our family...
(12:65**)*)?[^23]

2. ‘Allama Majlisi in his *Bihar al-Anwar* reports:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَبَانُ بْنُ الصَّلْتِ عَنِ الصَّادِقِ: سَمِيُّ اَمِيْرِ
الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ إنَّمَا هُوَ مِنْ مِيْرَةِالْعِلْمِ، وَذَلِكَ اَنَّ
الْعُلَمَآءَ مِنْ عِلْمِهِ امْتَارُوْا وَ مِنْ مِيْرَتِهِ
اسْتَعْمَلُوْا
  </p>
</blockquote>

Aban bin al-Salt is reported to have said that Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said:
Indeed naming *Amir al-mu’minin is* from ‘the provision of knowledge’;
and that is because the knowledgeable ones took knowledge from him, and
took advantage of his provision.[^24]

Some esteemed *muhaddithun* like the late ‘Allama Majlisi give the
probability that the word Amir instead of being a common noun meaning
‘commander’ is an indefinite verb (*al-fi’l al-mudhari’*) meaning ‘I
provide’ (اًَمِيْرُ) that later turned into a proper noun (‘*alam*). In
other words, Imam ‘Ali (AS) said “*Amiru* (I provide) *al-mu’minina*
(the believers)’ and thereafter the whole statement turned into a noun
referring to Imam ‘Ali (AS). They liken this with name تَاَبَّط شَرّاً
(lit. he put evil beneath his armpit). The well-known poet Thabit bin
Jabir was called that because it is said that the sword never left
him.[^25] According to a narration indicated in the *Bihar al-Anwar*, he
was known to be so because:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
تَاَبَّط سَيْفًا وَخَرَجَ فَقِيْلَ لاُمِّهِ: اَيْنَ هُوَ؟ فَقَالَتْ:
تَأبَّط شَرًّا وَخَرَجَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

...he put a sword beneath his armpit (*ta’abbata sayfan*) and went out;
and when his mother was asked, ‘Where is he?’ she said: He put evil
under his armpit (*ta’abbata sharran*) and left.[^26]

In short, therefore, *Amir al-mu’minin (I provide the faithful)* could
be a sentence which later turned into a proper noun.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَابْنَ اَمِيْرِالْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

O son of the **Commander of the Bestowers of Protection**

If we carefully consider the meaning of *al-mu’minun* (plural of
*al-mu’min*) in the genetive construction Amir al-mu’minin we may be
able to unravel and draw some of the secrets of this radiant verse.
Following are some narratives that define the word *mu’min*:

1. Imam al-Sadiq (AS) was asked why a believer was known as *mu’min* and
he said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لِأَنَّهُ اشْتَقَّ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ اسْماً مِنْ أَسْمَائِهِ تَعَالَى
فَسَمَّاهُ مُؤْمِنا، وَإِنَّمَا سُمِّيَ الْمُؤْمِنُ لِأَنَّهُ يُؤْمَنُ
مِنْ عَذَابِ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى، وَيُؤْمِنُ عَلىَ اللهِ يَوْمَ
الْقِيَامَةِ فَيُجِيْزُ لَهُ ذَلِكَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

It is because He (Allah) derived for the believer a name from His Names,
and named him *mu’min*. And he was named *mu’min* because he is
protected from the punishment of Allah, the Exalted, and gives warrant
to Allah [for others] on the Judgment Day, and Allah would approve that
for him.

2. Imam al-Sadiq (AS) when defining the meaning of the Divine Name
*al-Mu’min* is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
سُمِّيَ الْبَارِئ ُعَزَّ وَجَلَّ مُؤْمِنًا لأنَّهُ يُؤْمِنُ مِنْ
عَذاَبِهِ مَنْ أَطاعَهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

The Maker, Invincible and Exalted, was named *Mu’min* because He
protects (*yu’minu*) whosoever obeys Him from His punishment...[^27]

Notice carefully that the aforementioned traditions allude to the
following important realities:

(a) The believer is a manifestation of the Divine Name *al-Mu’min*.  
 (b) He enjoys protection (*aman*), and  
 (c) He confers protection (*yu’minu*) by seeking the same for others
from Allah.

3. The Holy Prophet (S) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَلاَ اُنَبِّئُكُمْ لِمَ سُمِّيَ الْمُؤْمِنُ مُؤْمِنًا؟ لإِيْمَانِهِ
النَّاسَ عَلىَ أَنْفُسِهِمْ وَأَمْوَالِهِمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Should I not inform you why a believer was named *mu’min*? It is because
he grants security to people in themselves and their wealth.

4. The Holy Prophet (S) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَاللَّهِ مَا سُمِّيَ الْمُؤْمِنُ مُؤْمِناً إِلاَّ كَرَامَةً لِأَمِيرِ
الْمُؤْمِنِين
  </p>
</blockquote>

“I swear by Allah, the believer was not named *mu’min* save in honor of
Amir al-Mu’minin."

If we study the various derivatives of the word *mu’min* as expounded in
the above traditions, we would realize that all of them converge at one
single attribute: protection (*aman*). The reason why a believer is
called *mu’min* is because he ‘enjoys protection’ and ‘confers the
same’.

The fourth tradition however requires deliberation to comprehend.
Perhaps it would like to tell us that in order to bestow the honorable
appellation Amir al-mu’minin to Imam ‘Ali (AS), Allah named the believer
as *mu’min*. For the appellation Amir al-mu’minin would have no meaning
in the absence of people called ‘*mu’minun*’. Obviously this should not
be considered a kind of superficial honorification. The Imam (AS) most
brilliantly manifesting the Divine Attribute al-Mu’min, qualified to
command the believers who manifest this attribute acording to their
limitations. Therefore Allah bestowing honor to Him called the believer
a *mu’min* and named Him Amir al-mu’minin.

In conclusion, the genitive construction Amir al-Mu’minin means ‘The
commander of those who confer protection’. Therefore Imam ‘Ali (AS) is
the commander of one who enjoys and confers protection. Consequently, he
is the professor and teacher of the lesson of protection (*aman*). He is
not merely a theoretical professor, but ‘a commander’ and thus ‘a
practical mentor’. And the believers always benefit from his banquet. If
we ponder over the abovementioned traditions we would realize that the
protection that is spoken about is not always physical protection. A
believer fundamentally seeks the spiritual protection of others.

The entire life of Amir al-mu’minin (AS) serves as a lesson for those
who would like to learn how to protect themselves and others. The
yardstick of such a life, as mentioned in the aforementioned tradition
of Imam al-Sadiq (AS), is obedience to Allah. The Imam’s thoughts,
words, and deeds, all reflect utter submission to Allah’s will.

The Holy Prophet (S) describing some of the phenomena of the Day of
Judgment to Imam ‘Ali (AS) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
...ثُمَّ يُنَادِيْ مُنَادٍ مِنْ قِبَلِ اللهِ تَعَالى: أَلاَ إِنَّ
عَلِيًّا وَشِيْعَتَهُ الآمِنُوْنَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

...Thereafter a caller on behalf of Allah would call: Look! Surely ‘Ali
and his followers are the protected ones (*al-aminun*) on the Judgment
Day.[^28]

And in another tradition, the Holy Prophet (S) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا عَلِيُّ، أَنْتَ وَشِيْعَتُكَ عَلىَ الْحَوْضِ تَسْقُوْنَ مَنْ
أَحْبَبْتُمْ، وَتَمْنَعُوْنَ مَنْ كَرِهْتُمْ، وََأَنْتُمْ الآمِنُوْنَ
يَوْمَ الْفَزَعِ الأَكْبَر...
  </p>
</blockquote>

O ‘Ali, you and your followers would quench the thirst of whom you love
at the Fountain, and hamper those whom you abhor. ***You are the
protected ones (al-aminun)*** on the Day of the great terror (See
21:103)...[^29]

Some of the verses of the Holy Qur\`an also inform us that by
maintaining pure faith and observing *taqwa*, ‘protection’ (*aman*) is a
guarantee:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الَّذينَ آمَنُوا وَلَمْ يَلْبِسُوا إيمانَهُمْ بِظُلْمٍ أُولئِكَ لَهُمُ
الأَمْنُ وَهُمْ مُهْتَدُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Those who have faith and do not taint their faith with wrongdoing for
such there shall be safety, and they are the [rightly] guided.”(6:82)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ الْمُتَّقينَ في‏ مَقامٍ أَمينٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Indeed the God wary are in a secure station (44:51)***

Imam al-Husayn (AS) who is *ibnu Amir al-mu’minin* is in this sense “the
product of the commander of those who confer protection”. Necessarily,
then, he likewise enjoys the characteristics of his father. His entire
life serves as a lesson of *aman* and protection from Hell Fire.

In one of the supplications of the Holy month of Sha’ban we express the
following about the Ahl al-Bayt (AS):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَللَّهُمَّ صَل ِّعَلىَ مُحَمَّدٍ وَّآل ِمُحَمَّد اَلْفُلْكِ
الْجَارِيَةِ فِي اللُّجَجِ الْغَامِرَةِ يَأْمَنُ مَنْ رَكِبَهَا
وَيَغْرَقُ مَنْ تَرَكَهَا
  </p>
</blockquote>

O Allah bless Muhammad and his progeny, the moving ark in the covering
depths [of the sea], whosoever boards in it is protected and whosoever
leaves it drowns.[^30]

Recitation & Realization
------------------------

Reciting this verse after having known its comprehensive meaning
undoubtedly fills the heart of the loving *za’ir* with awe and
veneration for the *mazur*. However, as we had mentioned in the very
beginning of this commentary, the most important and fundamental purpose
of our recitation must be unity and coherence with the *mazur*. If we
address Imam al-Husayn (AS) with *ibnu Amir al-mu’minin*, and believe
that he is fit to command the believers, then we must resolve to
practically follow his commands.

Believing someone to be *amir* is practically realized when one follows
him. And when we understand Amir al-mu’minin (AS) as the commander of
those who confer *aman* and safety, then we must practically seek and
follow the lesson of confering safety from Imam (AS) and apply the same
in our lifetimes.

And if we comprehend the appellation Amir al-mu’minin as the provider of
knowledge to the believers, then we must practically draw our
fundamental knowledge from authorities like Imam ‘Ali (AS) and the Ahl
al-Bayt (AS). And if we understand the meaning of Amir al-mu’minin (AS)
as the Commander of those who have faith, then we should resolve in
following his footsteps and drawing closer to him so that we are
entitled to be the bearers of iman and faith.

O Son Of The **Commander Of Those Who Confer Tranquility**

The word *mu’min* is conventionally translated as ‘*faithful*’ or
‘*believer*’. Its literal import however is worthy of consideration. It
comes from the word ‘*amn*’ which according to leading lexicographers
like al-Isfahani, means ‘*tuma’ninat al-nafs*’ (tranquility and
contentment of the heart). And the word *iman* which we translate as
faith actually means *‘to place in oneself or another [the state of] amn
(tranquility)*. And when we say آمن بالله ‘*amana bilLahi*’ which we
conventionally translate as ‘he believed in Allah’ we literally mean ‘he
attained contentment and tranquility by Allah’.

Principally when we speak of *iman billah* we mean to agree and have
tranquility that God exists, He is the overwhelming One, and to Him
belong the Attributes of Beauty and Majesty. However, such tranquility
which is limited to the belief in the existence of God is substantially
different from the tranquility and serenity attained in Allah.

Perhaps the most apt example of tranquility one can cite in the life of
the commander of the tranquil ones (Amir al-mu’minin) is what transpired
on the well-known *laylat al-mabit* when Imam ‘Ali (AS) rests with utter
peace and tranquility on the blessed bed of the Holy Prophet (S) while
the Prophet (S) sets for his well-known migration to Madina. Indeed I
feel it is only the Holy Qur\`an that can properly narrate the nature of
this historic incident. Almighty Allah says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ مِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَشْري نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغاءَ مَرْضاتِ اللَّهِ
وَاللَّهُ رَؤُوْفٌ بِالْعِبادِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And among the people is he who sells his soul seeking the pleasure of
Allah, and Allah is most kind to [His] servants.(2:207)***

Imam Zayn al-’Abidin (AS) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
نَزَلَتْ فِيْ عَلِيٍّ حِيْنَ بَاتَ عَلىَ فِرَاشِ رَسُوْلِ اللهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

This verse was revealed about ‘Ali (AS) when he slept on the bed of the
Messenger of Allah (S).[^31]

In another tradition which shows the extent of *itmi’nan* and
tranquility of ‘Ali (AS), we are told:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
...فَباَتَ عَلِيٌّ مُوَطنًا نَفْسَهُ عَلىَ الْقَتْلِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

So Imam ‘Ali (AS) slept while he stationed his soul to be killed...[^32]

The phrase *‘muwattinan nafsahu ‘ala al-qatl’* reveals so much. It shows
the Imam’s readiness to be martyred in the way of Allah. The word
‘*muwattinan*’ literally connotes that Imam ‘Ali (AS) had stationed his
spirit in the *watan* (hometown) of martyrdom.

Ayatullah al-Rayshahri quoting *al-Tabaqat al-Kubra* among other
historical texts writes in his *Mawsu’at al-Imam ‘Ali bin Abi Talib
(AS)*:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
...فَاقْتَرَحَ عَلى عَلِيٍّ أَنْ يَبِيْتَ فِيْ فِرَاشِهِ تِلْكَ
اللَّيْلَة، فَسَأَلَهُ: أَوَ تُسْلَمْ يَا رَسُوْلَ اللهِ؟ قَالَ:
نَعَمْ. فَرَحَّبَ الإِمَامُ بِهَذاَ الاِقْتِرَاحِ مُوَطنًا نَفْسَهُ
لِلْقَتْلِ عِنْدَ مُوَاجَهَةِ الْمُشْرِكِيْنَ صَبَاحًا، وَسَجَدَ
سَجْدَةَ الشُّكْرِ عَلىَ هَذِهِ الْمَوْهِبَةِ الْعَظِيْمَةِ
وَالْتَحَفَ بِالْبُرْدِ الْيَمَانِي الأَخْضَرِ الَّذِيْ كَانَ
يَلْتَحِفُ بِهِ النَّبِيُّ عِنْدَ نَوْمِهِ، َونَامَ مُطمَئِنًّا فِيْ
فِرَاشِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

...So the Prophet (S) suggested to ‘Ali (AS) that he sleeps that night
in his bed, and ‘Ali (AS) asked him: Would you be protected thereby O
Messenger of Allah? He (S) said: Yes. So the Imam (AS) welcomed this
suggestion while stationing himself to be martyred when he confronts the
polytheists in the morning, and he prostrated in thanks to Allah for
this great gift, and wrapped himself with the green Yemenite cloak that
the Messenger of Allah would cover himself with when he slept, *and he
slept in the state of tranquility...*[^33]

The phrase ‘*wa nama mutma’innan fi firashihi’* (*and he slept in the
state of tranquility in the Prophet’s bed)* is worthy of reflection. It
shows how Amir al-mu’minin having sold his soul to the only beloved is
overwhelmed and overtaken with utmost composure and tranquility.

Bearing the aforesaid understanding of the appellation Amir al-mu’minin
in mind, the meaning of *ibnu Amir al-mu’minin* confers the implication
that Imam al-Husayn (AS) who is the edifice of the commander of the
tranquil spirits also exemplifies the same attribute of tranquility.

Both his words as well as his deeds reveal this reality. In his
well-known supplication of ‘Arafa, Imam al-Husayn (AS) is narrated to
have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا ذَاوَجَدَ مَنْ فَقَدَكَ وَمَا الَّذِيْ فَقَدَ من وَجَدَكَ؟
  </p>
</blockquote>

What has he who has lost You found? And what has he who has found You
lost?[^34]

And Imam al-Sadiq (AS) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
‏ اِقْرَؤُوا سُوْرَةَ الْفَجْرِ فِيْ فَرَائِضِكُمْ وَنَوَافِلِكُمْ،
فَإِنها سُوْرَةُ الْحُسَيْنِ وَارْغَبوا فِيْهَا رَحِمَكمُ الله فَقَالَ
لَهُ أبُو أُسَامَة وَكَانَ حَاضِرَ الْمَجْلِس: كَيْفَ صَارَتْ هَذِهِ
السُّوْرَةُ لِلْحُسَيْنِ خَاصَّةً؟ فَقَالَ: أَلاَ تَسْمَعُ إِلَى
قَوْلِهِ تَعَالَى: يَا أَيَّتُهَا النَّفْسُ الْمُطمَئِنَّة اِرْجِعِيْ
إِلَى رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةً مَرْضِيَّة فَادْخُلِيْ فِيْ عِبَادِي
وَادْخُلِيْ جَنَّتِيْ إِنَّمَا يَعْنِي الْحُسَيْن بْنِ عَلِيّ
صَلَوَاتُ اللهِ عَلَيْهِمَا، فَهُوَ ذُوْ النَّفْسِ الْمُطمَئِنَّة
الرَّاضِِيَةِ الْمَرْضِيَّةِ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

Read *Surat al-Fajr* in your obligatory and supererogatory prayers, for
indeed it is the chapter of al-Husayn (AS), and have a liking to it, may
Allah have mercy on you. Thereupon Abu Usama, who was present in the
gathering asked him (AS): How did this *sura* become specifically for
al-Husayn (AS)? The Imam (AS) said: Do you not listen to Allah’s word “O
contented spirit (*ya ayyatuha al-nafs al-mutma’inna*), return to your
Lord, while you are pleased with Him, and He is pleased with you, and
enter the company of My servants, and enter My paradise”. It refers to
Imam al-Husayn bin ‘Ali (AS), for he is the contented spirit who is
pleased with his Lord and his Lord is pleased with him...[^35]

Al-Bahrani narrates a beautiful tradition from Imam Zayn al-’Abidin (AS)
which describes the situation of Imam al-Husayn (AS) and his brilliant
companions before their departure from this world when the situation
intensified as follows:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
...وَكَانَ الْحُسَيْنُ وَبَعْضُ مَنْ مَعَهُ مِنْ خَصَائِصِهِ تُشْرِقُ
أَلْوَانُهُمْ، وَتَهْدَأُ جَوَارِحُهُم، وَتَسْكُنُ نُفُوْسُهُمْ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

...while the situation of al-Husayn (AS) and some of those with him,
would be such that their colors would shine, the parts of their bodies
would be composed, and their spirits would be in the state of
serenity...[^36]

Having known the subtle meaning of *ibnu Amir al-mu’minin* as the
edifice of the possessor and bestower of tranquility, our aspiration
should be to uplift ourselves and realize the characteristics of a
tranquil soul.

‘Allama Majlisi in his *Bihar al-Anwar* narrates:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَنْ أَنَس بْن مَالِك قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُوْلُ اللهِ: اَلَّذِيْنَ
آمَنُوْا وَتَطمَئِنُّ قُلُوْبُهُمْ بِذِكْرِ اللهِ أَلاَ بِذِكْرِ اللهِ
تَطمَئِنَّ الْقُلُوْب: أَتَدْرِيْ مَنْ هُمْ يَا ابْنَ أُمّ سليم؟
قُلْتُ: مَنْ هُمْ يَا رَسُوْلَ اللهِ؟ قَالَ: نَحْنُ أَهْلُ الْبَيْتِ
وَشِيْعَتُنَا.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Anas bin Malik is reported to have said: The Messenger of Allah recited
***“And those who have faith and their hearts are tranquil by the
remembrance of Allah...”*** **(13:28)** and said: Do you know who they
are, O son of Umm Sulaym? I said: Who are they, O Messenger of Allah? He
(S) said: They are we and our Shi’a.[^37]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
...وَابْنَ سَيِّدِ الْوصِيِّيْنَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

...and the son of the **Leader of the Successors**

Here, as in the previous cases, اِبْن ‘ibn’ bears two different
messages: Imam al-Husayn (AS) is the son of *sayyid al-wasiyyin*, as
well as his spiritual product. And because he is the spiritual product
of the master of all the past successors of the prophets of Allah, he
likewise excels them and is embellished with the attributes of his
father. The word ‘*sayyid*’ literally means ‘leader’. Its correlatives
are the verbs *sada-yasudu* (he led, he is leading). That which makes
Imam ‘Ali (AS) to be *sayyid al-wasiyyin* is his capability to succeed
the Leader of the Apostles (*sayyid al-rusul*), who bore the most
comprehensive message of Allah, the Qur\`an, which is introduced as
*al-Muhaymin*. Consider the following verse of the Holy Qur\`an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ
يَدَيْهِ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَمُهَيْمِنًا عَلَيْهِ فَاحْكُم بَيْنَهُم
بِمَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَاءهُمْ عَمَّا جَاءكَ مِنَ
الْحَقِّ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

***We have sent down to you the Book with the truth, confirming what was
before it of the Book and as a guardian (muhayminan) over it. So judge
between them by what God has sent down, and do not follow their desires
against the truth that has come to you. (5:48)***

No Divine Messenger (*rasul*) or Successor (*wasi*) can bear the message
of the Holy Prophet (S) save Imam ‘Ali and his successors, for every
Prophet (S) enjoys the station of the Book that was revealed unto him.
Therefore because the Imams of the Ahl al-Bayt (AS) are the bearers of
the Qur\`an *(hamalat kitabilLah*) they excel the other prophets and
their successors and are rightly known as *sadat al-awsiya*’. Consider
the following narrations:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ: أَنَا سَيِّدُ النَّبِيِّينَ وَوَصِيِّي سَيِّدُ
الْوَصِيِّينَ وَأَوْصِيَاؤُهُ سَادَةُ الاَوْصِيَاء
  </p>
</blockquote>

The Apostle of Allah, upon whom and whose immaculate progeny be peace,
said: ‘I am the leader of the Prophets and **my successor is the leader
of all the successors, and his successors are the leaders of all the
successors**.[^38]

<blockquote dir="rtl">

وعَنِ ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ: أَنَا سَيِّدُ
الأَنْبِيَاءِ وَالْمُرْسَلِينَ وَأَفْضَلُ مِنَ الْمَلاَئِكَةِ

Ibn ‘Abbas is reported to have said: The Holy Prophet (S) said: ‘I am
the leader of the Prophets and Apostles, and better than the angels
nearmost to Allah, **and my successors are the the** **leaders of the
successors** of the other prophets and apostles, and my lineage is the
best of the lineages of the Prophets and Apostles of Allah.[^39]

And in the proximity of the radiant dome of Imam al-Husayn (AS), Imam
al-Sadiq (AS) tells his companion Safwan that all the Divine prophets
and their sucessors visit Imam al-Husayn (AS), including the Imam (AS)
himself. He (AS) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
...وَمُحَمَّدٌ اَفْضَلُ الاَنْبِيَاءِ وَنَحْنُ اَفْضَلُ
الاَوْصِيَاءِ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

...[including] Muhammad **the best of the Prophets and we, the best
successors**...[^40]

In the first volume of his well-known thematic exegesis of Qur\`an, the
grand Ayatullah Jawadi Amuli (may the Almighty protect his noble self)
says:

‘Inasmuch as the Noble Qur\`an is *muhaymin (supervisor and protector)*,
the Seal of the Apostles is also *muhaymin* over the prophets, for every
Apostle invites his community to the station of his book, and the
station of every prophet is the same as the station of his book, and the
station of the Messenger of Allah (AS) is the same as the station of the
Message that he brought.[^41]

And when trying to establish how Imam al-Husayn (AS) is the Leader of
martyrs, Ayatullah Jawadi Amuli in his *Shekufaieye ‘Aql* says:

Husayn (AS) is the leader and superior to all the martyrs of the
universe. And this station is due to his company with the reality of the
Holy Qur\`an which is a guardian over all other heavenly scriptures. In
other words:

1- The reality of the Prophet (S)’s progeny is at par with the Holy
Qur\`an.

2- The reality of Qur\`an, apart from verifying the previous books has a
supervisory role over them.

3- Every prophet is at par with the heavenly book given to him.

4- When the Progeny of the Holy Prophet (S) is equal to the noble
Qur\`an, they [obviously] are guardians over the great divine men of the
past.

This same evidence can be employed to prove that Imam al-Husayn (AS) is
among the leaders of all the sucessors of the previous prophets of Allah
(*sayyid al-wasiyyin*).

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
...وَابْنَ سَيِّدِ الْوصِيِّيْنَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

...and the son of the **Leader of the Successors**

The word *wasiyyin* is the plural of *wasi* and it literally means [the]
‘trustee’ to whom one entrusts his will (*wasiyya*). In the present
context, however, it refers to the Divine Trustee who is entrusted with
a Divine Will, which is to govern the Islamic state and rule according
to the Divine Laws. And Imam ‘Ali (AS) was entrusted with this Divine
Will before the demise of the Holy Prophet (S) on several occasions, the
fundamental of which was in *Ghadir Khumm*, where he (S) announced Imam
‘Ali (AS) as his successor and sought confirmation from others too.

Therefore, when we say that Imam al-Husayn (AS) is the edifice, product,
and inheritor of the Leader of the Divine successors and trustees, we
are also implying that he has inherited the qualities of such
successorship. And in rising against an illegal government that would
ruin and demolish the material and spiritual felicity of the believers,
he practically manifested his trustworthiness and successfully undertook
his mission of Divine leadership.
