description: |
  The book, although short, distills many volumes into its pages and is
  like the synopsis of a major commentary. It brings out the significance
  of the Qur’an for the life of Muslims, the features of the sacred Text
  which seems enigmatic, the inner and outer levels of meaning of the Text
  and the sciences of the Qur’anic exegesis. It also treats in a clear and
  direct manner the Shi’ite understanding of the Qur’an and the role of
  the Imams in its interpretation. It is a veritable prolegomenon to the
  study of the Sacred Book, and it is perhaps the most accessible
  introduction available in English to the study of the Qur’an as
  traditionally understood by the mainstream of Shi’ite thought, in fact
  Islamic exegetical thought in general.
