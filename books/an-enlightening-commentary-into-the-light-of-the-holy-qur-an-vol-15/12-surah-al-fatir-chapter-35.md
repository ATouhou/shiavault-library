***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

This Surah has been revealed at Mecca, and contains forty five verses.

‘Fatir’ is one of the attributes of Allah and it means ‘the Originator’.
The name of this Surah has been taken from the first verse of the Surah
in which Allah has been introduced as ‘the Originator of the heavens and
the earth’.

Like other Meccan Suras, the main axis of the discussion in this Surah
is about Origin, Resurrection, and struggle against polytheism.

The Virtue of the Surah
-----------------------

Imam Sadiq (as) in a tradition said:

*“There are two suras in the Qur’an which are one after another and they
begin with* ***/alhamd-u-lillah/ (the praise belongs (only) to Allah)**:
Surah As-Saba, and Surah Al-Fatir. Whoever recites them by night, Allah
will protect him in His support, and whoever recites them during the
day, there will come to him no affliction (on that day)…”*[^1]
