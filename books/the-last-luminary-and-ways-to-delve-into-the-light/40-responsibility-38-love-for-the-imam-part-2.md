Responsibility 38: Love For the Imam Part 2
===========================================

In addition to having love for the Imam, a true believer must also
encourage others to love him in essence, they must pull others towards
the Imam and towards love for him!

Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad as-Sadiq (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
رَحِمَ اللٌّهُ عَبْداً حَبَّبَنَا إِلـى النَّاسِ وَ لَمْ يُبَغِّضْنَا
إِلَيْهِمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“May Allah have mercy upon a servant who endears us to the people and
does not make them have hatred towards us (the Ahlul Bayt).” [^1]

In another tradition, Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad as-Sadiq has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
رَحِمَ اللٌّهُ عَبْداً إِجْتَرَّ مَوَدَّةَ النَّاسِ إِلَيْنَا
فَحَدَّثَهُمْ بِمَا يَعْرِفُونَ وَ تَرَكَ مَا يُنْكِرُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“May Allah have mercy upon that servant who encourages the people to
love us (the Ahlul Bayt) through speaking to them whatever (positive)
they know (about us), while refraining from mentioning that which they
do not find acceptable (about us).”[^2]
