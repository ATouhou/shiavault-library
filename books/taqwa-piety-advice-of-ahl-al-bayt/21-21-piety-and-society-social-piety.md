21) Piety And Society (Social Piety)
====================================

One of the other cases in which one must observe piety (Taqwa) is the
association with people, which is considered as social piety. If piety
is observed in the social relations, the world would turn into paradise,
for every man’s suffering, backwardness, misfortune, and wretchedness
are the result of not observing of piety.

If piety rules over a society, if the society is based on piety, and if
social relations are piety-based and if a society has the dress of
piety, that society will become firm and independent. But what is social
piety the observance of which is incumbent on people?

We have already said that piety, in relation to every topic, fits that
particular subject, though they have the same meaning, and that is the
refraining from disobeying the orders of God and the Prophet (a.s.).

In associating with other people, there are certain rules we should
observe. In Islam, in addition to the divine rights which are specially
related to God Himself and every Muslim has to observe like the
obedience to God, there are other rights towards others such as the
divine rights on man like the divine right on man’s tongue, ears, eyes,
hands, feet, and private parts, or the divine rights on man’s acts like
prayer, fasting, charity, or the divine rights towards the prophets,
imams, and other people. There is the treatise on rights attributed to
Imam Sajjad (AS) in which all the rights have been elaborated.
