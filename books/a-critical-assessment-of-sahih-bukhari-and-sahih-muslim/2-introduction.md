***In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful***

All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds and may prayer and
peace be upon our master and Prophet, Muhammad, and his pure progeny,
and may Allah’s curse be upon all their enemies from the first to the
last one.

Sunnis consider the two books of Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim as
correct from the beginning to the end, dealing with them like
revelation. They have based all their principle beliefs on the basis of
their content.

Sunni researchers refrain from considering as fabricated any tradition
that has appeared in these two books, for the position of these two
books is very high in their eyes.

The present work studies these two books and some of the traditions they
contain, in order to make it clear that all the traditions that these
two books contain are not authentic (Sahih) and that one cannot say that
the traditions that have not appeared in these two books are not
authentic.

I have, also, made other researches in this area, which are published
together with other works of mine. This work, however, includes those
researches.

Esteemed readers will find out that this research has cited only the
words of great Imamss and well-known memorizers (of traditions) of
Sunnis.

This research consists of two parts:

• A critical assessment of Sahih Bukhari

• A critical assessment of Sahih Muslim

I ask Allah, the Exalted to make this work a success, benefitting
readers as all success lies in His hand.
