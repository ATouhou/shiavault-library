[An Introduction]
=================

Moral and spiritual teachings constitute the greater part of the*Nahj
al-balaghah* making up almost half of the book. More than anything else
the fame of the*Nahj al-balaghah* is due to the sermons, exhortations,
and aphorisms on ethical and moral subjects.

Aside from the moral teachings of the Quran and a number of the sermons
and sayings of the Holy Prophet ('s), which are to be considered the
source and antecedent of the*Nahj al-balaghah* , the teachings of the
*Nahj al-balaghah* are without a match in the Arabic and Persian
languages. For more than a thousand years these sermons have played an
influential role serving as a matchless source of inspiration, and yet
retained their original power to quicken the heart, to sublimate
emotions, and to bring tears to the eyes. It seems that as long as there
remains any trace of humanity in the world, these sermons shall continue
to exercise their original power and influence
