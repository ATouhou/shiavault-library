Bahlool and a Book of Philosophy
================================

Bahlool went to the Mosque one day. Since that day was Eid, there were a
lot of people. Bahlool wanted to go sit in the upper room. He saw that
there were a lot of shoes, and since his shoes were stolen once, he was
scared that it might happen again. With this thought, he wrapped them up
in his handkerchief and hid them in his clothes. When he got to the
upper room, and had sat in a corner, a person sitting next to him saw a
bulging, wrapped handkerchief under Bahlool's shoulder, so asked about
it.

“I think that there is a valuable book under your shoulder. Can you tell
me which book it is?”

Bahlool said, “It is a book of philosophy.”

“Which bookseller did you buy it from?”

“I bought it from a cobbler.”
