Is the woman obliged to completely obey her husband according to the words and way of life of His Holiness Ali (P)?
===================================================================================================================

As referred to in the sacred verse:

<p dir="rtl">
وَقَضَىٰ رَبُّكَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ
إِحْسَانًا ..
</p>

***‘Your Lord has decreed that you should worship nothing except Him,
and [show] kindness to your parents.” (17:23)***

God considers kindness and humility towards parents equal to His
servitude. Or when He states:

<p dir="rtl">
…وَإِنْ جَاهَدَاكَ لِتُشْرِكَ بِي مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ فَلَا
تُطِعْهُمَا …
</p>

***“Yet if either of them should strive to make you associate anything
with Me which you have no knowledge about, do not obey them” (19:8)***

<p dir="rtl">
…لا تُطِعْهُمَا …
</p>

***“do not obey them.”***

Accordingly, similar to that is propounded on the obedience to the
husband as well. It is obvious that we should observe standards and
certainties to better understand the traditions in particular those,
which seem ambiguous or difficult to understand. A tradition may have a
message but we can perceive it well if we refer to the fundamentals and
certainties as our basis. Where Her Eminence Zahra (P) states:

<p dir="rtl">
و لاخالفتك عاشرتني
</p>

"During this period I have never disagreed with you.”

The word “disagreement” here refers to the matters of rights and
obligations, therefore, the boundaries should be observed. Many
objections to remarks of the Imams (P) are a result of a one-sided study
that is a verse or tradition is studied separately and with no
connection to other traditions or religious certainties.
