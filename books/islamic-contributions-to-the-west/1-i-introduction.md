I. Introduction
===============

In this talk I would like to give an idea about the cultural
contribution of the Islamic civilization to the West, the Islamic
origins of modern science and civilization and the ascendancy of the
Islamic science and learning for about 600 years in the world.

Therefore Iâ€™ll talk about the beginning of the Islamicization of the
West, of the Influence of Muslims on Western philosophy, rationalism,
experimental method, sciences, commerce, material life and arts of
gracious living.
