The Conjugation of The Verb With Its Pronouns
=============================================

32. What do you know about the conjugation of the verb with its
pronouns?

32. I understand that verbs are conjugated in the perfect, imperfect and
imperative tenses and are joined by personal pronouns in the single,
dual and plural forms. The verb is then conjugated into the nominative,
subjunctive and jussive cases.
