The Neglectful Slaves of this Deceitful World
=============================================

Imam Husayn (‘a) said: "Verily, people are the slaves of the world and
their religion is superficial, only on their tongues. They are attentive
to it as long as their material benefits are provided, but when they are
tested, the number of true devotees dwindles."
