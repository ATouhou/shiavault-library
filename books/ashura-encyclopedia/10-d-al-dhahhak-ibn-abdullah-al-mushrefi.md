D - Al-Dhahhak Ibn Abdullah Al-Mushrefi
=======================================

He was with Imam Husayn in Karbala. When he saw the great number of
people that had been killed in Imam Husayn's army, he came to the Imam
and asked permission to leave him. The Imam told him to go.

A group of â€˜Umar Ibn Sa'ad's army followed him but then let him escape
to wherever he was going to. Unfortunately, he missed his chance of
being amongst the martyrs of Karbala. It is said that he was among the
companions of Imam Ali Ibn Al Husayn.
