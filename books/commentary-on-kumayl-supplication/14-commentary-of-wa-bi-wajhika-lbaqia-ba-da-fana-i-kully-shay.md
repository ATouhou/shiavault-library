Commentary of: “Wa bi wajhika’lbaqia ba’da fana’i kully shay”
=============================================================

وَبِوَجْهِكَ الْبَاقِى بَعْدَ فَنَآءِ كُلِّ شَيٍْء

*(I ask You) by Your Face, which subsists after annihilation of all
things.*

Allah’s Holy Essence is the core of existence. His Existence is
Preexisting and Eternal. He has always existed without any counterpart,
and will always exist so. He has willed to create all things wisely,
while He is independent of all things. Everything will come to an end,
except He, Who will be forever.

Nothing in this world exists independently; the life of all beings is a
blowing of the Divine Soul, and therefore everything is doomed to
mortality. Mortality is an attribute of deficiency, while eternity is an
attribute of perfection. Hence the Absolute Perfection has Absolute
Eternity, and mortality is the attribute of all the beings and their
lives.
