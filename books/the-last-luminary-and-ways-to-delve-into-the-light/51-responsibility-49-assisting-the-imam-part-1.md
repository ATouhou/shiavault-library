Responsibility 49: Assisting the Imam Part 1
============================================

Another responsibility is to help the Imam as in essence, this is
equivalent to assisting Allah. The meaning of assisting Imam al-’Asr
(ajtf) is that a true believer must accept and follow whatever the Imam
himself has put into place and must struggle to bring the wishes of the
Imam into being.

Helping the Imam takes on various forms according to the time, place,
situation and events that one is surrounded in. However it must be noted
that helping the Imam during the period of occultation is different than
helping him during his advent.

Helping him during the occultation means that a true believer should
spiritually purify himself and observes awareness of Allah (taqwa). He
must not abandon dissimulation (taqiyyah) when it is required, and must
supplicate on behalf of the Imam and his Shi’a.

During the occultation, a believer must also mention the greatness and
qualities of the Imam, and convey the importance of helping the Imam to
his friends and Shi’a. One must also write and spread whatever knowledge
one has to help keep the religion alive. It goes without saying that
these are all to be done according to one’s ability.

As for helping the Imam during his advent, it includes things such as
struggling (jihad) on the side of the Imam; bearing difficulties with
patience, and giving up one’s life and property for the sake of the
Imam.
