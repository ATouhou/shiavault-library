Requesting Narration of Other Incidents
---------------------------------------

**Rabiâ€™ al-Awwal 23, 1330**

We seem to have elaborated on Usamah's regiment, just as we elaborated
on the Thursday calamity, till truth became distinct from falsehood, and
the rays of the dawn became visible to those who can see; so, now let us
hear about other incidents, Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*S*
