Dedication
==========

To the pioneer of wisdom and social justice in the earth,

To the thinking mind of humanity,

To the guardian of the Messenger of Allah (blessing and peace be upon
him), his companion and friend Ameerul Moâ€™mineen, peace be on him,

I offer, with all pride and faith, this humble work that I have had the
honor of studying the life of his grandson Imam Ali al-Hadi (peace be
upon him), the renovator of Islam, hoping it will be accepted to be a
supply to me on the day when I shall meet my Lord.
