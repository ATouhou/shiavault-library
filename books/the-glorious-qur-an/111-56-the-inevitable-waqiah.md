56: the Inevitable (waqiah)
===========================

This chapter was revealed after Ta-Ha 20 and before Believers 23 and
Poets 26. It forms the last of the seven early Meccan chapters to be
found in this present grouping. All of its 96 verses date from Mecca,
except for vv. 81-82 (in section III) which are from Madina.

An urgent message and strophic form underlies the chapter's rhythm. The
poetic vision here suggests that life is a race, and it speaks of future
rewards.

We meet three groups: first the Pioneers ", then Those on the Eight "
(I);and finally Those on the Left "(II). In the last section (III) the
Qur'an itself is discussed.
