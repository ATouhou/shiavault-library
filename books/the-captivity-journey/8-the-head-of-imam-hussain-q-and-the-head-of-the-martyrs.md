The Head of Imam Hussain (Q) and the Head of the Martyrs
========================================================

Indeed, the incident of carrying the head of the Prophet’s grandson (P)
and the rest of the pure heads is another crime of the many horrible
crimes that Karbala had witnessed. This crime had uncovered another veil
off the malicious intention of the Umayyad regime.

Thus Omar Bin Saad had sent off on that day, the Day of Ashura, the head
of Imam Hussain (Q) with Khewalli Bin Yazeed Al-Assbahi to Obayd Allah
Bin Ziad. Then he ordered the same for the rest of the martyrs’ heads,
except for the head of Al-Hurr Al Riyahi, due to his tribe objecting the
cutoff of his head, and he ordered Shamer Bin Zi Al-Jawshan to take it
along with Qeiss Bin Al-Ashaath and Amro Bin Al-Hajjaj.

So they kept going until they reached Bin Ziad.

Thus tribes like Kinda, Hawzan, Banu Tameem, and Banu Asad all competed
to carry the martyrs’ heads.
