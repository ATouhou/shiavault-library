Rule 199:

While in the state of ihram it is forbidden to hunt, hurt, injure or
kill a free animal, including domesticated animals, whether it is in the
Haram or outside and whether it is hunted for eating or not. It is
absolutely forbidden to hunt in the Haram even if the hunter is not in
the state of ihram.

Rule 200:

Just as it is forbidden for a pilgrim to hunt while in the state of
ihram, so is it forbidden to aid a hunter even by pointing at the
animal. In this regard there is no difference whether the hunter is a
pilgrim in ihram or not.

Rule 201:

It is not permissible for a pilgrim in the state of ihram to hold a
prey and keep it under control, even if he had hunted it before wearing
ihram or was hunted by someone else, whether inside or outside the
Haram.

Rule 202:

It is not permissible for a pilgrim in the state of ihram to eat the
meat of the prey even if the hunter was outside the Haram. It is
forbidden for a person who is not in the state of ihram to eat the meat
of a prey of a pilgrim in the state of ihram who killed it by hunting or
sacrificed it after hunting it. It is forbidden for a person who is not
in the state of ihram to eat the prey of a pilgrim who hunted in the
Haram in the state of ihram.

Rule 203:

The rules regarding the free animals also apply to their young ones. It
is apparent that it is forbidden for pilgrims in the state of ihram to
take, break or eat their eggs. As a matter of caution, he should not
even help others to do so.

Rule 204:

The rules stated above are for Free animals, including grasshoppers but
there is no objection to catching any of the inhabitants of the sea,
like fish. Those who live both on land and sea are regarded as free
animals but there is no objection in catching those in respect of whom
there is doubt as to whether they live on land or in the sea.

Rule 205:

As it is unlawful for a person in the state of ihram to hunt free
animals, so it is forbidden to kill any of the reptiles even though it
is not considered hunting. There are some exceptions:

(1) the domestic animals, like sheep, cow and camels and poultry
including turkey. So, it is permissible to kill these and the same rule
applies when there is a doubt as to whether an animal is a domestic one
or not;

(2) when a person in the state of ihram has a fear of his safety, for
example, from wild animals or snakes attacking him, it is permissible to
kill them;

(3) it is permissible to kill vultures if they are hunting the pigeons
in the Haram.

(4) it is permissible to kill vipers, other dangerous snakes, scorpions
and mice and there is no penalty for killing them.

Rule 206:

There is no objection in a pilgrim in ihram throwing an arrow at a crow
or kite and there is no penalty should any of them be killed by the
arrow.

PENALTIES FOR HUNTING

Rule 207:

For killing grazing livestock, the penalty is a camel; for killing a
wild cow it is a cow; for killing a wild donkey it is a donkey or a cow;
for killing a gazelle or a hare it is a sheep and the same, as a matter
of caution, is the penalty for killing a fox.

Rule 208:

If the penalty for the animal killed is a camel and it is not
available, then the obligation is to feed sixty poor people each of whom
should be given 750 grams of food and if it is not possible to do so,
then the penalty is fasting for eighteen days. If the penalty is a cow
and is not available, thirty poor people must be fed and if this is not
within means then the penalty is fasting for nine days. If the penalty
which has become obligatory is sheep and it is not available, ten poor
people must be fed and if this is not within means, then three fasts be
observed.

Rule 209:

For killing a sand grouse, partridge or francolin and their likes the
penalty is a lamb who has stopped taking its mother's milk and feeds on
grass. For killing a sparrow, lark and the like the generally accepted
penalty is feeding 750 grams of food. For killing other birds, the likes
of pigeons, the penalty is a sheep and the penalty for killing their
young ones, the penalty is a lamb or the young of a goat. If its egg is
broken the penalty is a dirham if there is no foetus, but otherwise, the
ruling is the same as that for the young ones of a bird and out of
caution the young lamb feeding on its own. For killing a grasshopper,
the penalty will be a date; if more than one was killed, the penalty
will be a handful of food and if many were killed, then it will be a

Rule 212:

If a person in the state of ihram hunts an animal outside the
boundaries of Haram, he must pay a penalty or the price of the animal
when there is no fixed penalty. However, if a person who is not in the
state of ihram hunts an animal inside the boundaries of Haram, he must
pay the price of the animal, except for hunting a lion when the penalty
is a sheep. If a person in the state of ihram hunts inside the
boundaries of Haram, he must pay both the penalty and the price.

Rule 213:

It is obligatory on a pilgrim in the state of ihram to avoid the path
on which there are grasshoppers but if that is not possible then there
is no objection if they get killed.

Rule 214:

If a group of pilgrims in ihram jointly kill an animal each of them
will be liable to the penalty.

Rule 215:

The penalty for eating the hunted animal is the same as for killing it.
Thus if the pilgrim in ihram hunts the animal and then eats it, he will
be liable to double penalty.

Rule 216:

If a person has with him the hunted animal and enters the Haram with
it, he must immediately free the prey and if he does not do so and the
animal dies, he becomes liable to the penalty. The same is the rule if
the hunting took place before ihram but the animal died after ihram and
as a matter of caution the penalty must be satisfied even if he did not
enter the Haram with it.

Rule 217:

The penalty for hunting an animal and eating its meat applies whether
the act was done deliberately or in error or out of ignorance.

Rule 218:

If the hunting is repeated, so is the penalty, whether the hunting was
out of ignorance, by oversight or deliberate. The same rule applies to
the hunting in the Haram by a native or a pilgrim in the state of ihram.
However, if a pilgrim in ihram hunts repeatedly during the same state of
ihram, he will meet the penalty once.

2.Sexual intercourse:

Rule 219:

Sexual intercourse is forbidden for a pilgrim in ihram for an
Umrat-ul-Tamatoo or Umrat- ul-Mufradah or during Hajj and even after
performing them but before reciting the prayers (salaat) for the Tawaf
ul-Nisa.

Rule 220: If during an Umrat-ul-Tamatoo a pilgrim intentionally has
sexual intercourse, whether vaginal or anal, then if he does so after
performing saee, the Umrah is not invalidated but there is an obligatory
penalty upon him which, as a matter of caution, should be a young camel
or a cow. If the intercourse takes place before saee is completed, the
penalty will be as stated above. As a matter of caution, he must
complete his Umrah and the pilgrimage after it and repeat both of them
in the ensuing year.

Rule 221:

If a pilgrim in the state of ihram for Hajj deliberately has sexual
intercourse with his wife, whether vaginal or anal, before the stay at
Muzdalifah his Hajj is invalidated and if the lady is also in ihram and
indulged knowingly and voluntarily, her Hajj is also invalidated. There
is a penalty on each of them and they are also obliged to complete the
remaining ceremonies and repeat the Hajj in the following year, whether
the pilgrimage was obligatory or optional. However, if the lady was
compelled into the act, her Hajj is not invalidated, there will be no
penalty on her but the husband who compelled her will be obliged to pay
double penalty. The penalty for the intercourse is a camel but if one
cannot afford it, the penalty is a sheep and it is mandatory that the
husband and wife live separately during the remainder of the pilgrimage,
that is, they should not meet except in the presence of a third person
until they complete all the ceremonies of the pilgrimage, including the
ceremonies at Mina and return to the point where the intercourse took
place and, unless accompanied by a third person, also during the
repetition of the Hajj in the following year until they reach the place
where the intercourse took place in the preceding year.

Rule 222:

If a person in ihram has sexual intercourse with his wife deliberately
after the stay at Muzdalifah but before completing the fourth round of
Tawaf ul-Nisa, then the penalty above stated is obligatory on him but
his pilgrimage is not invalidated.

Rule 223:

If a person has sexual intercourse with his wife deliberately during
the Umrat-ul-Mufradah, he is liable to the above stated penalty but his
Umrah is valid if the intercourse took place after saee, otherwise the
Umrah is invalidated as well. It is then mandatory on him to remain in
Makkah for another month, then depart to one of the meeqaats and wear
ihram again for the repetition of the Umrah. It is not sufficient to
wear ihram from the nearest border to Hill. As a matter of caution, he
must also complete the invalidated Umrah.

Rule 224:

If a pilgrim relieved from his ihram performs a sexual intercourse with
his wife who is still in ihram, she becomes liable to a penalty; the
price for it must be borne by the husband and the penalty is a camel.

Rule 225:

If a pilgrim in the state of ihram has sexual intercourse with his wife
out of ignorance or oversight, his Umrah and Hajj are valid and there is
no penalty on him. This rule applies also in respect of all the other
prohibitions which attract penalties. That is to say that an act of a
pilgrim in ihram will not attract a penalty if it was performed out of
ignorance or by oversight, except in the following cases:

(1) if he forgets a tawaaf in Hajj or umrah till he returns to his
country and has intercourse with his wife;
(2) if he forgets some portion of the saee in the Umrat-ul-Tamatoo and
has intercourse with his wife considering himself relieved;
(3) if he needlessly keeps his hand on his head or beard and a hair or
two drop off;

Rule 229:

liable for a goat. If he looks at her without passion and he ejaculates,
he is liable to a penalty of a camel. If, however, he looks at her, even

If a pilgrim in ihram unlawfully looks at a lady who is a stranger to

applies to him. If this happens before the stay at Muzdalifah, his Hajj
is invalidated and it is obligatory on him to complete the ceremonies
and repeat the pilgrimage in the following year. If this act occurs in
the Umrat-ul-Mufradah before completing saee, his Umrah is invalidated
and he is obliged to complete it and repeat it as stated above. The
penalty for it is the same as for intercourse. If, however, there is

(1) Application of black collyrium for beautification is totally
forbidden, except if used for treatment.

is forbidden for men in the state of ihram if the shade is above the
head. However, it is allowed to remain under the shade of a moving cloud
or if the shade falls on one side only, that is, pedestrians can walk
beside a car producing a shade on one side or the like. As a matter of
caution, riders must avoid shade unless the shade from objects producing
shade from both sides is so short that it does not cover the head and
chest of the pilgrim.

trees, mountains, etc. Being under such shade is allowed for a pilgrim
in the state of ihram and whether he is riding or on foot. There is no

is protected against wind.

Rule 269:

Once the pilgrim in the state of ihram arrives in Makkah, there is no
objection to his moving under shade even if he has not yet organized
accommodation, just as there is no objection during the journey to
remain under shade of a house in which the pilgrim is resting.
Similarly, if the pilgrim stops at the house of a friend or any other
person, it is apparent that he is permitted to be under shade. The
question still remains as to whether her he is permitted to be under the
shade of a moving object, like an umbrella, when, for example, he has
arrived in Makkah and wishes to proceed to the Holy Mosque for tawaaf
and saee or when in Mina wishes to proceed to the place of sacrifice. It
is difficult to answer these questions affirmatively, so, as a matter of
caution, one should avoid doing so.

of necessity or fear of heat or cold.

another, the penalty is two sheep.

Rule 273:

If a person in the state of ihram cuts his nails by following a ruling
that it is permissible to do so and in the process blood oozes out, the
penalty for the act, as a matter of caution, must be paid by the person
who gave the ruling.

24: Extraction of tooth:

Rule 274:

Scholars are unanimous in the view that extraction of tooth by a person
in the state of ihram is forbidden even if no blood comes out in the
process and the penalty for the act is a sheep. Although there is doubt
in the reasoning for this view, it is not far from being the correct
view.

25: Wearing of Arms:

Rule 275:

It is forbidden for a person in the state of ihram to wear arms, like
sword, gun and the like which would generally be regarded as arms. Items
of protection, like an armour etc., are excluded from this rule.

Rule 276:

There is no objection if the arms are in the luggage and are not
connected to the body although, as a matter of caution, it is better to
avoid having them altogether.

Rule 277:

Carrying of arms is forbidden only in ordinary conditions but if there
is necessity to carry them, for example, when there is fear of enemies
or thieves, then there is no objection in doing so.

Rule 278:

As a matter of caution, the penalty for carrying arms without necessity
is a sheep.

MATTERS FORBIDDEN WITHIN THE HARAM

Matters forbidden for the pilgrim in the state of ihram have now been
covered and we proceed to deal with the matters forbidden to the pilgrim
and the native:

First: Hunting in the Haram is forbidden to the pilgrim and the native
as stated before. Second: Uprooting grass or cutting down trees in the
Haram is forbidden. However, there is no objection if grass gets
uprooted in the course of ordinary walk or letting animals feed on the
grass but it is better to avoid cutting grass to feed them. There are
some exceptions to the rule:

(1) Edhkher' which is a well known herb;
(2) Date palm and fruit trees;
(3) Grass or trees planted by an individual;
(4) Trees or grass growing on the premises of an individual after the
purchase of the property or settling in it except that the trees that
were there at the time of the purchase of the property do not fall
within the exception.

Rule 279:

If the roots of a tree are in the area of the Haram but its branches
fall outside it or vice versa, it will be governed as though it were
wholly within the area of the Haram.

Rule 280:

The penalty for cutting down a tree is its value and the penalty for
cutting a portion of it is the value of the portion cut off but there is
no penalty for cutting grass.

Third: It is not permissible to impose the religious punishment upon a
person who guilty of an act committed outside the Haram has taken refuge
inside the Haram. However, people should refrain from feeding such a
person or communicating with him till he has no option but to leave the
Haram and submit to the punishment.

Fourth: It is highly discouraged to pick lost property within the Haram
but if a person has picked it and finds no sign to recognise its owner,
he may keep it for himself. As a matter of caution, however, it is
recommended that he should give it in charity on behalf of its owner. If
its price is more than one dirham (3.456 gms of silver) he should
announce for one year that he has found it and if the owner does not
claim it, then he must give it in charity on behalf of the owner.

BOUNDARIES OF HARAM

The boundaries of Haram are known and have ben handed down from
generation to generation. From the north is Tan'eem, north-west is
Al-Hudaibiyyah, that is, Shamisi, north-east is Thaniyyatu Jabalal
Maqtai, east is Batan Namirah, south-east is Ja'ranah and from
south-west is Idhaatul Laban. The boundaries of Madinah are the
mountains of Aaer and Waeer and the valleys of Waaqim and Laili.
Although it is not obligatory to wear ihram from Madinah, it is not
permissible to cut the trees, especially the green ones, and, as a
matter of caution, hunting is not permitted at all.

PLACE OF SACRIFICE

Rule 281:

If the penalty is for hunting in the course of an Umrat-ul-Mufradah in
the state of ihram, the animal must be sacrificed in Makkah but if it
was in the course of Hajj then the animal must be sacrificed in Mina. As
a matter of caution the same roll applies to any other penalty.

Rule 282:

If the penalty has become due on a pilgrim in the state of ihram for
hunting or otherwise but has not been fulfilled until after completion
of the pilgrimage and arrival at home, he has the option where to
sacrifice the animal.

DISBURSEMENT OF THE SACRIFICE

All penalties which were incurred by a pilgrim must be handed to the
poor and needy. As a matter of caution he must refrain from eating it,
and if he did so, he must pay its price to the poor.

TAWAAF

In Umrat-ul-Tamatoo, the second obligation is tawaaf and its deliberate
non-performance invalidates the Hajj, whether or not he was aware of the
rule or the subject. To delay its performance till the time when it
would no longer be possible to perform it as it would be time for the
stay in Arafah, then the Umrah will be invalid and it is apparent that
the ihram will also be invalidated. Reverting to Hajj-ul-Ifraad is not
sufficient even though one should do so as a matter of caution and in
both situations, it is obligatory on him to repeat the Hajj in the
following year.
