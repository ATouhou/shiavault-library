Lesson Eighteen: Envy
=====================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"الحاسِدُ مُضِرُّ بِنَفْسِهِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُضُرّ بِالْمَحْسُودِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

An envious person sustains a loss to himself before causing a loss to
the one he envies.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The spirit of envy refers to not tolerating others enjoying a blessing,
and trying to deprive them from that blessing, or causing a loss to them
in other ways.

An envious person’s tendency is to act as a destructive force , seeking
failure of others, rather than a constructive force that seeks one’s own
improvement and success.

Envy is a severe moral disease . Psychologists assert that feelings of
resentment and jealousy harbored by the envious persons play havoc with
their emotional and physical health and their actions bring suffering
and humiliation only to themselves. It is far better to concentrate on
one’s own success as opposed to trying to hold others back .
