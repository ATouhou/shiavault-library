Dedication
==========

I dedicate this work to the pioneers of recording the Hadith from the
past generations, and to those who follow their steps in principles,
course and belief, and to men of the Shariahâ€”students, teachers and
researchers, and to everyone who looks for the fact after releasing from
the chains of blind imitation and inactivity, and to every owner of
boundless intellect, sound nature, and genuine thinking.
