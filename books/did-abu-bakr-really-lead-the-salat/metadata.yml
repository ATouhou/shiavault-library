description: |
  In this book, the author is thoroughly investigating the Sunni reports
  on the alleged leadership of salat by Abu Bakr during the fatal illness
  of the Messenger. He will be analyzing the bewildering contradictions
  between the so-called “sahih” Sunni ahadith on the claim; and he will be
  questioning the historicity of the whole episode. In particular, he will
  be examining the correct implications of leadership in salat, according
  to orthodox Sunni Islam. Does it indicate superiority? Does it confer
  the khilafah? Do our brothers from the Ahl al-Sunnah really have any
  case, even if the tale about Abu Bakr had been true?
