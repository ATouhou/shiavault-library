The Chapter on I‘RĀB[17]
========================

**I‘rāb** [^18] is a change affecting the endings of words[^19] due to
the difference in the ‘Awāmil[^20] that enter and operate on them,
(whether the change is) Lafđan (real and explicit, such that it can be
verbally expressed) or Taqdīran[^21] (hypothetical and implicit, such
that it cannot be verbally expressed but is instead assumed in the
mind).

**Its types are four: Raf‘, Naṣb, Khafḍ and Jazm.**

Of this, Raf‘, Naṣb and Khafḍ apply to the Asmā’ (nouns) while Jazm does
not feature in them at all.

Of this, Raf‘, Naṣb and Jazm apply to the Af‘āl (verbs) while Khafḍ does
not feature in them at all.
