A - Atiyya
==========

He is always mentioned along with Jabir Ibn Abdullahh, a companion of
the Prophet (pbuh&hf). They were the first to visit Imam Husayn's burial
place forty days after his martyrdom. Because Jabir Ibn Abdullahh
Al-Ansari was blind, Atiyya guided him to the grave.

It is said that Ahlul Bayt saw them when coming back from Al Sham.
Atiyya Ibn Saad Ibn Junada was among the best Shia in science and
speech. He was born in Kufa during the reign of Imam Ali and it was he
who named him Atiyya.

In the days of the tyrant Al-Hajjaj, an order was placed to capture him,
as was the cause with all the followers of the Prophet's household.

Finally he was caught in Persia and was told to cuss Imam Ali, but he
refused to. Al-Hajjaj then ordered to whip him 400 times and beat his
beard and head. He died in 111 AH in Al-Kufa.
