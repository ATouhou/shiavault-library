Epilogue
========

This is the concluding book of the series entitled, ***The Role of the
Ahl al-Bayt (‘a) in Building a Virtuous Community***.

I pray to Almighty Allah to accept this meager effort out of His vast
generosity, to forgive all my faults and failings, and accept it as
purely dedicated to Him out of His favor, grace, and magnanimity.

I also pray to Him to make this work acceptable to my masters, the
Household of Divine infallibility and immaculacy—the Holy Prophet and
the immaculate and pure Members of his Household, especially the master
and leader of our time, Imam al-Mahdi (peace be upon them all).

My success in my task can only come from Allah. In Him I trust and unto
Him I look. All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. All
blessings be upon our master, Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and pure
Household.

*Our Lord! Condemn us not if we forget or fall into error.*

*Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that*

*which You did lay on those before us.*

*Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden greater*

*than we have strength to bear.*

*Blot out our sins and grant us forgiveness.*

*Have mercy on us. You are our Protector.*

*Help us against those who stand against faith.*
