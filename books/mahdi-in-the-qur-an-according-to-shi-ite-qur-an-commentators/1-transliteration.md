Transliteration
===============

The system I have used in this study for the transliteration of Arabic
and Persian words into English conforms with that indicated in the
*Encyclopaedia of Islam,* except for the diacritical dots and long marks
(h, s, d, t, z, ā, ū, ī ) that I have omitted.  
  

Dates
-----

The date formulae used throughout this study, as well as in
bibliographical references, are the following:

- Islamic lunar year AH (After Hijra) and Gregorian year, e.g. 468 AH /
1075 AD

- Iranian solar year designated by the abbreviation Sh (for Shamsi) and
Gregorian year, e.g. 1256 Sh / 1877 AD
