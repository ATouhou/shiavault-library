Question 75: Blood Transfusion
==============================

**Question:** Nowadays in all hospitals, blood transfusion is given to
many patients who are anemic or are undergoing operation. And it is
possible that the blood of a stranger man is transfused into a lady who
is na mehram or vice versa. Is it allowed in Islamic Law?

**Answer:** Since there is no proof for prohibition regarding this act
according to the rules of Islamic Jurisprudence, there is no harm in it.
Even then it is better if man is transfused with the blood of man and
woman with the blood of a woman. But if this is not possible, as
mentioned above, it is not haraam.
