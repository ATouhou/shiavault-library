Story no. 18: Jameela and her apology from her mother
=====================================================

Mrs. Siddiqa asked her daughter to bring a glass of water for her.  
 Her daughter, Jameela shouted “Oh goodness! You’ve made me fed up and
tired with all these ‘instructions’ of yours!”.  
 Unexpectedly her brother, Sa’eed spoke.  
 “Jameela, don’t you know that children have no right to shout at
parents? God has said in the Qur’an “Children don’t have the right even
to say ‘Uf’ to parents”.  
 Jameela understood her mistake and apologized.  
 She said “Sorry mother, I acted in an ill-mannered way”.
