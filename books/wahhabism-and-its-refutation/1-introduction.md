[Introduction]
==============

The Wahhabis are one of the groups who name themselves as Moslems while,
in fact, they strive to demolish Islam.

Ayyub Sabri Pasha [d. 1308 (1890)], Rear Admiral in the time of the
thirty-fourth Ottoman sultan 'Abd al-Hamid Khan II [1258-1336
(1842-1918), buried in the shrine of Sultan Mahmud, in Istanbul], wrote
a history book in which he told about Wahhabism in full detail.
(Mir'atal-Haramain, pp. 99 vol. III; five volumes in Turkish, Matba'a-i
Bahriye, Istanbul, 1301-1306.)
