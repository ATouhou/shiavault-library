11) Cause your heart to perceive the calamities of this world
=============================================================

وبَصّره فجايع الدنيا""

Man selects a shelter for living which is safe from hazards and where
the hardships will not threaten him; or else it is foolish to dwell in a
place where you are not safe.

Some, however, are involved in the life here and have forgotten the
statements of Imam ‘Ali (as) who has said: "This world is a house
engulfed in disasters; it is famous for its deceits; it is changing all
the time; it is not a safe place to dwell in; security is inconceivable
in it. Its dwellers are always a target for its arrows of misfortune.

Thus, my son! Always remember the disasters of this world so that you
will not live there negligently and wrongly assume that it is eternal!!
