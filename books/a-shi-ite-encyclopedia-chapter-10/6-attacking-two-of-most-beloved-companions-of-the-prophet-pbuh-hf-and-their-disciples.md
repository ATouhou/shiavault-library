Attacking Two of Most Beloved Companions of the Prophet (pbuh&hf) and Their Disciples
=====================================================================================

Sayf alleged that Ibn Saba is the one who instigated the two prominent
companions of the Prophet Muhammad, namely Abu Dhar (RA) and Ammar Ibn
Yasir (RA), against Uthman. He said this Jew met Abu Dhar in Damascus,
and that he introduced to him the idea of prohibiting treasuring gold
and silver. Sayf included the following great companions of prophet and
their disciples, among the list of the followers of Ibn Saba:

(1) Abu Dhar (RA),
(2) Ammar Ibn Yasir (RA),
(3) Muhammad Ibn Abi Bakr (RA), son of the first Caliph,
(4) Malik Ashtar (RA).

... and more

To better understand the heresy of Sayf and his allegation, let us
quickly review the biography of the above great Muslim pioneers:

(1) Abu Dhar al-Ghafari (Jundub Ibn Jonadah): He is the THIRD person in
the list of the four pioneers who first embraced Islam. He was a
monotheist even before his conversion. He frankly declared his faith in
Islam at Mecca beside the Holy House of God. The infidels of Mecca beat
him almost to death but he survived, and on the instruction of the
Prophet Muhammad (PBUH&HF) he returned to his tribe.

After the Battles of Badr and Uhud he came to Medina and stayed with
Prophet until the demise of the Prophet (PBUH&HF). During the reign of
the early Caliphs, Abu Dhar was sent to Damascus where he could not
agree with Muawiyah. Later Muawiyah complained about Abu Dhar to Uthman,
the third Caliph, and thus Uthman sent Abu Dhar into exile at Rabadha
where he later died. Rabadha was known for having the worst climate.

(2) Ammar Ibn Yasir: He was also known as Abuyaqzan. His mother's name
was Somayyah. He and his parents were pioneers in embracing Islam, and
he was the SEVENTH person to declare his faith. His parents were
executed after the torture by the infidels of Mecca, because of their
conversion to Islam, but Ammar managed to escape to Medina.

Ammar fought on Imam Ali's side in the battle of Jamal (Camel) and
later in the war of Siffin where he was killed in the battle field by
Muawiyah soldiers, at the age of ninety-three.

(3) Muhammad Ibn Abi Bakr: He was adopted by Imam Ali after his father,
Abu Bakr, died. Muhammad was one of the commanders of the army of Imam
Ali (AS) in the battle of Camel. He was also in the battle of Siffin.
Imam Ali appointed him as the governor of Egypt, and he took his office
15/9/37 AH.

Later, Muawiyah sent an army under the leadership of Amr Ibn al-Aas to
Egypt in the year 38 AH, who fought and captured Muhammad, and then
killed him. His body was placed in a belly of a dead donkey and then was
brutally burnt. (See al-Istiab, v1, p235; History of al-Tabari, v4, p79;
Ibn Kathir, v3, p180; Ibn Khaldoon, v2, p182)

(4) Malik Ashtar al-Nakha'i: He met the Prophet and was one of the
trustworthy disciple of companions (Tabe'in). He was chief of his tribe,
and after receiving an injury to one of his eyes in the battle of
Yarmuk, he became known as Ashtar.

He was the general of the army of Imam Ali in the battle of Siffin and
known for his bravery and combating the enemies of Islam. At the age of
38, he was appointed by Imam Ali as the governor of Egypt. But on his
way to Egypt, near the Red Sea, he died after eating poisonous honey
which had been planned by Muawiyah.

The above were the short bibliographies of some eminent Muslim
pioneers. It is regrettable that some historians who reported from
Sayf's heresy, allege that they followed a mysterious Jew. The mercenary
workers did not even hesitate to attack such outstanding companions.

They said that Abu Dhar and Ammar Ibn Yasir met Ibn Saba, were affected
by his propaganda, and thus turned against Uthman. However, we should
not forget that by their attacking those two prominent companions, they
are actually attacking the Messenger of God who attested to their purity
and righteousness frequently:

The Messenger of God said: "Certainly Allah commanded me to love four
persons and informed me that He loves them." The companions asked: "O'
Messenger of God, who are those four persons?" The Prophet (PBUH&HF)
said: "Ali is from them (repeating that three times), Abu Dhar, Salman
al-Farsi, and Miqdad."

The Messenger of Allah also said:

"Every prophet was given by God seven righteous companions. I was given
fourteen righteous companions". He included in them Ali, al- Hasan,
al-Husain, Hamza, Ja'far, Ammar Ibn Yasir, Abu Dhar, Miqdad, and
Salman.

Also al-Tirmidhi, Ahmad, al-Hakim and many others narrated that the
Messenger of Allah said:

"Heaven has not shaded, nor has the earth carried a person more
straight forward than Abu Dhar. He walks on earth with the
immaterialistic attitude of Jesus, the son of Mary."

Ibn Majah, in his authentic Sunan, narrated that Imam Ali said:

I was sitting in the house of the Prophet and Ammar asked to see him.
Then Prophet said: "Welcome the good and the purified." Ibn Majah also
narrated that Aisha narrated that the Messenger of God said "Whenever
Ammar is given two alternatives, he always chooses the most righteous of
the two."

There are much more authentic narrations told by the Prophet (PBUH&HF)
about Ammar, such as "Ammar is full of faith." Also Prophet said:

"A band of rebels will kill Ammar."

**Sunni references:**

- Sahih Muslim, English version, Chapter \# MCCV, pp 1508-1509,
Trditions \#6966-6970 (five traditions).

- al-Mustadrak, by al-Hakim, v3, p383

Now to see who those rebels were, look at Musnad Ahmad and Tabaqat Ibn
Sa'd who narrated:

"In the Battle of Siffin, when the head of Ammar Yasir (RA) was cut off
and taken to Muawiyah, two people were arguing over it, each one claimed
that he had killed Ammar."

**Sunni references:**

- Musnad Ahmad (Pub. in Dar al-Maarif, Egypt 1952), Tradition \#6538,
\#6929 - Tabaqat, by Ibn Sa'd, v3, p253

Also it is narrated that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HF) said:

"Paradise longs for three men, Ali, Ammar and Salman."

Sunni reference: Sahih al-Tirmidhi, v5, p332, Tradition \#3884

Moreover al-Tirmidhi narrated:

When the Messenger of God heard that Ammar and his parents were
tortured in Mecca, he (PBUH&HF) said: "Members of Yasir's family, be
patient. Your destination is paradise."

Sunni Reference: Sahih al-Tirmidhi, v5, p233, Thus, Ammar and his
parents were the first people declared by the Prophet to be dwellers of
paradise.

Here we should say: When a Muslim knows that the Prophet has commended
these two important companions (Abu Dhar & Ammar Ibn Yasir) so highly,
and if he is a believer in the truthfulness of Muhammad, he does not
allow himself to insult these two companions.

Such an insult discredits the Prophet. As we just saw, the above
authentic traditions in the six Sunni collections claim that Prophet
said he has only four or fourteen righteous companions, out of his 1400
companions. Interestingly enough that Abu Dhar and Ammar Ibn Yasir were
mentioned among those very few individuals.

We find that the hostility of Sayf Ibn Umar al-Tamimi, who lived during
the second century after the Prophet, and the hostility of his students
towards the Shi'ites, motivated them to spread such cheap propaganda.
Sayf knew that attributing the revolt against Uthman to the work of Ibn
Saba contradicts known historical facts which show that the two
companions, Abu Dhar and Ammar, were opposed to Uthman's ever coming to
power.

Because Sayf knew of their opposition to Uthman, he tried to smear
their reputations by adding the names of the two prominent companions to
the list of students of that fictitious Jew.

If Ibn Saba ever existed, he had declared his Islam after Uthman was
killed. Now let us suppose we accept what Sayf alleged concerning that
Abdullah Ibn Saba declared his faith after Uthman came to power. Abu
Dhar and Ammar Ibn Yasir, on the other hand, had been opposed to
Uthman's caliphate before he came to power.

The two companions were followers of the Imam Ali (AS), and they firmly
believed that Ali was appointed by the Prophet to be his successor.
Since this was their belief before the appearance of Ibn Saba, the story
of Sayf about their being influenced by Ibn Saba, is unfounded and
untrue.

Thus, in order to clear the third caliph from all accusations
pertaining to his ill-management of the Islamic treasury, Sayf accused
the revolters being the students of Ibn Saba. He then completed his
story by adding the two companions to the class of Ibn Saba's students,
intentionally overlooking the fact that the two companions belong to the
first successful class of the school of the Prophet Muhammad
(PBUH&HF).

They were among the important companions who were honored by the
Prophet. In fact, Sayf was led by his untrue story to reject the
testimony of the Prophet. By this, Sayf had disproved his whole tale.
