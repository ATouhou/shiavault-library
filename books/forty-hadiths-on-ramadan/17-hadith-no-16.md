Fasts of the Month of Ramadan
-----------------------------

The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said: The month of
Ramadan is the month in which Allah, The Mighty, The Glorious, has made
fasting obligatory upon you. So one, who fasts in this month in a state
of belief and with the intention of recompense, shall become free of his
sins just as he was on the day when his mother gave him birth.*Tahdheeb
al-Ahkam, vol. 4, pg. 152*
