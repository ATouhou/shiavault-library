65. Pleasure of the Almighty Allah
==================================

This *Dua* is a cause of divine pleasure and satisfaction, because when
the believer prays for his Imam, he makes his Imam happy, and the
happiness of Imam is cause of gladdening Allah and His Messenger. Thus
it is mentioned in *Usool Kafi* through authentic chain of narrators
from Abu Hamza Thumali that he said: I heard His Eminence, Abu Ja’far
Baqir (as) say:

The Messenger of Allah (S) said: “One who makes a believer happy, makes
me happy and one who makes me happy, makes Allah happy.”[^1]
