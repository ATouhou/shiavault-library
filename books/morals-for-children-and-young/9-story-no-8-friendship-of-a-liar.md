Story no. 8: Friendship of a liar
=================================

Zeenat and Izzat were playmates.  
 One day when Zeenat said to Izzat come and play……  
 Izzat replied “I won’t play with you anymore”.  
 Zeenat asked “why?”  
 Izzat replied “because you lied to me yesterday. If I play with you
I’ll become a liar like you myself.”

Yes, lying is a big sin. We should not lie and also keep away from those
who lie. The leaders of Islam have advised us not to say lies even if it
is in a joke.
