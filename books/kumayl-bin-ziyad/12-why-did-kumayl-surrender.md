Why did Kumayl surrender?
=========================

Kumayl believed in Allah and the hereafter. He loved all people. He
loved his family and his tribe.

Al-Hajjaj mistreated Kumayl's family and tribe. So, Kumayl surrendered
to save them from persecution.

*Kumayl remembered Imam Ali's words:*

*Kumayl, order your family to do good. Order them to help people at
night.*
