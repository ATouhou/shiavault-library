Third: Rule
===========

The Prophet as reinforced by himself at Ghadeer al-Khum, had the
position of wilayah, that is, the authority to rule and the people
needed to obey him. The Prophet asked the crowd:

*”Do I not have a greater right on your souls than you yourselves have
on them?”*

They answered with one voice:

*”The Apostle of God has a greater right on our souls than we ourselves
have on them”.*

The Prophet has more authority on the believers than what they have on
themselves. Why? This is because God has this authority and has given it
to the Holy Prophet.
