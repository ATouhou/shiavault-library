Leader

To them (the Household of the Prophet)

pertain the noblest of human virtues

described in the Qur'an,

and they are the treasures of the

Beneficent Allah.

When they speak, they speak the truth,

but when they keep quiet,

no one can out strip them.

The **leader** should speak truthfully to his people,

and put all his intelligence to work.

He should be one of those who work for

the next world,

because he has come from there

and would return to it.

(Sermon 154)
