Lesson Eighty Five: A Good Deed Is Never Small
==============================================

Imam As-Sajjad (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لاَ يَقِلُّ عَمَلٌ مَعَ تَقَوى وَ كَيْفَ يَقِلَّ ما يُتَقَبَّلُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

A deed accompanied with sincerity and piety is not small, although it
may look small. How is it possible for a deed favored by God to be
small!?[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The Holy Qur’an says: God only accepts the deeds which are accompanied
with piety and pure intention. Thus, purity in intention and sincerity
and piety should be the most important consideration . Such deeds are
valuable even if in material terms the quantity etc is small , because
they are favored by God and thus can never be considered little. In
summary, hollow, impure and hypocritical deeds are worthless no matter
how numerous and large they are, whereas even something light and little
performed with pure and sincere intention is worthy and weighty.
