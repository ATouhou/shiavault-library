Love Not an Instrument of Convenience
=====================================

Because the child needs the love and affection of the parents, some
parents make use of this urge of the children for their own ends. They
ask the child to do a certain thing that the mom would love him and ask
him not to do certain things or otherwise mom would not love him. No
doubt, a certain degree of control can be exercised on the childs action
in this manner. . But continuing with this strategy for long can be
detrimental. The child will get into the habit of doing things only to
please the parents and not for any benefit for him and the society at
large. He starts deciding the reason for doing any work with the sole
purpose of pleasing someone. He doesnt get the realization that his
actions have to be tuned to the welfare of the society and the humanity
in general There are lots of parents who value personal benefit more
than the good of the society. Their children become flunkies,
flatterers, hypocrites and impostors because their purpose in life
becomes pleasing others at any cost. Therefore, a clever and thoughtful
mentor wouldnt use the love and affection of the child for selfish ends.
