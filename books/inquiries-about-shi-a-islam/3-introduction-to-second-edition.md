Introduction to Second Edition
==============================

Since the first edition of *Inquiries about Shia Islam* was published in
the summer of 1999, four-thousand English copies have been distributed
and sold to Muslims and non-Muslims in the United States of America and
abroad. The book was also published in various languages.

The need still exists for a better understanding about the traditions
and followers of the Ahlul Bayt, and thus a revised second edition of
the book was made. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Sister
Fatma Saleh for her generous contributions in editing and revising this
edition.

Special thanks are also due to the Khaki family of Seattle, Washington
for making this book come to print. May Allah, the most Merciful, the
most Compassionate reward all those who work sincerely to serve His
cause.
