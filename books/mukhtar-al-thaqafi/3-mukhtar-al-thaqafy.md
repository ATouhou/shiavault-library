Mukhtar al-Thaqafy
==================

Mukhtar bin Abu Ubaid bin Masoud al-Thaqafy was born in Taif City, 1
A.H.

Mukhtar 's father loyally believed in Islam. He led the Muslim army to
conquer Persia. An elephant killed him at the Battle of al-Jisr. So, his
son Jubair led the Muslim army. He became a martyr, too.

Mukhtar 's house became headquarters. The Muslims went to it every day.

The spies told Yazeed bin Mu'awiyah about Mukhtar . They also told him
about al-Numan bin Basheer al-Ansary's the ruler of Kufa's mildness with
him.

Yazeed bin Mu'awiyah asked the advice of Sergon. Sergon was a spiteful
Christian man. Sergon advised Yazeed bin Mu'awiyah to appoint Ubaidullah
bin Ziyad, the ruler of Basrah, ruler over Kufa.

Ubaidullah bin Ziyad arrived in Kufa. He ordered his guards to arrest
Muslim bin Aqeel.

Muslim bin Aqeel disappeared in a house in Kufa. Ubaidullah bin Ziyad's
guards could arrest Mukhtar . They sent him to al-Tamura. Al-Tamura was
a fearful prison underground.

Ubaidullah bin Ziyad filled the prisons with innocent people. Meanwhile
he sent spies all over Kufa to look for Muslim bin Aqeel.

Muslim bin Aqeel was forced to announce a revolution. Many people
supported him.

Muslim bin Aqeel's forces besieged the Prince's palace for several days.

Ubaidullah bin Ziyad was wicked. He spread a rumour that an enormous
army from Damascus was coming. It would destroy Kufa and kill its
people.

The people believed Ubaidullah bin Ziyad's rumour. They left al-Husayn's
envoy alone. Muslim bin Aqeel was forced to disappear again.
