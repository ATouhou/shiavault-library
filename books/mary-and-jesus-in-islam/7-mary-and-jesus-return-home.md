Mary and Jesus Return Home
==========================

Wahab has said that when Herod died, twelve years after the birth of
Jesus[^1], Allah inspired Mary telling her of Herod's death, ordering her
to return with her son Jesus and cousin Joseph the carpenter to Syria.
They did, settling near the Galilee mountain at a village in
north-northeast of Bethlehem (Bayt Laham) called Nazareth after which
Christians are called “Nazarites” or “Nazarenes.” Its Arabic name is
al-Nasira. There, Jesus kept learning in one hour what others would
learn in a day, and in a day what others would in a month, and in a
month what others would in a year, and such is the Almighty's design
with His messengers.

When he became thirty years old, Allah inspired him to come out to the
public and to invite them to worship the One and Only God, Allah,
through the medium of parables, empowering [^1] There is no definite date
given for the birth of Jesus Christ even by Christians themselves! Most
books say that he was “probably” born between 8 B.C. and 4 B.C. The
angel referred to above is described in Christian books as “the heavenly
host.” In Islam, this may either be arch-Angel Gabriel or one of the
angels working under his command. “Jesus” is a Greek noun derived from
the Hebrew “Joshua” which means: “savior.” “Christ” is a Greek
translation of the Hebrew “Messiah” which means “anointed.”

In Arabic, his name is \`«s?. Jesus Christ is cousin of John the
Baptist who is described by the People of the Book as “an ascetic
preacher.” In Islam, he is a prophet referred to in the Holy Qur’an as
Yah,.ya son of Zakariyya (Zacharias). He is mentioned in 3:39 where he
is described as “an honourable, chaste, a prophet from among the good
ones,” in 6:85 and 19:12-15 where he is described as one whom the
Almighty granted wisdom even as a youth, and in 21:90 where he and his
family are described as those who “used to hasten, one with another, in
(the doing of) deeds of goodness.”

him to heal the sick, to cure those afflicted with permanent handicaps,
to give sight back to the blind, to heal the mentally retarded, to
suppress the power of evil, to forbid people from committing misdeeds,
and to subject the devils to humiliation by permitting goodness to thus
prevail. He did as he was ordered, so people loved him and enjoyed his
company.

His followers started increasing in number. Soon he became quite
famous, and at times he may have had as many as fifty thousand patients
or handicapped persons to heal. Those who could walk to him did so, and
those who could not he himself sought, the messenger of God that he was.
Those who could not reach him, he managed to reach them, and such is the
mark of distinction of men of God. The only medicine he applied to the
patients who had a full conviction in him and in his Lord was his
supplication.
