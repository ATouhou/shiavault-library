91: the Sun (shams)
===================

This chapter of 15 early Meccan verses was revealed after Power 97 and
before Constellations 85. The chapters are becoming increasingly lyric
at this point, and the poetic mood in this message is carried along by a
continuous and pronounced rhyme in the Arabic.

This chapter deals with Salih or Methusaleh, the messenger who was sent
to the early Arabian nation of Thamud, and the punishment which the
latter people received. It brings out the fact that most persons must
strive hard in order to remain pure.
