70: Stairases Upward (ma'arij)
==============================

This chapter containing 44 early to middle Meccan verses was revealed
after the previous one called Reality 69 and before The Announcement 78.
The Arabic word Al-Ma'rij, meaning staircases or ladders. is the plural
of rni'raj. which appears as the title of Chapter 17. where it is
translated as The Night Journey that was made on one of them.

The chapter deals mainly with what one can expect to find in the
Hereafter.

Morals and proper conduct are also discussed. The rhymes in the Arabic
add to the effect of the theme, although they are unfortunately lost
through translation.
