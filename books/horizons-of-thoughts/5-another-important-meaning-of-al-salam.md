Another Important Meaning of Al-salam
=====================================

Some authoritative lexicographers like al-Mustafawi in his al-Tahqiq fi
Kalimat al-Qur'an al-Karim define al-Salam as 'a state that depicts the
apparent dimension of an entity to be intensely coherent with its hidden
dimension, such that no kind of difference remains in between.[^55] This
meaning, we must understand, does not contradict the aforementioned
definition, for to be in the state of equilibrium such that the apparent
and the hidden of a thing are intensely coherent to each other, is
nothing but to be free from spiritual calamities and imperfections.

Considering this definition, if we take the phrase 'As Salamu 'Alayka
as invocative (li al-du'a) [^56], then we are seeking the exalted state
of salam for the Imam ('a) in its higher degrees, and thus indirectly
declaring our harmony with the spirit of salam too. This is because one
does not seek anything good for someone save that his heart truly
confirms to it.

This therefore calls for a great responsibility in the za'ir: to
struggle and seek the state of salam which in the case of the human
being is the equilibrium of the soul (salah al-nafs). If one begins his
journey towards this exalted state by self-purification as expounded by
the masters of ethics, his/her salam would truly shine with the spirit
of sincerity.

It is the fear of such state of salam acquired by the revolutionary
za'ir that led tyrants [^57] like the the Abbaside ruler Mutawakkil bi'
Allah to hamper and even kill anyone who aspired to visit the shrine of
Imam al-Hussein ('a).

Other Variables of al-Salam

Sometimes, the article 'al' in al-Salam conveys either of the
following:

1- All kinds of peace
2- The most perfect peace

This is when the definite article 'al' denotes 'genus' or 'species'.
Those who are acquainted with lexical discussions may consider the
footnote below. [^58]

Therefore when we seek the state of al-Salam for our Imam ('a) we
either seek all kinds of peace that behoove his exalted being, or the
most perfect peace. Seeking the second form of peace is in reality
seeking higher levels of peace for the Imam ('a) who already enjoys
peace. In fact the verse below implies that the degrees of peace are
endless:

<p dir="rtl">
وَاللهُ يَدْعُو اِلي دَارِ السَّلاَمِ.
</p>

And Allah invites to the abode of Peace…[^59]

Note that the indefinite verb yad'u denotes 'continuity' and
permanence. Therefore even with regard to the the Holy Prophet(s) who
enjoys the highest level of perfection, the invitation is open. Rather
it is open both in this world as well as the Hereafter.


**Seeking The Absolute State Of-Salam**

Sometimes when the article 'al' denotes genus, it can be taken to mean
'the absolute sense'. This is because no particular kind of peace is
mentioned. Therefore it is taken to mean peace without any kind of
particulairy of limitation. And this is the highest form of peace, which
no one save Almighty Allah enjoys. The Holy Qur'an says:

<p dir="rtl">
هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِي لا إِلهَ إِلا هُوَ الْمَلِكُ الْقُدُّوسُ السَّلامُ
الْمُؤْمِنُ الْمُهَيْمِنُ...
</p>

…He is Allah, other than Whom there is no god, He alone is the
Sovereign, the Most Holy, the Absolute Peace [^60]

Nevertheless the human beings are taught to seek such peace for the
obedient servants of Almighty Allah. Look at the following verses:

<p dir="rtl">
وَقُل الْحَمْدُ لِلهِ وَسَلاَمٌ عَلَى عِبَادِهِ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَى
</p>

Say, All praise belongs to Allah, and Peace [in the absolute sense] be
to His servants whom He has chosen [^61]

It should be noted however that the human being whatever level of peace
he would attain would never reach the absolute sense, which is only
coherent with the Absolute Perfect Being Who is Essentially Existent.
Seeking the same for others, would in reality be seeking higher stages
of Salam for them. And this journey of Salam, according to masters of
the field, would neither end in this world nor in the Hereafter. In
short, the path from the finite to the infinite by the Infinite is
Infinite.

**SEEKING AN ATTRIBUTE OF ALLAH FOR OTHERS**

Al-Salam, as we came to learn, earlier is one of the Attributes of
Almighty Allah, which some of his noble servants, like the infallible
Imams of the Ahl al-Bayt ('a), due to their utter submission enjoyed.
The path for others too is left open. Every human being is invited to
the abode of peace, and therefore he/she must strive to attain the same.
But a true beliver has an all-embracing heart, and thus yearns for the
betterment of others too. Perhaps that is why we are encouraged to greet
others with al-Salam. The Holy Prophet (s) is reported to have said:

<p dir="rtl">
السّلاَمُ اِسْم مِنْ أَسْمَاءِ اللهِ تَعَالى فَافْشُوهُ بَيْنَكُمْ.
</p>

Al-Salam is a Name from among the Names of Almighty Allah; therefore,
spread the same between you…[^62] In fact the word Muslim has originally
been derived from Allah's name al-Salam. Look at the following
tradition:

The Holy Prophet (s) is reported to have said:

<p dir="rtl">
تَسَمّى اللهُ باِسْمَينِ سَمَّى بِهمَا أُمّتِى هُوَ السَّلاَمُ وَسَمَّى
أُمّتِي المُسْلِمِينَ، وَهُوَ الْمُؤْمِنُ وَسَمَّى أُمَّتِى
الْمُؤْمِنِينَ.
</p>

Allah Named Himself with two names with which he [also] named my
Nation: He is al-Salam and He named my nation as muslims, and He is
al-Mu'min and He Named my mu'mins. [^63]

Perhaps due to this reason, exponents of ziyarah like al-Shubbar in his
al-Anwar al-Lami'ah and 'Allama Majlisi in his Bihar al-Anwar believe
that one of the meanings of al-Salamu 'alayka is [^64]:

<p dir="rtl">
اِسْمُ السَّلاَمِ عَلَيْكَ.
</p>

May Allah always Envelop you with His Name al-Salam

Therefore, Almighty Allah not only requires each of us to be at peace,
but teaches us to ask for our Muslim brothers and sisters to be availed
of the same. It should be understood however that the levels of peace
are infinite. Therefore invoking peace for others while we greet them
should never cease.
