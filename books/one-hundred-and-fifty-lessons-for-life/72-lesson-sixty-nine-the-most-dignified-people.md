Lesson Sixty Nine: The Most Dignified People
============================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ أَعْظَمَ النَّاسِ مَنْزِلَةً عِنْدَ اللّهِ يَوْمَ القِيامَةِ
أَمْشاهُمْ فِى أَرْضِهِ بالنَّصِيحَةِ لِخَلْقِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The most dignified people on the day of resurrection are those who had
engaged most in public service and benevolence.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

One of the ways of service to God’s people is respecting and protecting
their interests and their benefits as one’s own interest and benefit,
and dealing with them sincerely and benevolently in their presence as
well as behind their back.
