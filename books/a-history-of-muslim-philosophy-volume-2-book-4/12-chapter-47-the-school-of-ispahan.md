Chapter 47:  The School of Ispahan
==================================

A. Introduction
---------------

It is one of the most curious aspects of the Western study of Muslim
intellectual life that with one or two exceptions practically no serious
research has ever been made into the spiritual and intellectual
treasures of 12 Imam Shi‘ism in any of the European Languages.[^1] As a
result, not only Westerners but even the Muslims whose contact with the
Shi‘ah world is mainly through Western sources have remained totally
ignorant of the remarkable intellectual life which has persisted to this
very day in the centres of Shi‘ism, especially in Persia. Inasmuch as it
was mostly in the Shi‘ah world that much of the intellectual life of
Islam, especially in the sciences and traditional wisdom *(Hikmat)*,[^2]
took refuge after the seventh/13th century this ignorance has helped to
strengthen the totally erroneous notion that Islam fell into complete
decadence after the Mongol invasion.

Just as a closer study of the Muslim world at large will show that in
art, government, Sufism and many other aspects of Muslim life there was
anything but decadence until fairly recently, a study of the Shi‘ah
world will reveal that even in the sciences, philosophy, and gnosis the
Muslims have, with one gap of a century and a half, continued to
flourish up to the present century. It will reveal that just as Safawid
art is one of the high points of Muslim art, so the intellectual life of
Shi‘ism in this period one of the apogees of Muslim history, producing
sages like Sadr al-Din Shirazi, usually known as Mulla Sadra.

Perhaps one day histories of philosophy will not have chapters on Islam
which end abruptly with ibn Rushd or possibly ibn Khaldun but will trace
the chain to the present century and end once and for all the dangerous
illusion that the present day Muslims are separated from their own
tradition by centuries of Safawid Persia, where 12 Imam Shi‘ism became
for the first time a completely independent political and cultural
entity, an entity which has dominated every phase of life in Persia ever
since.

The coming to power of the Safawids in Persia is one of the most
fascinating chapters of Muslim history and marks one of the instances in
which the influence of Sufism upon the social and political life of
Islam is felt directly. Beginning as a Sufi brotherhood which traced its
lineage as well as its name to the great saint Sheikh Safi al-Din
Ardibili,[^3] the Safawids soon developed into a well organized
political unity for the first time since the fall of the Sassanid
Empire.

The Sufi order continued under the spiritual direction of a series of
descendants of Sheikh Safi, and its members in the ninth/15th century
adopted a 12-sided red hat for which they became known as the
*qizil-bash* (red heads). The order grew in power in the politically
disorganized Persia of the ninth/15th century and under Isma‘il
(892/1487 – 930/1523 – 24) succeeded in defeating the local rulers and
unifying the whole of Persia.

Shah Isma‘il was crowned in Tabriz in 905/1499 marking the beginning of
the reign of the Safawids which was to last over two centuries until in
1133/1720 the Afghans conquered Persia, sacked the Safawid capital at
Ispahan and killed Shah Hussein, the last of the Safawid rulers. During
this wavering between these two orthodox perspectives of the Islamic
revelation, became completely 12-Imam Shi‘ah and Shi‘ism, which had
until now remained a minority creed, found itself as the official
religio of an empire and had to face political and social issues it had
never been forced to face before.[^4]

No longer molested by an external force and face with a large number of
practical social problems, Shi‘ah theology, *Kalam*, which had always
served as the walls of the citadel of the faith,[^5] lost much of its
earlier vigour while jurisprudence, *Fiqh*, having to face new
situations, became highly developed. More important for our purpose is
the fact that the pre-dominantly Shi‘ah culture of Persia prepared the
background for the flourishing of the doctrines of *israqi* gnosis
(illuministic wisdom),[^6] philosophy, and the sciences. The efforts of
the chain of sages after Khuwaja Nasir al-Din Tusi, who had kept the
study of these subjects alive suddenly found the necessary environment
for the development of this form of wisdom.[^7]

We have connected this wisdom symbolically with the school of Ispahan,
which spread throughout Safawid Persia as well as in Iraq, Syria, and
India with which the Persians had very close contacts. The centres of
its life were not only Ispahan, the Safawid capital, but also other
cities like Shiraz, Kashan, Qazwin, and Tabriz. Furthermore, some of the
most important figures like Sheikh Baha’ al-Din Amili, and Sayyid
Ni‘matullah Jaza’iri, who played a vital role in the establishment of
Shi‘ism in Persia, were Arabs from Amil near Damascus and Bahrain, two
centres which had been preserving the Shi‘ah tradition for
centuries.[^8]

The Shi‘ahs have developed the Ja‘fari School of Law named after the
sixth Imam, Imam Ja‘far al-Sadiq, as well as theology *(Kalam)* and
other traditional studies, namely, language, history, hadith and
commentary upon the Qur’an, jurisprudence *(Fiqh)*, principles of
jurisprudence *(Usul)*,[^9] theology,[^10] and *Hikmat*, this last being
a combination of gnosis, theosophy, and philosophy which forms the main
subject of our present study.

B. Hikmat
---------

The form of wisdom which has survived until today in the Shi‘ah world as
*Hikmat* can neither be wholly identified with philosophy as currently
understood in the West, not with theosophy which has unfortunately
become identified in the English speaking world with pseudo-spiritualist
movements, nor with theology.[^11] As developed in the Safawid period
and continued to the present day, *Hikmat* consists of several threads
knit together by the matrix of Shi‘ism.

The most important of these elements are the esoteric teachings of the
Imams, especially as contained in the *Nahj al-Balaghah* by the first
Imam ‘Ali, the *ishraqi* wisdom of Suhrawardi which contains in itself
aspects of ancient Persian and Hermetic doctrines, the teachings of the
earlier Sufis, especially the gnostic doctrines of ibn ‘Arabi, and the
heritage of the Greek philosophers. It is, therefore, not too surprising
if many of the treatises on *Hikmat* begin with logic and end with
ecstasy experienced in the catharsis *(tajrid)* and illumination of the
intellect. They contain as a necessary basis some preparation in logic
which they share with the Peripatetics (Masha’iyun), but instead of
remaining bound to the plane of reason they use this logic as a
springboard for their flight into the heaven of gnosis.

The group of sages who between the death of ibn Rushd, the so-called
terminating point of Muslim philosophy, and the Safawids prepared the
ground for the intellectual revival of the school of Ispahan are usually
not much better known outside Persia than the Safawid sages themselves.
They include a series of philosophers and scientists like Khuwaja Nasir
al-Din Tusi, better known in the Western world as a scientist than a
philosopher and theologian, Qutb al-Din Razi, Mir Sayyid Sharif Jurjani,
Jalal al-Din Dawwani, and ibn Turkah Ispahani,[^12] all of whom sought
to reconstruct Muslim intellectual life through a gnostic interpretation
of the writings of ibn Sina, Suhrawardi, and the Sufis, and who carried
further the attempt already begun by al-Farabi, extended by ibn Sina in
his Qur’anic commentaries, and carried a step further by Suhrawardi, to
correlate faith *(iman)* with philosophy.[^13]

The precursors of the Safawid sages include also a series of pure
gnostics, both Shi‘ah and Sunni, although this distinction is not
essential in Sufism, who spread the doctrines of ibn ‘Arabi, the
Andalusian sage and the formulator of gnostic doctrines in Islam in the
Eastern lands of Islam.[^14] These Sufis include Sadr al-Din Qunawi,
Fakhr al-Din ‘Iraqi, ‘Abd al Razzaq Kashani, ‘Ala al-Daulah
Simnani,[^15] ‘Abd al-Rahman Jami,[^16] and two others who are
especially important in introducing the gnostic doctrines of ibn ‘Arabi
into the Shi‘ah world, ibn Abi Jumhur and Mulla Haidar ‘Ali Amuli.[^17]
One must also mention another great spiritual leader, Maulana Jalal
al-Din Rumi, whose influence has extended throughout Persia during the
past seven centuries.

C. Major Figures of the School of Ispahan
-----------------------------------------

To write down even the mere names and works of all the important authors
of the Safawid period would in itself require a book because in nearly
every field of religious science many notable figures arose during this
period of great intellectual activity. In theology, jurisprudence, and
related sciences it is enough to mention only a few names like that of
Zain al-Din ibn ‘Ali ibn Ahmad Jaba’i (911/1505 – 966/1558), commonly
known as the second martyr *(shahid-i thani)* because of his having been
put to death by the Ottomans, the author of numerous treatise which
still form a part of Shi‘ah religious education, ‘Ali ibn ‘Abd al-‘Ali
‘Amili known as Muhaqqia-i Karaki (d. 945/1538), the author of
*al-Najmiyyah* in theology and many other treatises and commentaries,
the two Majlisis, Mohammad Taqi (1003/1594 – 1070/1659), the author of
*Raudat al-Muttaqin*, and his son Mohammad Baqir (1037/1628 -1110/1699),
the greatest of the Safawid theologians and scholars to whom we shall
turn later.[^18]

As for the *hukama’*, those who cultivated this particular form of
wisdom which they called *Hikmat*, they include Sadr al-Din Shirazi,
better known as Mulla Sadra, to whom a separate chapter has been devoted
in the present work, Sayyid Ahmad ‘Alawi, Mir. Damad’s Sabziwari (d.
1090/1669), the commentator of the *Isharat* and the metaphysics of the
*Shifa’*, and the *Dhakhirat al-Ma‘afi*, Rajab ‘Ali Tabrizi (d.
1080?/1670), a thinker with nominalist tendencies and the author of
*Risaleh-i Ithbat-i Wujud*, ‘Abd al-Razzaq Lahiji (d. 1071/1661), a
student of Mulla Sadra and author of some of the most important books on
*Hikmat* in Persian like the *Guhar Murad, Sarmayeh-i Iman*, and the
*Mashariq al-Ilham*, glosses upon the commentary of Khuwaja Nasir al-Din
Tusi upon the *Isharat*, and the commentary upon Suhrawardi’s *Hayakil
al-Nur*, and Qadi Sa‘id Qumi (1049/1640 – 1103?/1692), a gnostic and
theologian, the author of the *Ara‘inat, Kilid-i Bihisht*, and a
commentary upon the *Athulujiyya* attributed to Aristotle but now known
to be a paraphrasis of the *Enneads* of Plotinus.

In addition to these authors, there are a few other major figures about
whom we have chosen to speak somewhat more fully hoping that in this way
we can depict the various aspects of the intellectual life of the
Safawid period. These figures include Sheikh Baha’ al-Din Amili, Mir
Damad,[^19] perhaps the central figure in the school of Ispahan, Mir Abu
al-Qasim Findiriski, Mulla Musin Faid Kashi, and the second Majlisi whom
we have already mentioned.

If space had allowed, we would have also considered the purely Sufi
writings like the commentary upon the *Gulsham-i Raz* by Mohammad
Lahiji, which is one of the best books on Sufism in Persian, and the
works by the masters of other Sufi orders like the *Tuhfih’-* by the
*Dhahabi* sheikh, Sheikh Mu’adhdhin Khurasani.

### Sheikh Baha’ al-Din ‘Amili

The most colourful figure of the Safawid period was without doubt Baha’
al-Din ‘Amili, better known as Sheikh-i Baha’i.[^20] His father was the
leader of the Shi‘ah community of ‘Amil and a student of Shahid-i Thani.
After his teacher’s death in 966/1559, he set out with his son towards
Persia. Baha’ al-Din, who was born in Baalbek in 953/1546, was then only
13 years old and well qualified to master the Persian language. In
Persia he continued his studies in the religious sciences, poetry, and
*Hikmat* and soon became the leading scholar of his day and the *Sheikh
al-Islam* of Ispahan. Despite his nearness to the Court and necessary
participation in the worldly life he was a gnostic and spent many of the
last years of his life travelling with the dervishes and visiting
various Sufi masters. He finally passed away in 1030/1622 while
returning from Hajj.[^21]

Sheikh Baha’ al-Din was the leading theologian and jurist of his time
and the leader of the *‘ulama’* of Ispahan. He was at the same time an
outstanding Sufi, one of the best of the Safawid poets who revived the
‘Iraqi style and wrote poetry in the tradition of Rumi and Hafiz, the
leading architect of the Safawid period, whose masterpieces like the
Shah mosque of Ispahan still stand among the summits of Muslim
architecture,[^22] and the greatest mathematician and astronomer of his
period.

In an age when the theologians, jurists, *Hakims*, natural historians,
sophists, logicians, and Sufis were well-marked groups, sometimes in
external conflict with one another, Sheikh-i Baha’i was respected by all
these groups, from the wondering dervishes, the *qalandars*, to the
Court *‘ulama’* each of which considered the Sheikh its own. His genius
lay precisely in showing the nothingness of all sciences before divine
gnosis, while at the same time having a mastery of each science. Yet
each of Sheikh-i Baha’i’s writings has become a standard source of
reference in its own field.

Some of his important works include *Jami‘i-i ‘Abbasi* on theology in
Persian, *Fawa’id al-Samadiyyan* on Arabic grammar which is still in
wide use, a treatise on algebra, the *Khulasah fi al-Hisab*,[^23]
several treatises on astronomy including the *Tashrih al-Aflak*, a
treatise on the astrolabe, *‘Urwat al-Wathqa*, general Qur’anic
commentaries, many works on various aspects of the Hari‘ah, the
*Kashkul*, a collection of Arabic and Persian writings which ranks among
the most famous Sufi works, and a series of *mathnawis* like *Bread and
Sweet, Cat and Mouse, Milk and Sugar*, and the *Tuti-Nameh*.[^24]

It is especially in the didactic poems, the *mathnawas*, that the
particular genius of Sheikh-i Baha’i for expressing sublime truth in
simple language and in witty anecdotes becomes manifest. In these poems
his spirit is very similar to that of Maulana Jalal al-Din Rumi whom he
follows in spirit as well as in form. In the long poem of *The Cat and
the Mouse* in which the cat symbolizes exoteric and formal knowledge and
the mouse esotericism, the theme is the danger of hypocrisy which the
exoteric view always faces and the necessity in the religious and social
structure for exoteric knowledge. Sheikh-i Baha’i also emphasizes
throughout the work the supremacy of intellectual intuition over
discursive knowledge. As an example we mention below the story of
Mu‘tazilite and a Sufi who appears in the guise of a madman named
Buhlul.

During the reign of one of the Caliphs, a Mu‘tazilite was chosen as the
Imam of the mosque. One day Buhlul entered the mosque with a brick
hidden under his dress and joined the congregation after the prayers to
listen to the Imam’s sermon. The Imam in the Mu‘tazilite fashion
mentioned that Satan is not harmed in hell because he is made of fire
and since a thing cannot harm its own kind, the fire of hell cannot harm
him. Upon hearing this, Buhlul became infuriated but held back his
anger.

The Imam continued his sermon by saying that both good and evil are by
divine consent. Again Buhlul became angry but once again succeeded in
remaining quiet. The Imam added that on the Day of Judgment man would
actually be able to see God. Upon hearing this, Buhlul took out the
brick from under his dress, threw it at the Imam injuring his head and
ran away. The Caliph raging with fury was about to call for Buhlul when
he walked into the palace and without any greetings sat at the head of
the Court. The Caliph asked him with great anger as to why he had
attacked the Imam. Buhlul answered by pleading to the Caliph to give him
permission to explain how by his act he had done nothing discourteous
and when given permission addressed the bleeding Imam and said that
since according to his own words a thing cannot harm it owns kind, a
brick cannot harm the Imam’s head since both are made of clay.

Furthermore, he asked the Imam if had felt any pain upon being hit on
the head and if he could see the pain. Upon receiving the reply that
Imam did not see the pain, Buhlul asked how a man could be unable to see
pain, a creation of God, see the Creator. Finally, Bulhul added that
since all acts are done through divine consent, God must have given
consent to his throwing the brick and so the Imam should not complain of
an act to which God had consented. Upon hearing this, the Imam, the
symbol of rationalism, had to remain silent before Buhlul, the symbol of
intellectual intuition.[^25]

The writings of Sheikh-i Baha’i are also replete with passages about the
nothingness of all human knowledge as against divine gnosis. For
example, in the poem *Nan wa Halwah* (Bread and Sweet) he says:

Formal science is nothing but altercation,
It results in neither intoxication[^26] nor contemplation.
It continually brings congelation to man’s nature,
What’s more, the Maulana[^27] does not believe in it.

If someone tells thee that of thy life,
There remains with certainty but a week,
Thou in this one week will busy thy self
With which science, oh accomplished man!
There is no science but the science of love,[^28]
The rest is the deception of the wretched Satan.
There is no science but the Qur’anic commentary and Hadith,
The rest is the deception of the perverse Satan.

The mysteries will never become known to thee,
If thou hast for student a hundred Fakhr-i Razi.[^29]
All who do not love the face of the beautiful
The saddle and the rein are appropriate for them[^30]
That is, he who does not have love for the Friend,
Bring for him the saddle and the headstall.[^31]
He who has not fallen in love with his beautiful Face,
Erase his name from the tablet of humanity.
A breast that is empty of the love of the Beautiful,
Is an old leather bag full of bones.
A breast if devoid of the Beloved,
Is not a breast but an old chest.
A heart which is empty of the love of that Beauty,
Count it as a stone with which the Devil cleans himself.

These sciences, these forms and imaginings,
Are the excrements of Satan upon that stone.
If thou allowest other than the science of love in thy heart,
Thou wilt be giving Satan the stone to clean himself.
Be ashamed of thyself, oh villain,
That thou carriest the Devil’s cleaning stone in thy pocket.
Wash the tablet of the heart from the Devil’s excrement,
Oh teacher, give also the lesson of love.

How long wilt thou teach the wisdom of the Greeks?
Learn also the wisdom of those who have faith.[^32]
How long with this jurisprudence and baseless theology,
Wilt thou empty thy brain? Oh exuberant one,
Thy life is spent in discussing conjugation and syntax,
Learn also a few words about the principles of love.

Illuminate thy heart with resplendent lights,
How long wilt thou lick the bowl of Avicenna?
The Lord of the universe, the King of this world and the next[^33]
Called the left-over of the believer a remedy, Oh grieved one,
But the left-over of Aristotle and Avicenna,
When has the illuminated Prophet called it a remedy?
Go rip thy breast in a hundred places,
And clear thy heart of all these stains.[^34]

Not only does Sheikh-i Baha’i suggest that man should not busy himself
solely with formal science and that he should seek to reach the divine
gnosis hidden in the revelation, but he also reminds man that he should
not become so accustomed to his world as to forget his original home. It
has been a constant theme of the gnostics throughout the ages that the
spiritual man being a stranger in this world must take the perilous
journey to return to his original abode.[^35] In the same *Nan wa
Halwah*, while commenting upon the Prophet’s saying, “The love of the
country comes from faith,” he writes,[^36]

“This country is not Egypt, Iraq or Syria,
It is a city which has no name.
Since all these countries belong to this world,
The noble man will never praise them.
The love of this world is the source of all evil,
And from evil comes the loss of faith.

Happy is the person who, through divine guidance,
Is led in the direction of that nameless city.
Oh son, thou art a stranger in these countries,
How wretched art thou to have become accustomed to it!
Thou hast remained so long in the city of the body,
That thou hast completely forgotten thy own country.
Turn away from the body and gladden thy soul,
And remember thy original home.
How long wilt thou, oh victorious falcon,
Remain away from the sphere of the spirit?
It is a shame for those, oh artful one,
To shed thy feathers in this ruin.
How long, oh hoopoe of the city of Saba,[^37]
Wilt thou remain in estrangement with feet tied?
Seek to untie the cords from thy feet,
And fly where ‘there is no space’”.[^38]

Shekhi-i Baha’i was one of those rare falcons who, while outwardly in
the midst of this world, had flown to the “land of nowhere.” He did not
write in the technical sense so much about the *Hikmat* as Mir. Damad or
Mulla Muhsin Faid did, but he reached such a degree of spiritual
realization above and beyond theoretical formulations that all of his
writings are spiritually precious. Even his compositions in the various
religious and natural sciences bear the perfume of his spirituality. His
writings present a balance between the exoteric and the esoteric, the
metaphysical and the cosmological, which serve as an example of what the
relation between the various aspects of a tradition, might be and could
be when the principal integrating influence of gnosis is present.

### Mir Damad

One of the most influential figures of the Safawid School was Muhammad
Baqir Damad, better known as Mir Damad. He and his student, Mulla Sadra,
must be considered to be the greatest *Hakims* of the period. Being the
grandson of Muhaqqia-i Karaki and descendant of a distinguished Shi‘ah
family, Mir Damad received the best education possible in all branches
of learning. His most famous teacher was Sheikh Hussain ibn ‘Abd
al-Samad ‘Amili, the father of Sheikh-i Baha’i, who later on became his
most intimate friend and companion at the Safawid Court.[^39] Mir Damad
soon became a leading authority on *Kalam, Hikmat, Fiqh* and even in the
occult and natural sciences.[^40]

In Ispahan he attracted numerous students to himself. His most famous
disciples were Mulla Sadra, Sayyid Ahmad ‘Alawi, the commentator of the
*Shifa’*, Mulla Khalil Qazwini whose commentary upon the *Usal al-Kafi*
is very well known in Persia, and Qutb al-Din Ashkiwari, the author of a
universal sacred history and several philosophical and gnostic
treatises.[^41] Mir Damad, more than anyone else, was responsible for
the revivification of ibn Sina’s philosophy and *ishraqi* wisdom within
the context of Shi‘ism and for laying the ground for the monumental work
for Mulla Sadra. Mir. Damad did much to revive what he referred to as
the Yamani wisdom *(falsafih-i Yamani)*, the wisdom of the prophets, in
contrast to the more rationalistic philosophy of the Greeks.[^42] He has
been entitled the Third Teacher *(Mu‘allim-i thalith)* after Aristotle
and Farabi.

The writings of Mir Damad, both in Arabic and Persian, many of which are
incomplete, are written in a very difficult style which adds to the
difficulty of understanding their contents. These writings include
several treatises on *Kalam*, works on *Fiqh* like *Shari‘ al-Najat*,
*al-Ufuq al-Mubin* on Being, time, and eternity, *al-Sirat al-Mustaqim*
on the relation between the created and the eternal, *Taqwim al-Imam* on
Being, creation, and God’s knowledge, several other major treatises on
*Hikmat* including the *Qabasat*,[^43] *Taqdisat, Jadhawat*, and *Sidrat
all-Muntaha*,[^44] several Qur’anic commentaries like *Amanat-i Ilahi*,
commentaries upon the *Istihsar* of Khuwaja Nasir al-Din Tusi and the
metaphysics of the *Shifa’*, the *Khalsat al-Malakut* on gnosis,[^45]
and a collection of poems in Persian and Arabic including the *Mushariq
al-Anwar*, written under the pen name, *Ishraq*.

After a life-time spent in writing, teaching, and reading the Qur’an to
which he was much devoted, and having prepared the ground for the whole
group of sages, especially Mulla Sadra, who were to carry his ideas to
their ultimate perfection, Mir Damad died on the way between Najaf and
Karbala in Iraq in 1041/1631.

The thought of Mir Damad is marked by two features which distinguish him
from the other *Hikims* of the period, the first the organization of his
treatises and the second the notion of eternal creation, *huduth-i
dahri*, which is the central and ever-recurring theme in his writings.
As for the organization of his works, like the *Qabasat* and *Taqdisat*,
it differs for the most part from that of the traditional Muslim books
on philosophy and *Hikmat* which usually begin with logic and then
proceed to natural philosophy *(tabi‘iyyat)*, mathematics
*(riyadiyyat)*, and theology *(ilahiyyat)*.[^46]

For example, in the *Qabasat* the ten chapters of the book concern the
various meanings of creation and the division of Being, kinds of
anteriority, multiplicity, appeal to the Qur’an and the Hadith, nature,
time, and motion, criticism of logic divine omnipotence, and
intellectual substances, chain of Being, and finally
pre-destination.[^47]

The second marked feature of Mir Damad’s exposition of *Hikmat* concerns
the notion of time. It is well known that the question whether the world
is created *(hadith)* or eternal *(qadim)* has been one of the major
points of dispute between the philosophers and theologians in both Islam
and Christianity as well as among the Greeks.[^48] Mir Damad seeks a
solution to this question by dividing reality into three categories:
*zaman* or time, *dahr*, and *sarmad*; the latter two are kinds of
eternity. This division is ontological and not just logical or
theoretical.[^49]

The divine essence or ipseity *(dhat)* is above all distinctions and
qualities; yet it is also the source of the divine names and attributes
which are both one with the essence and yet distinct from it. This
immutable relation between the essence and the attributes, which cannot
be changed from either side, the attributes being a necessary
determination *(ta‘ayyun)* of the essence to Itself by Itself, Mir Damad
called *sarmad*. It is an eternity in the absolute sense, above all
contingencies. The names and attributes, which are the same as the
archetypes, Platonic ideas, or the lords of the species *(rabb al-nau‘)*
as the Ishraqis call them, in turn generate the world to change.

They are the immutable intelligences of this world, and each species in
this world is a theurgy *(tilism)* for its archetype. The relation
between the immutable archetypes and the world change is like the
reflection of the moon in a stream of water in which the image of the
moon remains unchanged while the substance in which it is reflected,
i.e. water, flows on continually. This relation between the immutable
and the changing Mir Damad calls *dahr*. Finally, the relation between
one change and another is called time *(saman)*, in the sense of
quantity and measure of change as Aristotle had already described
it.[^50]

Since the world was brought into being through the intermediate world of
archetypes, its creation is *dahri* not *zamani*, i.e. the world was not
created in a time which existed before the world came into being but
with respect to a *dahr* which stands above the world.[^51] The creation
of this world is, therefore, *huduth-i dahri, ibda’*, and *ikhtira‘* and
not *huduth-i samani, wad‘*, and *lakwin*. Time has a reality in its own
plane of being, but the world of *dahr*, the world of the archetypes,
time does not even exist. Moreover, the changing physical world
*(‘alam-i jismani)* depends for its existence upon non-existence
*(‘adam)* in the world of archetypes.

While it exists in time *(zaman)*, it is non-existent in *dahr* and has
no share in the angelic mode of being, proper to the world of *dahr*, of
which it is no more than coagulation. Likewise, the world of *dahr*, of
the archetypes, is non-existent in the divine essence, in the world of
*sarmad* (the eternal world). In the divine essence *(dhat)* there is
neither *dahr* nor *zaman*, neither archetype nor body; God is alone in
His majesty.[^52] Yet, *dahr* exists on its own level and *zaman* on its
own. *Sarmad* is the cause of *dahr* and *dahr* the cause of
*zaman*,[^53] so that ultimately the divine essence is the cause of all
things, while in its essence nothing may even be said to exist.

The *Jadhawat*, the contents of which we will now briefly survey, is one
of the works in which Mir Damad presents the complete cycle of his
metaphysical ideas combined as usual with the Qur’anic text, the Hadith,
and his own verse.[^54] In the first *judhwah* or particle of fire, of
which the word *jadhawat* is the plural, Mir Damad divides the “book of
divine existence,” of the chain of Being, into two parts, one in which
there is an effusion or theophany *(tajalli)* away from the divine
essence and the other in which there is a return to the origin: the
first extending from the divine essence to prime matter or *hyle* and
the other from the *hyle* back to the origin of all existence. Moreover,
each chain is divided into a longitudinal *(tulil)* order and a
latitudinal *(‘ardi)* order.[^55] The longitudinal order of the chain of
effusion includes five essential degrees:

1. The degree of pure intelligences, the Victorial lights *(anwar-i
qahirah)* the first member of which is the universal intellect *(‘aql-i
kull)*, i.e. the first light to issue forth from the Light of lights
*(nur al-anwar)*.

2. The degree of heavenly souls *(nufus-i falakiyyah)*, the governing
lights *(anwar-i mudabbirah)*, the first number of which governing the
first heaven is called the universal soul *(nafs-i kull)*.

3. The degree of the natural souls *(nufus-i muntabi‘ah)* and the
archetypes of the heavens, the planets, the four natures, the elements,
and compounds.[^56]

4. The degree of bodily form *(surat-i jismiyyah)*, i.e. the
Aristotelian form, which is an extended substance and is of one species.

5. The degrees of *hyle*, from the matter of the highest heaven to that
of the world of generation and corruption.[^57]

As for the longitudinal order of the chain of return to the divine
essence, it too, includes five stages:

1. The degree of absolute body *(jism-i mutlaq)* and bodies comprising
the elements and the heavens.

2. The degree of composed bodies which come into being from the
combination of the elements and have a species of their own, e.g.
minerals.

3. The degree of plants possessing the vegetative soul.

4. The degree of animals possessing the animal soul.[^58]

5. The degree of men possessing the intellectual soul which is of the
same substance as the intelligences of the descending chain, above both
of which there is nothing but the Truth *(Haqq)* Itself.[^59]

Each of these degrees, both in the descending and the ascending chains,
have their several members that constitute the latitudinal extension of
each degree.

The world of the intelligences *(mujarradat)* is called the world of the
invisible *(ghaib)*, or command *(amr)*, or *malakat*, or intellect
*(‘aql)* or life *(hayat)*, or light *(nur)*, while the world of bodies
is called the world of creation *(khalq)*, vision *(Shahadat)*, or
dominion *(mulk)*, or death *(maut)*, or darkness *(zulmat)*. Man’s
nature is composed of these two worlds in such a way that he contains
the whole world in himself; he is the microcosm as the world is the
macrocosm. His intellect is like the sun, his soul like the moon, and
his body like the earth, and as is the case with the heavens, man can
also have an inner eclipse, i.e. the earth of his body can prevent the
light of the sun of the intellect to shine upon the moon of the soul.
The purpose of the two chains of descent and ascent is to bring into
being man, who contains both the chains within himself and who can,
therefore, ascend to heaven as well as descend to the lowest depths of
existence.

The macrocosm is a conscious being whose head is the highest heaven,
whose heart is the sun and whose other organs correspond with those of
man. It is compared symbolically to a man whose head is pointed towards
the North Pole, the right side towards the west, the face towards
heaven, the feet towards the south, and the left side towards the east.

The totality of these degrees, the macrocosm and the microcosm together,
is the book of God, in which each being is a word or rather a
letter.[^60] These words and letters are written by the divine Pen
*(qalam)* which symbolizes the intellect. The Pen writes the truth of
things upon the human soul which is called the *ispahbad* light *(nur-i
ispahbadi)*. More specifically, the Pen writes the truth of things upon
the soul of the prophet who in turn “writes” the knowledge of things
upon the soul of man and through the intelligences, upon the pages of
creation and existence. The intelligences are not limited to the nine
heavens, but as the Ishraqis have asserted, in number they equal the
fixed stars in addition to the heavens and extend all the way down to
the heaven of the moon. The intelligence of this heaven is called “the
giver of forms” *(wahib al-suwar)* or the active intellect *(aql-i
fa‘‘al)* which gives being as well as form to the sublunary region.[^61]

The heaven of the fixed stars is the meeting place of the corporeal and
intellectual lights, the boundary between formal and formless
manifestation. This heaven has its own soul and intelligence but, in
addition, each star in it is also a possessor of intelligence and a soul
proper to itself. As to the other heavens, they also have their general
intelligence and soul as well as particular intelligences and souls all
of which cast their illuminations upon the sublunary region. The
intelligence of the heaven of the sun is Gabriel whose grace is spread
throughout the heavens and the earth.

Having considered the chain of Being, Mir Damad turns to a discussion of
unity *(tauhid)* starting from “there is no divinity but God” *(la ilaha
illa Allah)* to, “there is no being but He and no truth but He” *(la
maujudun illa Huwa wa la haqqun illa Huwa)*.[^62] For the real gnostic
every being is nothing but Being. Mir Damad compares the relation of
Being to existence with that of the number one to other numbers, which
runs through all numbers without entering into them, which relation
neither the soul nor the intellect can understand, yet its effect is
felt everywhere.[^63]

The Divine Being by His essential unity encompasses all things; His
unity is before, with, and after both *dahr* and *zaman*. His unity
before *dahr* is the unity of His command, with *dahr*, the unity of the
universal intellect, after *dahr*, the unity of the universal soul,
unity with time *(zaman)* and unity of the elements and compounds.

As for the generation of multiplicity from unity, Mir Damad rejects the
Peripatetic view of authors like ibn Sina who consider that the first
intellect brings multiplicity into being by the three relationships
possible for it: necessity by something other than self, the
intellection of the divine essence, and the intellection of its own
essence. For Mir Damad just as the number of intelligences is unlimited
so are there possible relationships beyond the number determined by the
Peripatetics.[^64] Likewise, the intelligences have a great many
illuminations and effusions beyond the categories set forth by the
Aristotelians, one intelligence being victorial *(qahir)* and the other
passive and receptive *(maqhur)*. Each heaven as well as each body,
simple or composed, has its archetype *(rabb al-nau­‘­)* in the world of
divine command *(‘alam-i amr)* which is changeless and is to its species
what the soul of man is to his body.

Between the world of intelligences and the physical world there is an
intermediary world, the so called eighth climate which Mir Damad,
following the ancient Ishraqi sages calls *hurqalya*,[^65] the world of
separated imagination *(khayal-i munfasil*), or the purgatory
*(barzakh)*. Human imagination regarded as a gulf extending from this
vast cosmic ocean. This world contains the forms or Platonic ideas of
all physical bodies without being in a specific place. The mythical
cities of Jabulqa and Jabulas[^66] are located in it, and bodily
resurrection on the Last Day, miracles, and the passage of great
distances in a short time, all take place in this intermediary world
which is a bridge to be crossed before reaching the spiritual world.

In order to cross this bridge and make the return journey through the
ascending chain, man must become familiar with the divine names,
especially the Great name *(ism-i a‘zam)* which contains all the others.
All the prophets and saints derive their being from these names, and the
creatures are their effects. The spiritual world is called the world of
invocation *(‘alam-i tasbih)* because the realities of that world are
the divine names. Man, therefore, can regain the world only by invoking
the names and becoming unified with them.[^67]

The gnostic who has achieved this end sees the whole world through the
intelligible world; in fact, he sees nothing outside the Divine. As long
as man lives in this world no matter how much he has separated his soul
from his body and achieved *catharsis (tajrid)*, he is still in time and
space. It is only when he dies and leaves the world of darkness for that
light that he becomes completely free from the conditions of terrestrial
existence of *zaman*, and it is only then that he enters into eternity
*(dahr)*.

The inner constitution of man forms a bridge between the worlds of time
and eternity, the sensible and the intelligible. Man possesses four
degrees of perception: sensation *(ihsas)*, imagination *(takhayyul)*,
apprehension *(tawahkum)*, and intellection *(ta‘aqqul)*, the degrees
which stretch between these two worlds; on the one hand, it abstracts
perceptions from the sensible world and, on the other, receives the
illumination of the intelligible world which it clothes in the forms of
sensible, i.e. words and names which are the external dress of
truth.[^68]

Mir Damad echoes earlier Sufi and Pythagorean doctrines in assigning a
particular significance to the numerical symbolism of letters. He
writes, “The world of letters corresponds to the world of numbers, and
the world of numbers to the world of Being, and the proportion of the
world of letters to the proportion of the world of numbers and the
proportion of the world of numbers to the combinations and mixtures of
the world of Being.”[^69] He calls the sciences of the properties of
letters and their combination divine medicine and says that letters have
come into being from the conjunction of planets with the signs of the
Zodiac, for example *alif* has come into being by Mars crossing the
first degree of Aries. He establishes correspondence between the 28
letters of the Arabic alphabet and the equal number of the stations of
the moon and works out this correspondence in great detail.[^70]

In establishing a relation between numbers, letters of the alphabet, and
the heavens, Mir Damad, like many sages before him, seeks to point out
the common ground between the book of revelation and the book of nature,
as well as the relation between the sensible world and the intelligible
world. In his writings it is quite clear that both metaphysics and
cosmology are to be found in the esoteric *(batini)* meanings of the
Qur’an and that through the understanding of the symbolism of letters
and numbers and the sapiential exegeses of sacred books one can come to
know not only the Qur’an which corresponds to the world of creation, the
*Qur’an-i tadwini*, i.e. the *logos* or the reality of Mohammad
*(haqiqat al-Mohammadiyyah)*.

### Mir Abu al-Qasim Findiriski

The third famous triumvirate of sages from Isphan,[^71] Mir Findiriski,
spent much of his life travelling outside Persia, especially in India
where he was highly respected by most of the princes and where he made
the acquaintance of many Hindu sages. He became well acquainted with
Hinduism and even wrote a commentary upon the Persian translation of the
*Yoga Vasistha* by Nizam al-Din Panipati, which is one of the major
works on Hinduism in Persian. In the Muslim sciences he was a master in
philosophy *(Hikmat)*, mathematics, and medicine and taught the *Shifa’*
and the *Qanun* of ibn Sina in Ispahan where he died in 1050/1640.

The most interesting aspect of Mir Findiriski’s life is his complete
detachment, even externally, from the world. As a Sufi, in spite of his
having advanced very far upon the Path and having reached the state of
pure contemplation and illumination, he mingled with the common people
and wore the coarsest wool and yet he was one of the most respected men
in the Safawid Court.[^72] His manner resembled that of the Hindu Yogis
with whom he had had so much contact. He was a real man among men and
one of the most striking Sufis of his time. While completely detached
from the world and even from purely formal learning, he composed several
important treatises including one on motion *(al-harakah)*, another on
the arts and sciences in society *(sand‘iyyah)*, the book on Yoga
already mentioned, *Usul al-Fusul* on Hindu wisdom and a history of the
Safwids.

Moreover, he, like Mir Damad and Sheikh-i Baha-i, was an accomplished
poet showing the development in him of the gnostic element which is the
only possible common ground between traditional philosophy and poetry.
The most famous of his poems is a *qasidah*, based upon that of Nasir
ibn Khursau Dehlawi, which is one of the best known poems on *Hikmat* in
Persian. It has been taught and commented upon many times since its
composition, the more famous commentaries on it being those of Mohammad
Salih Khalkhali and Hakim ‘Abbas Darabi. Because of the importance of
this poem in summarizing some of the basic elements of *Hikmat* as it
was revived during the Safawid period, English translation of some of
the verses is given below.

“Heaven with these stars is clear, pleasing, and beautiful,
Whatever is there above has below it a form.[^73]
The form below, if by the ladder of gnosis
Is trodden upward, becomes the same as its principle.
No outward apprehension can understand this saying,
Whether it be that of an Abu Nasr or of an Abu ‘Ali Sina.[^74]

If life were not an accident under this ancient heaven,
These bodies would be forever alive and erect.
But whatever is an accident must first have a substance,
The intellect is our loquacious witness to this claim.
If one can obtain these qualities[^75] form the sun,
The sun is itself light and shines upon all things while keeping the
unity.

The intellect form which is endless and immortal
Of the life of the universe, I say that if thou knowest the relation of
the soul and the body,
In the heart of every particle, then life becomes both evident and
hidden.
God has placed seven heavens above us,
And seven others on the other side of the world in the life to come.
Thou canst reach heaven by their means,
Be true and walk the straight path for there is no falsehood there.
He who worships the world, the door of heaven will never open to him,
The doors will not open even if he stands before them.
He who is annihilated in Him finds eternal life,
He who is busy with himself, his affair is doubtless a failure.
The jewel is hidden in the mysteries of the ancient sages,
Only he who is wise can discover the meaning of these mysteries.

Pass beyond these words for they are forsaken by the people of the
world,
Find the Truth and tread its path, if thou art righteous.
Whatever is outside the essence will do thee no good,
Make thyself harmonious whether it be today or tomorrow.
The Being that is pure has no limit or description,
It is neither outside of us, nor with us, nor without us.

A beautiful thought is only beneficial when combined with virtuous
deeds,
A thought with virtuous action is competent and beautiful.
To talk of goodness is not like doing good,
The name of sweetmeat on the tongue is not like sweetmeat itself....
In this world and the next, with the world and without it,
We can say all these of Him, yet He is above all that.

The intellect is a ship, passion a whirlpool, and knowledge the mast,
God is the shore and the whole cosmos the sea.
The shore is reached with certainty; the sea of the possible has become
the necessary...[^76]
How good it would be if the sages before us had said everything
completely,
So that the opposition of those who are not complete[^77]would be
removed.

Desire keeps the soul in bondage in this world,
While thou hast desire, thy feet are tied.
Each wish in this world is followed by another wish,
The wish must be sought beyond which there is no other.”

Mir Findiriski occupied himself not only with metaphysics and the
theoretical sciences but also with the sciences of society, of
traditional society in which the social structure itself has a direct
bearing in metaphysical principles. In this treatise on arts and
sciences *(sana‘iyyah)*,[^78] he distinguishes 12 vocations or arts and
sciences in society depending upon the subject with which each one
deals. The subjects of the arts and sciences he enumerates are as
follows: (1) The subject is universal and the discussion concerns
knowledge as well as action from both of which there comes only good,
(2) the subject is universal and the discussion concerns both knowledge
and action from both of which there comes evil, (3) the subject is
universal and the discussion concerns knowledge from which there comes
only good, (4) the subject is universal and the discussion concerns
knowledge from which there comes evil, (5) the subject is universal and
the discussion concerns action from which there comes only good, and (6)
the subject is universal and the discussion concerns action from which
there comes evil.

To this list Mir Findriski adds a series of arts and sciences the
subject of which is no longer universal. These include: (7) those arts
and sciences the subject of which is particular and the discussion
concerns knowledge and action from which there comes only good, (8) the
subject is particular and the discussion concerns knowledge and action
from which there comes evil, (9) the subject in particular and the
discussion concerns only knowledge from which there comes only good,
(10) the subject is particular and the discussion concerns the knowledge
from which there comes evil, (11) the subject particular and the
discussion concerns only action from which there comes only good, and,
finally (12) the subject is particular and the discussion concerns only
action which there comes evil.[^79]

The first 12 categories listed above concerns the prophets, saints, and
sages, the most exalted of men, who maintain the order of the universe,
there being a prophet for each cycle of history and each people. The
second concerns those who oppose the prophets and sages, those who are
the deniers of truth, and the sophists and agnostics who are the lowest
of men. The fourth class is the opposite of the first, i.e., the enemies
of *Hikmat* and theology, of those who, seeing differences in the
expressions of the various sages, have denied the one truth which lies
behind the diversity.[^80] The fifth category is that of the jurists
*(juqaha’)* who cultivate the practical sciences, and the sixth is that
of their opposites like Mazdak,[^81] who concern themselves only with
their bodies and remain oblivious of the order of both this world and
the next.

The last six categories concern particular arts and sciences. The first
of them, or the seventh in our list, is that of professionals in
particular arts, like physicians, engineers, and astronomers, and the
eighth is that of their opposites, i.e. those who misuse each of these
arts. The ninth category is like the particular sense of an organ of the
body and concerns people who have only a theoretical knowledge of
various arts and sciences, like music, medicine, or the principles of
jurisprudence. The tenth is its opposite and in it are included those
who make a false claim to know those sciences theoretically. The 11th
category concerns arts and sciences which are limited to a particular
subject and the 12th its opposite which concerns the rejection of these
same arts and sciences.

In this classification we can already see the hierarchic structure of
society at the top of which stand the prophets and saints in whom
knowledge and action are combined, below them the *hukama’* and the
theologians, then those concerned with practical arts and the particular
sciences. The nobility of a vocation in each case depends upon the
nobility of the subject-matter treated. Likewise, the degree of
degradation of a person or group depends upon the truth that has been
denied, the higher the degree of a truth, the baser is he who denies it.
The categories outlined by Mir Findiriski reflect the hierarchy within
*Hikmat* itself. In both cases the religious sciences, like theology,
and the wisdom of the prophets and saints above all the other
categories.

### Mulla Muhsin Faid-i Kashi

Mohammad ibn Shah Murtada ibn Shah Mahmud, better known as Mulla Muhsin
or Faid-i Kashi, is the most famous of the sages of the generation
following that of Mir Damad, Sheikh-i Baha’i, and Mir Findiriski. Born
in Kashan in 1007/1600, he spent some years at Qum and then went to
Shiraz to complete his studies with Mulla Sadra whose daughter he later
married. He also studied with Mir Damad and Sheikh-i Baha’i but was more
closely associated with Mulla Sadra. Just as Mir Damad produced a series
of outstanding students, the best known of whom was Mulla Sadra – the
greatest of the Safawid Hakims to whom we shall turn in a separate
chapter – Mulla Sadra in turn produced a galaxy of famous students among
whom Faid-i Kashi and Mulla ‘Abd al-Razzaq Lahiji, both his sons-in-law,
are the most important.[^82]

The genius of Mulla Sadra conisisted largely in unifying the three
perspectives of formal revelation of *shar‘*, purification of the soul
leading to illumination *(kashf)*, and rational demonstration
*(falsafah)* into a single universal vision in which all these paths
lead to the same truth. All of his followers sought to preserve the
unity established by their master, each emphasizing some one aspect of
it. For example, later sages like Qadi Sa‘id Qumi, Mulla ‘Ali Nuri, and
Aqa ‘Ali Zunuzi sought to correlate revelation and reason, and Aqa
Mohammad Bidabadi and Aqa Mohammad Rida’ Qumshihi, reason and gnosis.
Others continued the path trodden by Mulla Sadra himself and emphasized
the harmony of all the three paths mentioned above. Mulla Muhsin Faid
and Haji Mulla Hadi Sabziwari, the most famous Persian thinker of the
last century, belong to the last group. Mulla Muhsin’s writings display
a harmonious integration of reason, revelation, and gnosis with lesser
emphasis upon reason. He succeeded perhaps more than anyone else in the
Shi‘ah world to bring about a complete harmony between Law and spiritual
life, *Shari‘ah* and *Tariqah*.

In many ways Mulla Muhisn may be considered to be a Shi‘ah Ghazālī, not
only because of his pre-occupation with harmonizing the exoteric and the
esoteric views, but also for his treatment of a spiritualized ethics
which forms the requirements for the following Path. He even re-wrote
the well-known *Ihya’ ‘Ulum al-Din* of Ghazālī under the name of
*al-Mahajjat al-Baida’ fi Ihya’ al-Ihya’*, substituting traditions
(Hadith) from the Shi‘ah sources for those from the Sunni ones given by
Ghazālī.[^83]

The writings of Mulla Muhsin both in Arabic and Persian are too numerous
to mention here.[^84] Among the more famous, one may name *Haqq
al-Yaqin, ‘Ain al-Yaqin*, and *‘Ilm al-Yaqin* on *Hikmat*, *al-Safi,
al-Wafi*, and *al-Shafi* on Qur’anic commentary and Hadith, *Mafatih
al-Sharaya‘* on jurisprudence, *al-Tathir* on ethics, *Jala al-‘uyun,
Zad al-Salik*, and *Kalimat-i Maknunah* on Sufism, numerous treatises on
esoteric meaning of acts of worship, on various invocations, on
particular sciences including astronomy, selections from and
commentaries on the *Rasa’il* on the Ikhwan al-Safa, the *Futuhat
al-Makkiyyah* of ibn ‘Arabi, and the *Mathnawi* of Jalal al-Din Rumi,
and a large collection of poems consisting mostly of verses of Sufi
inspiration. His works both in poetry and prose have remained very
popular in Persia and ethical and social teachings have attracted
particular attention in the past decades.

Mulla Muhsin’s thought marks the final integration of *Hikmat* into
Shi‘ism. *Hikmat* in Persia had been moving in this direction for many
centuries from the time of al-Farabi and ibn Sina. Suhrawardi Maqtul
took the decisive step in regarding knowledge as personal illumination
by the heavenly guide or “guardian angel.” Mulla Sadra following him
made the universal intellect the criterion of knowledge. Mulla Muhsin
took a further step in this direction in identifying this intellect with
the Shi‘ah Imams, in whom the light of Mohammad *(al-nur
al-Mohammadiyyah)* is manifested and who are called the innocent
*(ma‘sum)* intellects.[^85] Only by union with them, with the pure
intellects, can one gain ultimate knowledge.

One of the important treatises of Mulla Muhsin, in which gnosis,
*Hikmat* and *Shar‘* are blended in characteristic fashion in the
*Kalimat-i Maknunah* written in a mixture of Arabic and Persian.[^86] It
treats a complete cycle of theoretical gnosis so that its discussion
gives a fair example of the totality of Mulla Muhsin’s general
perspective.

The work begins by assuring the reader that there is no way of reaching
the essence of the Truth because the Truth encompasses all things.
Everything is its manifestation, but only the *elite* *(khwass)* know
what they see. Being is like light, but since its opposite does not
exist in this world as in the case of light which stands opposed to
darkness, one cannot come to know it so easily. God is hidden because of
the excess of His light, no veil can cover Him because every veil is a
limitation and God is above all limitations.[^87] Being *is* the Truth
which subsists by Itself, while everything else subsists by consisting
only of a reflection of Being itself.

The divine attributes and names are identical with the divine essence,
while in themselves they are distinct. Likewise the forms of all beings
in the divine intellect, i.e., the quiddities or essences, the *mahiyat*
or *a‘yan al-thabitah*,[^88] are in one respect identical with and in
another distinct from essence. Each being subsists by one of the divine
names and its very existence consists in the invocation of that name.
The archetype, *a‘yan al-thabitah*, have two aspects; on the one hand,
they are hidden and Truth is manifest, and on the other, Truth is the
mirror in which they are reflected, in which case truth is hidden and
they are manifest. These two aspects correspond also to two states of
contemplation: one of Truth *(Haqq)* and the other of creation
*(khalq)*. The perfect gnostic contemplates both mirrors, he sees the
cosmos as a mirror in which Truth is reflected, and his own essence as a
mirror in which both the cosmos and Truth are reflected. Mulla Muhisn
advises the sage to take a further step in eliminating himself also so
that there remains nothing but Truth.[^89]

Mulla Muhsin follows certain earlier Sufis in considering the world to
be re-created at every instant,[^90] so that its continuity is only
apparent. The real continuity is “vertical,” i.e. between Truth and its
manifestations, not “horizontal” and “substantial,” i.e. between parts
and instances of the created world. The world is like a flowing stream
which, although apparently a continuous and subsistent body, changes at
every instant and a new particle coming to take its place.

The creation of the world or the effusion of unity into multiplicity
does not take place immediately but through the divine names, each
creature being the theophany *(tajalli)* of a particular name. The name
Allah is the supreme master *(rabb al-arbab)* of all the names of
theophany of which is the universal man *(al-insan al-kamil)*. Although
the stages in which creation comes into being are numerous, Mullah
Muhsin names five degrees which mark the main steps. In the first degree
is the divine essence which is above all distinctions and
determinations; in the second are the names which are the manifestations
of Truth in the world of divinity, *uluhiyyah*, in the third are the
divine acts and world of spirits which are the manifestations of Truth
in the world of Lordship, *rububiyyah*, in the fourth is the world of
“ideas” and imagination *(khayul)*[^91] which is the manifestation of
Truth in the world of varying forms, and in the fifth is the world of
the senses which is the manifestation of Truth in determined forms.[^92]
Everything in the physical world has its archetype in the world of
imagination, while everything in the world of lordship is a form of one
of the divine names, each name an aspect of the divine essence.

Man alone among creatures is able to cast aside these veils and reach
the divine origin of things. He has a particular soul brought into being
with his body, which soul is independent of matter, and also a universal
soul which exists before the body and is manifested only in the
spiritual *elite*. Moreover, man has a vegetative soul consisting of the
faculties of attraction, repulsion, digestion, growth, and retention
originating in the heart, a sacred rational soul *(nafs-i natiqah-i
qudsiyyah)* with the faculties of meditation *(fikr)* and invocation
*(dhikr)*, and the universal divine soul *(nafs-i kulliyyah-i
ilahiyyah)*, not possessed by all men, with the faculty of reaching the
station of annihilation *(fana’)* in the Divine.[^93]

The goal of each man should be to awaken the potential faculties within
him until all the accidental obstacles are removed and he becomes
identified with the universal man, the theophany of the supreme name.
Then he will be able to contemplate Absolute Being and thereby fulfil
the purpose of all creation and sustain the whole universe.

The universal man is either a prophet or a saint. Absolute prophethood
*(nubuwwat-i mutlaq)* is the supreme station, the perfect “form” of
unity, the first pen, and the Pole of Poles, *qutb al-aqtab*, upon which
all the prophets and saints depend. The inner *(atin)* dimension of this
prophecy is absolute sainthood *(wilayat-i mutlaq)*. Mulla Muhsin
identifies absolute prophethood with the light of Mohammad, and absolute
sainthood with the light of ‘Ali. The prophethood of all prophets
depends upon absolute prophecy as the sainthood of all saints depends
upon absolute sainthood. Prophethood began with Adam and found its
completion in Prophet Mohammad. Sainthood will reach its completion
gradually until it culminates in the 12th Imam, the Mehdi. Absolute
prophethood is the treasure of all possible perfections and the whole
cosmos in the expansion and manifestation of its inner qualities.[^94]

Gnosis and illumination are themselves the fruit of the tree of
prophethood. Mulla Muhsin insists that the source of *Hikmat* was
originally the sacred spirit of the prophets; this wisdom, however, was
misunderstood and misinterpreted by men of the later period, i.e. the
Peripatetics and other later schools of Greek philosophy, and was
revived only in the light of the revelation of the Prophet of Islam and
his family. He who wishes to be initiated into it must, therefore, seek
the aid of the prophets and saints and this can be achieved only by
invocation and meditation and the purification of the heart. Only he who
has trodden this path and become a true Hakim can be considered the real
heir to the saints and the prophets.[^95]

### Mulla Mohammad Baqir Majlisi

One cannot terminate a study of the intellectual life of the Safawid
period without mentioning the two Majlisis, father and son, especially
the son Mohammad Baqir who stands as one of the outstanding figures of
the period. The first Majlisi, Mohammad Taqi (1003/1594 – 1070/1659),
was one of the students of Sheikh-i Baha’i and an outstanding theologian
and Sufi of his time.[^96] His son, the second Majlisi (1037/1628 –
1110/1699), however, surpassed his father in fame and power and became
the most dominant figure of Shi‘ism. Having studied with his own father,
Mulla Khalil Qazwini and Mulla Muhsin Faid, he in turn became the master
of over a thousand disciples including Sayyid Ni‘matullah Jaza’iri, well
known for his many writings, especially the account of his own life as a
student.

The second Majlisi is especially famous for revivifying the various
branches of the Shi‘ah sciences and for assembling the writings of the
earlier doctors of Shi‘ism and prophetic *hadith* into encyclopaedias
which have henceforth become the main reference for all who undertakes
religious education in the Shi‘ah *madrasahs*. The most important and
famous of these is the *Bihar al-Anwar* summarized in the *Safinat
al-Bihar* of Sheikh ‘Abbas Qumi, the lithographed edition of which
occupies 24 volumes: *Haqq al-Yaqin* in *Usul, Hayat al-Qulub*, a
commentary upon the *Mir’at al’Uqul*, a 12 volume commentary writing
career enters into purely intellectual *(‘aqli)* questions and treats of
many essential religious subjects, especially eschatology and the
conditions before the appearance of Mehdi, from an intellectual rather
than a purely “confessional” point of view.[^97]

Of special interest in the religious life of Persia is Majlisi’s
opposition to Sufism and even the denial that his own father, the first
Majlisi, was a Sufi.[^98] Furthermore, supported by the Court and many
of the theologians and doctors, he opposed the intellectual method of
the Hakims and philosophers with the result that both the Sufis and the
Hakims fell into disgrace and had a lot of difficulty in official
religious circles. The dynasty which had begun as the extension of Sufi
order ended by opposing all Sufism and gnosis itself. It was not long
after the death of the second Majlisi in fact that the Safawid dynasty
itself fell before the Afghans, and Ispahan, the historic as well as the
symbolic centre of this period of great intellectual activity was sacked
and its libraries burnt.

D. Conclusion
-------------

This form of wisdom or *Hikmat*, some features of which we have sought
to outline here, did not die with the termination of the Safwid dynasty.
In the 13th/18th century Sufism was revived in Persia by Ma‘sum ‘Ali
Shah and Shah Tahir Dakani, two Ni‘matullahi masters sent by Rida’ ‘Ali
Shah from the Deccan to Persia. It was persecuted for a period but began
to expand with the establishment of the Qajars. Likewise, the school of
*Hikmat* continued through the students of Mulla Sadra and others from
one generation to another until it produced Sheikh Ahmad Absai’i, the
founder of the Sheikhi movement,[^99] Haji Mulla Hadi Sabizwari, and
several other outstanding figures in the Qajar period, the light of
whose teachings has not yet disappeared from the horizon of Persia. One
can hardly understand the intellectual life of Islam in its totality
without taking into account this last major period of Muslim
intellectual activity, lasting from the Safawid period to the present,
to the understanding of which we hope this chapter will serve as an
introduction and as an incentive for further exploration.

[^1]: A few authors like Gobineau, Donaldson, and E. G. Browne have
touched upon certain aspects of Shi‘ism in their writings. The only
European author, however, who has delved with serious intention into the
Shi‘ah intellectual world is Henri Corbin, who during the past 20 years
has done much to introduce the rich heritage of Shi‘ism, especially as
it has developed in Persia, to the Western world.

[^2]: For the meaning of this word which denotes wisdom refer to the
chapter on Shihab al-Din Suhrawardi Maqtul.

[^3]: Sheikh Safi (647/1249 – 735/1334), one of the most important of
Shi‘ah Sufi saints, is still greatly respected by the Sufis, his tomb in
Ardibil has remained until today an important place of pilgrimage. Being
the disciple of Sheikh Zahid Gilani he was already a significant figure
in his own day as testified by the biographical works like the Safwat
al-Safa’ by ibn Bazzaz, and Rashid al-Din Fadl Allah’s letters to the
saint and to the governor of Ardibil in his Munsha‘at-i Rashidi. See
also E. G. Browne, A Literary History of Persia, vol 4, Cambridge
University Press, Cambridge, 1924, Chap. 2.

[^4]: For a history of the Safawid period, see E. G. Browne, op. cit.,
vol 4; L. Lockhart, The Fall of the Safawid Dynasty and the Afghan
Occupation of Persia, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1958, and
the traditional sources of which some of the more important include the
Safawat al-Safa’ by ibn Bazzaz, Ahsan al-Tawarikh by Hassan Baik Rumlu,
Zubdat al-Tawarikh by Mohammad Muhsin ibn ‘Abd al-Karim, and the
universal history Nasikh al-Tawarikh by Mriza taqi Sipihr.

[^5]: The purpose of theology is to protect the truth of a revelation
against false reasoning; its role is, therefore, defensive. It is the
shell which protects the inner spiritual life, not that life itself. If
there were no danger of rationalism and false reasoning, there would be
no need for theology. We, therefore, see theology coming into being with
rationalistic philosophy, and where there is no tendency toward
rationalism, there is no theology as this word is currently understood.

[^6]: For a discussion of the meaning of ishraqi wisdom, refer to the
chapter on Suhrawardi Maqtul.

[^7]: The reason why the pre-Safawid sages of Persian like ‘Ali Turkah
Ispahani and ibn Abi Jumhur as well as the Safawid authors themselves
have been neglected in the Western world, is that the quality of their
wisdom is primarily gnostic (‘irfani) like that of Sheikh al-Akbar Muhyi
al-Din ibn ‘Arabi by whose doctrines they were all influenced, that like
him they can be understood neither by the rationalistic philosophers nor
by the mystics as they have come to be understood since the Renaissance.

[^8]: For the name of some of these Arab Shi‘ah scholars, see E. G.
Browne, op. cit., vol. 4, Chap. 8.

[^9]: The science of Usul as an independent science has grown into
monumental proportions only in the past few centuries reaching its
height in the hands of Sheikh Murtada Ansari, the famous doctor of the
Qajar period, who only a century ago made Usul into a science matching
Kalam in its logical subtleties.

[^10]: Shi‘ah theology reached its height in the seventh/13th century in
the hands of men like Khuwaja Nasir al-Din Tusi and ‘Allamah-i Hilli.

[^11]: See the chapter on Suhrawardi Maqtul. Generally, Hikmah in Arabic
or Hikmat in Persian means wisdom in addition to the particular sense
given to it as a divine science.

[^12]: For the series of commentators and expositors of ishraqi wisdom,
see the chapter on Suhraw2ardi Maqtul.

[^13]: It is unfortunate that in books treating of the relation between
faith and reason in Islam like A. J. Arberry’s Revelation and Reason
inIslam, London, 1957, most of these authors are not taken into serious
consideration.

[^14]: For an account of the doctrines of ibn ‘Arabi, see T. Burekardt
(Tr), La sagesse des prophetes, Paris, 1955; also idem, Introduction to
Sufi Doctrine, tr. M. Matheson, Sh. Mohammad Ashraf, Lahore, 1959,which
is an excellent general introduction to ibn ‘Arabi’s school of Sufism.
See also Corbin, L’imagination creatrice dans la souflame d’Ibn ‘Arabi,
Flammarion, Paris, 1958, which contains some useful chapters on his
ideas and their spread in the east.

[^15]: See S.M. Sadr, Sheikh ‘Ala alpDaulah Simnani, Danish Press,
Teheran, 1334/1915.

[^16]: This great Persian Sufi poet and sage has written several
well-known summaries of ibn ‘Arabi’s doctrine including the Lawa’ih
translated by Whinfeld and Qazwini, Luzac & Co., London, 1928, the
Asha’at al-Lama’at, and the Naqd al-Nusus.

[^17]: The Kitab al-Mujli of ibn Abi Jumhur and Jami‘ al-Asrar and Jami‘
al-Haqa’iq of Mulla Haidar ‘Ali Amuli are among the most important
sources of Shi‘ah gnostic doctrines.

[^18]: The best traditional sources for these earlier Shi‘ah authors are
the Raudat al-Jannat of Mohammad Baqir Khunsari, lithographed edition,
Teheran, 1306/1888; al-Dhari‘ah of Agh Buzurg Tihrani, al Gharra Press,

[^22]: Sheikh-i Baha’i is said to have built a bath house name Gulkan
which had always had hot water without any fuel being used in it. When
it was pulled down, people discovered a single candle burning under the
water tank.

[^23]: This book on mathematics which helped greatly in reviving the
study of the mathematical sciences in Persia was a standard text-book
for centuries and has been commented upon several times and translated
into Persian by Mohammad Amin Najafi Hijazi Qumi and into German by G.
H. F. Nesselmann who published the text and the translation in Berlin in
1843. Sheikh-i Baha’i revived the study of mathematics and astronomy in
Persia after 100 years of neglect, having himself learned these sciences
in Herat.

[^24]: For a list of the nearly 90 works attributed to him, see his
Kulliyat-i Ash‘ar-i Farsi, ed. M. Tauhidiput, Mahmudi Press, Teheran,
1336/1917, pp. 42 – 45.

[^25]: Ibid., pp 164 – 66.

[^26]: Intoxication symbolizes ecstasy and spiritual union.

[^27]: Maulan Jala’i al-Din Rumi is commonly referred to as Maulawi in
Persian. This verse refers to Maulawi’s well-known rejection of
rationalism in favour of gnosis. (The leg of rationalist is a wooden
leg...).

[^28]: Love symbolizes gnosis or the science which comes through
contemplation and illumination rather than analysis and discursive
thought.

[^29]: Reference is to the famous theologian Imam Fakhr al-Din Razi.

[^30]: This verse is in Arabic and is repeated immediately with only a
little change in Persian.

[^31]: That is, he is like a beast of burden.

[^32]: Reference is to the wisdom of the Sufis are contrasted with that
of the Greeks, the Hikmat-i Imani and the Hikmat-i Yunani.

[^33]: The Prophet Mohammad (upon whom be peace).

[^34]: Sheikh-i Bhah’i, Kulliyat..., pp. 18 – 19.

[^35]: This theme appears in certain Hermetic writings, the Acts of
Thomas, the Grail story, as well as in Islam in the visionary narratives
of ibn Sina and many of Suhrawardi’s gnostic tracts like Qissah Ghurbat
al-Gharbiyyah; see H. Corbin, Avicenne et le recit visionnaire, Institut
Franco-iranien, Teheran, and A. Maisonneuve, Peris, 1952 – 54, vol. 1,
chap. 3, and Suhrawardi, Oeuvres philosophiques et mystiques, vol. 2,

[^36]: Sheikh-i Baha-i, Kulliyat..., p. 23.

[^37]: A city in the south of Arabia with which the name of the Queen of
Sheba is associated.

[^38]: La makan, meaning beyond the world of cosmic manifestation.
Suhrawardi refers to this point which is the top of the cosmic mountain
Qaf, as na kuja abad; see Suhrawardi, “Le bruissement de l’aile de
Gabriel,” tr. H. Corbin and P. Kraus, Journal Asiatique, Juillet-Sept.,
1935, pp. 41 – 42.

[^39]: For an account of the life and writings of Mir Damad, see M.
Tunikabuni, Qisas al-‘Ulmaa, pp. 333 – 35; Raihanat al-Adab, vol. 4, pp.

pp. 146 – 47; Danish Pazhuh, Fihrist..., Vol. 3, 1, p. 152 and the good
Introduction of his life and thought by Corbin, “Confessions extateiqes
de Mir Damad,” pp. 340ff.

[^40]: It is said that he had a lot of interest in the life of the bees
and had accumulated a good deal of observational data about them.

[^41]: For an account of these and other students of Mir Damad, see H.
Corbin, op. cit., pp 345 – 46.

[^42]: The “Yamani philosophy” means the wisdom revealed by God to man
through the prophets and through illumination; Yaman (Yemen) symbolizes
the right or oriental (Mashriqi) side of the valley in which Moses heard
the message of God. It is, therefore, the source of divine illumination
in contrast to the Occident, the source of Peripatetic philosophy, the
Occident symbolizing darkness and being on the plane of philosophy, i.e.
rationalism. See. H. Corbin, Le recit d’initiation et l’hermetisme en
Iran,” Eranos Jahrbuch, vol. 17, 1949, pp. 136 – 37. For the symbols of
the orient and Occident in ishraqi wisdom see the chapter on Suhrawardi
Maqtul.

[^43]: This major work has been commented upon several times. One of its
most curious commentaries is that of Mohammad ibn ‘Ali Rida ibn Aqajani,
one of the students of Mulla Sadra; it runs over a thousand pages.

[^44]: These last two works are among the important books on Hikmat in
Persian, the others being in Arabic. Some manuscripts attribute Sidrat
al-Muntaha to Mir Damad’s student, Sayyid Ahmad ‘Alawi, although in the
Jadhawat Mir Damad refers to this work as being his own. In any case it
is a product of his school.

[^45]: For a translation and discussion of this work, see H. Corbin, op.
cit., pp. 350ff.

[^46]: See for example the Shifa’ or Najat of ibn Sina and the Kitab
al-Mu‘tabar of Abu al-Barakat al-Baghdadi. In some cases as in the
Danish Nameh-i Ala’i of ibn Sina and many later ishraqi writings, the
book begins with metaphysics and then proceeds to natural philosophy in
the manner of Plato rather than Aristotle.

[^47]: See Mir Damad, Qabasat, Sheikh Mahmud Burujirdi, Shiraz,
1315/1897.

[^48]: For a general discussion of this question, see L. Gardet, La
pensee religieuse d’Avicenne, J. Vrin, Paris, 1951, pp. 38ff, and A. K.
Coomarasawany, Time and Eternity, Artibus Asiac, Ascona, 1947, Chap. 4.

[^49]: Mr. Dmad, Qabasat, pp. 1 – 10.

[^50]: Ibid, p. 7.

[^51]: Mir Damad argues that time itself is the measure of the movement
of the heavens and a condition for the existence of this world so that
one cannot speak of a time before the creation of the world; Qabasat, p.
20.

[^52]: For a comparison and affinity of these ideas with those of ibn
‘Arabi, see La sagesse des prophets, Chapters One and Two.

[^53]: In presenting this view of creation, Mir Damad draws heavily on
earlier writings from Plato’s Timaeus and the so-called Theology of
Aristotle to the Shifa’ of ibn Sina and the Kitab al-Mu‘tabar of Abu
al-Barakat. In each case he also criticizes the view of the previous
writers who considered the world either to be eternal in itself or
created in time from outside. Mir Damad’s Risalah fe Madhhab Aristatalis
is devoted to a discussion of the difference between the views of Plato
and Aristotle on the question time and eternity drawing on Farabi’s
Kitab Jam‘ bain al-Ra’yain. Mir Damad’s treatise is published on the
margin of the Qabasat, pp. 140 – 57.

[^54]: The Jadhawat (Bombay, lithographed edition, 1302/1884, pp. 203)
begins with a poem in prais of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib the first lines of
which are as follows: Oh herald of the nation and the soul of the
Prophet, The ring of thy knowledge surrounds the ears of the
intelligences. Oh thou in whom the book of existence terminates, To whom
the account or creation refers The glorified treasure of the revelation,
Thou art the holy interpreter of its secrets.

[^55]: Suhrawardi also divides the angelic world into the longitudinal
and the latitudinal orders, a division the influence of which upon Mir
Damad is easy to discern. On the question of angelology the Safawid
sages remained faithful to the ishraqi scheme combined with that of ibn
Sina. See the chapter of Suhrawardi Maqtul.

[^56]: The natures refer to the warm and cold, wet and dry, and the
elements to the four traditional ones, fire, air, water and earth.

[^57]: Mir Damad and Mulla Sadra, unlike Aristotle and his followers,
posit some form of matter in every degree of formal manifestation.

[^58]: Mir Damad mentions that there are 1,400 species of animals, 800
belonging to sea and 600 belonging to land.

[^59]: Jadhaudat, pp. 2 – 13.

[^60]: Ibid., pp. 13 – 18.

[^61]: Ibid., pp. 18 – 28..

[^62]: Ibid., pp. 28ff.

[^63]: In discussing tauhid, Mir Damad draws not only on ibn Sina and
Suhrawardi but even on the Nahj al-Balaghah of the first Shi‘ah Imam,
the Sahifih-i Sajjadiyyah of the fourth Imam and other Shi‘ah sources.
He regards Pythagoras as the Imam of the Seitic sages (Hukama-i Sami)
and one who received his wisdom through revelation. This view going back
to Philo is held among the great majority of the Muslim sages and
historians of philosophy.

[^64]: Jadhawat, pp. 38ff.

[^65]: This intermediary region plays an important role in the thought
of Mulla Sadra and even more in the writings of Sheikh Ahmad Asha’i, the
founder of the Sheikhis who still survive in Kerman.

[^66]: These are two famous mythical cities through which initiates pass
in their journeys and they appear often in initiatic narratives in
Persian.

[^67]: Jadhawat, pp. 54 – 63.

[^68]: Ibid., p. 100.

[^69]: Ibid., p. 103. In the same work, p. 92, the last part of which is
wholly devoted to the important traditional Muslim science of jafr, he
considers numbers to be the principles of beings, the illumination from
the intelligible world, the “Michael of the degree of existence” and
adds that if a person acquires all the knowledge of numbers he will gain
compete knowledge of the physical world. This view is very close to that
of Pythagoras and his school. See Aristotle, Metaphysica, Book 5. In
both cases number is not just the quantity of modern mathematics, but a
“personality,” an entity which possesses a definite qualitative aspect.
For the notion of the Pythagoreans, see H. Keyser, Akroasis, Verlag Gert
Jatje, Stuttgart, 1947.

[^70]: For a profound study of this subject as developed before Mir
Damad, see S. T. Burckhardt, La cle spirituelles de l’astrologie
musulmane d’apres Ibn ‘Arabi, Editions Traditionelle, Paris, 1950.

[^71]: The other two are Sheikh-i Baha-i and Mir Damad who were close
friends of Mir Findiriski and shared with him the respect and honour of
the Safawid Court. For an account of the life of Mir. Findiriski whose
complete name is Mir Abu al-Qasim ibn Mirza Baik Husain Findiriski, see
Raihanat al-Adab, vol. 3 pp. 231 – 32.

[^72]: The story is told of him in most biographies that one day Shah
‘Abbas, trying to admonish him for mixing with the common people, said,
“I hear some of the leading scholars and sages have been attending
cock-fights in the bazaar.” Mir Findirski, knowing that the remark was
meant for him, replied, “Your majesty, rest assured, I was present but I
saw none of the ‘ulama’ there.” See Riyad al-‘Arifin, p. 276.

[^73]: The text of this qasidah and the commentary by Khalkali have been
published in Teheran, lithographed edition, 1325/1907. This verse means
the celestial archetypes of Platonic ideas and their earthly reflections
or shadows.

[^74]: Reference is to Farabi and ibn Sina, the two early masters of
masha’i philosophy in Islam.

[^75]: “Qualities” means multiplicity of forms which become evident only
when light shines upon them.

[^76]: The later Muslim authors following ibn Sina divide reality into
the Necessary Being (wajib al-wufud), the possible being (mumkin
al-wufud) and the being that is impossible (mumtani‘ al-wujud).

[^77]: All the arguments begin because each side considers only one
aspect of the Truth. But those who are “complete,” that is, have a
vision of the totality of the Truth, never enter into arguments.

[^78]: Mir Findiriski, Raisaleh-i Sand‘iyyah, Sa‘adat Press, Teheran,
1317 Solar.

[^79]: Ibid., pp. 13 – 54.

[^80]: Mir Findiriski adds that all the Greek philosophers before
Aristotle were saying the same thing in different languages and that if
one is instructed in the secrets (rumuz) of Hikmat, Hindu wisdom, and
the Theology of Aristotle (i.e. the Enneads of Plotinus), all the
different expressions will have the same meaning for him.

[^81]: Mir Findiriski mentions Mazdak as the person why by a false
interpretation of the Avesta preached the communization of women and
property. He also mentions Carmathians (Qaramitah) as belonging to this
group.

[^82]: Mulla-i Lahiji, known as Fayyad author of several important
treatises on Hikmat in Persian and Arabic mentioned already, deserves a
separate study as one of the major figures of this period. There are
brief accounts of him in E. G. Browne, op. cit., vol 4, pp. 408 – 09,
435. See also the introduction by Sayyid Mohammad Mishkat to the new
edition of al-Mahajjat al-Baida’, vol. 1, Islamiyyah Press, Teheran,
1380 Solar, in which the significance of Faid’s doctrines and in
particular the present work on ethics is discussed.

[^83]: See Mulla Muhsin Faid-i kasha, al-Mahajjat al-Baida‘ fi Ihya’
al-Ihya’, four volumes, Islamiyyah Press, Teheran, 1380 – 81 Solar, in
which in ten sections he deals with Sufi ethics based on Shi‘ah sources
but following closely the model of Ihya’.

[^84]: The Raihanat al-Adab, vol. 3, pp. 242 – 44, mentions 120 works by
him. For the account of Mulla Muhsin’s life and writings, consult also
Qisas al-‘Ulama’, pp. 322 – 33, and Riyad al-‘Arifin, pp. 388 – 89.

Henceforth, our reference to this work will be to this edition.

[^88]: For an explanation ofthese terms see Seyyed Hossein Nasr, “Being
and Its polarisation,” Pakistan Philosophical Journal, Vol. 3, No. 2,
October 1959, pp. 8 – 13. In the general discussion among the Hakims as
to whether these essences (or Being) are principal, Mulla Muhsin sides
with the school of isalat-i wujud, the principality of Being, and
considers the mahiyat to be the accidents of Being. This question has
been dealt with in the chapter of Suhrawardi Maqtul.

[^89]: Kalimat-i Maknunah, pp. 31ff. Mulla Muhsin describes these stages
also as the ‘ilm al-yaqin, in which one “sees” nothing but the divine
essence names, and acts; the ‘ain alp-yaqin, in which one “sees” nothing
but the essence and names, and the haqq al-yaqin in which there remains
only the divine ipseity.

[^90]: See T. Burckhardt, Introduction to Sufi Doctrine, pp. 64ff.

[^91]: This term should not be taken in its negative connotation; it has
a positive meaning in Sufi cosmology and marks an intermediate stage
between the sensible world and the spiritual world. See H. Corbin,

his life and writings. Majlisi wrote 13 Arabic and 55 Persian books with
altogether occupy nearly a million and a half lines.

[^98]: He devoted a treatise, the ‘Itiqadat, to rejecting Sufism.

[^99]: Sheikh Ahmad is responsible for the last important religious
movement within Shi‘ism and should be studied separately as a founder of
a particular sect. The leaders of this sect called the Sheikhis claim to
have knowledge of all things, and so each of them from the time of
Sheikh Ahmad to the present has composed a large number of treatises on
all the sciences., For a list of the works of Sheikh Ahmad and other
leaders of the Sheikhis, see Abu al-Qasim ibn Zain al-‘Abidin ibn Karim,
