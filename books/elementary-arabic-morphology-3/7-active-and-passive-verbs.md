Active and Passive Verbs
========================

30. What is the difference between active and passive verbs?

31. What is a passive verb formed from?

30. An active verb mentions its agent, as in **بَرَیَ التِّلمیذُ
قَلَماً.** A passive verb erases its agent and places its objective
compliment as its subject of the predication, as in **بُرِيَ القَلَمُ.**

31. A passive verb is formed from an active transitive verb. If it is in
the preterite tense, the letter before the last letter is given a
*kasrah* and the letters with vowel signs before it are given *dummahs*.
For example: **أُکِلَ.** If the verb is in the aorist tense, the letter
before the last letter is given a *fathah* and the aorist letter is
given a *dummah*. For example: **یُؤکَلُ.**

If the letter before the last letter in the preterite tense is an
*alif*, it will be changed to a *yā'* and the letter before it will be
given a *kasrah*. For example: **صِیمَ.**

If the verb is a hollow verb in the aorist tense, the letter before the
last is changed into an *alif*. For example: **یُعادُ.**
