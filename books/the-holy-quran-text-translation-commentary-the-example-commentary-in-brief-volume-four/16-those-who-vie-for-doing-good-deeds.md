Those Who Vie For Doing Good Deeds
==================================

VERSE NO.55ِ61

Some people rely on wealth and children as a means of achieving
prosperity and happiness, but they are wrong. These can also become a
cause of negligence, and a means of God's tests and trials. Rank,
wealth, children, and power are all attractive and to some extent
useful, but not always and in all cases. Each of these, may have its own
problems and difficulties and may cause Man to forget his God, and even
his duties. If so, they may result in painful punishments in this world,
and damnation in the life to come.

After negating the conceptions of the unbelievers about wealth, power,
and children, reference is made to the party of believers who vie with
one another in doing good.

\`\`Those who are in awe for the fear of their Lord,
And those who believe in the signs of their Lord;
And those who do not associate anything with their Lord.''

The above class of god fearing men are so described that, their heart
is full of anxiety and fear of the reverence for Allah, lest their
charity be not acceptable by their Lord when they return to Him. They
are fearful of the sure encounter with Allah, and yet they are also full
of hope that they will have God's Grace and Mercy:ِ \`\`And those who
give of what they are given, and their hearts are anxious that they are
returning to their Lord.''

وَلاَ نُكَلِّفُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا وَلَدَيْنَا كِتَابٌ يَنطِقُ
بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ(( 62 ))

[ 296 ]

62- AND WE CHARGE NO ONE WITH A DUTY EXCEPT IN EXTENT OF HIS ABILITY,
AND THERE IS A BOOK WITH US THAT SAYS THE TRUTH, AND THEY ARE NOT
OPPRESSED.

بَلْ قُلُوبُهُمْ فِى غَمْرَة مِّنْ هَذَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْمَالٌ مِّنْ دُونِ
ذَلِكَ هُمْ لَهَا عَامِلُونَ(( 63 ))

63- BUT THEIR HEARTS ARE UNAWARE OF THIS (RECORD AND JUDGEMENT) AND
THEY HAVE DEEDS OTHER THAN THAT WHICH THEY ARE DOING.

حَتَّى إِذَا أَخَذْنَا مُتْرَفِيهِمْ بِالْعَذَابِ إِذَا هُمْ
يَجْأَرُونَ(( 64 ))

64- UNTIL, WHEN WE SEIZED IN PUNISHMENT THOSE OF THEM WHO LIVED IN
ABUNDANCE, THEN THEY BEGAN TO HOWL. (CRY FOR HELP)

لاَ تَجْأَرُوا الْيَوْمَ إِنَّكُمْ مِّنَّا لاَ تُنصَرُونَ(( 65 ))

65- (IT WILL BE SAID TO THEM) DO NOT HOWL TO-DAY, THAT YOU WILL NOT BE
HELPED BY US.

قَدْ كَانَتْ آيَاتِى تُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَكُنتُمْ عَلَى أَعْقَابِكُمْ
تَنكِصُونَ(( 66 ))

66- (HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT) MY SIGNS WERE RECITED TO YOU, BUT YOU
WERE TURNING BACK UPON YOUR HEELS?

مُسْتَكْبِرِينَ بِهِ سَامِراً تَهْجُرُونَ(( 67 ))

67- SHOWING PRIDE AGAINST IT, AND WERE RAVING IN YOUR NIGHT TALKS.

[ 297 ]

**THE COMMENTARY
THE HEARTS THAT ARE SUBMERGED IN IGNORANCE**

VERSE NO.62ِ67 One may say; obtaining the said characteristics and
distinct qualifications, is not an easy task, and only certain men can
reach to such spiritual stage of life. The answer to this is found in
the above verse (NO.62):ِ \`\`We charge no one with a duty except in
extent of his ability ....''

To subject people to a duty according to their capacity, is considered
as a principle, in all Islamic commandments and injunctions that should
be observed. This is because Allah will never charge a soul with any
duty more than it can bear; or beyond the capacity of doing it. He does
not want uneasiness by religion for His servants. He also keeps a true
record of everything, and every act, in a special Book that He keeps. Of
course, such realities can be effective, and are applicable to those who
have a wakeful conscience and an uncontaminated soul. It may not do for
those whose hearts have submerged in ignorance, so much so that doubt
will not leave them throughout their life.

Therefore, the unbelievers live in doubt, and reject the truth until
they are pulled up for punishment, or death overtakes them. They then
will ask for return and repentance, but too late now:ِ \`\`Until when
Allah seizes in punishment, those of them who live in abundance and high
level of welfare. Then they will begin to cry loudly and mournfully for
help; and of course without any use for being too late.''

The reason for such an evil fate of them, is that God's signs and
verses were repeatedly rehearsed to them, but they paid no heed, and
turned their faces with pride. They arrogantly rejected the Message of
their Lord, and indeed deserved such dreadful destiny. [ 298 ]

In the ending of the passage, they are said to have been \`\`SA"MER''
which is from the root word, \`\`SAMAR'' and generally means, night
talks, or moon light.

A favourite amusement of the Arabs in Pagan Era, was their idle talks,
and rehearsal of romantic poetries along the nights. Examples of such
love lirics were hanged down from the ceiling of KAABEH, seven numbers
of which are famous. It is also narrated that the Arab idolaters
gathered together around KAABEH under the moon light, and talked against
our prophet Mohammad (SA).

أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُوا الْقَوْلَ أَمْ جَاءَهُمْ مَّا لَمْ يَأْتِ
آبَاءَهُمُ الاَْوَّلِينَ(( 68 ))

68- DO THEY NOT THEN PONDER OVER THE WORD, (OF GOD) OR THERE HAS COME
TO THEM SOMETHING (NEW) THAT CAME NOT TO THEIR FATHERS OF OLD?

أَمْ لَمْ يَعْرِفُوا رَسُولَهُمْ فَهُمْ لَهُ مُنكِرُونَ(( 69 ))

69- OR DO THEY NOT KNOW THEIR MESSENGER, THAT THEY DENY HIM?

أَمْ يَقُولُونَ بِهِ جِنَّةٌ بَلْ جَاءَهُمْ بِالْحَقِّ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ
لِلْحَقِّ كَارِهُونَ(( 70 ))

70- OR DO THEY SAY HE IS POSSESSED? NOT SO. HE HAS BROUGHT THEM THE
TRUTH, AND MOST OF THEM DISLIKE THE TRUTH.

وَلَوِ اتَّبَعَ الْحَقُّ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ لَفَسَدَتِ السَّمَاوَاتُ
وَالاَْرْضُ وَمَنْ فِيهِنَّ بَلْ أَتَيْنَاهُمْ بِذِكْرِهِمْ فَهُمْ عَنْ
ذِكْرِهِمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ(( 71 ))

71- AND IF TRUTH WOULD FOLLOW THEIR CAPRICES, THE

[ 299 ]

HEAVENS AND THE EARTH, AND ALL THOSE WHO ARE IN THEM WOULD BE
CORRUPTED.

WE HAVE RATHER BROUGHT THEM (THE BOOK IN WHICH IS) THEIR REMINDER, AND
THEY TURN AWAY OF THEIR REMINDER.

أَمْ تَسْأَلُهُمْ خَرْجاً فَخَرَاجُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ
الرَّازِقِينَ(( 72 ))

72- OR DO YOU ASK THEM FOR EXPENSES? BUT THE RECOMPENSE OF YOUR LORD IS
FAR BETTER, AND HE IS THE BEST OF SUSTAINERS.

وَإِنَّكَ لَتَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَى صِرَاط مُّسْتَقِيم(( 73 ))

73- AND YOU, OF SURETY CALL THEM TO A STRAIGHT WAY.

وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالاْخِرَةِ عَنِ الصِّرَاطِ
لَنَاكِبُونَ(( 74 ))

74- AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT IN THE LIFE TO COME ARE DEVIATING FROM
THE STRAIGHT PATH.

**THE COMMENTARY
THE VARIOUS OBJECTIONS**

VERSE NO.68ِ74 Here in this passage, the main cause of the pagan's
denial, and their objections is stated in brief, which includes some
knocking down answer to their flimsy pretexts that they wove. In this
regard, their greatest weakpoint was their lack of thinking. They used
not their minds because their hearts were locked:ِ [ 300 ]

\`\`Do they not ponder over the word of God, or there has come to them
something new, that came not to their fathers of old?'' Qura"n is the
word of God, and if we ponder over its verses and passages, we may
easily understand the Message of God to Man, and become acquainted to
some extent with Allah's Universal Law of creation, and the way that may
lead us to salvation and prosperity.

The proclamation of; Monotheism, Resurrection and the raise of deads,
and Final Judgement was not something new to Arabs, and to have been
announced by Mohammad (SA) for the first time. The Israelites, and
Christians who lived in Arabian peninsula believed these tenets, and had
a brilliant record of the bases of such motives. Also these tenets were
among the principles of the creed of their forefathers, Abraham and
Ishmael. So they had no reason to reject the faith, except that they did
not mind to ponder over the verses of the Book, that Allah sent it down
to them through Mohammad the Messenger of God (SA)

In the third stage of the argument, Qura"n is asking them:ِ \`\`Do they
not know their Messenger, that they deny him?'' The Arabs knew their
apostle Mohammad (SA) and his ancestors much better than their own
children and fathers. They did give him the glorious title of AMIN,
which means trusted or trustworthy, when Mohammad was just a young man
over twenty. Why should then they have denied him when he brought them
the truth? Did he ask them for any worldly reward? Why did they try to
frustrate him in his endeavours which was merely for their own progress
and prosperity? Why was truth so much bitter in their sense of taste?
The next verse refers to the conflict that always exists between the
truth and falsehood:ِ

[ 301 ] \`\`If truth would follow their caprices, the heavens and the
earth and all those who are in them, would be corrupted.''

The above verse has a brief reference to the conflict that always
exists between truth and falsehood. If truth had to follow the desires
of people; these desires are never alike, and in the same level.
Therefore anarchy and disorder would prevail everywhere and over
everything, and eventually would end in corruption and ruin of all
things.

In other word, God has created and maintained the universe through His
wonderful and infinite knowledge. In His universal plan, Allah controls
everything by rightful rules and regulations that are all reasonable,
and based on truth and justice. Therefore, if this universal truth and
the right that holds everything firmly, should follow our vain desires
and caprices, what else can happen except destruction, misery, and
corruption? Then the Law of confusion and chaos would turn everything
upside down, and in that case woe to us and to every living creature.

وَلَوْ رَحِمْنَاهُمْ وَكَشَفْنَا مَا بِهِمْ مِّنْ ضُرّ لَّلَجُّوا فِى
طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ(( 75 ))

75- AND IF WE HAVE MERCY ON THEM, AND RELIEVE THEM FROM WHAT HAS
AFFLICTED THEM (OF MISFORTUNES AND DIFFICULTIES) THEY WILL STILL PERSIST
IN THEIR REBELLION, CONFUSED.

وَلَقَدْ أَخَذْنَاهُمْ بِالْعَذَابِ فَمَا اسْتَكَانُوا لِرَبِّهِمْ
وَمَا يَتَضَرَّعُونَ(( 76 ))

76- AND VERILY WE SEIZED THEM BY TORMENT, BUT THEY NEITHER HUMBLED
THEMSELVES TO THEIR LORD, NOR ENTREATED. (THEY BEGGED NO PARDON FOR
THEIR SINS)

[ 302 ]

حَتَّى إِذَا فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ بَاباً ذَا عَذَاب شَدِيد إِذَا هُمْ
فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ(( 77 ))

77- UNTIL, WHEN WE OPENED ON THEM A DOOR OF SEVERE PUNISHMENT, THEY
THEN ABANDONED TO DESPAIR IN IT.

وَهُوَ الَّذِى أَنشَأَ لَكُمُ السَّمْعَ وَالاَْبْصَارَ وَالاَْفْئِدَةَ
قَلِيلا مَّا تَشْكُرُونَ(( 78 ))

78- AND HE IS WHO CREATED FOR YOU HEARING AND EYES AND HEARTS (FOR
UNDERSTANDING), YET LITTLE IS THE THANKS THAT YOU GIVE.

وَهُوَ الَّذِى ذَرَأَكُمُ فِى الاَْرْضِ وَإِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ(( 79
))

79- AND HE IS WHO CREATED YOU IN THE EARTH, AND TO HIM YOU SHALL BE
RETURNED.

وَهُوَ الَّذِى يُحْىِ وَيُمِيتُ وَلَهُ اخْتِلاَفُ الَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ
أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ(( 80 ))

80- AND HE IS WHO GIVES LIFE, AND MAKES TO DIE. AND FROM HIM IS THE
ALTERNATION OF NIGHT AND DAY, WILL YOU NOT THEN UNDERSTAND?

**THE COMMENTARY
THE WAYS OF GOD'S AWAKENING**

VERSE NO.75ِ80

Allah will have His Mercy, and will extend His bounties on those who
are in distress for their sinful acts, and will relieve them, that they
may be thankful; and accept the truth by repentance and return. But
instead of gratitude, they become obstinate, and persist in their
rebellion and sinful deeds! So, they wander in a state of confusion and
thanklessness. [ 303 ]

\`\`And if we have Mercy on them, and relieve them from what has
afflicted them, they will still persist in their rebellion, while they
are confused.'' Sometimes Allah seizes them in a harder punishment, but
not only they insist upon their blasphemy, they also abandon themselves
to despair. They are in such a spiritual condition that the little trial
of God will not wake them up, and the greater trial takes them to
despair. After all, when their term is expired and death catches them,
there will be no more chance for them to repent and return.

As to what the, \`\`opening of the door to a severe punishment'' (VERSE
NO.77) may mean; various views have been put forth. Some commentators
say; the reference is to the painful punishment that their defeat in the
Battle of Badr brought on them. We doubt this idea, because this chapter
was revealed in Mecca, and the battle of Badr occured after the
Emigration to Medina. Some commentators say the reference is to a very
severe famine that afflicted Mecca when the prophet cursed them. This
incident was about four years before Emigration of the prophet to
Medina.

Most probably, this does not refer to a certain group of the wickeds
and disbelievers. It seems to be a general method of God's dealing with
the unbelievers and sinful people.

Then there comes the verse NO.78 through which reference is made to
three of the great bounties of our Merciful Lord, namely the sense of
hearing, the sense of sight, and the heart which is supposed to be the
seat of all Man's feeling and intelligence. These are the faculties and
the means by which knowledge can be found, judgement formed, and so many
good things obtained:ِ \`\`And He is who created for you hearing and
eyes and heart, yet little is the thanks that you give.''

To understand the importance of the two senses of sight and [ 304 ]
hearing, it is enough to think of having them lost for a couple of
weeks. It is then more than a misfortune, and indeed difficult to see
the beautiful world and nature no more.

To see no light, no day, no movements, no colour and no beauty. Or to
hear no sound, no voice, no talk, no music. Even the tongue will fail in
his task, and knows not what to say, and how to communicate with other
people. Then consider losing the heart. Of course, we don't mean the
hollow muscular organ which is about the size of a closed fist that
beats continuously in our chest, to propel blood through the arteries
and veins. Heart in Qura"nic literature, is the wisdom and
understanding. It is the seat of Man's feelings and intelligence. Then
think of losing the heart for a short period of time. What else remains
for man in this world to have the pleasure of its presence? How can we
then think, calculate, conclude, differentiate, distinguish, and finally
decide?

Are then we thankful enough for having such valuable faculties and
precious instruments of living and understanding that our Good Gracious
God has bestowed on us? Then in the next verse (NO.79) the change of day
to night and vice versa, has been pointed to. Consider how could our
life and living become, if the day or night would not be changeable. In
this natural phenomenon, the least profit for Man, is that the
alternation of night and day will make way for our rest and refreshment,
and our work and endeavour, for life and evolution:ِ

\`\`He is who gives life, and makes to die; and from Him is the
Alternation of night and day, will you not then use your wisdom?'' We
live and we die just as we fall asleep at night, and wake up in the
morning. Therefore, the night and day, besides their immense profit for
creatures, are two clear signs of God to help us to know the nature of
life and death, by studying the nature of sleep and wakefulness in the
night and day.

[ 305 ]

بَلْ قَالُوا مِثْلَ مَا قَالَ الاَْوَّلُونَ(( 81 ))

81- THEY TOO, SAID WHAT THE ANCIENT SAID.

قَالُوا أَئِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَاباً وَعِظَاماً أَئِنَّا
لَمَبْعُوثُونَ(( 82 ))

82- THEY SAID; WHEN WE ARE DEAD AND BECOME DUST AND BONES COULD WE
REALLY BE RAISED UP AGAIN?

لَقَدْ وُعِدْنَا نَحْنُ وَآبَاؤُنَا هَذَا مِنْ قَبْلُ إِنْ هَذَا إِلاَّ
أَسَاطِيرُ الاَْوَّلِينَ(( 83 ))

83- WE AND OUR FATHERS HAVE BEEN PROMISED THIS BEFORE. THIS IS NOT
EXCEPT THE PRIMEVAL TALES.

قُلْ لِّمَنِ الاَْرْضُ وَمَنْ فِيهَا إِنْ كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ(( 84 ))

84- SAY WHOSE EARTH IS THIS AND WHOEVER IS IN IT, IF YOU DO KNOW?

سَيَقُولُونَ للهِِ قُلْ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ(( 85 ))

85- SOON SHALL THEY SAY ALLAH'S; SAY DON'T YOU THEN MIND.

قُلْ مَنْ رَّبُّ السَّموَاتِ السَّبْعِ وَرَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ((
86 ))

86- SAY; WHO IS THE LORD OF THE SEVEN HEAVENS, AND THE LORD OF THE
SUPREME THRONE? (THE WHOLE UNIVERSE)

سَيَقُولُونَ للهِِ قُلْ أَفَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ(( 87 ))

87- SOON SHALL THEY SAY, ALLAH'S. SAY; WON'T YOU THEN AVOID EVIL?

قُلْ مَنْ بِيَدِهِ مَلَكُوتُ كُلِّ شَىْء وَهُوَ يُجِيرُ وَلاَ يُجَارُ
عَلَيْهِ إِنْ كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ(( 88 ))

[ 306 ]

88- SAY; IN WHOSE HAND IS THE DOMINION OF EVERYTHING AND WHO GIVES
REFUGE, BUT NEVER SEEKS REFUGE; IF YOU REALLY KNOW?

سَيَقُولُونَ للهِِ قُلْ فَأَنَّى تُسْحَرُونَ(( 89 ))

89- SOON SHALL THEY SAY; ALLAH'S. SAY HOW THEN HAVE YOU BEEN
BEWITCHED?

بَلْ أَتَيْنَاهُمْ بِالْحَقِّ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ(( 90 ))

90- IN FACT, WE HAVE BROUGHT THEM THE TRUTH, AND THEY ARE THE LIARS.

**THE COMMENTARY
QURA"N ASKS THEIR CONSCIENCE TO JUDGE**

VERSE NO.81ِ90

These verses in the above passage, ironically blame those who have left
the wisdom and knowledge aside, and then blindly follow the primitive
cult and creed of their ancestors. They say the same nonsense that their
progenitors had said before them:ِ \`\`When we are dead and became dusts
and bones, could we really be raised up again?'' We and our fathers have
been promised this before, and yet none of our fathers have returned to
us after their death. So this promise, and such assertions are nothing
except the primeval fairy tales.

Although they received the last, and the most perfect of God's
Revelations; they stood on the primitive ideas of their ancestors, and
said; how shall we be raised up to life when we died and turned to dust
and bones. [ 307 ]

So, following the verses that explained the false motives of the
unbelievers about Resurrection; in this passage, Qura"n pounds a heavy
blow of reasoning over their flimsy logic; from three directions:ِ

1) By God's ownership of the whole universe:ِ

\`\`Say;ِ Whose earth is this, and whoever is in it, if you do
know?''

2) By God's Nourishment and maintaining all the creatures.

3) And eventually, by God's Dominion and rulership over all things.

The wonderful order that works throughout the universe, and the unity
of purpose, in various natural phenomena, will prove the unity of
design, and the Infinite Knowledge and Intelligence of its designer. In
spite of all these perspicuous signs, it is only delusion in those who
seek other than God.

مَا اتَّخَذَ اللهُ مِنْ وَلَد وَمَا كَانَ مَعَهُ مِنْ إِلَـه إِذاً
لَّذَهَبَ كُلُّ إِلَـه بِمَا خَلَقَ وَلَعَلاَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْض
سُبْحَانَ اللهِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ(( 91 ))

91- ALLAH HAS NOT TAKEN TO HIMSELF ANY CHILD, AND THERE IS NOT ANY
OTHER GOD WITH HIM. FOR THEN, EACH GOD WOULD GO ON WITH WHAT HE CREATED,
AND SOME OF THEM WOULD SEEK SUPERIORITY OVER THE OTHERS. FAR IS ALLAH
FROM WHAT THEY ATTRIBUTE TO HIM.

عَالِمِ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ فَتَعَالَى عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ(( 92
))

92- THE KNOWER OF THE INVISIBLE AND THE VISIBLE. SO, EXALTED IS HE
ABOVE WHAT THEY ASSOCIATE.

[ 308 ]

**THE COMMENTARY
POLYTHEISM WILL LEAD THE WORLD TO CORRUPTION**

VERSE NO.91ِ92

Here once again the immediate reference is to the ONENESS of God, Who
is far above all the physical relationships like having a son, a
daughter, a mate, a partner, or any sort of companion. Nothing in the
whole existence is like of God, or similar to Him. He is the only one
unique God in all aspects and all respects, and no one and nothing can
be compared with Him, not in substance, nor in attributes. The pagan
Arabs knew the angels as the daughters of God. Christian do their best
to prove that, Jesus Christ was the son of God. But if there was any
other god beside Allah:ِ

\`\`....Then each god would go on with what he created and some of them
would seek superiority over some others....'' If it was so as the
polytheists say, there would be a bitter conflict between the various
gods, and a serious struggle to overcome one another. As a result of
such oppositions and differences, soon the world would be corrupted; and
then destroyed. Therefore, high is Allah above what they attribute to
him.

In the sight of one who has a common sense, when he considers the unity
of design, and the unity of purpose everywhere and in everything,
multiplicity of gods, is a ridiculous motive that cannot be supported by
any reason.

قُلْ رَّبِّ إِمَّا تُرِيَنِّى مَا يُوعَدُونَ(( 93 ))

93- AND SAY; O, MY LORD! IF YOU ARE TO SHOW ME (SOME OF THE
PUNISHMENTS) THAT THEY ARE PROMISED....

رَبِّ فَلاَ تَجْعَلْنِى فِى الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ(( 94 ))

94- MY LORD! THEN PUT ME NOT AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPRESSORS.

[ 309 ]

وَإِنَّا عَلَى أَنْ نُّرِيَكَ مَا نَعِدُهُمْ لَقَادِرُونَ(( 95 ))

95- AND WE ARE ABLE TO SHOW YOU THAT WHICH WE PROMISE THEM.

ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ السَّيِّئَةَ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا
يَصِفُونَ(( 96 ))

96- REPEL EVIL IN THE BEST WAY, (ANSWER EVIL WITH GOODNESS) THAT WE
KNOW THE BEST WHATEVER THEY DESCRIBE.

وَقُلْ رَّبِّ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ هَمَزَاتِ الشَّيَاطِينِ(( 97 ))

97- AND SAY; \`\`MY LORD! I SEEK REFUGE TO YOU FROM THE TEMPTATIONS OF
SATANS.''

وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ رَبِّ أَنْ يَحْضُرُونِ(( 98 ))

98- AND I SEEK REFUGE IN YOU, O, MY LORD, OF THEIR PRESENCE.

**THE COMMENTARY
SEEK REFUGE IN GOD FROM SATANIC TEMPTATIONS**

VERSE NO.93ِ98 The prophet is addressed by these above mentioned
verses, but in general meaning, it applies to the obstinate unbelievers
who reject the truth. They are threatened with Allah's severe
punishment. Not only the prophet, that all should pray to God that, they
may not be found in the company of oppressors who incur the wrath of
God, and draw his punishment on themselves.

Without any doubt, no promise of any punishment can apply to [ 310 ]
the Holy Prophet who is infallible, and who will never commit a sin. So,
if the prophet is addressed here, it is to illustrate the importance and
seriousness of God's promise of punishing the oppressors. As to what
kind of a punishment, that can be; most of the expounders of Qura"n have
understood it to be the worldly punishment by which God afflicted the
heathens, like that pounding blows that injured them in the battle of
Badr.

Then, the Divine Inspiration tells prophet to behave those evil doers
moderately, and repel their evil with a good and generous reaction. The
prophet is not to worry of what they say or what they do against him,
that Allah knows the best their acts and their description; but still he
has to commit himself to the care of God, with regards to the Satanic
Temptations. When people speak evil of us and do evil to us, it is not
good to return evil for evil:ِ \`\`Repel evil in the best of ways.''

Of course, keeping clear of evil, and being safe of the Satanic
Temptations, is not a task so easy, unless we seek refuge in Allah.
Without seeking God's help not only avoiding evil, but doing anything
shall be difficult for man.

حَتَّى إِذَا جَاءَ أَحَدَهُمُ الْمَوْتُ قَالَ رَبِّ ارْجِعُونِ(( 99 ))
99- UNTIL, WHEN DEATH CAME TO ONE OF THEM, HE SAID; O, MY LORD! RETURN
ME....

[ 311 ]

لَعَلِّى أَعْمَلُ صَالِحاً فِيمَا تَرَكْتُ كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا كَلِمَةٌ
هُوَ قَائِلُهَا وَمِنْ وَرَائِهِمْ بَرْزَخٌ إِلَى يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ((
100 ))

100- THAT I MAY DO RIGHTEOUSNESS IN WHAT I HAVE LEFT BEHIND. (TO MAKE
FOR MY PAST RELIGIOUS OMISSIONS)


NOT SO; IT IS ONLY A WORD THAT HE SAYS IT. (IF WE RETURN HIM HE WILL DO
THE SAME)

AND BEFORE THEM IS THE INTERMEDIATE WORLD UP TO THE DAY THAT THEY SHALL
BE RAISED UP.
