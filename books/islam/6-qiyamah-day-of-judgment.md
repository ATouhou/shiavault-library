Qiyamah, Day Of Judgment
========================

Now some words about the fifth root of religion and that is the \`Day of
Judgment.' It is the common belief of all Muslims that one day Allah
will bring life to every human being and he will be judged according to
his belief and actions. A man having true faith and doing right deeds
will receive the Grace of Allah and will be sent to Paradise where he
will find contentment according to his spiritual qualities. Persons
having the wrong kind of belief will be punished in Hell.

A man having right belief but doing wrong actions will be either
forgiven by Allah and sent to Paradise straight away or punished at
first and then sent to Paradise.

It is impossible to deal with this topic here in detail, but it will be
sufficient to say that all this depends upon so many things and all
those things depend upon the Mercy and Justice of Allah.
