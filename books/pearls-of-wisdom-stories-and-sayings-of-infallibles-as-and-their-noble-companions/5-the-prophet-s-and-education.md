The Prophet (S) and Education
=============================

***In the Name Of Allah the Beneficent, The Merciful***

The mosque of Medina was not only a place of worship. The believers
assembled here to learn. When the Holy Prophet (S) was present they
heard his words of wisdom, his elucidation on the verses of the Holy
Quran and benefitted from his counsel. And when he (S) was not present,
other faithful companions taught what they had heard from the Prophet of
Allah.

Once the Prophet (S) entered the Mosque before the prayer time. He found
two groups in the Mosque. One group was busy with its own act of
worship, some were reading the Quran while the others were supplicating.
The other group was in a corner busy learning. They learnt how to read
and write and discussed the teachings of Islam and their application to
their daily lives.

Looking at both, the Prophet (S) said:

“They are both engaged in useful pursuits. But I am a teacher. I shall
join the group assembled to learn.”

And so he (S) sat with the group of students.
