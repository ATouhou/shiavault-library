"إنَّ لِقَتْلِ الْحُسَيْنِ حَرَارَةٌ فِى قُلُوبِ الْمُؤْمِنينَ لَنْ
تَبْرُدَ أَبَداً"
  </p>

The martyrdom of Imam Husayn (a.s.) creates a fire and heat in the
hearts of believers which will never be extinguished.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

There have been a lot of bloody wars in the world which have faded from
memory with time and are forgotten over the years. However, the
self-sacrifice of those who offered their lives in the way of God and
for freedom of men and honor and virtue, shall not be forgotten because
God, freedom, honor and virtue do not get old. Imam Husayn (a.s.) and
his companions were the pioneers of the martyrs for faith.
