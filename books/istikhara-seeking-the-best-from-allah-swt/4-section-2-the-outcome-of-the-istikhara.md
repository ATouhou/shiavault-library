Section 2: The Outcome of the Istikhara
=======================================

4) Divine Inspiration to the Right Path
---------------------------------------

  <p>
قَالَ الإمَامُ الصَّادِقُ عَليهِ السَلامْ:
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
...مَا مِنْ عَبْدٍ مُؤْمِنٍ يَسْتَخِيرُ اللهَ فِي أَمْرٍ يُرِيدُهُ
مَرَّةً واَحِدَةً إِلاَّ قَذِفَهُ بِخَيْرِ الأَمْرَيْنِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*al‑Imam Jafar al‑Sadiq (‘as), said: "... there is no believing slave
(of Allah) who asks the best from Allah one time in his affair, except
that He makes a means between the two ways. “* [^1]*10*

Allah, the Glorious and the High is the Purest Perfect Being, and as
long as there are no obstacles from the servant's side to prevent His
mercy from being manifested, then He will not withhold His blessings and
grace.

Thus, if a true servant of Allah , with sincerity and a pure heart asks
Him for guidance even one time, then without doubt, Allah will guide him
towards that which is good and advisable for him.

5) Help in Choosing the Right Path
----------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ الإِمَامُ الصَّادِقُ { عَليهِ السَّلامْ}:
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا إِسْتَخَارَ الله عَزَّ و جّلَّ عَبْدٌ مُؤْمِنٌ إلاَّ خَارَ الله
لَهُ وَإِنْ وَقَعَ مَا يُكرِهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*al‑Imam Jafar al‑Sadiq (‘as), said: "There is no believing slave (of
Allah) that asks Allah ‑the Glorious and High ‑for goodness except that
Allah prepares the best for him even if he (the person) does not like
it. "*[^2]

How unfortunate is it for man that sometimes that which is good for him
lies in something that he does not like! Therefore, after one asks the
best from Allah , he should not anticipate that what he is asking for
will automatically be given to him and just as he would like it to be
(since that may not be the right thing for him).

6) A Way Out of Confusion
-------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ رَسُولُ الله {عَليهِ السَّلامْ}:
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا عَلِيُّ! مَا حَارَ مَنِ أسْتخارَ ولاَ نَدِم مَنِ اسْتَثارَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*The Prophet of Islam(‘s) said, "O' 'Ali! Whosoever asks the best (from
Allah), will never be confused, and whosoever asks (others) for advice
will never be regretful.”* [^3]*12*

The above hadith was a special piece of advice from the Prophet of Islam
(‘s) to Amir al‑Mu'minin \`Ali ibn Abi Talib (‘as), during one of his
travels to Yemen to spread the faith of Islam.

In such a dangerous mission, the most important thing that one could
have asked for is a strong heart, confidence, and conviction.

Asking the best from Allah , is the method to attain these spiritual
traits and characteristics.

7) Removal of Remorse and Sorrow
--------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ الإمَامُ عَلِيُّ عَليهِ السلامْ:
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
...مَا نَدِمَ مَنِ اسْتِخَارَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*al‑Imam 'Ali (‘as), said, "Whosoever asks the best (from Allah) will
never be regretful.”* [^4]*13*

The greatest outcome of asking for the best from Allah before performing
an action and in all matters is to arrive at the stage of having
satisfaction of the heart, removal of all doubt and dilemma, and the
elimination of all confusion and distress.
