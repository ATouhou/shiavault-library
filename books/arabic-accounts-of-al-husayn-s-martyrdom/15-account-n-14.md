Account N. 14
=============

**al-Ya’qubi**

It is surprising that al-Ya\`qubi, who was almost certainly a Shi’i,
has devoted little space to the account of the martyrdom of the Imam
al-Husayn in his history[^59].

It seems to be a mere summary of Abu Mikhnaf's account, with the
addition at the end of a miraculous tradition. According to this, the
Prophet had given Umm Salama some soil which he had received from the
angel Gabriel. This would turn red when the Imam al-Husayn was killed.
When that happened, Umm Salama tearfully announced the death of the Imam
in Medina, at the time that it had happened at Karbala'.[^60]

He strays slightly from Abu Mikhnaf's account in suggesting that both
the Imam al-Husayn and Ibn al-Zubayr went to see al-Walid together when
he summoned them to pledge allegiance to Yazid[^61].

Generally al-Ya'qubis account gives the impression of being a rather
hurried summary of Abu Mikhnaf and it does not add appreciably to our
knowledge of the historical tradition.

Al-Tabari's account of the martyrdom of the Imam al-Husayn has long
been regarded as the definitive account. He gives the isnad of the
account that he uses, and interrupts the narrative to give other
alternative or confirmatory traditions. In the main he relies on Ibn
al-Kalbi and \`Ammar b. Mu\`awiya al-Duhfi. Al-Tabari seems to be using
\`Ammar's version as a means of interpreting Ibn al-Kalbi’s.

Thus he gives the first half of \`Ammar's version first, and then
follows it with Ibn al-Kalbis fuller version. He then presents the
second half of \`Ammar's version, followed by the second half of Ibn
al-Kalbi's. On two occasions he interprets Ibn al-Kalbi with differing
reports from \`Umar b. Shabba[^62], and he concludes his account with the
brief version of Husayn b. \`Abd al­Rahman-similar to that of
al-Baladhuri. What emerges looks at first glance to be the authoritative
version of the martyrdom of the Imam al-Husayn.

However, this is not quite the case. As already mentioned, the
annalistic nature of the work means that the agreement made by Mu\`awiya
with the Imam al-Hasan, and the death of the Imam al-Hasan and the
letters of the Kufans, are not reported. The surprising thing is that,
in what purports to be a comprehensive history, they are not reported
elsewhere in the text.

The other annalistic historians, al-Ya'qubi, al-Dinawari, and Ibn
A'tham do not report them. These omissions must make us question
al-Tabari's motive. The answer to this problem will lie in a more
comprehensive study than this, which is limited to the account of the
martyrdom of the Imam al-Husayn.

We have already noted that the use of 'Ammar's version is intended to
be an interpretation of Ibn al-Kalbi's, and thus weakens the stature of
the Imam. This is probably deliberately done by al-Tabari. However, he
ignores, at least in this account, material from the \`Uthmaniyya.
