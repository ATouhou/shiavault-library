No Resemblance Between the Words of Qur’an and Hadith
=====================================================

After Qur’an, the second source of doctrine and legislation in Islam is
the Ahadith (utterances) of the Holy Prophet (S) himself. A very large
number of collections of the Prophet’s words thus appear under the title
of Ahadith, and thousands of Ahadith and traditions attributed to the
Holy Prophet are recorded in the Ahadith books.  
    
 The amazing remarkable point here is the fact that all these utterances
of the Prophet (Ahadith) which were also in pure Arabic language like
that of Qur’an, and the Prophet whose tongue would recite the Arabic
Qur’an, bore no resemblance whatsoever to the Qur’an. What must be
heavily stressed over here is the disparity between these two groups of
texts - Qur’an and Ahadith -  from a literary and stylistic point of
view. It would be unthinkable to compare the style of Qur’an with that
of the Ahadith. This itself is a convincing proof that the Qur’an
originated from a source other than the mind of the Prophet.
