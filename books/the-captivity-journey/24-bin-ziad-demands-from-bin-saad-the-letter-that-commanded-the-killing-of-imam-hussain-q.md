Bin Ziad Demands from Bin Saad the Letter that Commanded the Killing of Imam Hussain (Q)
========================================================================================

After the return of Bin Saad from the battle during which he killed Imam
Hussain (Q), Bin Ziad demanded of him the letter he had sent him, in
which he ordered him to kill Imam Hussain (Q).

So, Bin Saad said: "I obeyed your orders, and then the letter got lost!"

Bin Ziad said: "Get it for me".

Bin Saad said: "It is lost!"

He said: "Get it for me!"

Bin Saad said: "By Allah, it was left to be read to the elderly women of
Medina as a form of apology! By Allah, I gave you an advice about
Al-Hussain if I had given it to my father, Saad Bin Abi Waqqass, I would
have fulfilled my duty towards him!"

Just then, Othman Bin Ziad, the brother of Obayd Allah, said: "He is
right, by Allah I would rather that no man left of the Bani Ziad without
an earring in his nose,9 than killing A-Hussain!" and Obayd Allah Bin
Ziad did not deny that.
