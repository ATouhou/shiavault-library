Conclusion
==========

In this work, we have shown that the existence of al-Badaa plays a
central role in our way of expecting al-Qa'im (PBUH). Due to the
possibility of Badaa, the signs foretold are subject to change, the Imam
(PBUH) may reappear at any moment, and our good actions and
supplications for the early arrival of the Imam (PBUH) may be
answered.

Having faith in al-Badaa by Allah, everyone will keep himself ready all
the time to receive the Imam (PBUH).

According to the traditions, awaiting al-Qa'im (PBUH) at any moment is
the best deed and the most significant act after the recognition of the
Imam (PBUH) and his rights.

Moreover, Ahl al-Bait (PBUT) have urged us to pray to Allah to make the
advent of al-Qa'im (PBUH) smooth and to lessen the hardships prior and
during his mission. Such instructions are meaningful only when
alteration of the characteristics and the time of the aforementioned
signs and events are possible.

The signs were not given for the purpose of predicting the time of
reappearance, or for encouraging people to search the scientific data to
estimate the time of the occurrence of the sign itself. In fact, all the
mentioned signs before his arrival may happen miraculously in an
unpredictable manner. They remind people only after they occur
miraculously.

Once a sign occurs, the believers will realize that it was among the
signs foretold, and thus, their faith will be strengthened and their
confidence in the coming relief will increase. Moreover, before their
occurrence, these prophecies should urge the believers to turn to Allah
and supplicate to Him with the hope that He may alleviate or cancel the
decreed difficult situations and accommodate an easy and early relief.

Thus, such warnings are, ipso facto constructive if people properly
react to them by turning to Allah before the actual manifestation of the
signs, instead of trying to predict the time of the occurrence of the
signs and waiting for them to happen.

According to the traditions, once Allah allows Imam al-Mahdi (PBUH) to
reappear, all people around the world, believers and disbelievers
likewise, will become aware of him immediately without any ambiguity or
doubt. He will be supported by Allah and thus will not need any hidden
agenda as apposed to the impostors during the time occultation.

As we discussed, the opposition against Imam al-Mahdi (PBUH) is not due
to people's failure in identifying him; rather it is due to their
disbelief in the original laws of the religion, their overlooking of the
transmitted traditions, and their following man-made ideas and opinions
in the domain of religion.

If the Imam (PBUH) has not yet started his mission, it is not because
certain signs did not take place, but because people have deserted the
teachings of Ahl al-Bait (PBUT) and have hope in other alternative
solutions for their problems. Allah has assigned for people a leader who
is ready to relieve them, but they have turned away from him and
abandoned him.

The only solution for an early relief is that people of the world come
to the understanding that they should turn to Ahl al-Bait (PBUT) and
their instructions, which are available to us in the form of Hadith, so
that Allah may waive the remaining time of occultation (al- Ghaiba). In
the second part of this work, we enumerated some of the instructions of
Ahl al-Bait (PBUT) that would help an early relief.

Acting upon these commandments, inter alia, prepares us, makes us
worthy of receiving Imam al-Mahdi (PBUH), and paves the way for the
implementation of the kingdom of justice over the earth, by leave of
Allah.

As discussed, the best and the most important act for the believers
after recognition of the Imam (PBUH) is to wait for divine relief. This
is the most vrituous struggle (Jihad) and is considered one of the
requirements of faith according to the traditions.

The very act of waiting for divine relief is one of the greatest
manifestations of relief in our personal lives even before the time of
the manifestation of universal relief.

The condition of continuous waiting should be viewed as a major goal in
the life of this world, not a secondary or circumstantial issue. Allah
wants His servants to realize that they should put all their hope in
Him, implore Him for the relief, and constantly expect the relief only
through His hand (i.e., the Imam (PBUH)).

A person faithfully living in expectation of Imam al-Mahdi (PBUH) works
constantly at improving his spiritual state by acting upon the
instructions of Ahl al-Bait (PBUT). Maintaining this state guarantees
salvation and growing this behavior in the societies will eventually
make people worthy of the universal relief.

â€¦ O Allah! Make me of his helpers, ? assistants, adherents, and
followers.

Show me what the family of the Muhammad wish and what their enemies are
afraid.

Amen, O the Lord of truth, O the possessor of majesty and bounty, O the
most merciful![^1]

Cited Verses of the Quran 2:98

Gabriel and Michael, and Allah is the enemy of the disbelievers. 39

2:148 Wherever you are, Allah shall bring you together. Certainly Allah
has power over all things.28

Surely, Allah shall never fail to keep the promised event.

5

Say, 'If you truly love Allah, follow me; Allah will love you and
forgive you your sins. For Allah is forgiving, most merciful.'"40 and
the orphans 37

And the Jews said, "The hand of Allah is tied up." Be their hands tied
up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, His hands are
outstretched.10

5:101 O you who believe! Ask not questions about things which, if made
plain to you, may cause your dislike.26

6:42 Before you We sent towards many nations, and We afflicted them
with suffering and adversity, that they might beseech (Us) in
humility.49

6:158 ... On the day that certain signs of your Lord do come, no one
would benefit from believing in (that sign) if he did not believe (in
that) before, or such belief is no good for him. Say, "Wait! We too are
waiting."21

Satans guardians for those who do not to believe.

You await and I too am awaiting

7:128 The earth is Allah's. He gives it as a heritage to whom He wills,
and the end is for the watchful.4

7:187 None but He shall manifest it at its time. It is heavy for the
heavens and the earth. It will not come to you except suddenly.14

8:5

Just as your Lord ordered you out of your house in truth.

51

But Allah was not to punish them while you were among them; nor was He
to punish them while they ask for forgiveness.11 But what plea have they
that Allah should not punish them when they keep out (men) from the
Sacred Mosque?11

(Their manner) is like the manner of the People of Pharaoh and of those
before them. They rejected the Signs of Allah, and Allah caught them for
their sins; for Allah is strong and strict in punishment.

That is because Allah will never change the bounty that He hath
bestowed on a people until they change that which is in their souls
(from obedience to disobedience), and (that is) because Allah is He Who
hears and knows (all things).50

If there are twenty tolerant among you, they will overcome two hundred,
and if there are a hundred (like them) among you, they will overcome a
thousand of those who disbelieve.12

Now, Allah lightened your (burden) for He knew that there is a weakness
in you. Thus, if there are a hundred tolerant among you, they will
overcome two hundred, and if there are a thousand (like them) among you,
they will overcome two thousands by leave of 12Allah. And Allah is with
those who are patient.

10:98 Why had not there been a township (among those We decreed to
destroy) whose people would accept faith so that their faith should have
profited them, except for the People of Jonah (Yunus)? When they
believed, We removed from them the chastisement of ignominy in the life
of this world, and permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.12

11:93 and watch for I too am watching with you 44

13:39 Allah erases whatever He wills and establishes (likewise), and
with Him is the Mother-Book.10

14:19- If He so wills, He removes you and brings in a new Creation. Nor
is 20that (at all) difficult for Allah.11

16:1

The command of Allah came. Therefore, do not hasten it

51

17:71 On the day that We shall call every group with their (respective)
Imam.32

17:108 Glory to our Lord! Truly the promise of our Lord is a fulfilled
one! 18:29 Thus let him who will, believe (it), and let him who will,
reject (it). 21:37 Man is a creature of haste. I shall soon show you My
signs. So hasten not!51

21:105 And indeed We wrote in the Psalm (Zabur) after the reminder that
My righteous servants shall inherit the earth.4

22:47 And Allah shall never break His promise.

5

24:55 Allah has promised to those of you who believe and do good that
He will most certainly make them rulers on earth as He made rulers
before them, that He will most certainly establish for them their
religion that He has chosen for them, and that He will most certainly,
after their fear, give them security in exchange. They worship Me and
they do not associate anything with Me.4

25:77 My Lord would have not concerned Himself with you if it were not
for your call (upon Him).13

28:68 Your Lord creates whatever He wills, and He chooses. No choice
have they (in creation or in leadership as per traditions). Glory to
Allah! And far is He above the partners they ascribe!10

30:41 Corruption prevailed on the land and the sea because of what
men's 47hand have earned.

Allah has not assigned unto any man two hearts within his body

38

He increases in the creation what He wills, for Allah has power over
11all things. 35:11 Nor is an individual's life prolonged, nor does
anything decrease from his life span, except that it is (made appear) in
a book. Verily, all this is easy for Allah.11

35:16- If He so wills, He removes you and brings in a new Creation. Nor
is 17that (at all) difficult for Allah.11 40:60 Call on Me so that I
answer you.

But Allah has made you love the Faith and has made it beautiful in your
hearts, and He has made you hate disbelief, wickedness, and rebellion.
Such indeed are those who grow in righteousness40 Verily that which you
are promised is true.

51:54 So turn away from them, and you are not blameworthy
51:55 And remind, for reminding benefits the believers.
55:29 Every day He brings in a (new) matter/situation.

57:17 Know that Allah shall give life to the earth after its death!

58:22 You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last
Day, but love those who opposed Allah and His Apostle, even though they
were their fathers, their sons, their brothers, or their kindred...39
They love those who migrate towards them

40

Then, when it is knocked in Naqur, that day will be a tough day, far
15from easy for the disbelievers.
