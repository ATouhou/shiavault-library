Dedication
==========

This humble and petty and unworthy effort, O’ my Master, O’ Love of my
heart, O Luminous Star of the heavens and the earths, my father and
mother and all whom I hold dear be the ransom of the dust of your steps,
on the blessed occasion of your birthday, I offer to you, and with
tearful eyes and trembling voice and an embarrassed conscience, I
beseech you, *O king of glory, harm has touched us and our family.  We
have come to you with a scanty offer, so give us full measure and give
us charity, for Allah rewards the charitable.*

My Master, may Allah hasten your appearance and make us of your aides
and supporters and martyrs at your feet, though I confess that thus far,
I am ashamed to have been a very bad Shī‘a for you.  But my Master, you
know I do not have a Patron but you.  So please abandon me not for my
bad character, forget me not for my disloyalty, and give me charity from
the treasure trove of certainty, knowledge, propriety, and love and
more.
