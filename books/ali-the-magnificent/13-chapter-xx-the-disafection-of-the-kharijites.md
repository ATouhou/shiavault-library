Chapter Xx: the Disafection of the Kharijites
=============================================

The prospect of a truce between Ali and Moaviya did not please the
Kharijites. For one thing, a strong and stable government would put an
end to the plundering raids on which so many of them depended for
enormous wealth and booty. At the same time the fanatically pious
amongst them longed fervently for the restoration of God's kingdom on
earth and believed that this could never be accomplished while Ali and-
Moawiya remained alive. To the Kharijites, they were both ambitious
tyrants who had usurped power and established ungodly kingdoms in
defiance of the will of God.


**A concerted plot
**

Some of the remaining Kharijites, after the battle of Nahrwan, had gone
to Mecca, to find sanctuary in Kaaba, the house of God. Here they held
frequent religiopolitical meetings in the holy sanctuary, devising plans
to avenge their relatives who had fallen at Nahrwan. Here, too, they
planned the assassination of Ali and Moawiya, adding a third name to the
list of the ungodly that of Amr bin Aas. They feared that Amr bin Aas,
the wily

umpire, might lay claim to the Caliphate for himself in the event of
the death of Moawiya.

The three boldest of these Mcccan Kharijites, Abdur Rahman ibn Muljim
al - Sarimi, Burk ibn Abdullah, and Amr bin Bakr volunteered to rid the
world of the tyrants. Abdur Rahman agreed to kill Ali, Burk to kill
Moawiya and Amr to kill Amr bin Aas, now Governor of Egypt.

The morning of Friday, the 19th of Ramazan, was fixed for the execution
of the plot. The three assassins then poisoned their swords and swore to
kill their enemies or perish in the holy deed. Then they separated,
Abdur Rahman taking the road to Kiifa, Burk that to Damascus and Amr
that to Egypt.

Abdur Rahman's proposal of marriage
Abdur Rahman arrived in Kufa and began making secret plans. Help came
to him from an unexpected quarter, for he fell passionately in love with
a woman who had a great hatred for Ali. This was the beauteous Qutaum,
whose father and brother, according to one account and, whose uncle and
husband, according to another, had been slain by Ali in the Battle of
Nahrwan. Qutaum was outstandingly beautiful and was described by an Arab
chronicler as possessing "a face which would be the just reward of the
virtuous" and of "jet black tresses which fell on her cheek and
resembled the ignominious record of a villain's guilt." Abdur Rahman was
quite unable to resist such attractions and when he proposed a match,
Qutaum declared herself willing to marry him on three condition. He was
to give her three thousand dirhems in cash, a male and a female slave

and the head of Caliph Ali . Abdur Rahman had come to Kufa with the
express purpose of killing Ali and he therefore found no difficulty in
agreeing to her terms. Qutaum told him that he must attack Ali when he
was least expecting it. "Should you escape alive", she continued, "you
will have my hand and a happy domestic life with me; but should you
perish in the assault, you will enjoy a better life in Heaven above than
you would have done on earth with a poor soul like me."
In order to help her suitor, Qutaum asked a man of her tribe, Werdan,
to join in the conspiracy,-and it was also through her persuasion that
Shub'ibbin Bijrah of the tribe of Ashjah agreed to join in the plot. The
three conspirators now anxiously waited for the arrival of the 19th of
Ramazan-the day fixed for the ghastly murder.


Moawiya escapes with a wound
Having reached Damascus, Burk ibn Abdullah on the appointed day mingled
with the worshippers at the morning service and stabbed Moawiya who,
dressed in silken clothes was conducting it. It is said that the sword
slipped and Moawiya was wounded in the loins. Burk was caught redhanded
and when brought before Moawiya boasted that his associate Abdur Rahman,
would by that time have killed Ali in Kufa. To this Moawiya replied,
"Ali may have escaped in the same way as I." Moawiya then ordered his
men to cut off the feet of his would be assassin and take out his
tongue. Thereupon Burk was dragged out of his presence to be further
tortured and put to a cruel and ignominious death.

Moawiya's wound did not prove fatal. His physician gave him two
alternatives, one being cautery and the other to

drink a draught which would render him impotent. Moawiya chose the
second, saying, "My two sons, Abdullah and Yezid, are enough for me and
I do not require more." It was characteristic that after his recovery,
he took elaborate precautions for his future safety. Part of the mosque
was railed off and it was further guarded by soldiers with drawn swords,
ever ready to defend him in an emergency. Moawiya was far too much in
love with life ever again to run the risk of losing it. How different
his attitude was from that of Ali will be seen later in this chapter.


Amr bin Aas escapes death
In Egypt Amr bin Bakr went to the mosque on the morning of the 19th
Ramazan to assassinate Amr bin Aas. Luck favoured Amr bin Aas, who was
prevented by an attack of colic from leading the divine service on that
fatal day. In his stead his deputy, Kharja bin Huzafa was officiating.
Amr bin Bakr, who had never seen either of them before and was unaware
of the change, slew Kharja with one stroke of his sword. When asked
later by Amr bin Aas what his motive for the murder had been, he
replied, "O thou sinner, the stroke was not intended for any other than
thyself." "But God", said the wily Governor, "thou shalt be slain." Amr
bin Bakr was forthwith put to a cruel death.


Ali's nightly vigils in the mosque at Kufa
Of the three assassins, it was Abdur Rahman who had the easiest task.
Ali, had long been accustomed to spend night after night alone in the
mosque, in prayer and meditation. It was not unusual for him to kneel on
his

prayer mat at sunset and there pass the whole night long in prayer
until the dawn of the next day. This habit of his had occasioned alarm
among his followers who were sincerely devoted to him. "Is it not sheer
folly," they said, "to attend the mosque at night, unaccompanied and
without escort, in the midst of so many enemies ? We who are loyal to
him will take precautions for his safety which he himself neglects." A
small group took it in turns to guard Ali, unknown to the Caliph
himself. When eventually he was apprised of the existence of this
volunteer guard he said to them, "Are you here to defend me from the
decrees of heaven or against the hostilities of my enemies ?" "Lord",
they replied, "who can defend you against the decrees of heaven! We
guard you against the evil plans of your enemies and their treacherous
designs. We are only here to see that no one injures or assails you."
"Then" said Ali, "you must remember that the fate of even the most
insignificant creature on this earth is controlled and supervised by
God." With this, he dismissed the guard and forebade their nightly
vigils.

**CHAPTER XXI: THE DEATH OF ALI
**

Ali had prophesied his departure from this world several days before
hand, and on the day of his martyrdom he mysteriously desired his sons
Hasan and Husain to offer their morning prayers in the house and not to
accompany him as they usually did to the mosque. When Ali was leaving
his abode, observes S. Ockley in his famous work the History of the
Saracens, the household birds began

making a great noise and when one of Ali's servants attempted to
quieten them, Ali said, "Leave them alone, for their cries are only
lamentations foreboding my death."


The fateful nineteenth of Ramazan
On the 19th of Ramazan Hazrat Ali came to the mosque in Kufa for his
morning prayers. Ali gave the call for prayer and became engaged in
leading the congregation. Abdur Rahman Muljim pretending to pray, stood
just behind Ali, and when Ali was in a state of prostration, Abdur
Rahman dealt a heavy stroke with his sword, inflicting a deep wound on
Ali's head.

The Holy Prophet had prophesied the assassination of Ali and his
issues. Regarding Ali he had said, "O Ali! I see before my eyes thy
beard dyed with the blood of thy forehead."

His last moments
His blood-drenched lips parted into a thanksgiving prayer and he said,
"Lord! I thank Thee for rewarding me with martyrdom; how kind art thou
and how gracious. May thy mercy further lead me to the realm of Thy
grace and benevolence." The murderer was caught and brought before him.
When Hazrat Ali saw that the ropes with which his murderer was tied were
cutting into his flesh, he forgot his own agony, and requested that he
be untied and treated more humanely. Touched by these words the murderer
started to weep. A smile played on Hazrat Ali's lips and in a faint
voice he said, "It is too late to repent now, you have done your deed.
Was I a bad Imam or an unkind Ruler?" He expressly ordered

that no harshness should be shown towards his murderer. He should not
be tortured before his execution, his body should not be mutilated, and
members of his family should not be made to suffer on account of his
crime and his property should not be confiscated. Ali's justice was
always tempered with mercy, even to the worst of his own enemies. Ali
was taken home from the mosque, and lay mortally wounded, yet he was
answering all questions put to him. His sons Hasan and Husain were given
the last advice, and finally Ali told them that his coffin was to be
lifted only from behind, as the front would of itself be automatically
carried, and they would have to take the route guided by the coffin
itself. At the place where the coffin would stop, they would find a
grave already dug for him. Hazrat Ali also requested his sons that he
should be buried secretly, because he feared that his enemies would
desecrate his grave. The coffin stopped at Najaf which is about four
miles from Kufa.


Ali's last testament
To his sons Ali spoke thus : "Remain steadfast in piety and resign
yourself to the will of God. Never aspire to anything which is beyond
your reach. Always be truthful and merciful towards the orphans. Help
the poor and needy, and try to live in the world in a way which may help
it to become better. Stop the tyrant from his oppressions. Assist the
afflicted and act upon the commandments of God; and do not be put off by
any obstacles. Lastly, ask you to bury me in some place which is unknown
to the public. No less than 10,000 persons have I killed by my own hands
on different occasions, and I do not wish their relatives to violate the
sanctuary of my repose, and expose my corpse to indignity."

After this talk with Hasan and Husain, Ali addressed his third son,
Muhammad ibn Hanfia, and said, "You have heard what I have told your
other two brothers. I also want you to do the same. In particular, I
command you to respect and obey your elder brothers. They have a right
to claim your fealty. Always do whatever they command you. He entrusted
all to the care of his eldest son Hasan, except Abbas. Then he heard
Abbas, hardly twelve years old, sobbing. Hazrat Ali asked him to come
near and gave his hand to his second son Husain, saying : "Husain, this
child I am entrusting to your care. He will represent me on the day of
your supreme sacrifice and will lay down his life in defending you and
your dear ones."

And turning to Abbas, he said: "Abbas, my child, I know your unbounded.
love for Husain. When that day comes, consider no sacrifice too great
for Husain and his children."

Then, addressing the other members of his family, he continued, "O thou
Hashimites! After I am gone, do not spill Muslim blood, and do not kill
any one except my murderer."

Right until the end Ali continued to talk of the good of the Muslim
community, to fulfil the commands embodied in the Holy Quran and to
submit to the will of God. Repeatedly calling upon the name of God and
constantly re-affirming the belief in the Unity of God and in the Divine
Mission of the Holy Prophet. Ali was to survive the mortal wound for
three days. Speech was finally silenced at the approach on the third
day.


The pulpit in the mosque at Kufa
Ibn Jubayr says, "in the mosque at Kufa there is a pulpit which is
surrounded by a circle of steps of sandalwood.

It is elevated above the court and is like a small mosque. This pulpit
is a memorial to the Amir-ul-mumineen Ali ibn Abu Talib, and it was at
this place that the miserable and accursed Abdur Rahman ibn Muljim
struck him with a sword. People repeat a form of salutation here and
pray and weep." 1

**CHAPTER XXII: NAJAF
**
The visit of Prophet Abraham and Isaac and Abraham's
prediction and desire to buy the Valley of Peace.

Those who have visited Najaf will remember vividly that to the north
and east of the town there are acres of graves and myriads of domes of
various colours and in various stages of disrepair. Whoever goes to
Najaf will follow a road that approaches the town by a winding course
through this vast cemetery. The Prophet Abraham had come to this place
along with Isaac; there had been many earthquakes in the vicinity, but
while Abraham remained there, there were no tremors. On the night,
however, when Abraham and Isaac went to a different village, and sure
enough Najaf was visited with another earthquake. When they returned,
the people were most eager for them to make Najaf their permanent
dwelling-place. Abraham agreed to do so on condition that they would
sell him the valley behind the village for cultivation. Isaac protested
and said that this land was neither fit for farming nor grazing, but
Abraham insisted and assured him that the time would come when there
would be a tomb there with a
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 Travels of ibn Jubayr. Wright's Text, Gibb Memorial, Vol. V. page
211

shrine, at which seventy thousand people would gain absolutely
undisputed entrance to Paradise, and be able also to intercede for many
others. 1

The valley that Abraham wanted to buy is called the Valley of Peace
(Wadiu's-Salaam), and it is related on the authority of the fourth Imam,
that Ali once said that this Valley of Peace is part of Heaven and that
there is not a single one of the believers in the world, whether he dies
in the east or west, but his soul will come to this Paradise to rest. 2
"As there is nothing hidden in this world from my eyes," Ali went on to
say, "I see all the believers seated here in groups and talking with one
another."

How Najaf was given its name is explained in the tradition. At first
there was a mountain there, and when one of the sons of Noah refused to
enter the Ark, he said that he would sit on this mountain until he would
see where the water would come. A revelation came therefore to the
mountain, "Do you undertake to protect this son of mine from
punishment?" And all at once the mountain fell to pieces and the son of
Noah was drowned. In place of the mountain a large river appeared, but
after a few years the river dried up, and the place was called NayJaff,
meaning, "the dried river." 3

And so as per the prediction of Abraham, Hazrat Ali was buried here.

Ali is absent today from our midst only physically. His soul even to
this day is the greatest spiritual resort for everyone who seeks the
help of God through his medium. Thousands and thousands of people call
out to him in
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2 Majlisi op. cit. page 111
3 Majlisi op. cit. page 111

their difficulties, and the word "Ya Ali Madad" automatically comes to
them. A famous prayer known as "NADEY ALI" (Call Ali) which is given on
page iv is recited wherever abound the lovers of Ali.


The Mausoleum
"The Mausoleum itself of Hazrat Ali at Najaf, is breathtaking. There is
one large central dome which stands out of a square-shaped ornate
structure at the two sides of which are two minarets. The predominant
colour of the exterior is gold, bright shining gold and the entire
exterior of the mausoleum is inlaid with a mosaic pattern of light
powder blue, white marble, gold again with an occasional splash of
Middle East rust. "So says D. F. Karaka after his visit to Najaf, and
further adds, "1 have sat and wondered at the marbled splendour of our
Taj Mahal, the tomb which Shah Jahan built for his Empress Mumtaz Mahal,
but despite its beauty, the Taj appears insipid in comparison with this
splash of colour at Najaf. The tomb surpassed anything I have seen in
gorgeous splendour. All the great kings of the world put together could
not have a tomb as magnificent as this, for this is the tribute which
kings and peasants have built together to enshrine the mortal remains of
the great Ali."

Countless number of people from all over the world flock to his tomb
day after day to pay their respects and to offer salutations and to pray
to Allah seeking his intercession. And those who cannot afford to go
there personally, are constantly praying to Allah to help them to visit
the shrine of their Maula Ali, and when somebody goes on a pilgrimage to
Najaf, they request him to offer salutations on

their behalf, and to pray to God-for some particular favour-and to seek
Hazrat Ali's intercession.

May God in His infinite Mercy help us to follow the teachings of one
regarding whom the Holy Prophet has said. "I am the city of knowledge
and Ali is its gate."
Thus ended the last chapter of the history of a life which from the
beginning to its end was replete with noble deeds, pious thoughts and
sublime words, and every hour of which was a crowded hour of glorious
life.

The Holy Quran says : "And do not speak of those who are slain in
Allah's way as dead : nay, they are alive, but you do not perceive."
(chapter II-Verse 154 ).

The deer hunting incident of Harun-ar-Rashid

"During the reigns of the Umayyad Caliphs his blessed resting-place
could not be disclosed, and so it was also under the Abbasids until the
reign of Harun-ar-Rashid. But in the year 175 A.H. (791 A.D.), Harun
happened to go hunting in these parts, and the deer he was chasing took
refuge on a small piece of raised ground. However much he asked his
hunting dogs to capture the quarry, they refused to go near this spot.
He urged his horse to this place, and the horse too refused to budge;
and on this, awe took possession of the Caliph's heart, and he
immediately started to make inquiries of the people of the
neighbourhood, and they acquainted him with the fact that this was the
grave of Hazrat Ali ibn Abu Talib, the cousin and son-in-law of the Holy
Prophet. Harun ordered a tomb to be erected over the grave, and people
soon began to settle down in its vicinity.'" 1

**CHAPTER XXIII: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
PILGRIMAGE TO THE TOMB OF ALI
**

This is based on traditions from the other Imams. There is a saying
attributed to the Imam Jafar-as-Sadiq, "whoever visits this tomb of his
own free will and believing in the right of Ali-that he was the Imam to
whom obedience was required and the true Caliph-for such a pilgrim the
Most High will register very great merit." And when a visitor came in
person to visit Imam Jafar-as-Sadiq and remarked that he had neglected
to go to the tomb of Ali, the Imam rebuked him: "You have done badly,
surely if it were not that you are one of our community, I would
certainly not look towards you: Do you neglect to make the pilgrimage to
the grave of one whom God and the angels visit, whom the prophets visit,
and the believers visit?"

The pilgrim replied, "I did not know." The Imam continued, "Understand
that the Amir-ul-Momineen is in the sight of God better than all the
Imams, and to him belong the merit of the works of all the Imams, in
addition to which he has the merit of his own works." 1


Salutations to Hazrat Ali Alaihis Salaam-1
Before making the visit to the Shrine, according to Imam
Jafar-as-Sadiq, the pilgrim should first bathe and put on clean clothing
and afterwards anoint himself with perfume. The formal prayer of
salutation that is given by al-Kulaini 2, and which is very similar to
that given by Ibn Babawaihi 3, begins as follows :

Peace be unto thee, 0 Guardian of the Fire and Paradise;

Secrets, the place of His Wisdom, and a Brother of His Apostle and I
TESTIFY that thou wert the First Choice of the Holy Prophet. May the
favour of God be upon thee, 0 Prince of Believers, upon thy spirit, and
upon thy body.

In his Manual for Pilgrims, Majlisi gives eight long prayers that are
appropriate at the time of the pilgrimage to Najaf, 1 and most of these
prayers are attributed to different Imams and have been handed down for
centuries, and have been used over and over again by hundreds of
thousands of trustful pilgrims who go to the Shrine of Ali at Najaf.

Another Salutation to Hazrat Ali Alaihis Salaam is given on the next
page in Arabic.

kind of steadfastness that needs to be maintained, and thou didst never
transgress the limits of Allah, and thou didst pray to Allah with a firm
sincerity and wonderous Faith, and may Allah shower His blessings upon
thee and the Imams after thee.

Salutation to any of the Imams (Ziarat-E-Jamia)
A prayer for the use of pilgrims to the shrines of any of the Imams is
attributed by Ibn Babawaihi to the Imam Ali an-Naqi. Someone asked him,
"O Descendant of the Prophet of Allah, teach me the good and perfect
word, that I may repeat it whenever I visit the tomb of

any of the Imams." He replied, "When you enter the court of one of
these tombs, stand and say:

"I bear witness that there is no god but the one Allah, and He has no
partner; and I bear witness that Muhammad, blessing be upon him and his
descendants, is the servant of Allah and was sent by Him."
The Imam then added these instructions, "It is necessary that you
should have bathed, and when you enter the court and see the tomb, stand
and repeat thirty times, 'Allah is great.' Proceed, then pause and
repeat again thirty times, 'Allah is great.' Afterwards you may go close
to the tomb and repeat forty times, 'Allah is great.' When the one
hundredth time will have been completed then pray as follows :

"Peace be upon thee, 0 ye of the Household of the Prophet, of the place
of the Prophet, the place frequented by the angels, where revelation was
given, where mercy was shown, where learning is kept and wisdom is
complete; the place of guidance and where forgiveness is perfect. You
are the Lords of all Bounty, the Elements of all Goodness, the Pillars
of Virtue, the Governors of the Servants of God, the Supporters of the
Cities, the Doors of the Faith, the Trusted of Allah, the Progeny of the
Prophets, the Choicest of those sent, the Descendants of the Best of
Allah's Creation--may the mercy and blessing of Allah be upon you."

"Peace be upon the true Imams, upon the Lights in Darkness, upon the
Manifestations of Piety, the Possessors of Reason, the Masters of
Sagacity, the Caves of Refuge, the Heirs of the Prophets, the Exalted
Examples (from Allah) those who summon men to goodness, who are the
Proofs of Allah upon the Earth, at the beginning and

at the end-may the mercy and blessing of Allah be upon you."

"I testify that there is no god but the one Allah, and He has no
partner. He has given witness to Himself, and so have the angels and the
learned of those whom He has created borne witness to Him. There is no
god except Allah who is mighty and wise, and I bear witness that
Muhammad is his servant, the Chosen servant, and the Apostle who has
pleased Him, and whom He sent with the true Faith, that he should make
it prevail over all religions (Surah xlviii 28), notwithstanding the
opposition of those who associate partners with Allah."

"I bear witness that you are indeed the Imams, who indicate the true
way, the ones who have found Guidance, who are Sinless, the Noble, the
Near to Allah, the Pious, the Upright, the Elect, the Obedient to Allah,
who are firm adherents to His commands. You are those who fulfil His
will, and who are saved by His goodness, for God chose to impart His
learning to you, chose you to understand what is not revealed and to
know His secrets; and God has appointed you to exercise His authority,
and has made you victorious by His guidance. He has given you His own
Proof, His Light, and has helped you with His Spirit. He has designated
you to be His Representatives, His Caliphs and the Guardians of His
mysteries; the Repositories of His learning; the Trusted with His
wisdom; the Interpreters of His revelation; the Standards for His
servants; the Minarets for His cities; and the Proofs of His way. Allah
has chosen to keep you from errors and rebellion. He has kept you from
pollution and impurity (Surah xxxiii 33). Therefore you have exalted
Allah's glory and have dignified His name and praised His goodness. You
have constantly thought

of Him and have kept His covenant. In your obedience to Him you have
received counsel in your outer and inner lives. Thus you have summoned
men to Allah by wisdom and good preaching (Surah xvi 126). You have
given your lives to please Him and have endured what has happened to you
for His sake. You have established the Prayers and the Alms, have
commanded the good and forbidden the evil, and you have conducted for
Allah the kind of Holy War that needs to be carried on."

When the pilgrim has finished his prayers at the appointed places in
the shrine of an Imam and is ready to say "Farewell", he should pray as
follows :

"Peace be upon thee, the peace invoked by those who say farewell, not
wishing you evil, not deprecating you, and not with envy; may the mercy
and blessing of Allah be upon thee, 0 Household of the Prophet, for He
is the Glorious and the Accepted. Peace be upon thee, the peace of the
friend who does not try to offer anything to thee, and who does not
approach thee indirectly, and who does not come reluctantly. May Allah
not let this visit to thee be my last, this coming to the place of your
martyrdom, the place of your burial. Peace be unto thee, and may Allah
include me among your adherents and cause me to arrive at the
Hauz-i-Kausar (the "Pond of Abundance" in Paradise), and appoint me
among your followers. May you cause Allah to be pleased with me and give
me a place in your bounty. Let me live at the time of your returning and
have part in your government. Accept my efforts on your behalf, and may
my sins be forgiven because of your intercession. Overlook my faults by
your friendship and grant me progress by your favour. Let me attain
nobility through obedience to thee, and become dear to Allah through
your guidance.

Appoint me among those whose hearts are changed and saved. Grant that I
may prosper, and may be forgiven and favoured, having found grace in
Allah's goodness, having been fortunate in receiving the best of things
that are attained by pilgrims who are your friends and followers. Grant
that I may have something worthwhile to bring.

May Allah grant me the opportunity to make the pilgrimage again, and
the opportunity to return to eternal life by true purposes-by faith, by
discipline, by humility. And may Allah grant that I may have daily food
that is plentiful and permitted and clean."
"O Allah do not decree that this is to be my last pilgrimage. But wilt
Thou keep the Imams reminded of me, and send blessing upon them, and
make necessary the forgiveness of my sins! And I may enjoy that mercy
and goodness and blessing, self control, salvation, light, faith and
high favour-such as Thou hast appointed for those who are their friends,
those of whom Thou hast required obedience to the Imams, those who are
eager to make pilgrimages to their tombs, and those who are near to Thee
and to them."

And then, as he prays directly for the Imams, the pilgrim becomes
himself an intercessor on behalf of the several members of the Prophet's
family :

"My father, my mother, my life and all that I have are dedicated to
thee. Keep me in your regard and cherish me among your followers. Let me
profit by your intercession and mention me before your Preserver. 0
Allah, grant Thy blessing to Muhammad and his family, and cause my
greeting to reach their spirits and their bodies. Peace be upon thee and
upon all the Imams, with Allah's blessing and mercy. And may the mercy
of Allah be

upon the Prophet and his family, peace and great mercy, for surely
Allah is enough, and what a sufficiency!"

After giving this prayer, Majlisi adds as a personal observation that
"this is the best of the general prayers of pilgrimage, both in its text
and its authority, and it should be read at every feast of mourning and
on every visit to a sacred tomb."

A Shorter Salutation to any of the Imams
A shorter form of Salutation for the use of pilgrims to the shrines of
any of the Imams is attributed by Majlisi to Imam Ali Reza. Majlisi
quotes "By this salutation which is appropriate for each and every Imam,
their help sought, needs may be made known to them, and blessings may be
solicited."

"Peace be to the friends of the chosen ones of Allah;
Peace be to the Trusted and Favoured of Allah;
Peace be to the Helpers and Representatives of Allah;
Peace be to the places where Allah has been made known;
Peace be to the places where Allah is remembered;
Peace be to those who have revealed Allah's commands;
Peace be to those who call upon Allah;
Peace be to those who obey what Allah has approved;
Peace be to the tested followers of Allah's will;
Peace be to those who are Proofs for Allah (the Imams);
Peace be upon their friends, for they are the friends of Allah;
As likewise their enemies are the enemies of Allah;
Those who have known them have surely known Allah;
And those ignorant of them are ignorant of Allah;

Those who take them by the hand, and commit themselves to them,
Have given their hands to Allah;
But those who abandon them, have truly abandoned Allah,
I bear witness before Allah that 1 am loyal to whoever is loyal to
thee, and I am ready to fight those who are not loyal to thee."


**PILGRIMAGE BY PROXY
**

Definite instructions for the pilgrimage by proxy are given by Shaikh
Tusi as follows :
"Anyone who goes on a pilgrimage as a proxy for a believing brother
should say (after he has performed his ablutions and attended to the
necessary requirements of the pilgrimage), 'O Allah, keep me from
weariness or illness or disorder or weakness, and reward 1 ... the son
of 2 ... for this pilgrimage, and reward me for completing it.' And
after he has made the pilgrimage, at the end he should say, 'Peace be on
thee, O my master, from 3 ... the son of 4 ... I have come to thee as a
pilgrim on his account, so intercede for him with Allah."

Then he may offer Salutations on his account, or he may offer any of
the set Salutations that are written to meet this situation.

**THE HOLY QURAN AND AMIRUL-MOMINEEN ALI IBNE ABI TALEB.
**
The Holy Prophet has declared :
"Innal Quran onzila ala sab'atu ahrofin ma minha Harfon ilia walahu
zaahiron wa batanon Wa inna Ali Ibne Abi Taleb, Indahu minho zaahiro wal
batin."

"Verily the Holy Quran has been revealed on Seven\* Letters of which
there is no letter\* which has not a manifest and a latent meaning-And
verily Ali ibne Abi Taleb, with him is the manifest and the latent (of
it)."

(\*Seven phases, or aspects)
Sahih Bokhari
Suyuti's Itqaan
**THE HOLY PROPHET MUHAMMAD
**

(may the Peace of Allah be upon him and his Progeny) has said :

"He who dies in the love of my Progeny will be taken to Heaven just as
a bride is taken to the bridegroom's house; he who dies in the love of
my Progeny, Allah will open two doors of Paradise in his grave; he who
dies in the love of my Progeny, Allah will make his grave a visiting
place for the angels of mercy." "If you want to sec knowledge of Adam,
the piety of Noah, the devotion of Abraham, the awe of Moses and the
service and abstinence of Jesus, look at the bright face of Ali."
Qualities of a true Muslim.

May God bless the man who has heard His orders and remembered them; who
was called by Him and obeyed the commands; who has affiliated himself to
His

Messenger and has thus secured his salvation; who has faithfully obeyed
the commands and interdictions of his Preserver and Protector and fears
the consequences of his sins; who has been sincere in doing such good
deeds as will get him rewards in Heaven; who has always acted sinlessly,
righteously and honourably; who has tried to earn His blessings and
avoided vices and sin; who has discarded false pomp and glory of this
world and concentrated in achieving an exalted position in the world to
come; who has completely checked and restrained his desires and longings
and kept his fancies and cravings under control; who has decided that
patience on suffering is the best way to reach Heaven and abstinence
from sin as the best mode of securing salvation; who has adopted the
best of religions (Islam) as his creed and followed the bright path of
truth and justice; who has correctly decided that the span of his life
is a period of grace allotted to him to do good before his end and
having provided himself for the next world is eager to welcome death.
