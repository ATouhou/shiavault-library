The Islamic System of Judiciary in the Qur'an
=============================================

There are a number of noble Qur'anic verses which deal comprehensively
with the \`system of the judiciary', and which we must examine closely.
In the following sections, these verses will be studied and the results
sought for derived from them:

1. The need for the judiciary (al-qada'), which is indispensable for
the life of human society.

2. The criterion for judiciary.

3. The rules of conduct for the judge, his qualities, rights, and
particular duties.

4. The duty of the litigants in observing the criteria specified by
none other than revelation and in refraining from opposition to and
questioning what has originated from the Source of the judiciary.

5. Matters concerning judiciary, such as testimony and the duties of
the witness.

We will discuss these important issues, and study the Qur'anic view of
them.
