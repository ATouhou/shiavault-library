Responsibility 39: A Desire to Meet the Imam Part 1
===================================================

Expressing one’s desire to meet the Imam is another responsibility of
the believers.

In the supplications which are specifically related to Imam al-Zaman
(ajtf) such as Du’a al-Nudbah[^1], there are passages (which as we know
are the exact words of Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad as-Sadiq) in which this
responsibility has been clearly mentioned:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَزِيزٌ عَلَيَّ أَنْ أَرَى الْـخَلْقَ وَ لاَ تُرىٰ وَ لاَ أَسْمَعُ
لَكَ حَسِيساً وَ لاَ نَـجْوىٰ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“How difficult it is for me that I am able to see all the creation,
however you cannot be seen, and I do not hear any sound or whisper from
you!”

The Commander of the Faithful, ‘Ali b. Abi Talib (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
هَاه! وَ أَوْمـى بِيَدِهِ إِلـى صَدْرِهِ شَوْقاً إِلـى رُؤْيَتِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Aah! (O’ how I wish I could see him!)” And then he struck his hand on
his chest as a sign of longing to see the Imam (al-Mahdi).[^2]
