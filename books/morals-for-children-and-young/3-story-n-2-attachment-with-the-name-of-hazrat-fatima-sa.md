Story n.2: Attachment with the name of Hazrat Fatima (sa)
=========================================================

Crying, Flora entered the house.

Her mother asked “Flora dear, why are you crying?” Sobbing loudly, Flora
said “Mother, the children made fun of me and said “this name of yours
is not Islamic.

Is it possible for you to request father and change my name?”

“My dear daughter, the children were right. We made a mistake. When
father returns home I will request him to change your name”.

“Mother ,thank you. Now that you want to change my name, I’d like the
name Fatima.”

Yes, one of the important affairs of Islam is the naming of children,
which the prophet (saw) has mentioned as their right.
