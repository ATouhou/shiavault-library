85: Constellations (burooj)
===========================

These 22 Meccan verses were revealed after The Sun 91 and before The
Figtree 95.

The chapter is named from the starry mansions in the sky called the
signs of the zodiac. It is rhymed, generally in -d.

The chapter concerns the Christians who lived in the Najran highlands to
the south of the Hijaz, north of Yaman and east of the Red Sea before
151am; they were massacred by Dhu-Nuwas, a Jewish king of Yam an, by
being burned alive in the year 570 A. D., when the Prophet had just been
born.
