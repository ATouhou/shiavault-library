167. A possessive noun is a form that indicates a relationship between
two things. For example: **لبنانيٌّ** (a man from Lebanon).

168. A. The noun is placed in the single masculine form and the last
letter is given a *kasrah* then given *yā's* contracted together. For
example: **ناصرة** (female helper) becomes **ناصر** (male helper) which
becomes **ناصريٌّ** (from a helper). If the word is a broken plural the
possessive noun can be formed from it or its singular form. For example:
**ملائکة** (angels) becomes **ملائکيٌّ** or **ملاکيٌّ** (of the angels).

169. The following words are exceptions to this rule:

• **مدینة** becomes **مدنيٌّ** (a man from Medina)

• **قریة** (village) becomes **قَرَويٌّ** (a man from a village)

• **حيّ** (living) becomes **حَیَويٌّ** (a man from the living)

• **ید** (hand) becomes **یَدَويٌّ** (hand-made)

• **أب** (father) becomes **أبَويٌّ** (fatherly)

• **ابن** (son) becomes **بَنَويٌّ** (sonly)

• **أخ** (brother) becomes **أخَويٌّ** (brotherly)

• **سنة** (year) becomes **سَنَويٌّ** (yearly)

• **لُقة** (language) becomes **لُغَويٌّ** (literal)

• **دَم** (blood) becomes **دَمويٌّ** (of blood)

170. A noun ending in a *hamzah*:

• If the *hamzah* is a feminine *hamzah* it should be changed into a
*wāw*, for example: **بَیضاء** (white) becomes **بَیضاوِيٌّ** (from
white).

• If the *hamzah* is not a feminine *hamzah* then it can be changed into
a *wāw* or it can remain, for example: **سماء** (sky) becomes سماويٌّ or
**سمائيٌّ** (of the skies).

171. A noun ending in a weak letter is put into the possessive noun form
by erasing the weak letter and then adding the *yā's*. **مصطفیَ**
becomes **مصطفيٌّ** (from Mustafa).

172. If the word is a triliteral or quadriliteral word ending in a *yā'*
or *alif* the last letter should be changed into a *wāw* and then the
*yā's* should be added. For example: **فَتیَ** (young man) becomes
**فَتَوِيٌّ** (of a young man).
