Story no. 64: Why we attend classes.
====================================

It was recess time and some youngsters were sitting together.  
 One of them said “Why do we attend classes?”  
 The first one said “I attend classes so that I become an engineer”.  
 The second one said “I attend classes so that I become a doctor”.  
 The third said “I attend classes so that I do not become illiterate.”  
 The fourth said “I attend classes to get a degree when I grow up.”  
 The fifth one said “Isn’t it better if we attend classes so we do not
have to depend on others and can run our own business when we grow up,
or if not that, we can do a job and don’t become a pauper?”  
 All the youngsters had good ambitions but the suggestion of the fifth
one was on the highest place.
