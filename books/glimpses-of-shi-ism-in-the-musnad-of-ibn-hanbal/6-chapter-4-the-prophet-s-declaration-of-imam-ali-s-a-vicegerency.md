Chapter 4 : the Prophet’s Declaration of Imam ‘ali-’s (‘a) Vicegerency
======================================================================

Ahmad bin Hanbal says:

Burayrah (Aslami-) has related:

The Prophet (S) dispatched two regiments towards Yemen, one under the
command of (Imam) ‘Ali- bin Abi- Ta-lib [(‘a)] and the other led by
Kha-lid bin Wali-d with instructions that when the two regiments are
with each other they should be under the sole command of (Imam) ‘Ali-
[(‘a)], and when they are separate they will remain under different
commanders. We the Muslim forces, encountered the Yemeni tribe of Bani-
Zayd and fought and defeated these infidels. When their men had died
fighting, the families surrendered and from among the captives, (Imam)
‘Ali- [(‘a)] chose a maid for himself.

Burayrah continues:

Kha-lid bin Wali-d sent me to the Prophet with a letter informing him
of this matter. I submitted the letter to the Prophet and when he had
read it I saw signs of anger appear on his face. I said:
O Messenger of Allah (S), you sent me with a man instructing me to obey
him, and accordingly I performed whatever duty I was ordered to do.
The Messenger of Allah (S) said:

La- taqa‘ fi- ‘Ali-yyin fa innahu minni- wa ana minhu wa huwa
waliyyukum ba‘di- wa innahu minni- wa ana minhu wa huwa waliyyukum
ba‘di- (Don't try to find faults with ‘Ali-, he is indeed from me and I
am from him, he is your leader after me. He is from me and I am from
him, he is your leader after me).[^32]
