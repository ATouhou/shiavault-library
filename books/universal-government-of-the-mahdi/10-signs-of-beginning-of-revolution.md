Signs of Beginning of Revolution
================================

Signs of the Advent
-------------------

Is there any sign available that this universal revolution is coming?

Is it possible to predict that such revolution is coming now or not?

Is it possible to advance the time of this revolution?

If it is possible then with which tools it is possible to advance this
time?

It should be said that the answer of most of these questions are
positive.

Because no great storm begins in nature without, and no revolution
happens in human society without previous signs.

Also, it is pointed to a series of signs in Islamic ahadith for the
coming of that great resurrection, which are possible to be divided into
two types:

The first group, signs which are possible to be predicted more or less
in any revolution according to its size.

The second group, details which are not possible to be understood
through ordinary information and knowledge and mostly has the form of a
miraculous prediction.

Here, we point to “3 important signs” from both parts:

Diffusion of Tyranny and Corruption
-----------------------------------

The first sign with which it is possible to predict the coming of any
revolution - including this great revolution - is Sweepingness of
tyranny, oppression, corruption and violation of others’ rights and
different kinds of social corruptions and moral aberrance which is
itself the factor of expansion of corruption in society.

Naturally, when pressure exceeds the limit, explosion happens, because
social explosions are the results of severe and overmuch pressure like
mechanical explosions.

Expansion of oppression and injustice by the “Zahhaks” of the time
waters the seeds of revolution, and train the people like "Kave the
Blacksmith" beside their furnaces; gradually, the crisis grows and the
time of revolution comes.

The matter is the same for the coming of the great universal revolution
and the advent of the great peacemaker, Mahdi.

But, as it has been said before, there is no need to expand the
oppression and corruption more like pessimistic people, but by
considering the existence of enough corruptions in a large scale, we
should try to construct ourselves and others and a content and brave and
knowledgeable group to be the flag holders of the revolution.

Anyway, this matter has been mentioned in many Islamic narratives “کما
ملئت ظلماً و جوراً” (as the world is filled with oppression and
injustice).

The exact expression can be found in many ahadith, which have been
mentioned in Shiite and Sunni resources.

And it is understood from them entirely, that one of the clearest signs
of this revolution is this matter.

Here, one question is asked that do “oppression” (ظلم) and “injustice”
(جور) have any difference that these two words have been emphasized
repeatedly?

It is understood from the root of these words that violating the right
of others has two types, that there is one separated word for each of
them in Arabic literature.

The first one is that a person takes others right for him/her and usurps
the results of others’ efforts; it is called “Oppression”

The other one is to take others’ rights and to give it to another people
and to dominate the person’s adherents over the lives and honors and
assets of people for strengthening the bases of the power, and to take
power by unjust discriminations, it is called “injustice”.

The antonym of “oppression” is “fair distribution” (قسط) and the antonym
of “injustice” is “justice” (عدل).[^1]

Anyway, when “violation” of others’ rights, from one side, and
“discriminations”, from the other side, fill the human society, he
appears and removes all of them.

What have been said above were generalities about the sweeping
corruption as a factor of mutation and revolution, which is predictable
in any kinds of revolution.

But it is considerable that:

Details of these signs and corruption have been mentioned in Islamic
cabbalas in the way that maybe they are not from 13 or 14 centuries ago,
but they belong to present century and maybe some years ago; and today,
which we see many of them with our own eyes, we believe that they are
indeed miraculous!

For instance, tens of these corruption, which a part of them have social
and political aspect and another part has moral aspect, have been
mentioned in a narratives from Imam Sadiq(as) that studying them makes
the human to think deeply about the issue.

Here it is the text of the foresaid narrative with the English
translation:

so that Allah (عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ) will see you do the opposite of what they
do…”[^2]

As we have said before, what has been mentioned above is a part of a
long hadith, which points on corruptions, which expand near the great
revolution.

These various corruptions can be divided into three groups:

1) Corruptions related to legal issues and governments like expansion of
oppression, dominance of adherents of untruth, nonexistence of freedom
of speech and action, in the way that believer people can only express
their hatred from oppression and oppressors in their hearts, also
spending large assets in useless, harmful or destructive consumptions,
advancement of bribery, auctioning the positions, inclination of weak
people who don’t have constructive culture to any power which wins
(anyone who it is); also spending the capitals in wars and destructive
armament competitions and noticing to these issue more than construction
(until the costs of war becomes more than the costs of constructions).

Also, each year new ways of corruption, oppression, exploitation are
invented, and nobody feels responsible for social disharmonies except a
few, and even they advise each other to disregard these issues.

2) Another part of these corruptions are related to moral issues, like:
expansion of adulation, emulation, choosing trite jobs (like making
money through prostitution of the wife!) by men, also advancement of
wine, gambling and different kinds of unhealthy entertainment, speeches
without action, hypocrisy, affectation and influencing the authorities
even in helping the poor, evaluation of people by their wealth and like
them.

3) Another part of these corruptions are related to particularly
religious aspects like imposing lust-soaked self desires to Qur’an and
interpretation by opinion, and material and personal inclinations in
religious matters, congestion of polluted and sinner persons in mosques,
extraordinary notice to ornamentation of mosques and emptying their
contents, reducing the value of prayer and ignoring that and like them.

If we carefully notice then we see that many of these corruptions have
become practical in present complexes and the other ones are also
expected; so what don’t we have for preparing the background of that
great revolution?

The answer of this question is that we have also previously mentioned;
we have few knowledge, and in other words, constructive and
revolutionary reaction against these corruptions.

Anyway, appearance of these signs is not solely the condition of
establishment of that great revolution, but it is a beginning for
awakening the thoughts, lashes for awakening the sleeping souls, and it
is a background for preparing social and psychological readiness.

The people of the world will have to analyze the sources of these
disharmonies, and their results and effects anyway, and it founds a
general self-awareness and accordingly, they become certain that
continuing the current conditions are not possible, but should make a
revolution.

A revolution in all aspects for finding a just, divine and popular
system.

It is also necessary to remind that it is not necessary for these
corruptions to appear all around the world and if some small
environments are pure then this conditions is not fulfilled; but the
criterion is the typical feature of the people of the world whether in
the East or in the West; and in other words, this ruling is based on
majority method like many other rulings.

Dajjal (the great deceiver)
---------------------------

When it is talked about “Dajjal”, usually, based on a general thought
record, people think about a one-eyed man, who appears before that great
revolution with his legendary body and more legendary ride, with his
special programs.

But, as it is understood from the root of the word Dajjal[^3] on the one
hand and from hadith resources on the other hand, Dajjal is not
exclusive to one person and it is a title for deceiver and cunning
persons, who use any means for attracting people to themselves, and
appear in the way of any constructive revolution which is performed in
different dimensions.

We read in a famous hadith, which has been quoted from Sahih of
“Tirmidhi” that Prophet (S) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
انّه لم یکن نبیّ بعد نوح الّا انذر قومه الدّجال و انّی انذرکموه
  </p>
</blockquote>

Any prophet, after Noah, forewarned his nation from the conspiracy of
Dajjal, I also forewarn you![^4]

Certainly, previous prophets didn’t have warned they people about the
conspiracy of Dajjal who will appear in End of Days and is thousands of
year latter.

Especially, because we read at the end of hadith that:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فوصفه لنا رسول الله فقال لعلّه سیدرکه بعض من رآنی او سمع کلامی
  </p>
</blockquote>

Then Prophet (S) explained his characteristics for us and said maybe
some of those who have seen me or have heard my expression live in his
time!

Maybe, hadith points to dangerous tyrants and deceivers like Umayyad
caliphs and people like Muawiyah who deceived people and deviated them
from the way of truth toward traditions of the age of ignorance and
revived social classes and tyranny and autocracy, and brought back
obsequious unrighteous persons and ruthless criminals to positions, and
removed righteous, superior and competent men.

Also, we read in another hadith in the same book that:

Prophet (S) said about Dajjal:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ما من نبیّ الّا وقد انذر قومه و لکن ساقول فیه قولا لم یقله نبیّ لقومه
تعلمون انّه اعور ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

There was no prophet except that he forewarned his nation from the
conspiracy of Dajjal, but I say a sentence about him that no prophet
have said to his nation, I say that his one-eyed!

Maybe, mentioning the time of Noah in some of these ahadith is for
pointing to the farthest time; or nonexistence of Dajjals in the times
before Noah is because Noah brought the first religion, or because
deceptions didn’t influenced past human societies.

Anyhow, explaining Dajjal as a one-eyed man has an interpretation that
we will soon discuss about it.

It is interesting that it is mentioned in some of ahadith that 30
Dajjals will appear before the advent of Mahdi (as)![^5]

The appearance of Dajjal is even mentioned in the Testaments.

We read in the second epistle of John (chapter 1, sentence 6 & 7):

“As ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.

For many deceivers are entered into the world”

This expression also confirms the multiplicity of Dajjals.

We read in another hadith:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال رسول الله (ص) لا تقوم اسّاعة حتی یخرج نحو من ستّین کذّاباً کلّهم
قولون انا نبی!
  </p>
</blockquote>

Prophet (S) said: resurrection won’t come except that sixty liars appear
and claim for prophecy![^6]

Although the name of Dajjal is not mentioned in this narrative, but it
is totally understood from hadith that false claimants and deceivers
will not exclusively one or some persons in End of Days.

Anyway, the fact which is not possible to be ignored is that when the
backgrounds are revolution are provided, in any society, deceiver
people, who are in fact the guardians of corrupted systems, begin
deceiving people for keeping the current conditions, and exploiting
intellectual and social backgrounds of the people in benefit of their
incorrect goals, and even they express revolutionary mottoes, and this
is one of the greatest obstacles in the way of reform and real
revolution.

These are Dajjals from whom all the prophets have forewarned their
nations and have warned about their deceptive plans.

But, before the advent of Mahdi and that great and expanded and real
revolution, as much as intellectual, mental and social backgrounds
advance in the world, activities of these Dajjals, who come one after
another, increase, in order to delay the advancement and improvement of
revolutionary backgrounds and use thousands of deceptions and tools for
deviation of the thoughts.

Albeit, there is no problem for a great Dajjal to be above them all,
but, signs which have been expressed about him in some of narratives are
like symbolic expressions, allegory and metaphors. For example, it is
derived from the narrative, which has been quoted by Allame Majlesi in
Bihar al-Anwar from Amir al-Mu’mineen Ali (as) that he has the following
characteristics:

1) He has only one eye that shines at the middle of his forehead like
the star of the dawn! But this eye is bloody, maybe it is mixed with
blood!

2) He has a white clipper donkey (ride) which any of its steps is one
mile and moves through the earth very fast!

3) He claims of being God and when he gathers his friends around him the
whole world hears his voice!

4) He goes into the seas and the Sun moves with him, a mountain of smoke
is in his front and a white mountain is behind him that people see it as
food.

5) At the time of his appearance, people are in hunger and famine …[^7]

Undoubtedly, we are not permitted to symbolize any religious concept
which has been mentioned in Qur’an or hadith resources, because this act
is interpretation by opinion which is strongly prohibited in Islam and
wisdom and logic also deny that, but by the way, standing on the first
meaning of the expressions, when rational or quoted evidences are
available, is not correct either and caused the purpose and definition
to be missed.

And incidentally, these metaphors about the events of End of Days have
records; for instance we read that “Sun will rise from the west”.[^8]

And this is one of the most complicated issues related to this part that
it is apparently improper with today’ science; because rising of the Sun
from the west means that earth moves in the opposite direction; if it
suddenly happens then the water of the seas, all buildings and creatures
living on earth will be thrown out and everything become disordered, and
no sign of life will remain on. And if it happens gradually then the
length of the day and night will increase in the way that it becomes
more than one month or two months and again the order of the universe
will be destroyed on earth!

But, there is an interesting interpretation beneath the above hadith,
which is about the signs of Dajjal that shows this expression is a
metaphor.

Because the narrator of hadith “Nazal ibn Sabra” asks “Sa’sa’a bin
Sohan” what was the purpose of Amir al-Mu’mineen Ali (as) that he said:

“Don’t ask me about the events which happen after that…”?

Sa’sa’a answers:

> انّ الّذی یصلّی خلفه عیسی بن مریم هو الثّانی عشر من العترة التّاسع من
> ولد الحسین بن علی، و هو الشّمس الطّالعة من مغربها7

The one behind whom Christ performs prayer is the twelfth person prom
the dynasty of Prophet (S) and the ninth person from the sons of Hussein
ibn Ali(as), and he is the Sun which will rise from the place of
sunset![^9]

Therefore, it is not interesting for Dajjal who has been explained with
above characteristics to be also symbolic.

Surely, you ask that how is it possible to interpret that?

We answer this question that it is likely that Dajjal, with those
characteristics, is pointing to deceivers and oppressor materialist
leaders in mechanical world; because:

Firstly, they have only one eye and that is the eye of economy and
material life. They look only to one (dimension) and that is the
dimension of financial benefits of their own nation. And use thousands
of deceptions and exploiting politics for reaching this goal. They are
deceiver Dajjals who have lost the eye of spirituality and humanity.

But, this only material eye is very dazzling and shining, and they have
achieved glorious victories in industries and they have also passed the
diameters of the earth.

Secondly, they have rides, which are extremely fast and circumambulate
the earth in a short time even with ultrasonic speed!

Thirdly, they practically claim of being God and consider the destiny of
the people of the world in their hands, and by all their weakness and
incapability, consider landing on moon as conquering the space! And
consider using some of the powers of the nature as the sign of
conquering the nature, while a small earthquake, a weak storm, one
cancerous cell, destroys their entire system; they claim of being God
like Pharaoh while being weak.

Fourthly, they go under the seas by equipped submarines, their fast
moving equipments moves with the Sun (and maybe pass that). There is a
mountain of smoke in front of his great factories and behind him is a
mountain of industrial products and food (that people think they are
healthy foods, while they don’t have much nutritious value and mostly
all unhealthy foods).

Fifthly, people are in hunger because of some reasons - like famine or
exploitation and imperialism and different discriminations and huge
capitalization for armaments and tremendous of wars, and destructions
which are the results of war and all of them are the result of
one-dimensional materialistic life - and especially a group of people
die because of hunger, and Dajjal, who is the main cause of these
disorders, abuses these conditions and tries to strengthen the bases of
his imperialism under the title of helping hungry people and deprived
societies.

It is also mentioned in some narratives that any hair of the ride of
Dajjal has a new and special tone that it is possible to consider that
with this much of unhealthy entertainments of one-dimensional mechanical
world which are available in all homes and cities and deserts and
coasts.

Anyway, it is important for revolutionary members who are truthful
soldiers of the great peacemaker the promised Mahdi (as) not to be
deceived by Dajjals like simple and fool people and don’t miss any
opportunity for executing their revolutionary plan bases upon belief,
truth and justice.

Albeit, what has been said above was a possible interpretation for
Dajjal that different evidences prove that. But, acceptance or
unacceptance of this interpretation doesn’t harm the main subject that
the issue of Dajjal, with these characteristics, is a metaphor not to be
a human with such ride and characteristics and advantages!

Appearance of Sufyani
---------------------

The appearance of “Sufyani” has been also mentioned in many resources of
hadith of Shiites and Sunnis like the appearance of “Dajjal” as a sign
of the advent of great universal peacemaker, or as one of the events of
End of Days.[^10]

Although, it is understood from some of narratives that “Sufyani” is a
specific person from the dynasty of Abu Sufyan and his children, but it
is also understood from other narratives that “Sufyani” is not
exclusively a person and it is pointed to specific characteristics and
plans which many persons have been their examples in history.

For instance, it is quoted in a narrative from Imam Ali ibn Hussein
(as):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
امر السّیانی حتم من الله ولایکون قائم الّا بسفیانی
  </p>
</blockquote>

The appearance of Sufyani is one of the certain matters; and there is
one Sufyani against anyone who rises![^11]

It is cleared from this hadith that Sufyani has “descriptive” aspect not
“individual” and his characteristics is his plans and conditions and it
is also understood that one (or some) Sufyani will stand against any
revolutionary man and truthful peacemaker.

We read in another hadith from Imam Sadiq (as):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
انا و آل ابی سفیان اهل بیتین تعادینا فی الله؛ قلنا صدق الله و قالو کذب
الله؛ قاتل ابوسفیان رسول الله (ص) و قاتل معاویة علی بن ابی طالب (ع) و
قاتل یزید بن معاویه الحسین بی علی (ع) و السّفیانی یقاتل القائم
  </p>
</blockquote>

We and the dynasty of Abu Sufyan are two dynasties that don’t have
agreement about divine programs; we have confirmed the expressions of
God and they have denied. Abu Sufyan fought against the Prophet (S); and
Muawiyah against Ali ibn Abi Talib (as); and Yazid against Hussein ibn
Ali (as); and Sufyani will fight against the Imam who arises.[^12]

In previous discussion, we understand the role of Dajjals against
constructive revolutions, now we should know about evil plans of
Sufyani; because it is highly necessary to know all the “adherents” and
“oppositions” of universal reform plan for establishing the definition
of real waiting.

Abu Sufyan, who was the head of the Sufyanids, had the following
characteristics:

1) He was capitalist who had collected his fortune by plunder, violation
of others’ rights, usury and like them.

2) He was a powerful man who had gained his power through evil ways and
was the leader of ignorant parties in Mecca and it surrounding regions;
and all his personality was summarized into these two.

He had a considerable leadership and government for himself before
Islam; but after Islam, all the bases of his power became weak, because
Islam was the strongest enemy of those who had the power of people like
Abu Sufyan; and there is no surprise that he became the number one enemy
of Islam.

3) He was considered as the symbol oppressive system of class society of
Mecca and his devoted support of idols and idolatry was according to
this matter; because idols were the best tool for “divide and rule” and
“fooling and stupefying exploited people” and in result strengthening
the bases of the government of people like Abu Sufyan.[^13]

His strong opposition against Islam - as we said before - was because of
the reason that Islam was destroying all bases upon which his evil
personality was based; therefore, he didn’t stop trying to suffocate the
revolution of Islam. But, finally his last fort of power destroyed
during the conquest of Mecca and was removed forever and became
isolated; although, he didn’t stop hidden motivations.

He transferred all these characteristics to his son, Muawiyah, and
through him to his grandson Yazid - by teaching and through the genes -
and both of them followed the plans of the father - but in another way -
although they finally failed.

Abu Sufyan was a completely backward person who was genes afraid of
revolutionary movement of Prophet (S); because Islam had a
multidimensional plan for changing that backward society which was full
of corruption; a plan in which there was no place for leeches like Abu
Sufyan and his gang.

And we can understand here that why his children and successors tried to
destroy Islam and return people to the rituals of ignorance, although
they have been crashed under its wheels; but anyway, they have made
strong strikes to the advancement of Islam and Muslims.

We return to the discussion; we read in previous ahadith that the
appearance of Abu Sufyan in the way of Prophet (S) was not exclusive to
Islamic revolution, there was also there is an Abu Sufyan with the
characteristics of a plunderous, powerful and oppressor, backward and
distributor of superstitions capitalist against anyone who arises and
any peacemaker who tries to nullify the efforts of the al-Qa’im and
peacemaker; makes troubles for him and at least, delays the time of his
revolution.

There will be also “Sufyani” or Sufyanis against the rise of the great
universal peacemaker “Mahdi”, who try to delay the real revolution of
Mahdi by their hellish powers; return the time to the past or at least
stop it; prevent the destruction of oppressive class systems in benefits
of the exploiters.

Maybe the difference between “Dajjal” and “Sufyani” is that Dajjal
established his evil plans through deception and tricks, but Sufyani
performs this act by using his expanded destructive power; as it has
been mentioned in news that he conquers some flourished regions of the
earth1, that we have read similar cases in governments of Abu Sufyan,
Muawiyah and Yazid.

There is no problem for Sufyani of End of Days who stands against the
great universal peacemaker “Mahdi” to be one of the grandchildren of Abu
Sufyan and his genealogy reaches him, as it is mentioned in news; but it
is more important than genealogy that his characteristics and efforts
are all similar to Abu Sufyan and has the same method.

This “Sufyani”, like all people like Abu Sufyan and all other Sufyani,
will be defeated against the universal revolutionary movement of Mahdi
(as) and his efforts and plans will all be destroyed.

The most important thing is that people should know “Dajjals” and
“Sufyanis”. These Sufyanis have also another sign adding to what have
been mentioned before that its example can be seen clearly in the
history of Islam, and that is: They remove the righteous and competent
ones from society and place unrighteous people in their positions.

Divide “Bayt al-Mal” among their adherents, as it was in the same way in
the government of the dynasty of Abu Sufyan; they support different
kinds of discriminations, Stupefactions and separations; and it is
possible to recognize and show them by these characteristics.

“Dajjals” form mysterious antirevolutionary rows, and “Sufyanis” form
apparent antirevolutionary rows, and in fact, both of them are in one
side but in two different features, and there is no assurance for
“development” and “existence” of revolution until their rows break
apart.

together, but if they are mentioned separately then both of them, which
means قسط and عدل, may have the same meaning.
