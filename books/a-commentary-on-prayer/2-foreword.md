Foreword

**In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful**

The Cultural Center of Qur’anic Lessons was established in 1375 AHS
(1996) with the aim of compiling, arranging and publishing the written,
audio and visual works of Hujjat al-Islam Shaykh Muhsin Qara’ati.

During the many years of its activity, apart from publishing new books
by the author, the *Tafsir-e Nur* {Commentary of Light} in particular,
this institute has also presented a book in its edited version, which
had been published by other publishers.

Among the works of the writer on the subject of prayer is the book,
*Tafsir-e Namaz* {A Commentary on Prayer}, which was initially published
by the Performance of Prayer Headquarters. Pursuant to the view of the
honorable officials at the Headquarters, subsequent editions of the said
book were supposed to be published by the Cultural Center of Qur’anic
Lessons.

It is necessary to note that this book has been edited and earlier
typographical errors have been corrected as far as possible.
Nevertheless, we look forward to receiving the views and suggestions of
our dear readers who we invite to communicate with us at this address:
