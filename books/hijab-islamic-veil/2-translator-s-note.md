Translator's Note
=================

This book, On the Islamic Hijab, is a translation of seven lectures
delivered by Shaheed Ayatullah Murtaza Mutahhari on this topic in 19661
to the Islamic Physicians Association.

As it will be seen from the text of these lectures2, this issue is
presented through lively discourse in which the process of ijtihad (that
is, strenuous endeavours to reason an issue) unfolds for those who wish
to understand it.

It is the hope of all of those who endeavoured to present this
translation, but even more important, it was the aspiration of the one
who originally presented the lectures and was martyred defending the
real Islam, may Allah rest his soul in peace, that Muslim women come to
understand their duties and then turn towards putting them into action
so that the Islam practised during the time of the Holy Prophet (S.A.)
may be realized through the conduct of our Muslim women. Insha Allah.
