**In The Name of Allah The Beneficent, The Merciful**

Praise be to Allah the Lord of the worlds. And benedictions upon His
beloved, Muhammad and his purified Progeny

I humbly state that this book, Misbah-uz-Zulam, is written with the sole
intention of research and it is not intended to hurt anyone’s feeling.
Through its perusal, unprejudiced people will easily understand the
causes of the tragedy of Karbala’ and it will also throw light on
numerous other matters, which are yet unknown to the vast majority of
Muslims.

I rely on Allah and He is sufficient for me, the best of the masters and
the best protector.
