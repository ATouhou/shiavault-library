80: He Frowned! (abasa)
=======================

This chapter containing 42 very early Meccan verses was revealed after
The Star 53 and before Power 97. It refers to an incident when the
Prophet was conferring with some of the leading citizens of Mecca, and a
blind man, \`Abdullah! ibn-Umm Matttim, interrupted their conversation
to ask him some questions of his own.

Muhammad is here cautioned against being overbearing and is reminded
about how he must provide instruction for everybody.

The chapters from this point on have no sections; previously the
sections have been indicated by means of small Roman numerals -I, II,
III, IV, etc.
