Chapter 50: On Proof of Ar-Ridha’’s Rightfulness Due to the Acceptance by God the Honorable the Exalted of his prayers for the Barmakites
=========================================================================================================================================

50-1 My father and Muhammad ibn Al-Hassan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Waleed - may
God have Mercy upon them both - narrated that Sa’d ibn Abdullah quoted
on the authority of Muhammad ibn Isa ibn Obayd, on the authority of Ali
ibn al-Hakam, on the authority of Muhammad ibn al-Fudhayl, “In the year
in which Harun got mad with the *Barmakites*[^1] and first ordered that
Ja’far ibn Yahya be killed and Yahya ibn Khalid be imprisoned, and
whatever else that happened to the *Barmakites*. Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’
(a.s.) was standing up on the Day of Arafat and he (a.s.) was praying
and bowing his head. He (a.s.) was asked for the reason. The Imam (a.s.)
said, “I was cursing the *Barmakites* before God the Highest for what
they had done to my father (a.s.). God fulfilled my prayers today.” Then
the Imam (a.s.) returned home. A short time later, Ja’far and (his
father) Yahya (of the *Barmakites*) were faced with problems and the
tables turned on them.

50-2 Muhammad ibn Musa - may God be pleased with him - narrated that
Abdullah ibn Ja’far al-Hemyari quoted on the authority of Ahmad ibn
Muhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of Al-Hassan ibn Ali al-Washsha’, on
the authority of Mosafir (Abu Muslim - one of the companions of Imam
Musa Al-Kazim (a.s.)), “I was with Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) in Mina.
Yahya ibn Khalid and a group of the *Barmakites* passed by. Then Imam
Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) said, ‘These poor fellows do not know what will happen
to them this year.’ The Imam (a.s.) then added, ‘O! It is amazing that
Harun and I are like these two (fingers)’ while he was putting two of
his fingers side by side.” Mosafir added, “By God, I did not understand
what this meant until he was buried at the side of Harun.”

50-3 Abdul Wahid ibn Muhammad ibn Abdoos al-Neishaboori al-Attar
narrated in Neishaboor in the year 352 A.H. (962 A.D.) that Ali ibn
Muhammad ibn Qutayba quoted on the authority of Al-Fadhl ibn Shathan, on
the authority of Safwan ibn Yahya, on the authority of Muhammad ibn
Ya’fur al-Balkhi, on the authority of Musa ibn Mehran, “I heard Isa ibn
Ja’far tell Harun (Ar-Rashid) when he was going from Raqqah to Mecca,
‘Do not forget what you have sworn to about the household of Abi Talib.

You have sworn to chop off the head of anyone who claims to be a Divine
Leader after Musa ibn Ja’far. Now this is his son Ali (Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.))
who is claiming to possess the Divine Leadership, and people are saying
about him the same thing that they said about his father.’ Harun looked
at him angrily and said, ‘So what? Do you think that I should kill them
all[^2]?’ Musa ibn Mihran added, “Once I heard this I went and informed
Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) about this. Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) said, ‘What do I have to
do with them? By God, they do not have the power to do anything to me.’”

50-4 Ahmad ibn Ziyad al-Hamadani - may God be pleased with him -
narrated that Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashem quoted on the authority of
Muhammad ibn Isa ibn Obayd, on the authority of Safwan ibn Yahya, “When
Abul Hassan Musa ibn Ja’far (a.s.) passed away and Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.)
started to talk (about Divine Leadership), then we feared for his life
and I told him, ‘You are expressing a great issue. We are afraid of this
oppressor (Harun).’ Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) said, ‘He can struggle to do
whatever he likes, but he cannot affect me at all.’” Safwan added, “A
trustworthy person informed me that Yahya ibn Khalid (*Al-Barmaki*) told
the oppressor (Harun), ‘This is his son Ali (Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.)) who has
taken his position and is declaring that he himself is the (Divine)
Leader.’ Harun replied, ‘What was the use of what we did to his father?
Do you think that we should kill them all?’”

The author added, “Indeed all the *Barmakites* were all enemies of the
Members of the Household of God’s Prophet (S) and displayed their
animosity.”

[^1]: The Barmakites were a family of Iranian origin who started with
Barmak who was in charge of an Idol-House called Nobahar in the city of
Balkh. Barmak’s son was called Khalid. He started to work in the court
of Abdul Malik ibn Marvan, and was able to attain a high position there.
He accepted Islam during the era of Hisham ibn Abdul Malik. Later he
became one of the heads of the army of Abu Muslim Khorasani. After the
downfall of the Umayads, he went to Abul Abbas Saf’fah and became a
minister. His son Yahya who was very intelligent was Harun Ar-Rashid’s
teacher. It has been said that the majesty of the Abbasids was due to
the wisdom of Yahya and his son Ja’far who was a minister in the court
of Harun Ar-Rashid.

[^2]: The members of the Household of God’s Prophet (S)
