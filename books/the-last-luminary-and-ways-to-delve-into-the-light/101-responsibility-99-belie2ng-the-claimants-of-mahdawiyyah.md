Responsibility 99: Belie2ng the Claimants of Mahdawiyyah
========================================================

The final responsibility of a believer (which we will cover in this
book) is to keep away from and also to proclaim those who claim to be
the Mahdi (ajtf) as being liars.

This responsibility cannot be realized except through a complete
understanding of the rightful Imam and successor of the Messenger of
Allah (S) as it is only through this correct understanding that one can
recognize those who falsely claim to be al-Mahdi (ajtf).

It is possible for a person to falsely claim the status of Mahdawiyyah,
and to introduce himself to others as being the Mahdi (ajtf) and those
who lack intelligence or are ignorant and do not recognize the true Imam
or a group of people who are only looking out for their own interests or
are plagued with following Satan and who are on the path of confusion
and spiritual darkness, and disbelief and hypocrisy, may take this
(false) claim of Mahdawiyyah and fall into error and also lead others to
the wrong path and thus, they will have strayed away from the path of
Allah and the religion of His Messenger and his rightful Successors.
