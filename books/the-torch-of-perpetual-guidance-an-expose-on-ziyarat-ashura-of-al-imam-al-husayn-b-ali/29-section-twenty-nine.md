  <p>
أَللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ حَمْدَ الشَّاكِرِينَ لَكَ عَلَى
مُصَابِهِمْ، الْحَمْدُ لِلّهِ عَلَى عَظِيمِ رَزِيَّتِي، أَللَّهُمَّ
ارْزُقْنِي شَفاعَةَ الْحُسَيْنِ يَوْمَ الْوُرُودِ، وَثَبِّتْ لِي
قَدَمَ صِدْقٍ عِنْدَكَ مَعَ الْحُسَيْنِ وَأَصْحابِ الْحُسَيْنِ
الَّذِينَ بَذَلُوا مُهَجَهُمْ دُونَ الْحُسَيْنِ.

“O’ Allah! To you belongs the praise, the praise of those who are
thankful to You for their tribulations. All Praise belongs to Allah for
my intense grief. O’ Allah, grant me the blessing of intercession of
Husayn on the Day of Appearance (before You) and strengthen me with a
truthful stand in Your presence along with Husayn and the companions of
Husayn – those people who sacrificed everything for Husayn.”

The final section of this Ziyarat which is recited in Sajdah – again,
showing that this visitation is directed towards Allah and that He is
always in our sight is one of thanks. We confirm that we praise Him just
as those who have been plagued with tribulations glorify and sing his
praise.

We also conclude our visitation with asking Allah for the permission of
Husayn to intercede for us on the Day when we shall all be gathered in
His presence to be accountable for our sins and that we are able to
stand alongside Husayn and his companions – those who sacrificed
whatever they had for his cause.

With this, we bring our visitation to the grandson of the Prophet to a
close and ask Allah to accept our actions and to grant us the ability to
be able to manifest all which we have said in this supplication. We also
ask Allah to give us the strength to be able to love those whom He has
commanded us to love and to hate those whom He has commanded us to hate.
We also ask for the Tawfeeq to be able to follow the footsteps of Husayn
and that we are able to reject the “Islam” of Yazid and the likes of
him...
