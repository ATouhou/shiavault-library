A Bedouin approached Imam ‘Ali (as) in the Battle of Camel and asked if
he asserted that God was one. In answer, Imam ‘Ali (as) said:

To say that God is one has four meanings; Two of these meanings are
false and two correct. As for the two incorrect meanings, one is that
one should say 'God is one' and be thinking of number and counting. This
meaning is false because that which has no second cannot enter into the
category of number. Do you not see that those who said that God is the
third of trinity [i.e, the Christians] fell into infidelity? Another
meaning is to say that so and so is one of this people, namely as a
species of this genus or a member of this species. This meaning is also
not correct when applied to God, for it implies likening something to
God and God is above all likeness.

As for the two meanings that are correct when applied to God, one is
that it should be said that God is one in the sense that there is no
likeness unto Him among things. God possesses such uniqueness. And one
is to say that God is one on the sense that there is no multiplicity or
division conceiveable in Him, neither outwardly nor in the mind nor in
the imagination. God possesses such unity.

Also Imam ‘Ali (as) said:

To know God is to know His Oneness.

This means that to prove that the Being of God is unlimited and infinite
suffices to prove His Oneness, for to conceive a second for the Infinite
is impossible.
