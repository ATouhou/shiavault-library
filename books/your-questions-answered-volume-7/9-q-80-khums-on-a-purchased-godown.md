Q. 80: Khums On a Purchased Godown
==================================

A man has bought a godown for US$ 200,000/- which he is turning into a
Show Room. Does he have to pay Khums on the purchase price? A: If the
Khums of the price was not given before, then he will have to pay US$
50,000/- for Khumus (US$ 250,000/- total minus US$ 50,000/Khums = US$
200,000/- Net).

**Q. 81: HOUSE BOUGHT BUT GIVEN ON RENT.**

A man is staying in a house, against which there is a demolition order.
He therefore bought a house, for his own residence. Having bought the
house, he decided to give it to rental for a couple of years, before he
moves in.

Does he have to pay Khumus on purchase price of the house.

A: Yes. Had it been used straight-away for his own residence, and if
the price was paid from the same year's saving in which the house was
purchased, then there was no Khumus due. But if the money was from
previous year's savings, there will be Khumus payable. Also, if it is
not used for own residence, Khumus has to be paid

**Q. 82: ACCOUNTING OF KHUMUS:**

I got married in 1970 and I received dahej money of Shs. 2,335/- which
I deposited in a savings account with National Bank of commerce. I was
working after marriage and used to earn salary of Shs. 400/- per month
from my husband's company which was being deposited in the savings
account by banker's order. Upto 1978 I was deposited with shs.

22,800/- as my salary which I never touched. All this attracted
interest. Upto now my balance in my Savings Account is Shs. 627,034.65.
So I have earned interest of Shs.601,899.65!! But I have never paid
Khums on it.

I have now realised my mistake. Can you please guide me as to what am I
supposed to do now.

A: I advise you to begin your financial year from the date of your
marriage. Let us say, it was 1st August, 1970. Now every year on 31st
July your financial year will close. Whatever you had got in your
account upto 31st July 1996, is your saving, on which you have to pay
Khumus.

As for the money that has entered into your account between 1st August,
1996, and 31st July, 1997, if you have spent something from it on
household expenses, that will be exempted from Khumus, but you will pay
Khumus on the balance. If you have not spent anything from that amount,
then Khumus will be paid from the whole amount.

**Q. 83: GIFTING EXCESS MONEY TO AVOID KHUMUS:**

Can a husband and wife gift their total assets to one another (which is
less than their annual expenses) in order to avoid paying Khums? A:
Allah (s.w.t.) says in the Qur'an: "They (intend to) deceive Allah and
those who believe, they deceive not but themselves, but they perceive
(it) not."

If the intention in paying Khumus is to obtain the pleasure of Allah,
then such manipulations cannot remain hidden from Him, and He will deal
with them accordingly. If they think that Allah is unaware of such
tricks, then they are not Muslims at all.

**Q. 84: NATIONALISED HOUSES:**

a) In Tanzania on 22nd April, 1971 a law was enacted and assented to by
the then President of the United Republic of Tanzania being No: 13 of
1971 entitled " Acquisition of Building Act, 1971".

By virtue of the said law, all buildings, residential, commercial or
industrial whose cost of construction or rental value was more than one
hundred thousand shillings, the Parliament empowered the President to
acquire the said property if in his opinion it was in the public
interest to do so. Under the said law almost all buildings owned by
individuals or companies were acquired (nationlised) by the
Government.

There was a provision for compensation but very few were paid and those
who were paid were not in accordance with law: the legal requirement was
that the compensation shall be fair, edequate and prompt. Some were paid
after 5 to 10 years but not adequately. Others have not been paid at
all.

Now the problem we face is this: If the owner of an "acquired" property
has not been paid any compensation, can a tenant occupying such property
prior to acquisition continue to occupy it and pay rent to the
government?

A: If it is possible to contact the original owner, then the best
course is to obtain his permission to live in that house either free of
charge, or on paying some token rent. If it is not possible to contact
him or if his identity or present address is not known at all, then the
occupier should pay every month some amount (according to his ability)
as its rent and give it to a poor Shi'a as Sadaqah on behalf of the
original owner. (This reply is based on late Sayyid Al-Khoui's fatwa.)

b) Can a tenant of such acquired property take "goodwill" or
"key-money" and with the consent of the Government, "transfer" it to a
third party? (No doubt they have to grease or bribe an officer for such
a transaction).

A: I could not find any such provision in the books of the
mujtahideen -past or present. c) Can a broker or, lawyer charge fees on
such transaction of an acquired property where compensation has not been
paid?

A: Apparently, no one. is allowed to deal in a ghasbi property, and fee
or commission obtained from such a deal will not be lawful.

**Q. 85: NEED OF HOUSE AND OBLIGATION OF HAJJ:**

"When a person is in need of owning a house, performance of Hajj will
be obligatory on him IF he also possesses money for the house" Now the
following issues emerge:

1. A tenant of National Houseing Corporation in the present state of
law has no security at all. He can be thrown out, his rent can be
increased at any time and his heirs cannot inherit the house a person
now accupies, even if he was its owner before Acquisition.

2. This is because Rent Restriction Act only partly applies to
parastatals like NHC etc.

3. And Building Acquisition Act, by Section 7 sub-section 4 states that
property partly returned to owners and occupied with other persons in
the building cannot "pass" by inheritance such a flat or tenement or
portion of the building. Under such situation will a person be obliged
to perform Hajj if he fulfills other requirements but has no sufficient
fund for "owning a house"?

A: I do not have the English book, but on comparing your quotation with
his Arabic Manasiku 'l-Hajj, (Mas'alah 25, p.20), there appears some
ambiguity in the English translation. The Arabic book says as follows:

"If he has wealth sufficient for hajj expenses and he is in need of
marriage or of buying a house for his residence or other (such)
requirements; then if using that wealth for hajj would put him in
difficulty, hajj will not be wajib for him; otherwise it will be
wajib".

Owning a house for residence is a genuine necessity of life in the eyes
of Islam. But a residence which one can pass to one's heirs is not a
condition for wujub of hajj. If a rented house suffices for his present
requirements, the above mas'alah is not applicable to him - the
provisions of Building Acquisition Act and Rent Restriction Act
nowithstanding.

You know very will that in this country, even the private houses (like
other buildings) are built on plots having not more than 99 year lease.
And the President can revoke the lease any time be likes. Surely nobody
can say that hajj is not wajib on even those who own private houses
because "they can be thrown out" any moment.

For the purpose of this mas'alah, a man should not own any other
residential house, and there must be some actual deal finalised (or
nearing final stages); if that deal reduces the money to such an extent
that hajj is not possible, then hajj is not wajib. But an imaginary
danger of eviction after some unknown future eventuality, or just a
vague plan to purchase a house at some time in distant future will not
exempt him from hajj.

**Q. 86: 25th DHUL-QA'DAH:**

According to the Mafati-hulJinan it is related that the "25th of
Dhul-Qa'dah (also known as Dahw-ul-Ardh), is also the night when both
Nabi Ibrahim and Nabi Isa were born and the day the earth was spread
under the Ka'ba and it also is the chosen day that the Mahdi (PBUH) will
re-emerge.

How come there seems to be no other source that mentions the
coincidence of the birth of Nabi Ibrahim with that of Nabi Isa? Most of
my Christian friends are rather surprised at this information too. What
is the coincidence of the re-emergence of the Mahdi (PBUH) on the same
day?

A: 25th Dhu 'l-qa'da is called Dahwu 'l-ard, because, according to
ahadith, it was the day the earth was spread under the Ka'bah. As for
its being the birthday of Nabi Ibrahim and Nabi 'Isa (peace be on them),
it can neither be proved nor refuted: the calendar systems of the Jews
and of the Arabs were and are different.

Moreover the exact birthdays of the two prophets are not known even to
the Jews and Christians themselves. As for the reappearance of our
Twelfth Imam (a.s.), many ahadith mention some dates of Ramadhan; others
say 'Ashura day; while more authentic ones forbid fixing of any date for
it. So, you may ignore such statements altogether.

**Q. 87: WAS 'A'ISHAH MUSLIMAH BEFORE HER MARRIAGE?**

Was 'A'ishah, the Prophet's wife, a Muslimah before their marriage? A:
Yes. She was a born Muslimah.

**Q. 88: WHERE AND WHEN DID 'A'ISHAH DIE?**

Where and when did 'A'ishah (wife of the Prophet s.a.w.a.) die? A: She
died at Medina in the reign of Mu'awiyah in the year 58 A.H. as may be
seen in Kitab Al-Ma'arif of Ibn Qutaybah Dinawari (Egypt ed. p.59). It
is narrated in Habibu 'S-siyar of Ghayathu 'd-din al-Harawi and Rabi'u
'labrar of Az-Zamakhshari that when Mu'awiyah began convassing from the
pulpit of the Prophet to appoint his son, Yazid, as his heir- apparent,
'A'ishah opposed it vehemently. Mu'aviyah then invited her for a meal to
his place in Medina. Before her arrival, he had ordered a deep pit to be
dug; and covering it with a bed-spread put a chair on it. When 'A'ishah
sat on it, she fell down in the pit, which was at once filled with lime
and then the floor was levelled. I do not know how reliable this report
is, but I have mentioned it here because the writers of those books were
well- recognised Sunni scholars.

**Q. 89: ABOUT SALMAN AL-FARSI (R.A.):**

Was Salman Al-Farsi (r.a.) governor of Mada'in at the time of his
death? When did he die and where?

A: Salman (r.a.) was appointed governor of Mada'in by the 2nd caliph.
The caliph usually changed governors every two years. When he got the
news that Salman (r.a.) was about to enter Medina, the caliph went out
with many companions to welcome him. It was a very unusual honour paid
to returning governor. The reason became clear when they saw Salman
(r.a.) returning with the same robe in which he had set out. He had not
taken from the treasury anything for himself during his governorate.

Then Salman (r.a.) settled in Basrah, where he married a lady. After a
few years, he shifted with his family to Mada'in. I think he did so
because Mada'in people spoke Persian. He died in Mada'in in the last
year of 'Uthman's caliphate, i.e. in 36 A.H. (Vide At-Tabaqat by Ibn
Sa'd, vol.4, p.93).

**Q. 90: STRENGTH OF YAZID'S ARMY IN KARBALA:**

How many soldiers were there in the army of Yazid in Karbala?

A: According to Sayyid Ibn Ta'us (a.r.) in al-Luhuf, Ibn Ziyad had sent
30,000 soldiers under various commanders to Karbala. The commander's
names with number of the soldiers under them are given as under:

1. 'Umar ibn Sa'd4,000soldiers
2. Shimr ibn Dhul Jaushan4,000 "
3. Haseen ibn Numayr4,000 "
4. Yazid ibn Rikab2,000 "
5. Mazini3,000 "
6. Nasr2,000 "
7. Others11,000 "

('Umar ibn Sa'd was the commander-iri-chief.) The same, more or less,
is the number given by some other authentic writers. Abu Makhnaf says:
25,000; some say 22,000, and some others, 40,000.

**Q. 91: ENEMIES KILLED BY IMAM HUSAYN (A.S.):**

How many enemies had Imam Husayn (a.s.) killed in Karbala? A: According
to Sayyid Ibn Ta'us (a.r.) and Ibn shahrashub (a.r.) and many other
scholars, the Imam (a.s.) had killed 1,950 infidels in Karbala. On the
other hand, Al-Mas'udi has written in Maruju 'dh-dhahab that only 88
people were killed from the army of 'Umar ibn Sa'd. But it is a very
absurd statement, and most of the authentic books refute it.

**Q. 92: HOW MANY WOUNDS ON IMAM'S BODY?**

Can you give me a rough estimate as to how many wounds Imam Husayn
(a.s.) had sustained in the battle of Karbala?

A: According to Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (as.), there were more than 320
wounds of swords, spears and arrows on the body of the Imam (a.s.). Abu
Makhnaf narrates from Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq (a.s.) that Imam Husayn
(a.s.) was inflicted with 33 wounds of spears and 34 of swords. It means
that the Imam (a.s.) had sustained more than 250 arrow-wounds.

**Q. 93: ABOUT CAPTIVES OF AHLUL-BAYT:**

Is it correct, as zakireen say, that Imam Zaynu 'l-'Abideen (a.s.), in
spite of his illness and weakness, was made to drive the camles of the
captives of Ahlu 'l-bayt from Karbala to Kufa and then to Damascus?

A: I have not seen such a report in any source book. However these
books say that the Yazid's army had put iron in the neck of the Imam
(a.s.) and had shackled his hands and feet with iron chains. Also, they
had tied the captives in one rope before bringing them to the court of
Yazid.

**Q. 94: ADAM AND IBLIS:**

Where was Adam when Iblis approached him? A: According to many Shi'a
tradtions he was in a Jannat (garden) of this world. It was not the
ever-lasting Paradise which the virtuous will enter on the Day of
Resurrection.

**Q. 95: IBLIS & SATAN:**

Is Iblis the same as Satan? Or they are two different beings? A: They
are one and the same.

**Q. 96: CAN A GREAT-GRANDCHILD INHERIT WITH A GRANDCHILD?**

My grandmother had a son who died and left behind two daughters and
three grandchildren, two being males and one female. (Their father had
died before). Now she has some property. If she dies, what are the
heritable portions for those two grand- daughters and the three
great-grand-children?

A: Your question does not give a clear picture. However, a nearer heir
excludes the remote one. It appears from the question, that your
grand-mother does not have any son or daughter, nor any of her own
parents. I understand that she does have only two granddaughters and
three great-grand-children. If my surmise is correct, then only the two
grand-daughters will inherit her, to the exclusion of the three
great-grandchildren.

If you question means that she has five grand-children (2
granddaughters from one son, and 2 grandsons plus one grand-daughter
from another son) then all five will inherit her, the males getting
double the share of a female.
