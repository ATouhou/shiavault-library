The Real Name
=============

Imam Ali [a] bought Maytham from a woman belonged to Bani Asad. The Imam
asked Maytham:

*What's your name?*

*Saalim.*

The Imam said:

*Allah Apostle [s] has told me that the Iranians call you Maytham.*

Maytham was astonished because no one knew his real name. So, he said:

*Allah and His Apostle are truthful.*

Since that day, Maytham had not left the Imam.
