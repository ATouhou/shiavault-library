Lesson One Hundred Seven: Do Not Sever All Relations With God
=============================================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اِتَّقِ اللّه بَعْضَ التُّقَى وَ إنْ قَلَّ وَدَعْ بَيْنَكَ وَ بَيْنَهُ
سِتْراً وَ إنْ رَقَّ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Be god-fearing and fear although it may be little, and maintain a
curtain between yourself and Him, although it may be thin.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

There are some people who sever all relations between themselves and God
. They burn all bridges behind them and close all doors for their return
to God as they proceed along the path of sins and mistakes.

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.), in this pearl of wisdom, advises us not to do that
and to maintain a link however flimsy so that one can return one day and
find an open door to enter for repentance.
