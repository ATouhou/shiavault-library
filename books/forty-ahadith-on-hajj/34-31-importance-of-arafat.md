31. Importance of ‘Arafat
=========================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَنِي النَّبِي (ص) قَالَ: أَعْظَمُ أَهْلُ عَرَفَاتَ جُرْماً مَنْ
إِنْصَرَفَ وَ هُوَ يَظُنُّ أَنَّهُ لَنْ يُغْفَرَلَهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

   
 The Noble Messenger (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family) has
said, “The greatest sin of a person who goes to ‘Arafat and then leaves
is to think that he has not been forgiven of his sins.”
