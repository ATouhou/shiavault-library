5. Wearing Ornaments
====================

Article 109
-----------

It is not permitted that men wear ornamental rings. Rings, which are
used for blessings, are not a problem. Therefore, the pilgrim should
abstain from wearing ornamental rings, even if they are used for
ornamental purposes or blessings.

Article 110
-----------

Wearing ornaments is absolutely Haraam for a woman in the state of
Ihram, but ornaments that she normally uses can be worn in the state of
Ihram if she hides them.

Article 111
-----------

Using henna is not permitted for men and women if it has ornamental
purposes.

Article 112
-----------

It is an obligatory precaution that a Muhrim (man or woman) abstain from
wearing any other kinds of ornament. He/she should not wear ornamented
Ihram clothing of sandals and abstain from any kind of makeup and
decoration on the head, face or other parts of the body.

Article 113
-----------

Coloring the hair has problem for a Muhrim if it is called decorating,
even if he/she have not intended for decoration, and if it has no
decorating purpose (like using henna for treatment) then there is no
problem in doing that. Also coloring the hair and using henna before
Ihram in the way that its effects remain until the time of Ihram has no
problem, unless the pilgrim had intended for decoration for Ihram from
the beginning.
