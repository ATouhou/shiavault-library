Akhlāq (Manner of character)
============================

Story n. 1
----------

   
 ‘Allāmah was refined, kind, chaste, humble, sincere, lacking desire,
patient, sweet and a great companion. For 30 years I was with ‘Allāmah,
attending his classes, participating in his private Thursday night and
Friday sessions, and benefiting from his presence as much as I could.
Not once during this time do I remember him ever becoming angry or
yelling at one of his students or speaking harshly or insulting
anyone.   
              
 He used to teach his classes calmly and quietly, never raising his
voice. He became familiar and made friends with others very quickly. He
was so friendly with everyone, even a new student, that one might have
thought they were two dear friends. He listened to everyone and always
displayed signs of love and friendship. He was incredibly humble…and did
not give importance to the number of his students, sometimes agreeing to
teach only two or three individuals.  
    
 In private sessions he would normally remain quiet and calm. If he was
asked a question, he would answer, and if not, he would maintain his
silence. Occasionally if someone would refer to him as a Professor
(*Ustād*), he would say, *“I do not like this title. We have gathered
here as colleagues in thought so that we might discover the truths of
Islam”*.  
    
 ‘Allāmah was very well mannered, listening to every individual and
never interrupting anyone. If he heard the truth he would acknowledge
it. He would avoid argumentative discussions, but willingly answer any
sincere questions asked of him.    
*Ayatullah Ibrāhīm Amīnī*  

Story n. 2
----------

   
 ‘Allāmah Tabātabā’ī’s manner was one that conformed completely to the
Qur’ān. Perhaps it can be said that his behavior had become the Qur’ān.
Every verse that God has placed in the Qur’ān describing a perfect human
being (*Insāne Kāmil*), we found it in ‘Allāmah’s behavior to the extent
that it is possible to be seen in an individual. His gatherings were
those of perfect Islāmic etiquette and Godly character. It was rare for
him to commit even an action which, without being a sin, was not the
best course of action to take (*tarke ūla*). He never mentioned
someone’s name with ill-feeling, nor anyone’s bad characteristics, and
tried to always pray for the well-being of others.  
    
*Ayatullah Jawādī Āmulī* 

Story n. 3
----------

   
 ‘Allāmah Tabātabā’ī was extremely kind and sentimental. He never forgot
his friends and always kept in touch with them. He acted benevolently
with his private students, and was attached to and familiar with them,
and inquired about the situation of those who had moved to other
cities.  
    
*Ayatullah Ibrāhīm Amīnī*  
  

Story n. 4
----------

   
 One of the outstanding characteristics of my father was his close
relationship with his students – especially Āghā Mutahharī. He himself
used to say: every time I sit with my friends, it is as if the entire
world lights up in my view. Truly I take pleasure [from their
company].

Story n. 5
----------

   
 ‘Allāmah used to speak very little, and he also used to advise others
to speak less. He regarded speaking a lot as a sign of a weak intellect.
He talked very simply and in such a manner that sometimes people used to
believe he was a regular individual, and not a scholar and a
philosopher.
