The Sayings of Ahlul Bayt (2)
=============================

If we studied the biographies of Ahlul Bayt, we would find that each of
them had confuted the accusations had been ascribed to Abu Talib. They
declared the reasons behind those accusations, which distorted the faith
of Abu Talib and made him one of the unbelievers. Whenever the lies and
the fabrications increased, a word of rightness came out to scatter all
that confusion and a ray of truthfulness shone to clarify the darkness
of that unfairness and evil wills. 1. One of those, who had heard of the
lies fabricated

about the faith of Abu Talib, asked Imam Sajjad -Ali bin al-Husayn- (s)
(1) about those accusations. Imam Sajjad said: "Yes!" The asker repeated
his question to be certain about the source of those accusations and to
know whether they were true or not: "There are some people here
pretending that Abu Talib was unbeliever!" Imam Sajjad sighed painfully
and cried loudly: "How wonder! Did they accuse Abu Talib (of being
unbeliever) or they accused the Prophet (s), who had been ordered by
Allah not to let a believing woman keep on living with an unbelieving
man as his wife in many Quranic verses? No one doubted that Fatima bint
Assad (2) was one of the first faithful women. She had been still Abu
Talib's wife until he died." (3)

The saying of Imam Sajjad showed that whoever thought that Abu Talib
was unbeliever, accused the Prophet (s) of contradicting the orders of
the holy Quran or being indifferent to apply them to his uncle.

No one at all could deny the true faithfulness of Fatima bint Assad,
Abu Talib's wife and Ali's mother, and no one could say that the Prophet
(s) had annulled the marriage of Abu Talib and his wife Fatima. If Abu
Talib was unfaithful, then the Prophet (s) had to separate between him
and his faithful wife. As long as Fatima bint Assad had been still as
Abu Talib's wife until he died, so whoever said that Abu Talib was
unfaithful, definitely would accuse the Prophet (s) of disobeying his
God. Hence whoever accused Abu Talib of being unfaithful would
impudently accuse the heart of

Islam; the great Prophet (s).

2. Imam Baqir (1) was asked about the false tradition fabricated
against Abu Talib saying that Abu Talib would be in Hell. He answered:
"If the faith of the Abu Talib is put in a scale of a balance and the
faith of the peoples is put in the other scale, the faith of Abu Talib
will outweigh." Then he said: "Don't you know that ameerul mo'mineen Ali
(s) ordered to offer the hajj for the sake of Abdullah, Aamina (2) and
Abu Talib during his lifetime (Ali's lifetime) and then he ordered in
his will to offer the hajj for them." (3)

The faithfulness of Abu Talib was of a prudent man not of an imitator.
It was faithfulness of a struggling supporter. Abu Talib was the leader
of the greatest tribe among all the Arabs. In fact it was the essence of
the Arabs. He was the chief of the town that all the Arabs used to visit
for its sacredness and holiness. Such an obeyed leader and a highly
respected chief turned to be a follower of an orphan, who was brought up
by Abu Talib himself. He left his leadership and high position and
followed his nephew; the Prophet, who was chosen by the Heaven to be the
means between the Creator and His creatures. Wasn't it a true
faithfulness that made this great an as same as any of the slaves, who
followed the Prophet (s)? Then Imam Baqir proved the faithfulness of Abu
Talib when saying that Imam Ali had ordered to offer the hajj for the
sake of Abu Talib not only during his lifetime (Ali's lifetime) but also
after his death when recording that in his will. Hajj was one of the
basic pillars of Islam and hence Ali wouldn't have ordered to be offered
for an unfaithful man!

3. As for Imam Sadiq (1) (s) he had plentiful sayings about his great
grandfather Abu Talib, in which he confuted all the accusations ascribed
to his grandfather. The age of Imam Sadiq was after the end of the state
of the Umayyads, which poured upon the people flows of disasters and
distresses, and the beginning of the state of the Abbasids, who ruled
under the pretense of getting back the rights of the Alawites. (2) They
pretended that they would get back the rights to their actual
possessors. It was just a pretense, which they made as the cornerstone
of their new state.

It was a short time when the swords were put aside from the necks of
the Alawites and the muzzles were removed from the mouths of people but
everything would be changed as soon as the bases of the state became
firm and strong. This was an active reason that made the voice of Ja'far
bin Muhammad as-Sadiq announce the truth loudly and spread much of his
lights among people. Although the time was short for him, he could
spread the pure principles of the Hashemites. Abu Talib, the assistant
of the Prophet (s), had his enough share of Imam Sadiq's active
traditions.

Once someone asked Imam Sadiq: "People pretend that Abu Talib is in
Hell!" Imam Sadiq said: "They tell but lies! Gabriel had never revealed
such a thing." Then he added: "The example of Abu Talib was like the
example of the Fellows of the Cave; they concealed their faith and
announced polytheism and so Allah rewarded them doubly. Abu Talib also
concealed his faith and announce polytheism so Allah rewarded him doubly
... He didn't leave this worldly life until he was

told that he would be in Paradise ... How do they describe him so?
Gabriel had come down in the night when Abu Talib died and said: "O
Muhammad! Go out of Mecca! You have no supporter in it after Abu Talib."
(1) Imam Sadiq said that Allah would reward Abu Talib twice that he
could keep his faith secret when he found that it was better; therefore
he would be rewarded for his faith and he would be rewarded for keeping
his faith secret. Not everyone could conceal what one believed in even
if it was in the interest of the mission.

Imam Sadiq compared Abu Talib with the Fellows of the Cave mentioned in
the Quran and he said that Allah had brought him good news (via the
revelation to the Prophet (s)) that he would be in Paradise. This was
not an unbelievable thing after the historians had mentioned that the
Prophet (s) had told somme people that they would be in Paradise. There
might be some ones among them, who wouldn't be equal to Abu Talib in his
defending and supporting Islam!

Then Imam Sadiq mentioned a great evidence confirming the faithfulness
of Abu Talib when saying that Gabriel had ordered the Prophet (s) to
leave Mecca after the death of Abu Talib because by the death of Abu
Talib, the Prophet (s) had lost the support and protection in Mecca.
Would such a man like Abu Talib be unbeliever or would Hell be his
reward? If it was so then there would be no difference between the
Muslims and the polytheist. Once there was a conversation between Imam
Sadiq and Yonus bin Nabata. Imam Sadiq asked Yonus: "O Yonus! What do
people say about Abu Talib?" Yonus said: "They say that he is in Hell,
in which his

head boils." Imam Sadiq said: "Have told lies the enemies of Allah! Abu
Talib is one of the companions of (the Prophets, the truthful, the
martyrs and the good, and a goodly company are they!) (1) Once again
Imam Sadiq answered a man asking him that people pretended that Abu
Talib was unbeliever: "They tell but lies! How is that and he had said:
Don't you know that we have found Muhammad a Prophet as Moses! It had
been recorded in the first Books! (2)

Once again he said: "How was Abu Talib unbeliever whereas he had
said:

They knew well that our sons had never been a liar,
nor had he cared for absurdities.
And a white-faced, with whose face it is prayed,
so that the clouds bring goodness.
He is the shelter of the orphans and the guardian of the widows." (3)

Imam Sadiq said: "Ameerul mo'mineen (Imam Ali) was pleased with the
poetry of Abu Talib to be recited and recorded. He said: Learn it (the
poetry) and teach it to your children for it complies with the religion
of Allah and it has much knowledge." (4) Besides that this tradition had
a clear witness by Ali about the faithfulness of his father. It showed
us the value and the high position of Abu Talib. Imam Ali became so
pleased when he heard his father's poetry; therefore he ordered that it
should be learned and taught because it complied with the mission of
Allah and it had much divine knowledge about the previous religions of
Allah.

4. Imam Musa al-Kadhim (5) was asked by Durst bin

Abu Mansoor about Abu Talib. The asker didn't ask about the
faithfulness of Abu Talib because this was certain for him but he asked
about something above the faithfulness. He asked: "Was the Prophet (s)
submissive to Abu Talib?" (1) Imam Kadhim said: "No! but he (Abu Talib)
was the depositee of the precepts and then he delivered them to him (to
the Prophet (s)). The man asked: "Did he deliver the precepts to the
Prophet (s) as if the Prophet (s) was submissive to him?" Imam Kadhim
said: "If the Prophet (s) was submissive to him, he wouldn't deliver the
precepts to him!" The man asked: "Then what about Abu Talib?"

Imam Kadhim said: "He believed in the Prophet (s) and in his mission
and so he delivered the precepts to him." (2) This tradition confirmed
what we have said about the personality of Abu Talib in this book. A man
like Abu Talib was necessary to be available in order to connect the ray
of the mission of Abraham (s) to the shining flame of the Mission of
Muhammad (s).

The tradition showed us that the asker was certain about the
faithfulness of Abu Talib and he thought that Abu Talib was the
depositee of the precepts, which he had to deliver them to Prophet
Muhammad (s). Definitely no polytheist would have been deposited with
this divine heritage. The asker thought, as he had already known the
high position of Abu Talib, that Prophet Muhammad (s),

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(Jesus Christ (s)). He had the precepts, which he had to deliver to the
next prophet (Muhammad).

before the advent of the mission, was submissive to Abu Talib as
guardian but Imam Kadhim removed this illusion from the asker's mind
when answering him so clearly.

After the clouds of illusion had left the asker's mind, he asked about
the situation of Abu Talib and Imam Kadhim answered him that Abu Talib
had confessed the prophecy of Muhammad and believed in Allah otherwise
he wouldn't have delivered the precepts to the Prophet (s). 5. Abban bin
Mahmood wrote to Imam Reza (1) (s) when his faith was about to be shaken
by the fabricated lies: "May Allah make me die for you! I am in doubt
about the faith of Abu Talib!"

Imam Reza (s) wrote to him: "(And whoever acts hostilely to the
Messenger after that guidance has become manifest to him, and follows
other than the way of the believers, We will turn him to that to which
he has (himself) turned and make him enter Hell; and it is an evil
resort) (2) Then: if you don't confess the faithfulness of Abu Talib,
your fate will be to Hell." (3) The answer of Imam Reza showed that
doubting about the faithfulness of Abu Talib contradicted believing in
the Prophet (s) and deviate from the way of guidance after knowing it
and whoever deviated from the right way of guidance would be out of the
sphere of faith and then his way would lead him to Hell. It would be
considered as harming the Prophet (s) and harming the Prophet (s) was a
guilt leading to Hell.

Allah said in the holy Quran: (Surely (as for) those who speak evil
thing of Allah and His Messenger, Allah has cursed them in this world
and the here after, and He has prepared for them a chastisement bringing
disgrace) 33:57, and: (and (as for) those who molest the Messenger of
Allah, they shall have a painful punishment) 9:61.

The Prophet (s) said in one of his tradition: "He, who harms a hair of
mine, harms me and whoever harms me, harms Allah." (1) 6. Imam Askari
(2) (al-Hasan bin Ali) said in a long tradition narrated by his
grandfathers: "Allah the Almighty had revealed to his messenger
(Muhammad): (I have assisted you with two groups of assistants; a group
supports you secretly and the other supports you openly. As for the
group that supports you secretly, their master and the best of them is
your uncle Abu Talib but as for the group that support you openly, their
master and the best of them is his son Ali bin Abu Talib."

Then he added: "Abu Talib is like the believer of the Pharaoh's people;
he keeps his faithfulness secret." (3) One of the two groups had to
carry out its task secretly as long as carrying it out openly was not
possible for it ... like the support of the angels as mentioned by the
Quran: (... and sent down hosts which you did not see) 9:26. (... and
strengthened him with hosts which you did not see) 9:40. (... that your
Lord should assist you with three thousand of the angels sent down)
3:124. (Your Lord will assist you with five thousand of the havoc-making
angels) 3:125. (I will assist you with a thousand of the angels
following one another) 8:9. There are many other verses talking about
this subject.

Abu Talib wouldn't be able to support the Prophet (s) unless he kept
his faith secret. He was like the believer of the pharaoh's people,
whose story had been mentioned by the Quran. (1) If the believer of the
Pharaoh's people hadn't concealed his faithfulness, the Pharaoh would
have killed Prophet Moses (s). His situation was so active among his
people, who didn't know that he was a believer but they thought that he
was like them. So was the situation of Abu Talib towards the mission of
the Prophet (s). To this meaning Imam Askari referred when he mentioned
this tradition narrated by his fathers, who had ascribed it to the
Prophet (s).

No one could suspect the sayings of the Prophet's progeny and think
that their sayings might be untrue after the Quran had confirmed their
infallibility by saying: (Allah only desires to keep away the
uncleanness from you, O people of the House! and to purify you a
(thorough) purifying) 33:33.

This Quranic verse declares the infallibility of the pure Prophet's
progeny in spite of the disgraceful attempts of some deviate
interpreters to distort its meaning.

Ahlul Bayt were equal to the holy Quran. They were as a rope extended
between the Heaven and the earth; whoever kept to it would get to the
top of eternality and whoever turned aside from it, would remain at the
foot surrounded with dangers of destruction. The Prophet (s) said: "I
have left among you two weighty things, which if you keep to, you will
never go astray at all; the Book of Allah and my family. They will never
separate until they come to me at the river in Paradise." This true
tradition, which had been agreed upon by the consensus of the Muslims,
was another evidence showing the infallibility of the Prophet's
progeny.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 We began our book with the verses talking about the believer of The
Pharaoh's people because they had a similarity to our subject.

whoever suspected the, would suspect the Quran, whose equal they were,
and whoever let them down, would be perished. There are many other
Quranic verses and prophetic traditions confirming the infallibility and
purity of the Prophet's progeny. We don't want to mention them for they
are not of our subject.

They, who were equal to the Quran, definitely wouldn't say save
truthfulness. They were worthier than anyone else not to contradict the
Quran and they were the first to obey its orders and to refrain from its
prohibitions. After that, would they praise a man, even if he was their
father, falsely and ascribe to him what he didn't have? Would they
acquit him from a real guilt without any evidence just because of
kinship? Certainly not!

Whoever said that, would violate their high position, which was the
very position of the Prophet (s) himself, and would violate the
sacredness of the Prophet (s) and the sacredness of his mission.

**The Sayings of the Companions and Others**

We found among the Prophet's companions that there were many, whose
eyes hadn't been blinded by the evil fancies nor had they deviated from
the right way because of the personal interests, confessing the
faithfulness of Abu Talib and mentioning his good deeds. We don't want
to quote all what was said by the companions about Abu Talib in order to
prolong the research, but we want to quote some of their sayings to be
as evidence to show the truth.

1. The caliph Abu Bakr said: "Abu Talib didn't die until he had said:
There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah." (1)
The same was said by al-Abbas. (2)

2. Abdullah bin Abbas was asked by a man: "O cousin of the messenger of
Allah! Would you tell me about Abu Talib? Was he a Muslim or not?"

Abdullah bin Abbas answered him: "How was he not a Muslim whereas he
said: "They knew well that our son had never been a liar, nor had he
cared for absurdities."

Abu Talib was like the Fellows of the Cave; they kept their
faithfulness secret and showed polytheism so Allah rewarded them
doubly." (3) 3. The great companion Abu Tharr, whose eyes hadn't been
blinded by the shine of gold nor had he been frightened by the violence
of Mo'awiya, said: "By Allah, whom there is no god other than! Abu Talib
(may Allah be pleased with him) didn't die until he became a Muslim ..."
(4)

4. Hassaan bin Thabit, the poet recited:

"If you mourn a dead, Please, mourn the loyal man; the brother of the
loyal." Sibt bin aj-Jawzi when explaining this verse said: "He means
Hamza and Abu Talib." (5)

5. These confessions were not limited to a certain age rather than the
others or to a certain class of people ... everyone, who was honest,
fair, impartial and not affected by the different fancies, had a ray of
light emitted in the darkness to light the straight way.

It was a word of rightness emitted of the mouth of the Abbasid King
Abdullah al-Ma'moon, although he was not such an honest man, but it was
a fair word that slipped away of his mouth willingly or unwillingly. He
said: "By Allah, Abu Talib became a Muslim when he said:

I supported the Prophet; the Prophet of the Lord,
with swords shining like the lightening.
I defended and protected the Prophet of the Lord,
as kind guardian.
I creep to his enemies like a young camel with much heed,
but I roar at them proudly,
as a lion roaring in its liar. (1)

6. Abu Ja'far al-Iskafi, in his thesis (Naqdh al-Othmaniyya) when
trying to refute the thesis of aj-Jahidh (al-Othmaniyya), mentioned Abu
Talib. He couldn't but praise him. He said: "Abu Talib was his father
(the Prophet's father), his guardian, his supporter and defender and
without him, the Prophet (s) wouldn't succeed. But in spite of that, he
(Abu Talib) didn't become a Muslim according to most of the traditions."
(2) We found it odd; in fact we didn't think that Abu Ja'far had said
the last statement, which contradicted the beginning of his saying,
besides that Abu Ja'far was one of those, who had said that Abu Talib
was a Muslim as we will mention it in the last chapter.

What made us doubt more about it was that our source was not the thesis
itself but the summary of the thesis, which was collected by Hasan
as-Sandoobi, whom we talked about in the beginning of the book (At the
threshold). If it was proved that the last statement was said by Abu
Ja'far, he didn't showed his own opinion about the

2 The Theses of aj-Jahidh p.32.

subject but he just said that some of the traditions had mentioned that
Abu Talib was not a Muslim. In another place, when Abu Ja'far talked
about those, who had become Muslims because of the good praying of Abu
Talib and his keeping to the Prophet (s), he said: "... and because of
him (Abu Talib) the Hashemites kept on defending the Prophet (s) in
Mecca against the tribes of Makhzoom, Sahm and Jumah ... and because of
him the Hashemites tolerated the blockade in the Shi'b ... and because
of his praying and his keeping to Muhammad (s), his wife Fatima bint
Assad became a Muslim. He was better in kindness and good nature than
Abu Bakr and others ... What prevented him from being a Muslim -if it
was proved that he hadn't been a Muslim- was but the Taqiya (1)." (2)

This last statement didn't mean that he thought Abu Talib hadn't been a
Muslim as his disciple ibn Abul Hadeed declared. This saying -if it was
his- might have been said by him before he became certain about the
faithfulness of Abu Talib after researching for the truth then he
declared what he had become certain about. This word denied the
announcement of Abu Talib's faithfulness and not the faithfulness itself
because taqiya would impose upon one to conceal the true beliefs. 7.
Aj-Jahidh, in spite of his disgracefull and ignorant situation in his
thesis (al-Othmaniyya) when mentioning Abu Talib to disvalue the
antecedence of Ali in being a Muslim, couldn't but to say: "Don't you
know that Quraysh and all the people of Mecca couldn't harm the

Prophet (s) as long as Abu Talib was alive?" (1)

8. The author of Tathkiratul Khawass, after talking about Abu Talib
through the talking about Imam Ali (s) and mentioning some of the good
deeds of Abu Talib, the sayings of the Prophet (s) about Abu Talib and
his praying Allah to have mercy upon him, said: "I say: the saying that
Abu Talib is among the fellows of Paradise doesn't need pondering on it.
There are many evidences proving that; his caring for protecting the
Prophet (s), supporting him, defending him against the harm of the
polytheists and the unbelievers, the sorrow of the Prophet (s) when Abu
Talib died, naming that year as the year of sorrow by the Prophet (s)
because of the death of Abu Talib and Khadeeja, the praying of the
Prophet (s) that Allah might have mercy upon Abu Talib and might forgive
him and the response of Allah to the praying of Abu Talib especially
when he insisted upon it." (2) Then the author tried to prove the
faithfulness of Abu Talib by mentioning the sayings of the infallible
imams about him and his own sayings about the Prophet (s) and about his
religion.

It would be better to quote this passage: "... and also that no one of
his enemies mentioned that his (Abu Talib's) sons were angry that their
father was unbeliever. Mo'awiya, the bitter enemy and opponent of him
(Ali), Amr bin al-Aass, Abdullah bin az-Zubayr, Marwan and others, in
spite of criticizing him, defaming him and ascribing to him what he was
free from, did never accused him of that his father was unbeliever ...
whereas he (s) often criticized them for the unbelief of their fathers
and mothers and the meanness of their lineage but they didn't
reciprocate ...! This was the best evidence showing his (Abu Talib's)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 The Theses of aj-Jahidh p.5.
2 Tathkiratul Khawass p.10-11.

faithfulness and showing the bad fanaticism of those of the public (the
Sunnis), who ascribed unbelief to him. O you, the just! Think about the
evil will of the batlike people in their enmity against the sun of Islam
and its light ...!" (1) It was a clear evidence and a reasonable
conclusion taken from the actual reality! If those, who were the bitter
enemies of Imam Ali, weren't certain that Abu Talib was faithful, they
would definitely defame Imam Ali with this thing, whereas they tried
their best to ascribe to him much many fabricated defects, which he was
certainly free from. There was no faith, no honesty and no conscience
would prevent them from that but they had no way to it.

9. We had, in this chapter, to quote this clear saying, which came out
of a Christian mouth that knew the rightness and supported it and saw
the light and led to it.

We quote it without any comment for the facts in these lines didn't
need any comment or explanation. The historian writer Abdul Masseeh
al-Antaki said: "The historians disagreed upon the faithfulness of Abu
Talib. Some said he was a Muslim and some said he was a polytheist. Each
group had evidences and prophetic traditions they declared upon. One
like me is not to determine such a serious matter.

But the evidences taken from the actual reality confirmed the thought
of those, who said that Abu Talib was a faithful because man, however
exceeded in loving his kin; his son, his nephew or his son-in-law, could
never be indifferent to his beloved if he saw him violating his religion
or belief and trying to demolish its pillars to replace it with another
religion ... could never be indifferent unless he himself believed in
the new religion for, as you know well, that people stuck to their
religions
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 Tathkiratul Khawass p.11.

and exaggerated in sanctifying them to a degree that a believer was
ready to kill his son or his father if he saw him scoring his religion
or making little of his god. If this was applied to the ordinary people,
it would be worthier to be applied to the upper class of them like Abu
Talib, who had a high position among Quraysh so he was obliged by
himself and by his position to defend his religion, which he and his
people had already believed in, in order that his position would still
be respected, he wouldn't be mean before his people and he wouldn't
expose himself to the wrath of his gods and then to lose his
afterlife.

Hence Abu Talib must believe in the mission of his nephew (s) in his
heart but he didn't announce that for a certain purpose required by
wisdom and political affairs. If he had announced his faithfulness at
the beginning of the mission, Quraysh would have been against him and so
he would have lost his glory and respect ... then he would be unable to
defend his nephew, who was still powerless, against the harm of Quraysh.
This made him conceal his faithfulness.

His deeds, poems and speeches showed his faithfulness clearly,
especially when defending and praising al-Mustafa (1 (s) in his poems
and speeches until the last moment of his life, which he ended with his
clear will. He could do all that depending upon his powerfulness and
high position among Quraysh.

According to that, Abu Talib was one of the best companions and
supporters undoubtedly. How nice it would be if Islam would have some
men, nowadays, who could defend it and could restore its glory as Abu
Talib had done at the dawn of the mission, then Islam would remain
glorious. This was Abu Talib; the guardian of al-Mustafa (s),

his uncle, his beloved, his supporter and the father of our master;
ameerul mo'mineen, the emir of the religion and the victor lion of
Allah, Ali bin Abu Talib ...! Yes, he was this great man, who had
brought up these two luminous suns that lighted the sky of life and
religion!" (1) We don't think that this clear saying needs any comment.
On the pages of history there were many examples confirming the saying
that the religious sentiment was stronger and more determined than the
sentiment of kinship. If both of them met in the field of struggle,
victory would definitely be for the first and defeat would be for the
second.

10. Dr. Taha Hussayn said: "Abu Talib's kindness to the Prophet (s) was
well-known and his strife to defend him and his religion against Quraysh
was so famous." (2)

11. The fair professor Abdul Aziz Sayyidul Ahl wrote a book about Abu
Talib. Some of the readers noticed that he hadn't declared the
faithfulness of Abu Talib.

I am on the contrary to that. I think that the professor have confessed
in the clearest way that Abu Talib was one of the first believers and
the antecedent Muslims and that he had done Islam many favors. If the
book had nothing but the few shiny lines in its preface, it would be the
best evidence proving what the author thought about the sheikh of the
Hashemites.

It would be better to quote some lines of those shiny pages. The author
said: "It was not fair for people towards the man, who had brought up
the Prophet (s) and protected him ore than forty years, that his news
were abridged, scattered and distorted and that the narrators of his
news were so few and confused ... Then all his favors were forgotten and
history, at the

moment of his death, took an odd and weak situation towards him.
History talked about this man, who had protected the prophecy and
defended it strongly, sacrificingly and faithfully, in a way as if it
talked, with a tongue created by fancy, about an adventitious thing or a
new coming foreigner ...!

The man had spent all his life in supporting the Prophet (s), forced
his family to follow him, spent his power, love and monies for him,
quarreled with his enemies, stroke them and defeated them and made
himself ready to hasten sincerely to his nephew in the way of
distresses. The existence of Abu Talib was one of the necessities of the
creation and a support that must be available to make the mission
survive and spread as ibn Khaldoon had said in his theory (1)...

It was the will of Allah; no man, no belief and no religion would win
unless there was a sufficient support defending him or it against the
terrible fanaticism then he or it would prevail by the followers and the
assistants, but that support must be the first because without it there
wouldn't be followers and assistants." (2)

"... and Abu Talib didn't miss the duty, which he was to do, and he
wasn't overburdened with the heavy task that he was to carry out. He
supported the Prophet (s) and assisted him, quarreled with all the
people for the sake of him and pride didn't carried him off to sin as it
carried the others of the greats, who misled the people. Abu Talib was
the master of all of Quraysh with no equal." (3) "The Prophet (s) cried
when his uncle died; and who

1 We wished if the Professor had referred to the source of this saying
of ibn Khaldoon.
2 Abu Talib; the Sheikh of the Hashemites p.5-6.
3 Ibid p.7.

would cry tenderheartedly, mercifully and faithfully if Muhammad, whose
God had brought him up well, wouldn't? He mourned his uncle, who had
brought him up, protected him, supported him and tolerated any
sufferings for him. Abu Talib was his father when he lost the father,
was his right hand when he needed a supporter and was his party when he
needed a strong rightness to defeat the falsehood and to perish the
tyranny!" (1) We tried not to quote many sayings spread in the book but
in spite of our trying we were forced to quote the above words.

Then we want to ask the reader: "Was it possible to say that we didn't
find that the author had declared that Abu Talib was a Muslim after all
what he had said in his book? We quoted these sayings just to be as an
example to show his clear confession, which was definitely the truthful
witness! 12. We found the professor George Jirdaq in his wonderful book
(Imam Ali; the Voice of the Human Justice) praising Abu Talib with
wonderful statements of esteem and glorification.

We thought that we had to quote something of this marvelous mention.

The professor said: "When his grandfather -Abdul Muttalib; the
Prophet's grandfather- died, his uncle Abu Talib -Ali's father- adopted
him. The boy kept on living in the sphere of sympathy, meekness and
well-education, which the late father had left to the resident son." (2)
After mentioning that Abdul Muttalib had recommended Abu Talib to took
after his grandson he said; "... and he wouldn't choose Abu Talib unless
he was certain about the actual feeling and thinking of him. Although
all the sons of Abdul Muttalib were kind and

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2 Imam Ali; the Voice of the Human Justice p.34 (vol.1 p.154).

sympathetic, their kindness and sympathy were not so firm and deep like
Abu Talib's. The effect of kindness and sympathy in the good adopting
and educating would be clearer than the effect of monies; therefore
Abdul Muttalib chose Abu Talib to look after Muhammad (s).

In addition to that Abu Talib had great sympathy towards his nephew
that would force him strongly to take much care of him even if his
father hadn't recommended him to! So how would it be if both of them;
his sympathy and his father's recommendation were together? No doubt
that Abu Talib was a nice and beloved person; a nice person, who had the
wisdom of a kind old man, who was loyal and experienced and who put all
what he had of kindness, loyalty and experience in practice in any
case." (1)

Let us listen to this wonderful word: "As if it was that when Allah had
chosen the Prophet from among the family of Abdul Muttalib, He had
chosen this generous uncle to bring him up! As if the power of the
existence paved the way for Abu Talib to know about the matter of his
nephew what any one else didn't know." (2)

Another wonderful word said by this man talking clearly about the
personality of Abu Talib with all the good meanings it had: "... the
good meanings of Abu Talib's nature moved to be inside the soul of
Muhammad. They became a part of his self while growing under the care of
the loving uncle." (3) "Abu Talib was the first in Islam, who recited
poetry full of love towards Muhammad and calling for supporting him. He
became so angry whenever there was

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2 Ibid.
3 Ibid p.56.

a doing or a saying having some harm to his nephew." (1) "Abu Talib
didn't forget for a moment throughout his life that Muhammad was the
continuity of the high morals, which he himself, his brother Abdullah
and their father Abdul Muttalib had spontaneously." (2) "When Abu Talib
died the Prophet (s) felt that he lost the greatest pillar, to which he
used to resort and which defended him against the harm of Quraysh. This
feeling showed the connection of the means of goodness between Muhammad
and his uncle; the chief of the house, in which Muhammad grew and
acquired his high morals! By losing Abu Talib, Muhammad felt that he
lost the supporter, who was ready to sacrifice himself for him and to
defend him against any harm, who was his fortified shelter against
Quraysh and its oppressors until he said: "I didn't get any harm from my
people until my uncle died." How much we justify this deep sorrow that
had filled Muhammad's heart after his uncle's death?

What was the cause of this grief whereas Muhammad was so patient,
determined and confident that his mission would succeed however his
enemies were many or however his assistants were few and whatever the
situations of the good or the evil people were?

Yes! What was the cause of this grief? It was the disaster that
afflicted Muhammad (s) when he lost his uncle; the dearest man, who had
been so kind to him and who had protected him against the evils of the
enemies. The abundant tears Muhammad shed were clear evidence showing
that he had lost something of his self, his present and his past!" (3)
Then, in another chapter, he talked about the relation

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1 Imam Ali; the Voice of the Human Justice p.35 (vol.1 p.58).
2 Ibid p.59.
3 Ibid p.60.

that united the sympathy between Muhammad and Ali as it was between Abu
Talib and Muhammad and how that unity had given its good fruits. He
said: "The connection of sympathy and brotherhood continued between
Muhammad and Ali and the cooperation between them to make the mission
succeed continued too since Muhammad had known Abu Talib and since Ali
had known Muhammad and since the three had gathered in one house, which
had been based on the meanings of magnanimity.

The qualities of the house of Abu Talib were but an incentive that made
Abu Talib and Ali understand the genius of Muhammad in a way that
appeared in the first as sympathy and sacrifice and in the second as
great intellect, deep feelings and sacrifice like the miracles!" (1) A
reader might say that there was nothing of what the writer had praised
Abu Talib with showing that he said that Abu Talib was a Muslim because
he didn't do save showing Abu Talib's high qualities, his devotedness in
loving and protecting the Prophet (s) and his propagandizing for the
mission and for supporting the Prophet (s).

We are satisfied with this. We don't need from a great thinker like
George Jirdaq to say about the light: I see it ... when he described the
light, shows its aspects and leads to it. This is enough to make us feel
that he walks in the way of the light that he praises. Hence we don't
need to lead the reader with his hand to show him what meanings these
words have because they are too clear and they are full of frank
confession of the faithfulness of Abu Talib. We want to refer to his
sayings: "As if the power of the existence paved the way for Abu Talib
to know about the matter of his nephew what any one else didn't know."

and: "Muhammad was the continuity of the high morals, which Abu Talib,
his brother Abdullah and their father Abdul Muttalib had spontaneously."
How would Muhammad be the continuity of these men, if they were
polytheists? God forbid! Then what was that great soul of Abu Talib,
which melted inside the soul of Muhammad and the two souls mixed to be
two parts of one thing? Then how Abu Talib, Muhammad and Ali became one
thing that couldn't be divided?

The qualities of the house of Abu Talib was the strong incident that
led the father and the son to understand the genius of the Prophet (s)
in a way that appeared in them as great sympathy and sacrifice, which
were held together just to make the mission succeed with all what that
successfulness required of deep sympathy, great intellect and sacrifice,
which was like the miracles.

That high sympathy united between the Prophet (s) and his uncle and his
cousin since he had known his uncle and since his cousin had known him
to make a firm unity that couldn't be separated since the three had
gathered in one house built upon the bases of magnanimity and virtues.
Then what was that goodness, whose means connected between Muhammad, his
uncle and Ali?

Did Muhammad acquire means of goodness from a polytheist one?

Was it hopeful to acquire goodness from a stubborn polytheist?

Could that stubborn polytheist be a partner with the messenger, who
would spread the mission of monotheism?

It was naturally for the Prophet (s), when he lost his uncle, to feel
that he lost the greatest pillars, on which he leant and by which he was
protected and his mission was defended. His uncle was the chief of the
house, in which he had been brought up with the highest of morals. It
was naturally for Muhammad (s) to be sad and sorrowful in spite of that
he was so patient and firm and in spite of his confidence in his God,
Who would definitely make his mission succeed, even if the apparent
means of success were so little that the enemies were much more than the
assistants and that the evil ones were more than the good ones.

But it was the sorrow that remained when one was afflicted by the loss
of the dearest one, who used to protect and defend ... it was the loss
that made one feel as if one lost a part of one's self extended from
one's present to the past! These quotations are enough and we don't need
to quote more. They have enough evidences and confessions clarified by
many personalities leading to the same point although there are
differences controlled by the different fancies and aims. This point is
supporting the wronged right, uncovering the hidden facts and announcing
the truth loudly, in the milieu that is full of noisy lies, odious
barking and hideous hissing of adders scattering their poisons here and
there.

But it is the bright rightness and the shiny truth ...! Allah
definitely prepares the sincere supporters and the loyal assistance of
the rightness lest the virtue and the vice be equal or lest the evil
defeat the good!
