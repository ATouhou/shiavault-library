Letter 33

When was ‘Ali and Aaron Described as the Two Stars?
---------------------------------------------------

**Thul-Hijjah 25, 1329**

It has not been clarified yet what you claim that he, peace be upon him
and his progeny, used to describe ‘Ali and Aaron as the two stars which
are alike; when did he do that?

Sincerely,

*S*
