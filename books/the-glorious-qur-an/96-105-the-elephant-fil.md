105: the Elephant (fil)
=======================

This chapter of 5 Meccan verses was revealed after Disbelievers (or
Atheists) 109 and before Dawn 113. It has a rhyme in -it to parallel the
title word of fil or elephant The historic reference is to the time when
the Abyssinians ruled Yaman in southern Arabia. In the year 570 of the
Christian era, the very year when the

Prophet was born, they invaded the territory of Mecca under their King
Abraha.

Fortunately they were repulsed, as this chapter shows, but the campaign
became legendary as the Year of the Elephant.
