73: Bundled Up (muzzammil)
==========================

These 20 verses arranged in two sections all date from Mecca except for
VV. 10, 11 and 20, which are from Madina the short crisp Meccan verses
are thus followed by a longer passage from Madina. The chapter was
revealed after The Pen 68, and it refers to the Prophet's worries as he
initially accepts his mission and searches for Truth. It gives us an
excellent picture of his concern at this period as well as his care in
attempting to fulfill his Prophetic mission.
