***In the Name of Allah, The Beneficient, The Merciful***

***"Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you, O people
of the House! and to purify you a through purifying." (Sura Ahzab
33:33)***

The Lord of the worlds honoured the Holy Prophet (S) and his Ahlul Bayt
(as) with the robe of infallibility and purity; and thus never did they
waver

from the right path. We could only achieve salvation and perfection if
we follow the example set by them. They are such exemplary personalities
that they have

no peer on the road of guidance.

However in order to achieve this aim we must refer to the authoritative
books of the scholars of Islam. So that we can easily understand the
lofty position of this exalted Family, and their incomparable knowledge
and deeds.

The aim of this booklet is to educate the Muslim masses about Ahlul Bayt
(as) and especially for the youth who can profit greatly by this
endeavour. Each chapter of this booklet begins with a brief historical
introduction followed by the virtues and excellences of the exalted
'family'.

It must be mentioned that the virtues of Ahlul Bayt (a.s.) are such that
no amount of words could suffice.

*However If you cannot draw all the water of the sea.*

*At least obtain enough of it to quench your thirst*. (Persian Couplet).

A cue is sufficient for those who understand. We have attempted to glean
from the corpus of ahadith only those traditions which are considered
authentic and reliable, so as to enable the reader to derive maximum
benefits.

It is hoped that the radiance of these divine personalities will light
up our life, and that we may be included among their helpers.

May Allah hasten the reappearance of the last of them, Hazrat Mahdi (aj)
