33. Reward Of Seeking Knowledge
===============================

When the supplicant for early reappearance of the Master of the Time
(aj) aims that by the reappearance of His Eminence sciences would be
exposed and illuminated for him – as knowledge will not be expounded
except during the period of reappearance – this person will earn the
unlimited rewards of trying to seek knowledge. We have already explained
this point in the chapter of Letter ‘K’ in Part Four of this book.
