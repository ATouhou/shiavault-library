Reflections On Islam and Modern Life
====================================

Seyyed Hossein Nasr Vol. VI, No. 1

FEW subjects arouse more passion and debate among Muslims today than
the encounter between Islam and modern thought. The subject is of course
vast and embraces fields ranging from politics to sacred art, subjects
whose debate often causes volcanic eruptions of emotions and passions
and vituperations which hardly lead to an objective analysis of causes
and a clear vision of the problems involved. Nor is this debate which
consumes so much of the energies of Muslims and students of Islam helped
by the lack of clear definition of the terms of the debate and an
insight into the actual forces involved.

The whole discussion is also paralyzed by a psychological sense of
inferiority and a sense of enfeeblement before the modern world which
prevents most modernized Muslims from making a critical appraisal of the
situation and of stating the truth irrespective of the fact whether it
is fashionable and acceptable to current opinion or not. Lot us then
begin be defining what we mean by modern thought.
