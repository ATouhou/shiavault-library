A Description of this World
===========================

This world is like a body whose head is pride, whose eyes are avarice,
whose ears are greed, whose tongue is dissimulation, whose hand is
desire, whose legs are vanity, whose heart is heedlessness, whose being
is annihilation, and whose product is extinction.

It brings pride to whoever loves it, avarice to whoever prefers it,
greed to whoever seeks it, and cloaks with hypocrisy whoever praises it.
It gives vain power over whoever desires it; it leads to heedlessness in
the person who relies on it. It seduces whoever admires its goods, but
those goods do not last for him. It returns the person who gathers it
and is miserly with it to its own abode, which is the Fire.
