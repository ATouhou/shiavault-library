Foreword
========

We are pleased to present the English translation of the book *Bahth
hawl al-Mahdi* ( An Enquiry Concerning al-Mahdi). The original in Arabic
text written by Shahid as-Sadr in 1397 H., has been published separately
(Beirut: Dar al Ta'aruf lil-Matbu'at, 3rd impression 1401 H. /1981) as
well as within his collected works, al-Majjmu\`ah al-kamilah li
mu'allafat as-Sayyid Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr, vol. 11 (Beirut: Dar al
Ta'aruflil-Matbu'at, 1410 H. /1990).

Praise be to Allah for the success we have had in our progress to this
book. It is enough, by way of introduction to say that the author,
as-Sayyid Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr is one of the great scholars of Islamic
thought, and it is enough, by way of introduction to as-Sayyid as-Sadr,
to let him introduce himself by his works and writings; the only thing
we can do is to enable the worthy readers to become acquainted with his
thought. The reader can see for himself the stature of the writer from
studying his works, of which the present book is an example, albeit
small, but containing great meaning.

This is the fourth book which we have so far published from the writings
of as-Sayyid as-Sadr in the English language. And we pray to Allah, may
He be praised that He guide our steps, and lead us in the right path. He
is the best Guide, the best Helper.
