71. The best deeds
==================

Since this act is cause of happiness of the best of the people of faith,
and making believers happy it is – after Prayer (*Salaat*) – the best of
the deeds. That which proves this is a tradition in the tenth volume of
*Biharul Anwar* quoted from the book of *Manaqib* that His Eminence,
Husain bin Ali (as) said:

I know it certainly that my grandfather the Holy Prophet (S) said: “The
best deed after Prayer is conveying happiness to a believer provided
there is no sin involved in it.” As I saw a slave who was eating food
with a dog. I asked him about it and he replied: O son of the Messenger
of Allah (S) I am sad and by making this dog happy, I am getting
pleasure. Because by master is a Jew and I want to leave him. So Husain
(as) went to his master taking an amount of 200 dinars as the cost of
that slave. The Jew said: “The slave is at your service. And this
orchard is for him and I give the money back to you.”

Imam (as) said: “I also grant the money to you.” He accepted the money
gave the slave to him. Imam Husain (as) said: “I have freed the slave
and given all this to him.” At that moment his wife said: “I have become
a Muslim and surrendered my dower to him.” The Jew said: “I have also
become a Muslim and given this house to my wife.”[^1]
