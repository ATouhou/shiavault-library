Habib bin Mudhahir
==================

The desert was very vast. The sky was full of stars. An old man aged
seventy-five left his tent. The old man jumped on his horse and rode
away.

The old man heard a wolf howling. He was afraid of nothing. He intended
to get to Mudharib (Bani Asad's tribe) near the Euphrates.

When the old man got there, some dogs barked at him. Some men of Bani
Asad's tribe were sitting in a big tent. They were chatting with one
another at night.

The old man greeted them. They stood up for him. He looked dignified,
but they did not know him.

The old man sat down. He had a beard. His beard was as white as cotton.
The men began looking at his calm expression and his white beard.
