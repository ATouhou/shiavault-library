Conclusion
==========

Intellectual, political and social status of Shi'ites and their
leadership in the time of the Imam Hadi (A.S) and Imam Askari (A.S) had
special characteristics.

Shi'ite hadiths were compiled and maters of hadith and religious
scholars were trained to resolve crises and troublesome events. Among
Imams' efforts in that period were protecting Islam from being robbed by
deviants, their proper positioning and elucidations, answering
intellectual and jurisprudential questions and enabling Shi'ites to be
prepared for entrance into the age of occultation of the Twelfth Imam
(A.S).

In political aspect, the Shi'ite leadership was brought to Samarra from
Medina forcibly and taken under strict control. Imam Hadi and Imam
Askari began to develop and reinforce the deputies' network following
the policy of*taqīyah* .

Among their other measures were their support for some 'Alawīs'
uprisings, preserving Shi'ites and allowing some of them to assume some
positions in the government in order to help the poor and the oppressed.

From the social aspect, Shi'ites were in poverty, under pressure,
suppression of beliefs and deprivation. And although Shi'ite leadership
were besieged and restricted from making any contact with Shi'ites and
other people, they had great influence among all classes of society,
from Shi'ites and common people to religious scholars, nobles, people of
the Scriptures, commanders and ministers.
