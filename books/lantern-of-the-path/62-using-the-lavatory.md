Using the Lavatory
==================

The lavatory is called in Arabic 'the place of rest', because there
people may find rest from the burden of impurities and empty themselves
of grossness and filth. There the believer may reflect on how he is
cleansing himself from the food and perishable matter of this world, and
how his own death will come in like manner: therefore he should find
ease in avoiding the world, leaving it aside and freeing himself and his
heart from its distractions. He should be averse to taking and gathering
this world just as he loathes impurity, the lavatory and filth,
reflecting on how something good in one state becomes so base in
another. He knows that holding onto contentment and precaution will
bring him ease in the two abodes.

Thus ease comes from considering this world to be insignificant, giving
up one's enjoyment of it, and removing the impurity of what is forbidden
or doubtful. A person closes the door of pride on himself once he
recognizes this; he flees from wrong actions and opens the door of
humility, regret, and modesty. He strives to carry out Allah's commands
and to avoid His prohibitions, seeking a good end and excellent
proximity to Allah. He locks himself in the prison of fear,
steadfastness, and the restraint of his appetites until he reaches the
safety of Allah in the world to come, and tastes the food of His good
pleasure. If he intends that, everything else means nothing to him.
