Commentary : Verse 29.30
========================

(29) إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَتْلُونَ كِتَابَ اللَّهِ وَأَقَامُوا الصَّلاَةَ
وَأَنفَقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ سِرّاً وَعَلاَنِيَةً يَرْجُونَ
تِجَارَةً لَن تَبُورَ

(30) لِيُوَفّـِيَهُمْ اُجُورَهُمْ وَيَزِيدَهُم مِن فَضْلِهِ إِنَّهُ
غَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ

29.“Verily, those who recite the Book of Allah and establish prayer and
spend (in charity) out of what We have provided them, secretly and
openly, hope for a merchandise which will never perish,”

30. “That He will pay them their rewards fully and increase of His
grace unto them; verily He is Forgiving, Thankful (of their good
deeds).”

**Commentary:**

The words ‘prayer’ and ‘Book’ (the Qur’a-n) have repeatedly been
mentioned beside each other in the Qur’a-n, and also prayer must be
accompanied with helping the deprived. In view of the fact that the
former verses referred to the state of fear of the learned ones from
Allah, the verse under discussion points to their state of ‘hope’,
because, as we said, it is only by means of these two wings that man can
fly high in the sky of felicity and pave the path of spiritual
development. At first, the verse says:

“Verily, those who recite the Book of Allah and establish prayer and
spend (in charity) out of what We have provided them, secretly and
openly, hope for a merchandise which will never perish,”

It is evident that the act of recitation here is not a mere reciting
without contemplation and action. It is a reading which is the origin of
thought, a ponder which is the source of righteous deed, an action
which, on one side, joins man to Allah the manifestation of which is
prayer, and, on the other side, it relates him to the servants of Allah
the manifestation of which is spending in charity, expending from
whatever Allah has bestowed on a person, including: wealth, knowledge,
authority, powerful thought, character, experiences, and, briefly
speaking, from all merits that Allah has given him.

Sometimes this expending is done secretly (/sirran/) to be the sign of
a complete sincerity, and sometimes it is done openly (/‘ala-niyah/) in
order to encourage others and to be the veneration of rituals.

Yes, the knowledge which has such an effect is the source of hope.

Regarding the contents of this verse and the verse before it we
conclude that the true Muslim scholars have the following
characteristics.

From the spiritual point of view, their hearts are full of fear of
Allah mixed with His greatness.

From the point of speech, their tongues are busy reciting the verses of
Allah.

From the point of the spiritual and bodily action, they establish
prayer and worship Him.

And, finally, from the point of aim, the horizon of their thought is so
high that they have left the fleeting material world aside and look for
only the Divine beneficial merchandise which will neither be dull nor
does it vanish.

This point is also noteworthy that the Arabic word /tabu-r/, mentioned
in this noble verse, means destruction. Thus, ‘the merchandise free of
destruction’ is a trade which has neither slackness nor degeneration.

An interesting tradition indicates that once a man came to the
Messenger of Allah (p.b.u.h.) and said: “Why do I not like death?” The
Prophet (p.b.u.h.) said: “Do you have any property?” He answered: “Yes”.
He (p.b.u.h.) told him: “Send it before you.” The man answered: “I
cannot.” The Prophet (p.b.u.h.) said: “Verily the heart of a person is
with his property. If he sends it before himself, he likes to join it;
and if he keeps it (for later), he likes to be with it.” [^1]

This tradition, in fact, has illustrated the whole content of the above
mentioned verse, because it implies that they establish prayer and spend
in charity in the path of Allah (s.w.t.) and are willingly hopeful of
the next world, because they have sent some goodness before themselves
and they are willing to reach it.

The next holy verse states the aim of the true believers as follows.
They do these righteous deeds:

“That He will pay them their rewards fully and increase of His grace
unto them; verily He is Forgiving, Thankful (of their good deeds).”

This sentence, indeed, points to their ultimate sincerity that, in
their actions, they look for nothing but the Divine reward. Whatever
they desire they ask it from Him, and they do nothing for hypocrisy,
showing, admiration, and glorification of this one or that one, because
the most important thing in righteous deeds is the sincere intention.

The application of the Arabic term /’uju-r/ (the plural form of /’ajr/)
in the sense of ‘wage’ is, in fact, a grace from the side of Allah, as
if He sees the servants as His creditors because of their righteous
deeds, while whatever the servants have belongs to Him; even the
strength for performing the righteous deeds has also been given from His
side.

[^1] Majma'-ul-Baya-n, Vol. 8, P. 408

A more affectionate meaning is the sentence which says: “… and increase
of His grace unto them, …”. This gives them glad tidings that besides
the ordinary reward, which itself sometimes is hundreds or thousands
fold of the deed, He increases it of His grace. And He bestows on them,
from some merits which no mind can bear and none in this world is able
to consider.

However, the sentence which says: “… verily He is Forgiving, Thankful
…” shows that the first grace of Allah unto them is that very
forgiveness of their sins and the faults they might have had, since the
most anxiety of a person is the anxiety about this issue.

After having peace of mind from this point of view, He involves them in
His thankfulness, i.e., He thanks for their good deeds and endows on
them the best reward.

It is much to be regretful that a free wise man refuses such a
merchandise and refers to other than it; and worse than that is that he
sells the goods of his self for naught.

Amir-ul-Mu’mineen Ali (a.s.) says: “Is there no free man who can leave
this chewed morsel (of the world) to those who like it? Certainly, the
only price for your selves is Paradise. Therefore, do not sell your
selves except for it.” [^1]

**Commentary : Verse 31**

(31) وَالَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ هُوَ الْحَقُّ
مُصَدّ‌ِقاً لّـِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ اِنَّ اللَّهَ بِعِبَادِهِ لَخَبِيرٌ
بَصِيرٌ

31.“And that which We have revealed to you of the Book, it is the truth
verifying that which is before it, verily Allah, about His servants, is
Aware, Seeing.”

**Commentary:**

In Qur’a-n there is not any false word, or any superstitious idle and
illogical statement; and even the scale of legitimacy of any word or
book is the Qur’a-n: “It is the truth.”

Since the words in former verses were about the believers who recite
the verses of the Book of Allah and actually apply them, the verse under
discussion speaks about this heavenly Book and the evidence upon its
legitimacy as well as the true bearers of the Book. It completes the
discussion mentioned in the former verses about Monotheism by this
discussion which is about prophecy. It says:

“And that which We have revealed to you of the Book, it is the truth
verifying that which is before it, verily Allah, about His servants, is
Aware, Seeing.”

Regarding this fact that ‘truth’ is in the sense of something which
adapts the reality and is consistent with it, this meaning is a
reasoning for proving this idea that this heavenly Book has been sent
down from the side of Allah, because the more we are careful in its
content the more we find it consistent with realities.

There is no contradiction in it; no falsehood or superstition is found
in it; its beliefs and knowledge are consistent with the logic of
wisdom; its statements about the ancient events are far from myths and
legends; and its laws agree with the needs of human beings. This
legitimacy is a clear proof upon this fact that it has been sent down
from the side of Allah.

The holy sentence which says: “… verifying that which is before it …”
is another proof upon the veracity of this heavenly Book, because it
adapts with the signs which have been mentioned in the former heavenly
Books about it and its bringer. (In this regard, there is a detailed
discussion in the commentary of Sura Al-Baqarah, No. 2, verse 41)

The Qur’a-nic sentence which says: “… verily Allah, about His servants,
is Aware, Seeing” states the cause of legitimacy of the Qur’a-n and that
it is parallel with the facts and needs, because it has been sent down
from the side of Allah Who knows His servants well and is Aware and
Seeing unto their needs.

As for the difference between the Qur’a-nic words /xabi-r/ and
/bas?i-r/ some commentators have said that the word /xabi-r/ is in the
sense of cognizance about innate things, beliefs, intentions and the
man’s spiritual construction, while /bas?i-r/ means having insight unto
the man’s outward things and his bodily phenomena. [^1]

Some other commentators believe that the word /xabi-r/ refers to the
principle of the creation of man, and /bas?i-r/ refers to his deeds and
states.
