description: |
  The book which is translated by Ihtijaj al-Tabarsi presents a
  compilation of debates of Holy Prophet Muhammad (S) with scholars and
  representatives of other religions including Judaism, Christianity,
  atheism, dualism and polytheism. The dire need for this work becomes
  essential due to the ceaseless false, baseless and vicious Islamophobia
  propaganda that is being carried out against the Holy Prophet (S) and
  Islam across the world. The debates of the Prophet Muhammad (S) with
  scholars of other religions prove that the dynamic universal message of
  Islam was preached through peace and brotherhood.
