34. Allah Shall Not Exhibit Mercy Upon Them!
============================================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ رَسُولُ اللٌّهِ (ص): أَرْبَعَةٌ لاَ يَنْظُرُ اللٌّهُ إِلَيْهِمْ
يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عَاقٌّ وَ مَنَّانٌ وَ مُكَذِّبٌ بِالْقَدَرِ وَ
مُدْمِنُ خَمْرٍ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his family) has stated:
“On the Day of Judgment there shall be four groups of people upon whom
Allah shall not cast His look of mercy: those who have been disowned by
their parents, those who place obligations upon others after doing good
to them, those who reject the concept of fate and destiny and the one
who consumes intoxicants.”
