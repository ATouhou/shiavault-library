Respect Everyone's Rights
=========================

**( 16 )**

  
 You should respect everyone's right  
 Be they old, young or full of might,  
 Be they for you an adversary  
 Or if they ever made you happy  
 The biggest right is that of God's  
 You should obey him and no other gods  
 Our body parts too have certain rights  
 Such as not viewing forbidden sights  
 Our relatives have many rights  
 Be it our parents, brothers or our wives  
 There are also rights for our deeds  
 Be it charity, supplications or holy feeds  
 All people have certain rights  
 Be they our teachers, or citizens nation-wide
