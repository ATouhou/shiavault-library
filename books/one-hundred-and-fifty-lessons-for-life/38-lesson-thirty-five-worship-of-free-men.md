Lesson Thirty Five: Worship of Free Men
=======================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلْعُبّادُ ثَلثَةٌ: قَوْمٌ عَبَدُوا اللّهَ خَوْفاً فَتِلْكَ عِبادَةُ
الْعَبِيد، و قَوْمٌ عَبَدُوا اللّه طَلَبَ الثَّوابِ فَتِلْكَ عِبادَةُ
الأُجراءِ، وَ قَوْمٌ عَبَدُوا اللّهَ حُبًّا لَهُ فَتِلْكَ عِبادَةُ
الأَحْرارِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Worshippers fall into three groups:

Those who worship Allah for the fear of hell; this is the worship of
slaves.

Those who worship Allah for his reward; this is the worship of
mercenaries.

Those who worship Allah out of love and affection for Him; this is the
worship of free men.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Although the promises of divine reward and punishment are all true, and
his reward is very valuable and his chastisement is very painful, there
are some high minded free men who do not see anything save God, and do
not seek anything save God, and the measure of their heart is full of
love and kindness. They are looking beyond rewards and punishment; their
motive for observing God’s command is only love mingled with his
cognition and knowing.
