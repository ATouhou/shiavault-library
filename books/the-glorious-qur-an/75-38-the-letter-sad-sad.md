38: (the Letter) Sad (sad)
==========================

This five-section chapter contains 88 early Meccan verses; it was
revealed after The Moon 54 and before The Heights 7. Its revelation
occurred during a period of intense trial for the Prophet.

The title refers to the unvoiced velarized sibilant, or the letter "S"
which here may stand for As -Sadiq or the Truthful [God] or the friend
(who tells you everything, whether you want to hear it or not); thus it
means our voice of conscience or power of discretion.

One of David's judgments is described in a dramatic manner (II) Solomon
then appears (III); next Job and other prophets (IV). Soon we have a
description of Heaven and Hell (IV) and the chapter ends with Diabolis'
fall (V).

Sections III-IV are somewhat parallel to those of 21:V-VI.
