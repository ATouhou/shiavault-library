10. Arabic Syntax.
==================

According to Siibawayh words are noun**إسم** , verb**فِعل** , or
particle**حَرف** intended for items which are neither noun nor verb. The
basic difference between the three parts is the declension,** الأعراب**
.In principle, only nouns and their adjectives have case endings to
indicate their syntactic function in a sentence. This classification
remained intact throughout the history of the Arabic grammatical
traditions. The noun category was defined either as a word with certain
syntactic characteristics such as its combinability with the definite
article or as a word denoting an essence. Unlike the definition of the
noun in Western grammar, the Arabic noun category includes adjectives,
pronouns and even a number of prepositions and adverbs. The category of
the verb was defined as a word that denotes an action and could be
combined with some particles. The particle category includes the
remaining words, and their function is to assist other words in their
semantic function in the sentence.
