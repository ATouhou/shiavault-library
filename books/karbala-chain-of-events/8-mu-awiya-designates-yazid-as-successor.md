Mu'awiya Designates Yazid as Successor
======================================

Mu'awiya began a campaign to introduce Monarchy into the structure of
Islam. To have Monarchy, by force or otherwise is alien to Islam, an
innovation in religion, simply not acceptable. Everyone knew that, for
Islam does not subscribe to any form of Royalty through inheritance or
Monarchy. In Islam it is supposed to be Shura.

Nevertheless, Mu'awiya sent his agents to the prominent members of the
communities to obtain allegiance of loyalty to his son**Yazid** .
But**Yazid** was evil, of the drinking type, incompetent, contemptible,
and a pleasure-seeking person. People knew that. So the people protested
vigorously. There was anger everywhere.

Emotions went sky high. To calm people down, at least temporarily,
Mu'awiya decided to send his son**Yazid** to Mecca for the pilgrimage.
Yes,**Yazid** did go to Mecca but only after taking alcohol with him as
well as a chorus of girls for his entertainment.
