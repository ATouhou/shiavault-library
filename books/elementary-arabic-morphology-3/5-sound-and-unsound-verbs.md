22. There are three types of sound verbs: One, perfect verbs. These are
verbs that do not have a *hamza* in its root nor any duplicate letters,
for example: **نَصَرَ.** Two, Double-lettered verbs. These are verbs
that have two identical letters in there root, for example: **مَدَّ.**
Three, verbs that have a *hamza* in their root, for example: **أکَلَ.**

23. There are three types of unsound verbs: One, quasi-sound verbs.
These are verbs whose first root letter is a weak letter, for example:
**وَعَدَ.** Two, hollow verbs. These are verbs whose second root letter
is a weak letter, for example: **قالَ.** Third, defective verbs. These
are verbs whose third root letter is a weak letter, for example:
**دَعا.**

24. There are two types of cluster verbs: a cluster verb whose first and
third root letters are weak, for example: **وَفیَ** and a cluster verb
whose second and third root letters are weak, for example: **شَویَ.**

25. Verbs with a *hamza*, a verb with double letters, or a verb with
weak letters are only considered sound or unsound when the mentioned
letters are in its root.
