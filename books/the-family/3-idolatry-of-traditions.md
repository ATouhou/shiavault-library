Idolatry of Traditions
======================

There are certain traditions that have become so widespread as to be
now generally accepted as if they were God given laws whereas they do
not in reality have any connection with Islam. They are in fact
contradictory to the laws of God. The idolatry of customs and the
prevalence of deviations is a major problem which faces almost every
country.

Hence, the necessity arises for visionaries and academics to undertake
a courageous stand against this crippling malady and to point out its
weaknesses.

These traditions at times assume a holy nature which can make the
people all the more ready to believe them and put them into practice. It
is not proper either from a religious or intellectual standpoint to pay
attention to the compatibility of star signs of the husband or the wife,
and although it is correct that a marriage taking place when the moon is
in Cancer will not be joyous, even this may be eliminated through
supplication, Qur'anic verses or almsgiving.

There are also certain foreign customs which have reached the Islamic
world which observe that the married couple should not be related in any
way. This is not correct as can be seen in the marriage of 'Ali and
Fatima and certain of the Imams and their sons.

It is related that the Emissary of God looked to the children of 'Ali
and those of 'Aqiel saying 'Our daughters are for our sons and our sons
are for our daughters'. 55 Indeed, the habit of Muslims from the
beginning of Islam was to marry between cousins on the mother's and
father's side.

Whatever the case may be, Islamic standards should not be mixed up with
Western standards.

**The Rights of the Married Couple**

The husband has no right over his wife other than the conjugal right,
and in the matter of her exit from the house for purposes other than in
fulfilling her duties 56 since: 'No creature should be obeyed at the
cost of disobedience to the Creator'. 57

These rights are brought together in the following Qur'anic verses :

'And women shall have rights similar to the rights against them
according to what is equitable'. 58

'They are your garments and ye are their garments'. 59

'But men have a degree over them'. 60

There is absolutely no right for the husband to transgress with regards
to his wife, especially as the marriage has taken place with her consent
and with her ability to make conditions and that she has certain rights
over the wealth of the man if he divorces her as well as other choices
which are at her discretion.

She also has the right to make the condition that the man does not
marry another beside her, and that she can be the agent in divorcing
herself, and that he can not divorce her - as many scholars believe -
according to the report that Mansour Ibn Younis said: ' I said to Abu
Al-Hasan that one of my colleagues had a wife whom he divorced so she
left him. Subsequently he wished her back but the woman said " I will
never marry you until you agree not to divorce me and not to marry
another besides me".

So Abu Al-Hasan asked whether he did so and I said Yes. He said 'He has
done ill'. Then he said 'But now, tell him that the condition should
stand, for the Emissary of Allah has said, "The Muslims should stand by
their personal conditions". This was related by Sheikh Murtada in
Al-Makasib. Further detailed study of the hadith and pronouncements of
the jurists can be found in the book of Fiqh. 61


**Section Three : Islam's Word on the New Born Child**

**The Fruit of Marriage**

The goal of marriage is the maintenance of human kind so it is
important that the two parents pay attention to bringing up the children
after marriage or even before it, as in the saying: 'Choose well for
your seed, for what is bred in the bone comes out in the flesh'. Whether
it be that the man chooses a fine mother or the woman chooses a good
father, the child will take after each of them.

Then comes the time for impregnation, the method for which Islam makes
plain. Then the period of pregnancy and suckling where it is recommended
that it be undertaken by a beautiful woman for 'beauty delights'. After
that comes upbringing and education and the age of studying, from
kindergarten until university.

Similarly, care must be taken in choosing a name for them as in the
saying 'nomen est omen' and as has been proven by psychology. Hence, the
Prophet of Islam used to change ugly names to good ones.

The prevalence of children born with deformities, diseases,
incapacities and mental deficiencies in the Islamic world in the last
half of the twentieth century is one of the unpleasant results of
Western lifestyle which has overcome the Muslims with all kinds of
poisons and anxieties and corrupt habits from fashions and cosmetics to
foodstuffs and certain chemical medicines and so forth.

I myself do not recall, before the second world war, even one instance
of any of these terrible occurrences in infants where we used to live in
Karbala and Najaf when Iraq was living in a state of Islam. Today
however, hardly a day passes without us hearing of a case or cases of
abnormalities of this sort.

As for the cure, although it lies in the complete restoration to life
of Islam, prevention gives a clear and effective result in reducing
these diseases.

**The Importance of Health**

The married couple must place a great importance on hygiene because of
the Qur'anic verse: 'save yourselves and your families from the fire'
62, and because of the saying of Al-Sajjad: 'Your body holds a right
over you'. The human being has a responsibility for his body before
Allah as well as for the deeds he has done and their effect on later
generations.

Illness is rife, particularly in this age where the rules of hygiene
have been destroyed in food, drink, clothing, transport, and housing,
together with travel from cold climates to hot climates and vice versa.
Modern technology has destroyed a large part of health, while new modes
of dealing with life have destroyed another part, and foods and drinks a
third part.

Similarly it is imperative that sexual health be maintained where an
excess of intercourse and bathing is one of the most detrimental things
to the health as Avicenna said: 'Stay continent (of semen) as far as you
can for it is the water of life to be poured into the womb'. Likewise, a
paucity of sexual intercourse has its own ills proven by medical
science, so the best is to opt for moderation and the middle course.

It is also important to observe the times for intercourse 63 as is
found in the major works and mentioned by physicians. This particularly
during times of pregnancy when many ills can be directed to the foetus
which can result in its death, deformity or suffering from chronic
disorders.

Hence we see a prevalence of physical and mental disorders in children.
This stems from many causes including unhealthy parents and exposure of
the child to ills. Children then are now being born at a time when
exposure to diseases and problems is increasing, while mankind is
responsible before Allah for his children, as is reported reliably.

**Suckling**

There is no doubt that the best nourishment for the child is the
mother's milk as is confirmed by the religion and by medical science 64,
except when an infectious disease or the like strikes the mother. One of
the reasons for the prevalence of diseases in the child and in the
mother is feeding something other than the mother's milk to the child.

It harms the new born because his metabolism is not prepared for
anything other than his mother's milk and so causes many types of
illnesses as is witnessed these days. It also harms the mother because
the body after childbirth prepares for breast feeding which, if it does
not take place, can cause the milk to become clotted and coagulated in
the breast,

in addition to the dangers of non-secretion of surpluses in the body
which are intended to be discharged through their proper channels.
Furthermore, the breast that does not feed tends towards sagging which
can lead to a decline of its beauty which is a loss where the woman who
has a partner is concerned. Beauty is beloved in religion, common sense
and in customs, as in the hadith: 'God is beautiful He loves beauty' 65,
and other examples.

The intellect weighs up each quality of perfection and beauty is one of
the parts of perfection. As for custom, it is too obvious to mention.

It is recommended that the natural mother should feed the child whilst
in a state of ritual purity because the milk passes to the soul and to
the body as is proven in the religion and in medicine. Hence if the
father is forced to feed the child by one other than the child's natural
mother, then it is recommended that he choose a woman of good qualities
according to the details laid out by scholars.

**Upbringing and Protection**

It is necessary for the parents to protect the children from deviancy
in morals and values. Protecting is incumbent religiously, as in the
Qur'an: 'Protect yourselves and your families from the fire'. 66

In previous times, before modern methods, and before the colonialist
networks had spread through Islamic lands, sons used to follow in the
footsteps of their fathers except in a very few cases. In this age
however, deviancy is the norm. The majority of youngsters today, despite
their young ages and lack of experience,

and with their deviant modes of thinking propagated by colonialist
factions and organisations, view their parents as reactionary and
superstitious, whilst they themselves have been seduced by the
propaganda networks and mass media in the country which promote every
forbidden thing from alcohol to gambling, licence and perversion. The
immature youngster by his nature and inexperience burns with vitality,
activity, desire for change, and lust and is thus quickly attracted
towards deviancy.

Hence arises the necessity of a thorough concern for the children from
parents, relatives, and society as a whole. For without direction, harm
and corruption will not only strike the children but will become general
amongst their families and entire communities.

The forces of Saddam in Iraq, and the Communist forces in Afghanistan
and the like have cost these countries a lot of blood and tears. This is
true of many of the other Islamic lands where many lives have been
sacrificed at their hands.

When we say 'protection of children', we don't simply mean advice and
guidance, but as well as that we mean making them feel part of a healthy
environment and preparing for them the means of obtaining work and
making a living, and forging links for them with a mosque or a school or
a library or a religious community centre, and marrying them when they
come of age and seeking gainful employment for them.

**The Bond of Kinship**

Kinship has a prominent role in safeguarding society from deviance. The
married couple may not be related in any way so kinship develops through
their children, among themselves and between them and the parents'
relatives.

Kinship is a very important means of reaching a common understanding
and of strengthening the bonds of friendship and co-operation, of
solidarity and mutual regard.

The parents should sow the seeds of this in their children so that they
may derive benefit from it and also give benefit. For in kinship there
is benefit gained and given, rights and responsibilities, give and take.
The rewards in it are unfathomable.

In the Qur'an comes the words: '... and be careful of (your duty to)
Allah, by whom you demand one another your rights, and to the bonds of
kinship' 67.

Here the bond of kinship and guarding against breaking it are linked
with piety and God-consciousness and guarding against disobeying Him.

There are many reports about this matter. The Prophet has said: ' The
bond of kinship populates the houses and increases life spans even if
the inhabitants are not good people' 68.

Imam Al-Baqir has said: 'The bond of kinship purifies deeds and makes
wealth grow. It keeps tribulations at bay and increases longevity' 69.
Imam Al-Sadiq has said: 'The bond of kinship improves the character,
cleanses the hands, perfumes the soul, increases sustenance and adds to
longevity' 70.

In another report from Imam Al-Sadiq comes that a man came to the
prophet and said: 'Messenger of God, I have a family and I was their
head but now they bring me pain and I wish now to disown them'.

The Prophet said 'Then God will disown you all'. The man asked 'What
shall I do then? 'The prophet said 'Give to he who denies you, bond with
he who cuts off from you and forgive whoever wrongs you. If you do this,
God will be your backer' 71.

A child disobeying and disrespecting his parents, religiously
prohibited and intellectually detestable, is a form of breaking the bond
of kinship. Similarly a father's disrespect to his children - which is
also disrespect and is referred to in traditions - is also a kind of
breaking this bond.

When a person is born he is surrounded by a plethora of rules and
etiquettes, as well as by universal laws and practices. Therefore a
person should prepare himself to adapt in a practical way to these rules
and etiquettes and to follow those laws and traditions. Otherwise he
will find himself to be the first casualty because of the clash he will
experience coming up against them and in many cases he may also cause
harm to others besides him.

**Virtues and Non-violence**

Supposing that a man had a number of wives long term, or if he became a
widower or his marriage was annulled or he became divorced, he should
not place the status of one wife above the other, nor should he place
the children of one wife over those of another. This can cause the
break-up and dispersion of the family in many cases, and can sow the
seeds of enmity and hatred amongst the children. In extreme cases this
can end up in injury, beating, murder and suicide.

The wives must also not be jealous of one another 72 for this also
propagates enmity and all its consequences including murder, especially
if one wife has children while the other does not.

These kinds of enmities and quarrels as well as being disobedience to
God which warrant punishment in the afterlife also disturb the serenity
of life without good reason.

Some friends of mine who have visited parts of Asia and Africa and
certain Western countries have told me that the concepts held by some
Muslims of hatreds and enmities and quarrels and their consequences are
generally not present there.

Human nature often calls for these things but the consequences of them
is obvious if a person uses his intelligence and strengthens his faith
in God and desires His reward and fears His punishment.

A good upbringing and the development of an environment of tolerance
and loving and non-violence are the best way in manifold areas of life.
Hence the parents should school themselves and their children in noble
morals and praiseworthy virtues and non-violence in marital matters so
that they may find happiness in this world and the next.


**Section Four : Problems and Safeguards towards Maintaining
Harmony**

**The Happy Household**

Married life can vary greatly from couple to couple. One couple can
make their home heavenly and happy through morals and virtues, good
habits and sympathetic behaviour.

Another couple however, can be found to be the opposite of this, one or
both of them being uncouth, violent and bad mannered or with bad habits
whether it be smoking in the vicinity of the other person which can
cause friction, or to be indiscreet and not to say anything, or by
eating pungent foods like garlic, onions, and leeks.

It is perhaps a familiar sight to see husbands fleeing from their homes
to avoid their ill-mannered wives and vice versa when the wife occupies
herself in a certain activity in order to avoid her husband.

The humanistic and Islamic view of society is that each of the married
couple should respect and be aware of their partner's needs in their
life and realise that they are also a human being with emotions,
feelings and sensitivities and that any ill-mannered behaviour can cause
pain and in many cases ends up in divorce and separation.

It is important that each partner wherever possible should overlook the
slip-ups and mistakes of the other just as the prophet has ordered.

I myself once saw an ill-charactered man drive his wife to death and
his second wife followed her.

The person of bad character is generally driven by his behaviour
towards bad consequences, while good character and morals usually lead
to good consequences. This is the principle involved which the prophet
made clear.

There is no doubt that human natures vary in goodness and badness.
However, the effect upon the person of education and self-development
cannot be denied. A person should educate himself in good personal
relationships with others, as is mentioned in the Qur'an in the verse:
'... good fellowship' 73.

Maintaining an atmosphere in the household where no one party forces
the other to work in the house or for the house can make the household
peaceful and happy. Compulsion though can make the house into a hell on
earth which can destroy all the occupants including any children there
may be.

**No to Extravagance!**

The married couple should avoid in particular extravagance and
profligacy.

The difference between the two is that the former is to do with excess
where the necessity remains in principle, while the latter is
expenditure that is not necessary in the least. In the Qur'an comes an
indication that the seriousness of the second type is greater in the
words: 'Spendthrifts are akin to devils' 74, whereas this kind of
seriousness has not been said of extravagance.

In a hadith it is said 'Pouring out excess water and discarding a date
is extravagance' 75. Certain laws relating to this subject have been
highlighted in 'The Book of Food and Drink' in 'The Encyclopaedia of
Fiqh' 76.

In another Hadith is said: 'God is merciful; to he who knows his
capacity and does not transgress his limit' 77. The lively society is
one which makes use even of its refuse. Regarding the Qur'anic verse:
'God will revive the dead' 77, the probable meaning is that they are of
no use until God revives them and they become of the living.

At times, there may be a sense of competitiveness between the partners
or between two families. This causes many evils, much to the delight of
Satan, including extravagance, wastage and ostentation to the level of
excess.

Imam 'Ali once gave a ruling that camel meat slaughtered as a form of
'one-upmanship' between two tribal leaders was forbidden and it was left
to the scavengers. Perhaps the point is that getting the message across
is more important than leaving the meat for the scavengers, even though
the meat was slaughtered in a lawful manner.

In any case it is important that the married couple co-operate together
from the outset with a view to creating a family whose basis is love and
affection and whose driving force is purposefulness and reality, not
squandering and extravagance, false facade and idle boasting.

**Work Within the Household**

Manual work within the household is a blessing which is necessary for
psychological well being and beneficial for the body because it leads to
health and well being.

It is then important that the married couple should concern themselves
with handiwork, and that each one choose for themselves some task or
they both undertake it together.

We can still remember the days when families use to work in their
houses or outside in the garden or in the fields or the farmyards when
people used to live a life of self-sufficiency not being in need of
outsiders.

I myself remember the problems that the world experienced after World
War II and the famine that struck humanity as a result of those wars.
However, Iraq and certain other Islamic countries were not as affected
by the famine due to their reliance upon their own produce. At that
time, all needs were satisfied internally, and we did not need to import
more than white sugar and some cloth.

People used to make their own clothes on simple looms and didn't need
imported cloth in any great measure. Our father 78 (May the mercy of God
be upon him) used to tell us to take our tea with dates or molasses
whenever we needed sugar. Then, the entire imports of Iraq did not
exceed 30 million Dinars, as all our needs were met from within the
country.

These days however, after the flood of oil wells, these imports have
reached tens of billions of Dinars but look at the state of Iraq, and
the state of the people. One glance at the problems, poverty and hunger
which is sweeping the country is enough to confirm the reality. 79
Therefore a gradual independence from outsiders must be worked towards,
through for example making the house into a workstation for the married
couple.

It is also important that charitable organisations help provide
opportunities for married couples and facilitate and stimulate work for
them.

64 Psychological studies have shown that the child who is fed at the
breast of his/her mother is usually less susceptible to psychological
problems. The sense of security, warmth and affection which the baby
feels at the mother's breast increase his/her attachment to her in the
future. Also, as doctors would confirm, all attempts to find a synthetic
substitute to mother's milk have failed.

Mother's milk provides the complete requirements for the health of the
infant and its physical and mental growth. (Our children, their growth,
nutrition and their problems. 'Ali Hasan. p.70.). Also among the
benefits of breastfeeding for the mother is the fact that it lessens the
risk of her contracting breast cancer and helps to return the womb to
its natural state and also works to dispel spots and blemishes from the
face of the mother.

also ' The jealousy of a woman amounts to disbelief but the jealousy of
a man is faith'(The Summit of Eloquence: Article 124). From the sayings
