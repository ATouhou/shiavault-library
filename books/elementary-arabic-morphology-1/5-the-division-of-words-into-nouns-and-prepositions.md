=================================================

17. How many divisions of words are there?

18. What is a verb?

19. What is a noun?

20. What is a preposition?

17. Words are divided into three categories:

• verb: **کَتَبَ یَکتُبُ اُکتُب** (write, he writes, he wrote)

• noun: **خالِد عُصفُور تُفّاحة**(apple, sparrow, Khalid)

• preposition: **هل فی لم** (*lam* of negation, in, *hal* question word)

18. A verb is a word that denotes an action or state in the past,
present or future. For example: **کُنتُ کَتَبتُ اکُونُ اکتُبُ کُن
اُکتُب** (write, be, I write, I am, I wrote, I was)

19. A noun is a word that denotes an adjective or noun that can be
described.

• A noun that can be described is a noun that denotes a person, animal
or thing. For example: **مریم فَرَس وَرَقَة** (paper, horse, Maryam)

• An adjective is a word that is related to another word describing its
condition: for example: شَجَرَةٌ **عالیَةٌ حَیَوانٌ بَرّیٌ** (a wild
animal, a tall tree)

20. A preposition is a word that does not have a meaning unless it is
related to a verb or noun. For example: the *lā* of negation for it does
not have a meaning unless one says **لا یضرِبُ** ( don't hit).
