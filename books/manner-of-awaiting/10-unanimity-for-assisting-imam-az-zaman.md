Unanimity for Assisting Imam az-Zaman
=====================================

Numerous reasons have been mentioned for the occultation and concealment
of Imam az-Zaman (a.t.f.s.). Among them, we may mention the fickle and
unfaithful attitude among the people. About Imam az-Zaman, Khwaja Nasir-
uddin Tusi writes: “His existence is grace and his domination yet
another grace; his occultation and concealment is due to us.”[^1]

If the people desire their Imam’s advent, they must get united by heart
in this respect and must manifest this holy union in their deeds too. In
the case of past nations too, if a prophet would voluntarily go into
hiding and the people would sincerely and unitedly pray to Allah for the
return of the said prophet, Allah would grant their wish.[^2] In this
regard, Imam az-Zaman (a.t.f.s.) has recommended us to follow the same
path. In his lofty address to Shaikh Mufid (413 A.H.), Imam (a.t.f.s.)
says:

“If our Shias (may Allah give them the opportunity of obedience) would
be firm on their promises whole-heartedly, our meeting would not be
delayed and they would see us much sooner; a seeing that is accompanied
with true recognition with respect to us. Thus, nothing keeps them far
from us save their unpleasant actions that we become aware of and which
we don’t reckon to be worthy.”[^3]
