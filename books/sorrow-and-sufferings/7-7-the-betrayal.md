(7) The Betrayal
================

Pin drop horrifying silence prevailed all round

The mosque of Kufa stood on hallowed ground

Treachery it had witnessed time and again

It was the mosque where Ali had been slain.

The town crier was reading the Governor's decree

"To associate with Muslim will not go free

He is an emissary of Prophet's grandson, Husayn

Who has refused allegiance to Yazid, with disdain."

When the prayer was over, Muslim looked back

The mosque was empty, earlier it was packed

He glanced at his host, Hani Ibn Urwah

No words were needed, only a breath choking, Ah!

The packed mosque had just witnessed jubilant scenes

So great was the rush to swear allegiance to Muslim

They had madly jostled and vied with each other

In honoring Muslim, as Husayn's cousin brother.

They exchanged glances, the picture was clear

For their own lives they had absolutely no fear

To inform Master Husayn was the sole prime need

Whom could they trust? No, none, indeed!

Hani rushed out, choked to the brim

He had in his house, two sons of Muslim

He whisked them out by the back door

For safety's sake, there was no other go.

Muhammad and Ibrahim, two innocent lads

Were anxiously awaiting return of their dad

They were now on the road; alone, all alone!

The cruel treacherous world was now their home.

Soon was Hani's house completely surrounded

The hopes he had nourished were soon grounded

He fought the armed troops of upstart Obeidullah

The odds were too heavy; he prayed to Allah!

He was soon overpowered and chained

There was now no hope which remained

His only thought was to inform post haste

To Husayn, of the events and breach of faith

After Hani's departure, he reflected a while

A train of thoughts flowed, mile after mile

Hani was sincere, there was no iota of doubt

But if in danger, whom could he for help shout.

He thought of his sons, the two young kids

In the house of Hani, he hoped they were hid

He prayed to God to spare him for a little while

So that, to Husayn, he could send the secret file.

It was night, he had no place to go

Tired and forlorn, his walk was slow

Curfew was imposed, no soul stirred out

The search was on in all possible hideouts.

He sat for a while and leaned against the door

The door of a house with an old muddy floor

An old lady came out to see who it was

"My son! Why do you not return to your house?"

"Do you not have a wife nor children?

Go and rest, in peace, in your own garden!"

A lump came to his throat: yet, he sadly smiled

"I come from the house of the Prophet," he replied.

The venerable old lady was in shocking pain

"My God! You are Muslim, the Emissary of Husayn,

How did I fail to recognize you, O, My Lord!

What reply will I give to my Most Merciful God?"

She hid him on the old wooden attic floor

Extinguished the lights and shut the door;

Her son soon returned from his usual rounds

He was in the army of the Yazidi hounds.

"Hani has been beheaded," he declared,

"The search is now on for Muslim and his lads."

The simple old lady was moved to tears

And confided to her son, her own gnawing fears.

The son was elated at the fortunate news

He pretended sorrow, as a deceitful ruse,

"I will soon be back with the two young lads"

And rushed to his Master, Obeidullah Ibn Ziad.

The sound of horses hoofs were approaching near

Muslim was in his prayers; he knew no fear

He immediately realized, he had been betrayed

His time was up; he would soon be dead!

The noble lady was aghast! How could she explain?

It was her son who had brought her everlasting shame

Muslim assured Taha that he was absolutely sure,

She was a lover of Husayn and his grandsire!

The lane was narrow, it had no width

Two horses abreast could hardly breath

It was an ideal ground for single combat

Like lion, Muslim ferociously fought.

To the enemy, it soon became abundantly plain

It was a futile and sure loosing game

From housetops, they hurled missiles and stones

Seriously wounded, M7uslim left his vantage position.

He desperately moved forward; they all fell back

So fierce was the charge, they all fled in a pack

To stop him, they thought of a clever ruse

They dug a trench and had it covered, as subterfuge.

He rushed on wielding his sword dexterously

He fell in the trench, as planned treacherously;

The retreating hounds soon swooped down

In no time, he was heavily chained and bound.

In the streets of Kufa, he was soon paraded

Those who had sworn him allegiance, were delighted

They were watching him with perfect equanimity

As if he was an utter stranger; what rascality!

"As per Arab custom, I shall fulfill it

Your last wish if you shall reveal it."

A glint of hope came to Muslim's eyes

Why not accept and make this final try?

Obeidullah, if you are true to your word,

Fulfill my last wish and inform my lord

To return to Medina, before it is late

As coming to Kufa, would be a sheer waste.

The crafty Obeidullah was absolutely flabbergasted

Spare the lives of my two sons, he could have suggested

He could not even imagine, how could a person

Think of his master, when doomed were his sons.

Muslim's last wish did not go in vain

Merciful God kindled the heart of one of them

He left Kufa post-haste to fulfill his mission

And informed Husayn of Muslim's martyrdom.

Husayn wept bitterly, as never before

Muslim's daughter realized her father was no more

One pair of earrings, he lovingly gave to her

And another to Sakina, his child most dear.

"Are you returning back?" the messenger inquired

"No! I am not," Husayn, very sadly replied

"As ordained, I am going to meet my destiny,

And so are my faithful friends, who are with me."
