The Second Degree
=================

It is when his goal is to obtain a permissible worldly gain such as
wealth or marriage to a beautiful or distinguished woman, etc., so he
feigns grief and keeps himself busy with admonishing and reminding
others so that funds may be spent on him. He will then sell more of his
merchandise if he is a merchant, a businessman, or among money making
folks. Or if he wishes to marry a distinguished woman, such as the
daughter of a righteous scholar, he pretends to her father to be a man
of knowledge and adoration so that he may marry him to his daughter.

This sort of pretension is prohibitive because it seeks through the
means of obedience to AllƒÅh the wares of this lowly life, but it is of a
lesser degree than the first. What is sought through this pretension is
by itself permissible but it is contemptible, and its reality is
*shirk*; the absolute authority is the privilege of the True One, the
Almighty, when it comes to dealing with His servants.
