2) Stages of Piety
==================

Moralists consider three stages for Taqwa:

a. To safeguard *self* from the eternal chastisement and from abiding in
hell due to correcting oneâ€™s beliefs. When a human being tries to
rectify his beliefs, to avoid atheism, to improve his belief in
monotheism, prophethood, and the Day of Judgment, to adopt a right path
in Imamate, to perform obligatory duties, and to leave the forbidden
acts, he will save himself from chastisement and fire.

b. To avoid committing sins verbally and practically; such a meaning of
Taqwa is best known to the people of religion.

c. To safeguard the heart from what keeps it busy away from truth, from
the forbidden, blameworthy, and permissible acts. This is the excellent
stage of Taqwa.
