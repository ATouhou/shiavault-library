A Side Note: Is It Shirk To Say "ali[as] Mawla"?
================================================

People criticize us for saying "Mawla" to Ali (as). They base their
argument on the verse:

<p dir="rtl">
لَّي'سَ بِأَمَانِيِّكُم' وَلا أَمَانِيِّ أَه'لِ ال'كِتَابِ مَن يَع'مَل'
سُوءًا يُج'زَ بِهِ وَلاَ يَجِد' لَهُ مِن دُونِ اللّهِ وَلِيًّا
</p>

[Yusufali 4:123] whoever works evil, will be requited accordingly. Nor
will he find, besides Allah, any protector (Waliyan) We pray to Allah
(swt) to give them the "Taufeeq" and "Ability" to see the other part of
Qur'an and Hadith too and to take guidance from them.

In fact, saying "Mawla" to Ali (as) is the "Sunnah" of Rasool Allah
(saww), when in the valley of Khum, he said:

"For whoever I am his Leader (mawla), 'Ali is his Leader (mawla)."

So, we only follow the "Sunnah" of Rasool Allah (saw) , when we say
"Ali Mawla". And if these people still want to criticize us, then they
have to first issue a fatwa of shirk against Rasool Allah (saww).

**Can anyone Intercede us beside Allah?**

In verse 39:43-44, Allah says that there is no intercessor beside
Allah.

<p dir="rtl">
أَمِ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ شُفَعَاء قُل' أَوَلَو' كَانُوا لَا
يَم'لِكُونَ شَي'ئًا وَلَا يَع'قِلُونَ قُل لِّلَّهِ الشَّفَاعَةُ جَمِيعًا
لَّهُ مُل'كُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَال'أَر'ضِ ثُمَّ إِلَي'هِ تُر'جَعُونَ
</p>

[Yusufali 39:43-44] What! Do they take for intercessors others besides
Allah? Say: "Even if they have no power whatever and no intelligence?"
Say: "To Allah belongs exclusively (the right to grant) intercession But
in verses 19:87 and 43:86, Allah says that there are some people who can
also intercede for us with the permission of Allah.

<p dir="rtl">
لَا يَم'لِكُونَ الشَّفَاعَةَ إِلَّا مَنِ اتَّخَذَ عِندَ الرَّح'مَنِ
عَه'دًا
</p>

[Yusufali 19:87] None shall have the power of intercession, but such a
one as has received permission (or promise) from (Allah) Most
Gracious.

<p dir="rtl">
وَلَا يَم'لِكُ الَّذِينَ يَد'عُونَ مِن دُونِهِ الشَّفَاعَةَ إِلَّا مَن
شَهِدَ بِال'حَقِّ وَهُم' يَع'لَمُونَ
</p>

[Yusufali 43:86] And those whom they invoke besides Allah have no power
of intercession;- only he who bears witness to the Truth, and they know
(him).

Are we associating partners with Allah, when we say that Rasool Allah
(saww) can also intercede for us by the permission of Allah? Are there
contradictions in the Qur'an? Rule: When Allah says that He is the sole
Intercessor, then some pious people are already allegorically included
in it, who intercede with the permission of Allah.

(Note: There are 10 occasions in Qur'an wherein Allah says that there
is no Intercessor except him. And there are 7 occasions wherein Allah
says that there are some pious people and angels who can intercede us,
with Allah's permission).

Salafi Tactics: They always quote ONLY those verses where Allah says
that all intercession belongs to Him. But they totally neglect and
discourage mention of those verses, that state that some other people
and angels have also been given the power by Allah to intercede for
us.


**Fadhl (Grace / Bounty) is only in Hands of Allah?**

You will find Salafi often quoting the following verse with great
stress.

<p dir="rtl">
لِئَلَّا يَع'لَمَ أَه'لُ ال'كِتَابِ أَلَّا يَق'دِرُونَ عَلَى شَي'ءٍ
مِّن فَض'لِ اللَّهِ وَأَنَّ ال'فَض'لَ بِيَدِ اللَّهِ يُؤ'تِيهِ مَن
يَشَاء وَاللَّهُ ذُو ال'فَض'لِ ال'عَظِيمِ
</p>

[Yusufali 57:29] That the People of the Book may know that they have no
power whatever over the Grace of Allah, that (His) Grace is (entirely)
in His Hand, to bestow it on whomsoever He wills. For Allah is the Lord
of Grace abounding.

By quoting these type of verses, the Salafi want to compare us (i.e.
Shia and our Ahl'ul -Sunnah brethren, who believe that Rasool Allah
(saww) has also been given the powers and authority to benefit us) to
the Kuffar and Ahle-Kitab (Christians and Jews). They try to prove that
in the same way that the Kuffar and Ahle Kitab committed shirk by having
such beliefs, the Sunni and Shi'a have likewise fallen into the quagmire
of Shirk.

Sadly, by doing this, they completely neglect other parts of the Qur'an
and Sunnah. See the following verses.

<p dir="rtl">
وَلَو' أَنَّهُم' رَضُو'ا' مَا آتَاهُمُ اللّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَقَالُوا'
حَس'بُنَا اللّهُ سَيُؤ'تِينَا اللّهُ مِن فَض'لِهِ وَرَسُولُهُ إِنَّا
إِلَى اللّهِ رَاغِبُونَ
</p>

[Shakir 9:59] And if they were content with what Allah and His
Messenger gave them, and had said: Allah is sufficient for us; Allah
will soon give us (more) out of His grace and His Messenger too; Is
Allah himself committing shirk by saying that His Messenger can also
GIVE to others along with Him?

<p dir="rtl">
يَح'لِفُونَ بِاللّهِ مَا قَالُوا' وَلَقَد' قَالُوا' كَلِمَةَ ال'كُف'رِ
وَكَفَرُوا' بَع'دَ إِس'لاَمِهِم' وَهَمُّوا' بِمَا لَم' يَنَالُوا' وَمَا
نَقَمُوا' إِلاَّ أَن' أَغ'نَاهُمُ اللّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ مِن فَض'لِهِ فَإِن
يَتُوبُوا' يَكُ خَي'رًا
</p>

[Yusufali 9:74] They swear by Allah that they said nothing (evil), but
indeed they uttered blasphemy, and they did it after accepting Islam;
and they meditated a plot which they were unable to carry out: this
revenge of theirs was (their) only return for the bounty (Fadhl) with
which Allah and His Messenger had enriched them! If they repent, it will
be best for them;

And do we really associate Rasool Allah [saww] as a Partner to Allah
when we say that he [saww] can also ENRICH the others out of his Bounty
(Fadhl) along with Allah?

Salafi Tactics: Since all these kind of verses go directly against the
self-invented definition of Shirk given by Salafi, therefore, they are
compelled to neglect and avoid them. They discourage the mentioning of
these types of verses, because they fear that it will lead the people
towards Shirk.

We hope that our dear readers would now be able to better understand
the evils of this literal approach. Let us go towards help from Rasool
Allah [saww].

Is Allah the Only and Sufficient Helper? Salafi claim that Allah is the
Only and Sufficient Helper. And we (Shias and our Ahle-Sunnah brothers),
agree with them 100% on this statement. Allah says in Qur'an:

وَاللّهُ أَع'لَمُ بِأَع'دَائِكُم' وَكَفَى بِاللّهِ وَلِيًّا وَكَفَى
بِاللّهِ نَصِيرًا [Yusuf Ali 4:45] But Allah hath full knowledge of your
enemies: Allah is enough for a protector, and Allah is enough for a
Helper.

<p dir="rtl">
قُل' مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَع'صِمُكُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ إِن' أَرَادَ بِكُم'
سُوءًا أَو' أَرَادَ بِكُم' رَح'مَةً وَلَا يَجِدُونَ لَهُم مِّن دُونِ
اللَّهِ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا
</p>

[Yusufali 33:17]...Nor will they find for themselves, besides Allah,
any protector or helper. Now after saying that we agree with Salafi on
this point (that Allah is the Only and Sufficient Helper), we would like
to ask Salafi if they too agree with us on the following point:

Our claim is this that when Allah says that He is the Only and
Sufficient Helper, then Rasool Allah [saww], Gabriel (as), righteous
believers and angels are already included in it allegorically. Please
look at the following verse.

<p dir="rtl">
إِن تَتُوبَا إِلَى اللَّهِ فَقَد' صَغَت' قُلُوبُكُمَا وَإِن تَظَاهَرَا
عَلَي'هِ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ مَو'لَاهُ وَجِب'رِيلُ وَصَالِحُ
ال'مُؤ'مِنِينَ وَال'مَلَائِكَةُ بَع'دَ ذَلِكَ ظَهِيرٌ
</p>

[Pickthal 66:4] If ye (wives of Muhammad) twain turn unto Allah
repentant, (ye have cause to do so) for your hearts desired (the ban);
and if ye aid one another against him (Muhammad) then lo! Allah, even
He, is his Protecting Friend (Mawlaho), and Gabriel and the righteous
among the believers; and furthermore the angels are his helpers.

Does this verse really mean that Allah is not the ONLY and SUFFICIENT
Helper. Are there contradictions in Qur'an? And do we really associate
Partners to Allah when we believe that Gabriel (as), some righteous
believers and angels can also be our Mawla (guardians) and Naseer
(helpers), along with Allah?

If we still follow the Literal Approach and Self Defined definition of
Shirk by our Salafi friends, then certainly we are going to make Allah
himself a Mushrik (naudo-billah), and along with Him all those too, who
believe in Whole Qur'an. And please also look at this verse.

<p dir="rtl">
وَمَا لَكُم' لاَ تُقَاتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ وَال'مُس'تَض'عَفِينَ
مِنَ الرِّجَالِ وَالنِّسَاء وَال'وِل'دَانِ الَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا
أَخ'رِج'نَا مِن' هَـذِهِ ال'قَر'يَةِ الظَّالِمِ أَه'لُهَا وَاج'عَل
لَّنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ وَلِيًّا وَاج'عَل لَّنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ نَصِيرًا
</p>

[Yusufali 4:75] .. Men, women, and children, whose cry is: "Our Lord!
Rescue us from this town, whose people are oppressors; and raise for us
from thee one who will protect (Waliyan); and raise for us from thee one
who will help (Nasira) (us)!" When Allah is enough as Protector
(Waliyan) and Helper (Nasira), then why these people asked Allah for
another person who should protect and help them?

And when Allah is giving the attributes of Wilayat (protection) and
Nusrat (help) to this person, then why to claim that no one other than
Allah can Benefit us (either by protecting or helping)? Indeed there are
pious people of Allah, who can Benefit us by the permission of Allah.
And it is not shirk to take these Awliya (friends of Allah) too as our
Protectors and Helpers, along with Allah (i.e. they are not separated
from Allah in these attributes, but Allah has kept them with Him).

And the opposite party is Shaitan and his Awliya (friends). If we take
Shaitan or his Awliya as our Protector and Helper, then surely it is
Shirk. يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا' اس'تَعِينُوا' بِالصَّب'رِ
وَالصَّلاَةِ [Pickthal 2:153] O ye who believe! Seek help in
steadfastness and prayer.

NOTE: There are a lot of more verses of Qur'an and Ahadith, where help
and benefit has been sought allegorically by others than Allah. And one
is not allowed to interpret them literally, otherwise several
contradictions will appear in Qur'an.
