Hijsain of Kerbala
==================

Men weep for you today in nzany lands And on their breasts in bitter
anguish beat, And in sad, mournful tunes, the tales repeat Of how you
lost your life upon the sands. You nobly spurned the tyrant's base
demands And Chose death to prevent your soul's defeat,- Became a martyr
with unflinching feet For these well may one weep who understands.

This sorrow at your death, despite the years Is still as fresh, which
Time has failed to quell. In every heart this day new pain appears And
of your sufferings men each other tell. They see a vision through
slow-falling tears Of that lone battle where athirst you fell.
