6. ‘Aqidah Al-Raj’ah: Between ‘Umar And ‘Ali
============================================

‘Umar b. al-Khattab, the second Sunni *khalifah*, was one of the
earliest to publicly declare belief in *al-raj’ah*, long before even the
unproved profession of the same *‘aqidah* by Ibn Saba. Imam al-Bukhari
(d. 256 H) records:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا إسماعيل بن عبد الله حدثنا سليمان بن بلال عن هشام ابن عروة عن
عروة بن الزبير عن عائشة رضي الله عنها زوج النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم
:أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم مات وأبو بكر بالسنح - قال إسماعيل
يعني بالعالية - فقام عمر يقول والله ما مات رسول الله صلى الله عليه و
سلم قالت وقال عمر والله ما كان يقع في نفسي إلا ذاك وليبعثنه الله
فليقطعن أيدي رجال وأرجلهم .
  </p>
</blockquote>

Isma’il b. ‘Abd Allah – Sulayman b. Bilal – Hisham b. ‘Urwah – ‘Urwah b.
al-Zubayr – ‘Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her, the wife of the
Prophet, peace be upon him:

The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, died while Abu Bakr was at a
place called al-Sunah (i.e. al-‘Aliyah). ‘Umar stood up, saying, “I
swear by Allah! The Messenger of Allah is not dead!” She (‘Aishah)
narrated: ‘Umar said, “I swear by Allah! Nothing occurred to my mind
except that. **Verily! Allah will** **RESURRECT**[^1] **him and he will
cut the hands and legs of some men**."[^2]

It is this very belief that has been attributed to ‘Abd Allah b. Saba in
the *mawdhu’* (fabricated) report documented by Imam Ibn Jarir al-Tabari
(d. 310 H):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فقال لهم فيما يقول لعجب ممن يزعم أن عيسى يرجع ويكذب بأن محمدا يرجع وقد
قال الله عز و جل إن الذي فرض عليك القرآن لرادك إلى معاد فمحمد أحق
بالرجوع من عيسى قال فقبل ذلك عنه ووضع لهم الرجعة فتكلموا فيها
  </p>
</blockquote>

Then, he said to them, “It is strange of he who claims that ‘Isa will
return but rejects that Muhammad will return. Meanwhile, Allah the
Almighty has said, ‘Verily, He Who has ordained the Qur’an upon you (O
Muhammad) will surely bring you back to a place of return’ (28:85). As
such, **Muhammad is more entitled to return than ‘Isa**.” So, it was
accepted from him, and he created for them (the doctrine of)
*al-raj’ah*, and they spoke about it.[^3]

It is indeed strange that the Ahl al-Sunnah ignore ‘Umar and attack Ibn
Saba instead for this *‘aqidah*, despite the *complete* lack of evidence
to establish that the latter *ever* believed it?! Indeed, wonders never
end.

Meanwhile, there is also good Sunni evidence to support a theory that
Amir al-Muminin ‘Ali b. Abi Talib, *‘alaihi al-salam*, equally believed
in his own *raj’ah* before the *Qiyamah*. Imam al-Tabari again records:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا محمد بن المثنى، قال: ثنا محمد بن جعفر، قال: ثنا شعبة، عن القاسم
بن أبي بزة، عن أبي الطفيل، قال: سمعت عليا وسألوه عن ذي القرنين أنبيا
كان؟ قال: كان عبدا صالحا، أحب الله فأحبه، وناصح الله فنصحه، فبعثه الله
إلى قومه، فضربوه ضربتين في رأسه، فسمي ذا القرنين، وفيكم اليوم مثله.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Muhammad b. al-Muthanna – Muhammad b. Ja’far – Shu’bah – al-Qasim b. Abi
Bazzah – Abu al-Tufayl:

I heard ‘Ali while they asked him about Dhu al-Qarnayn: “Was he a
prophet?” He replied, “He was a righteous servant. He loved Allah and
Allah loved him. He sought the guidance of Allah and He guided him.
Then, Allah sent him to his people. **But, they struck him twice on his
head. As a result, he was named Dhu al-Qarnayn. And among you today is
an example of him**.[^4]

Commenting upon this exact *riwayah*, Prof. Ibn Yasin pronounces:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وسنده صحيح
  </p>
</blockquote>

Its chain is *sahih*.[^5]

So , the matter is clear and undisputable.

This *sahih* *athar* proves the following:

1. Dhu al-Qarnayn, *‘alaihi al-salam*, was not a prophet. But, he was a
righteous servant loved by Allah, and he was rightly guided by Him.

2. He was given that name only because he was *fatally* struck twice on
his head.

3. Even though he was not a prophet, Allah nonetheless “sent” him to his
people, like a prophet. This shows that non-prophets can be given *some*
qualities and jobs of prophets.

Imam al-Tabari further presents:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا محمد بن بشار، قال: ثنا يحيى، عن سفيان، عن حبيب بن أبي ثابت، عن
أبي الطفيل، قال: سئل علي رضوان الله عليه عن ذي القرنين، فقال: كان عبدا
ناصح الله فناصحه، فدعا قومه إلى الله، فضربوه على قرنه فمات، فأحياه
الله، فدعا قومه إلى الله، فضربوه على قرنه فمات، فسمي ذا القرنين.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Muhammad b. Bashar – Yahya – Sufyan – Habib b. Abi Thabit – Abu
al-Tufayl:

‘Ali, *ridhwanullah ‘alaihi*, was asked about Dhu al-Qarnayn, and he
replied, “He was a servant who sought the guidance of Allah, and He
guided him. He called his people to Allah. **So, they struck him on
his** ***qarn*****, AND HE DIED. But, Allah RESURRECTED him, and he
(again) called his people to Allah. They (once again) struck him on
his** ***qarn*****, AND HE DIED. Therefore, he was named Dhu
al-Qarnayn**.[^6]

This report too is *sahih*. Al-Hafiz (d. 852 H) states about the first
narrator:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
محمد بن بشار بن عثمان العبدي البصري أبو بكر بندار ثقة
  </p>
</blockquote>

Muhammad b. Bashar b. ‘Uthman al-‘Abdi al-Basri, Abu Bakr Bundar:
***Thiqah*** **(trustworthy)**.[^7]

Concerning the second narrator, he also says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يحيى بن سعيد بن فروخ بفتح الفاء وتشديد الراء المضمومة وسكون الواو ثم
معجمة التميمي أبو سعيد القطان البصري ثقة متقن حافظ إمام قدوة
  </p>
</blockquote>

Yahya b. Sa’id b. Farrukh al-Tamimi, Abu Sa’id al-Qattan al- Basri:
***Thiqah*** **(trustworthy)**, extremely precise, a *hadith* scientist,
**an Imam, a leader**.[^8]

On the third narrator, al-Hafiz submits:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
سفيان بن سعيد بن مسروق الثوري أبو عبد الله الكوفي ثقة حافظ فقيه عابد
إمام حجة
  </p>
</blockquote>

Sufyan b. Sa’id b. Masruq al-Thawri, Abu ‘Abd Allah al-Kufi:
***Thiqah*** **(trustworthy)**, a *hadith* scientist, a jurist, a devout
worshipper of Allah, **an Imam, a** ***hujjah*** **(authority)**.[^9]

The fourth narrator is *thiqah* (trustworthy) too, as al-Hafiz declares:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حبيب بن أبي ثابت قيس ويقال هند بن دينار الأسدي مولاهم أبو يحيى الكوفي
ثقة فقيه جليل وكان كثير الإرسال والتدليس
  </p>
</blockquote>

Habib b. Abi Thabit Qays, and he is called Hind, b. Dinar al-Asadi,
their freed slave, Abu Yahya al-Kufi: ***Thiqah*** **(trustworthy)**, a
jurist, meritorious. He used to do a lot of *irsal* and *tadlis*.[^10]

The only problem here is that Habib was a *mudalis*, and he has narrated
in an *‘an-‘an* manner from Abu al-Tufayl, *radhiyallahu ‘anhu*.
However, this matter is resolved by the *mutaba’ah* of al-Qasim b. Abi
Bazzah, which has already been examined above. Therefore, the report of
Habib is *sahih* through the *mutaba’ah* of al-Qasim.

Meanwhile, Imam Ibn Abi Shaybah (d. 235 H) has also documented a
slightly more detailed *riwayah* through the same narrators:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا يحيى بن سعيد عن سفيان عن حبيب بن أبي ثابت عن أبي ا لطفيل قال:سئل
علي عن ذي القرنين فقال: لم يكن نبيا ولا ملكا، ولكنه كان عابدا ناصح
الله فنصحه فدعا قومه إلى الله فضرب على قرنه الأيمن فمات فأحياه الله،
ثم دعا قومه إلى الله فضرب على قرنه الأيسر فمات فأحياه الله فسمي ذا
القرنين.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Yahya b. Sa’id – Sufyan – Habib b. Abi Thabit – Abu al-Tufayl:

‘Ali was asked about Dhu al-Qarnayn, and he replied, “He was neither a
prophet nor an angel. Rather, he was a servant who sought the guidance
of Allah, and He guided him. He called his people to Allah. **So, he was
struck on his right** ***qarn*****, AND HE DIED. But, Allah RESURRECTED
him, and he (again) called his people to Allah. He was (once again)
struck on his left** ***qarn*****, AND HE DIED. Then, Allah RESURRECTED
him (again). Therefore, he was named Dhu al-Qarnayn**.[^11]

Of course, the *sanad* is *sahih* through its *mutaba’ah*, as we have
already established.

Prof. Ibn Yasin quotes another report for us:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال الضياء المقدسي: أخبرنا أبو المجد زاهر بن أحمد بن حامد بن أحمد
الثقفي -بقراءتي عليه بأصبهان- قلت له: أخبركم أبو عبد الله الحسين بن

  </p>
</blockquote>

Al-Dhiya al-Maqdisi said:

Abu al-Majd Zahir b. Ahmad b. Hamid b. Ahmad al-Thaqafi – Abu ‘Abd Allah
al-Husayn b. ‘Abd al-Malik b. al-Husayn al-Khalal – Imam Abu al-Fadhl
‘Abd al-Rahman b. Ahmad b. al-Husayn b. Bundar al-Razi al-Muqri – Abu
al-Hasan Ahmad b. Ibrahim b. Ahmad b. ‘Ali b. Faras – Abu Ja’far
Muhammad b. Ibrahim al-Duyali – Abu ‘Ubayd Allah Sa’id b. ‘Abd al-Rahman
al-Makhzumi – Sufyan b. ‘Uyaynah – Ibn Abi Husayn – Abu al-Tufayl:

I heard Ibn al-Kawa asking ‘Ali b. Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with
him, about Dhu al-Qarnayn, and ‘Ali replied, “He was not a prophet, and
he was not an angel. He was rather a righteous servant. He loved Allah;
so, He loved him too. He sought the guidance of Allah; and so, He guided
him. He was sent to his people. **But, they struck him on his**
***qarn*** **AND HE DIED. Then, Allah RESURRECTED him, and he was
thereby named Dhu al-Qarnayn**.[^12]

Giving the source, our professor states:

> (المختارة 2/175 ح 555) وصححه الحافظ ابن حجر بعد عزوه للمختارة للحافظ
> الضياء (الفتح 6/383).

(*Al-Mukhtarat* 2/175, \# 555) **and al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar declared it**
***sahih*** after attributing it to *al-Mukhtarat* of al-Hafiz al-Dhiya
(*al-Fath* 6/383)[^13]

These are the exact words of al-Hafiz in his *Fath*:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أخرجه سفيان بن عيينة في جامعه عن ابن أبي حسين عن أبي الطفيل نحوه وزاد
وناصح الله فناصحه وفيه لم يكن نبيا ولا ملكا وسنده صحيح سمعناه في
الأحاديث المختارة للحافظ الضياء
  </p>
</blockquote>

Sufyan b. ‘Uyaynah recorded it in his *Jami’* from Ibn Abi Husayn from
Abu al-Tufayl, and he added: “He sought the guidance of Allah; and so,
He guided him” and in it is “He was not a prophet, and he was not an
angel”. **Its chain is** ***sahih***. We heard it in *al-Ahadith
al-Mukhtarat* of al-Hafiz al-Dhiya.[^14]

Obviously, al-Hafiz only declares the much shorter chain of Sufyan in
his *Jami’* as *sahih*. However, he confirms that what we find in
*al-Ahadith al-Mukhtarat* of al-Dhiya is the same as that which was
recorded by Sufyan in his book. Meanwhile, al-Hafiz’s *tashih* actually
comes *before* his mention of al-Dhiya’s book, contrary to the erroneous
submission of our professor. In any case, this *sahih* report is,
apparently, an additional strengthening *mutaba’ah* for the *riwayah* of
Habib b. Abi Thabit.

Imam Ibn Abi Asim (d. 287 H) here presents the seal of these *athar*:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا أبو بكر بن أبي شيبة نا وكيع عن بسام عن أبي الطفيل عن علي رضي
الله عنه قال كان ذو القرنين عبدا صالحا نصح الله عز و جل فنصحه فضرب على
قرنه الأيمن فمات فأحياه الله عز و جل ثم ضرب على قرنه الأيسر فمات
فأحياه الله عز و جل وفيكم مثله
  </p>
</blockquote>

Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaybah – Waki’ – Bassam – Abu al-Tufayl – ‘Ali, may
Allah be pleased with him:

Dhu al-Qarnayn was a righteous man. He sought the guidance of Allah the
Almighty, and He guided him. So, he was struck on his right *qarn*, AND
HE DIED. But, Allah the Almighty RESURRECTED him. Then, he was struck on
his left *qarn*, AND HE DIED, and Allah the Almighty RESURRECTED him
(again). **And among you is an example of him**.[^15]

Concerning the first narrator, al-Hafiz says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عبد الله بن محمد بن أبي شيبة إبراهيم بن عثمان الواسطي الأصل أبو بكر بن
أبي شيبة الكوفي ثقة حافظ صاحب تصانيف
  </p>
</blockquote>

Abd Allah b. Muhammad b. Abi Shaybah Ibrahim b. ‘Uthman, of Wasiti
origin, Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaybah al-Kufi: ***Thiqah*** **(trustworthy)**,
a *hadith* scientist, author of books.[^16]

On the second narrator, he states as well:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وكيع بن الجراح بن مليح الرؤاسي بضم الراء وهمزة ثم مهملة، أبو سفيان
الكوفي ثقة حافظ عابد
  </p>
</blockquote>

Waki’ b. al-Jarah b. Malih al-Ruwasi, Abu Sufyan al-Kufi: ***Thiqah***
**(trustworthy)**, a *hadith* scientist, a devout worshipper of
Allah.[^17]

And, about the last narrator, al-Hafiz submits:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بسام بن عبد الله الصيرفي الكوفي أبو الحسن صدوق
  </p>
</blockquote>

Bassam b. ‘Abd Allah al-Sayrafi al-Kufi, Abu al-Hasan: ***Saduq***
**(very truthful)**.[^18]

So, the *isnad* is *hasan*, due to Bassam, and the *hadith* itself is
*sahih* on account of its *mutaba’at* and *shawahid*.

In the above *athar*, we read two interesting phrases:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وفيكم اليوم مثله.
  </p>
</blockquote>

And among you today is an example of him.

And:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وفيكم مثله
  </p>
</blockquote>

And among you is an example of him.

In simpler words, there was someone alive at that very moment who was an
example of Dhu al-Qarnayn. That person too:

1. was not a prophet, but a righteous, sincere servant loved by Allah;.

2. sought the guidance of Allah and was guided by Him;

3. though not a prophet, was “sent” by Allah to his people; and

4. would be hit on the head and thereby killed, but would be resurrected
by Allah and then hit on the head again and murdered a second time.

Who was it? The answer is apparent, of course. If Allah were to send any
non-prophet to the *Ummah* at that point in time, it would have been
none other than Amir al-Muminin ‘Ali b. Abi Talib, *‘alaihi al-salam*.
He was the best creature alive – in all good qualities, especially in
terms of piety, knowledge and guidance - at that moment. Therefore, ‘Ali
could not have been referring to anyone except to himself in those
statements, anyway. Besides, he was martyred by Ibn Muljam, *la’natullah
‘alaihi*, who struck him on the head, like Dhu al-Qarnayn was. So, that
too is a clear indication.

Imam Ibn Salam (d. 224 H), a grand ancient Sunni *hadith* linguist, has
the same conclusion as well:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وإنما اخترت هذا التفسير على الأول لحديث عن علي نفسه هو عندي مفسر له
ولنا وذلك أنه ذكر ذا القرنين فقال: دعا قومه إلى عبادة الله فضربوه على
قرنيه ضربتين وفيكم مثله. فنرى أنه أراد بقوله هذا نفسه - يعني أني أدعو
إلى الحق حتى أضرب على رأسي ضربتين يكون فيهما قتلي.
  </p>
</blockquote>

I have only chosen this explanation instead of the first due to a
*hadith* from ‘Ali himself. It (the *hadith*), in my view, explains it
to us. And that is, he (‘Ali) mentioned Dhu al-Qarnayn and said, “He
called his people to the worship of Allah, and they struck him on his
*qarn* *twice*. **And among you is an example of him**”. **So, we see
that he (‘Ali) was referring to himself with this statement of his** –
he meant: I will call to the Truth until I will be struck on my head
twice. My death will be in them.”[^19]

Imam Ibn al-Athir (d. 606 H), a leading classical Sunni *hadith*
linguist, also submits:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ومنه حديث علي وذكر قصة ذي القرنين ثم قال وفيكم مثله فيرى أنه إنما عنى
نفسه لأنه ضرب على رأسه ضربتين إحداهما يوم الخندق والأخرى ضربة ابن ملجم
  </p>
</blockquote>

And from it is the *hadith* of ‘Ali. He mentioned the story of Dhu
al-Qarnayn, and then said: “And among you is an example of him.” **So,
it is seen that he was only referring to himself because he was struck
on his head twice**: one of them on the Day of al-Khandaq and the other
was the strike of Ibn Muljam.[^20]

This explanation of Ibn al-Athir is slightly misleading. Dhu al-Qarnayn
was given two *fatal* blows, which resulted in his deaths twice. Since
‘Ali was an example of him, then he too would be *fatally* struck twice.
The blow on the Day of al-Khandaq was NOT *fatal*. So, it is
automatically ruled out. Amir al-Muminin was, of course, martyred by Ibn
Muljam, who struck him on his head. But, he has not been resurrected by
Allah yet – as He did with Dhu al-Qarnayn. Therefore, the incident will
definitely happen in the future. ‘Ali will come back, and will be
fatally hit again on his death. He will die a second time, on the
surface of this earth. Dhu al-Qarnayn was revived once more after the
second death, and our *mawla*, ‘Ali b. Abi Talib, will still “return”
after his own second death as well.

Imam al-Nasafi (d. 710 H) has this comment about the words of ‘Ali too:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وعن عليّ رضي الله عنه أنه قال : ليس بملك ولا نبي ولكن كان عبداً صالحاً
ضرب على قرنه الأيمن في طاعة الله فمات ثم بعثه الله فضرب على قرنه
الأيسر فمات فبعثه الله فسمي ذا القرنين وفيكم مثله أراد نفسه
  </p>
</blockquote>

It is narrated that ‘Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said (about Dhu
al-Qarnayn): “He was neither an angel nor a prophet. But, he was a
righteous servant. He was struck on his right *qarn* due to his
obedience of Allah. So, he died. Then, Allah resurrected him. But, he
was (again) strucked on his left *qarn* and he died. Then, Allah
resurrected him (once more). As a result, he was named Dhu al-Qarnayn.
And there is an example of him among you.” **He meant himself**.[^21]

Meanwhile, there is a *shahid* from the Messenger of Allah, *sallallahu
‘alaihi wa alihi*, for the words of Amir al-Muminin in the *athar*. Imam
Ahmad (d. 241 H) records:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا عبد الله حدثني أبى ثنا عفان ثنا حماد بن سلمة ثنا محمد بن إسحاق
عن محمد بن إبراهيم التيمي عن سلمة بن أبي الطفيل عن علي بن أبي طالب رضي

Verily, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “**O ‘Ali!** Surely, you

al-Qarnayn**.”[^22]

The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said to me: “**O ‘Ali!**
Verily, you are the owner of a treasure in Paradise, **and you are its
Dhu al-Qarnayn**.”[^25]

Al-Hakim declares:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
هذا حديث صحيح الإسناد
  </p>
</blockquote>

This *hadith* has a *sahih* chain.[^26]

And Imam al-Dhahabi (d. 748 H) agrees with him:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
صحيح
  </p>
</blockquote>

*Sahih*[^27]

So, what does this *hadith* mean, especially the last part? The
determining factor is the (ها) [“its”] in (قرنيها) [“its Dhu
al-Qarnayn”]. To what does it refer. On the apparent, it refers to
(الجنة) [“Paradise”] mentioned earlier in the *hadith*, especially since
it also has a feminine grammar. If it is a reference to Paradise, then
Amir al-Muminin will be its Dhu al-Qarnayn, and that is, its emperor.
This is because the comparison then would be about kingdom, as opposed
to personal merits or qualities. Dhu al-Qarnayn was the emperor of the
earth during his lifetime, as the Qur’an testifies:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ويسألونك عن ذي القرنين قل سأتلو عليكم منه ذكرا إنا مكنا له في الأرض
وآتيناه من كل شيء سببا
  </p>
</blockquote>

And they ask you about Dhu al-Qarnayn. Say: “I shall recite to you
something of his story: ‘**Verily, We established him over the earth,
and We gave him the means** **of everything**.’”[^28]

Therefore, if Imam ‘Ali is the Dhu al-Qarnayn of Paradise, then he will
be its emperor. Allah will establish him over Paradise, and will give
him the means of everything there. This, indeed, is an extremely great
virtue of Amir al-Muminin. He will be the emperor over all the *awliya*,
prophets, messengers and Imams except his own master, Muhammad b. ‘Abd
Allah – who naturally will be the Grand Emperor. Some scholars of the
Ahl al-Sunnah agree on this too. However, the stronger opinion among
them is that Imam ‘Ali is the Dhu al-Qarnayn of this *Ummah* only,
according to the *hadith*. Imam Ibn Salam for instance states about the
*riwayah*:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قد كان بعض أهل العلم يتأول هذا الحديث أنه ذو قرني الجنة - يريد طرفيها،
وإنما يأول ذلك لذكره الجنة في أول الحديث، وأما أنا فلا أحسبه أراد
ذلك - والله أعلم، ولكنه أراد إنك ذو قرني هذه الأمة، فأضمر الأمة
  </p>
</blockquote>

One of the people of knowledge interpreted this *hadith* to mean that he
(‘Ali) will be the Dhu al-Qarnayn of Paradise – intending its entire
territories, and he made this interpretation only because of the mention
of Paradise at the beginning of the *hadith*. As for me, I do not think
that he (the Prophet) intended that, and Allah knows best. Rather, he
(the Prophet) intended that “You are the Dhu al-Qarnayn of this
*Ummah*”, and thereby pronounised the *Ummah*.[^29]

Since the lifetime of the *Ummah* has exceeded that of ‘Ali and his rule
for more a millennium, obviously this alternative interpretation cannot
be about political authority. He is the only Dhu al-Qarnayn of this
*Ummah*, but not its only ruler. As such, the comparison between ‘Ali
and Dhu al-Qarnayn – as far as our *Ummah* is concerned - is apparently
about their shared personal merits and qualities, and not about their
political histories. Imam al-Mundhiri (d. 656 H) gives some further
explanation:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قول صلى الله عليه و سلم لعلي وإنك ذو قرنيها أي ذو قرني هذه الأمة وذاك
لأنه كان له شجتان في قرني رأسه إحداهما من ابن ملجم لعنه الله والأخرى
من عمرو بن ود
  </p>
</blockquote>

His statement, peace be upon him, to ‘Ali “and you are its Dhu
al-Qarnayn”, that is, the Dhu al-Qarnayn of this *Ummah*. **And this is
because he had two head wounds on the two** ***qarns*** **of his head**:
the first of them from Ibn Muljam, may Allah curse him, and the other
from ‘Amr b. Wudd.[^30]

‘Ali Shiri, the annotator of *Tarikh Madinah Dimashq*, quotes a similar
exegesis for the *hadith*:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

الطاهرة لأنه ضرب على رأسه ضربتين: إحداهما يوم الخندق والثانية ضربة ابن
ملجم.

It is in *al-Faiq* of al-Zamakhshari 3/173 under the entry “Qarn”:

(He, peace be upon him, said to ‘Ali, may Allah be pleased with him:
“Verily, that is a house in Paradise, and you are its Dhu al-Qarnayn”.
**The pronoun (i.e. “its”) refers to the** ***Ummah*** and its
explanation is in what it narrated from ‘Ali, may Allaah be pleased with
him, that he mentioned Dhu al-Qarnayn and said, “He called his people to
the worship of Allah, and they struck him on his *qarn* twice, **and
among you is an example of him”, he meant his pure self, because he was
struck on his head twice**: one of them on the Day of Khandaq and the
second, the strike of Ibn Muljam.[^31]

This escapist diversion, however, does not help either. Dhu al-Qarnayn
was so named because he received two *fatal* blows to his head. Amir
al-Muminin is his example in this *Ummah*, and our own Dhu al-Qarnayn.
Therefore, the non-fatal strikes on ‘Ali’s head do not count in the
comparison. He too *must* receive two *fatal* blows to his head. We know
as a fact that he already was fatally struck by Ibn Muljam. We now await
his *raj’ah*, and a second fatal blow to his head. After his second
death, he is expected to resurrect again, and then die, perhaps
naturally.

So, Amir al-Muminin is not coming back to this earth only once in the
future, but actually twice; and he will die three times before the end
of the world – *like Dhu al-Qarnayn*. This was ‘Ali’s own belief about
himself.

[^1]: A Sunni brother raises an objection to our translation of yab’ath
as “resurrect”. He says that it only means “send” in this context, and
not “resurrect”. Meanwhile, Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan, the Sunni
translator of Sahih al-Bukhari, has also rendered the word as
“resurrect” (see Sahih al-Bukhari, English Translation, Volume 5, Book
57, Number 19). The alternative translation – “send” – which is offered
by our Sunni brother makes no sense. For instance, ‘Umar’s words would
look like this: “Verily! Allah will SEND him and he will cut the hands
and legs of some men.” But, Allah has already sent His Prophet decades
before that period! Or, did ‘Umar not believe, up till that moment, that
Muhammad was a messenger sent by Allah? What may be said here is that
‘Umar was double-speaking, perhaps due to the “shock” which he allegedly
suffered as a result of the “sudden” death of the Prophet, sallallahu
‘alaihi wa alihi, or for some other reasons that were well-known to his
Lord. He was denying and also affirming the Messenger’s death at the
same time! If he did not die, how would he resurrect? Was all this only
a tactical drama by ‘Umar to stall time, in order to allow a certain
plan to materialize? We believe so. Interestingly, while ‘Umar later
suddenly “believed” the death of the Prophet of Allah once Abu Bakr
arrived and spoke, we have been unable to locate any authentic Sunni
evidence showing that he ever recanted his other claim about the future
raj’ah of Muhammad.

makes some very ridiculous claims about this riwayah. He is unable to
reject its authenticity. So, he alleges that it is “very possible” that
Amir al-Muminin learnt this hadith from the Israelites! Alas, Imam ‘Ali
was, without any doubt, NOT among those Sahabah who used to go to the
Israelites to learn their religion! Mawquf reports bordering on al-ghayb
– like this one – from Sahabah like ‘Ali are graded marfu’ (i.e. from
the Prophet). Even a beginner in Sunni ‘ilm al-hadith knows this! Our
Sunni friend also claims that the Prophet was once asked about Dhu
al-Qarnayn, and he did not know whether Dhu al-Qarnayn was a prophet or
not. But, the explanation of thing is very simple. The Messenger of
Allah made that statement before Allah informed him of the status of Dhu
al-Qarnayn. However, when He eventually told him, he too narrated it to
his Sahabah. That is the logical explanation in view of the ahadith of
Amir al-Muminin.
