Suffering and not Evil
======================

Now, let us go a bit deeper in the problem. What we should say at this
point is that we commit a mistake by using the term "evil.'. We should
rather use: \`suffering or hardship.' By doing this we have not done
anything against reality or any logical necessity. In the term \`evil'
there is a concept of injustice hidden. We shall avoid using it, because
it is a loaded word.
