96: the Clot (alaq)
===================

These 19 Meccan verses form what is traditionally considered to be one
of the very earliest portions of the Qur'an that was revealed to
Muhammad. They are thrilling words through which God spoke directly to
mankind. It is calculated that this incident occurred about the year 610
of the Christian era or over a decade

before the Hijra or eventual Transfer to Madina.

This chapter was revealed before The Pen 68 with which it is connected
in mood and message, and after The Man Wearing a Cloak 74 (which SEE).

These chapters recognize the fact that the art of reading or literacy
forms the basis for civilized life and culture. The Muslims' respect for
it helped to build up the Islamic commonwealth later on which held off
the West European middle ages from much of Africa and Asia.

The latter half of this chapter shows a subtle though quite apparent
change in mood which is directed against the Meccans' opposition to the
Prophet's public prayers.
