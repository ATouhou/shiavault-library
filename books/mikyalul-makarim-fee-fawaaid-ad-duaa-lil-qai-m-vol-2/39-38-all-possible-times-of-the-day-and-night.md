38. All Possible Times Of The Day And Night
===========================================

The evidence of this statement lies in the tradition related by Faiz bin
al- Mukhtar from Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (as) when he (as) was asked
concerning the Ziarat of Imam Husain (as), ‘Is there any particular time
for this visitation, which we can call as the best time?’ Imam (as)
replied, “Visit him at all times and whenever possible. Indeed, his
visitation is the best thing. Whoever visits him more, has indeed
performed abundant goodness and whoever does less, he will get lesser
reward. Make yourself free for his Ziarat. For, the good deeds are
multiplied during this act and this is the time when the angels descend
for his visitation.”

I say: It is supported by the statement of His Eminence (aj) that: “Good
deeds are rewarded many times on this day.” And since there is no doubt
that Dua is the best of the worship acts, especially the Dua mentioned
above, that is Dua for hastening the reappearance and victory of the
oppressed hidden Imam (as) – and what we have mentioned is as brilliant
as light upon Mt. Tur.
