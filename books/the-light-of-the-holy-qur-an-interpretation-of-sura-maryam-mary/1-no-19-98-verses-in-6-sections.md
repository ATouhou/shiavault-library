No. 19 (98 Verses in 6 Sections)
================================

**(Revealed in Mecca)**

In the Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful

**Introduction to the Sura:**

Sura Maryam, as arranged in the Book, is the nineteenth Sura of the
holy Quran. It contains 98 verses which have been revealed in Mecca.

Similar to other Meccan Suras, the content of this Sura is mostly about
matters concerning the Hereafter, the end of the evil-doers, the rewards
of the good-doers, and part of the account of the lives of Zakariyya
(Zechariah), Mary, Jesus, Yahya (John), Abraham, Ishmael and Idris
(Enoch).

It is recorded in Tafsir-i-Al-Mizan that, in the last few verses of
Sura Maryam, Allah says that the purpose of revealing this Sura is to
give 'glad tidings and warnings', and this aim has been followed in the
beautiful form of the story of the prophets' lives.

Allah has mentioned no woman in the Qur'an directly by her proper name
except Mary, and the name 'Mary' occurs 34 times in the Qur'an. The only
Sura, which has been entitled by the name of a woman in the Qur'an, is
this very Sura, Sura Mary.

For the virtue of studying this Sura, it has been cited that whoever
continues reciting this Sura (whenever he can), he will not die save
that Allah will suffice him in life, wealth and children.
(Majma'-ul-Bayan)

There is no doubt, of course, that the one will make himself free from
want from others by means of practicing the contents of this Sura.

2. (This is) a mention of the mercy of your Lord unto His servant
Zechariah."

3. " When he called upon his Lord in secret."


**Commentary:**

The mentioned letters are among the 'Abbreviated Letters' of the Qur'an
in which some mysteries and secrets are hidden. Some Islamic traditions
indicate that each of these letters is a sign of one of the great names
of Allah (The Names Most Beautiful). Kaf 'K' refers to /kafi/ (The
Sufficient); Ha 'H' refers to /hadi/ (The Guide); Ya 'Y' refers to
/waliyy/ (The Friend, The Protector, The Surety, The Patron); 'Ain 'A'
refers to /'alim/ (The Knower); and Sad 'S' refers to /Sadiq-ul-wa'd/
(The One Who is Truthful in His promises). Sometimes, in some
supplications, Allah (s.w.t.) is invoked through these abbreviated
letters, in this manner: "O Lord! by Ka, Ha, Ya, 'Ain, Sad." In a
supplication, for instance, Hadrat Ali-ibn-Abitalib (a.s.) said: "O
Allah! We ask you, O'Kaf, Ha, Ya, 'Ain, Sad!" (1)

Some Islamic traditions state that these abbreviated letters indicate
the event of the uprising of Imam Hussayn in Karbala, as follows: Kaf
refers to 'Karbal?', Ha refers to 'Halak' (the slaughter of the
Prophet's progeny), Ya refers to 'Yazid', 'Ain refers to the subject of
'Atash (thirst), and Sad refers to 'S?abr' (the patience and
steadfastness of Imam Hussayn and his self-sacrificing supporters).

It should be noted, of course, that the verses of the Qur'an have the
capacity to have different meanings but despite the variety of meanings,
they do not conflict with each other.

After the abbreviated letters at the beginning of Sura Maryam, the
first verse concerning the story of Zechariah begins. It says:

(This is) a mention of the mercy of your Lord unto His servant
Zechariah."

This event occurred at the time when Zachariah was very worried and sad
because he did not have a child, and he,

1- Majma'-ul-Bayan, the Commentary

worshipping Him, called upon his Lord secretly. The verse says:

" When he called upon his Lord in secret."

The Arabic term /nida/ means 'to call with a loud voice', and the
Qur'anic word /xafiyya/ means 'in secret' not in a low voice, since such
a call cannot be performed 'silently', but it can be done secretly.

Perhaps, the invocation of Zechariah, done in secret, was for the
reason that his people would not scoff at him by saying why that old man
wished Allah for a son.

Some Islamic literature indicates that the best supplication is that
which is asked in secret, and the best provision is that which is
sufficient. (Tafsir-i-Majma'-ul-Bayan)


**Commentary : Verse 4.5**

4- قَالَ رَبِّ إِنّـِى وَهَنَ الْعَظْمُ مِنّـِى وَاشْتَعَلَ الرَّأْسُ
شَيْباً وَلَمْ أَكُن بِدُعَآئِكَ رَبِّ شَقِيّاً

5- وَإِنّـِى خِفْتُ الْمَوَالِيَ مِن وَرَآءِى وَكَانَتِ امْرَأَتِى
عَاقِراً فَهَبْ لِى مِن لَّدُنكَ وَلِيّاً

4. " He said: 'My Lord! verily my bones are weakened and my head is all
aflame with hoariness, and, my Lord! I have never been unblessed in
prayer to You."

5. " And verily I fear my kindred after I am gone, and my wife is
barren. So grant me from your presence a successor (a child)."

**Commentary:**

Zechariah invoked Allah saying that his bones, the pillars of his body
and its most solid parts, were weakened and his head was all aflame with
hoariness. By this statement, Zechariah might have wanted to say that
the harbinger of death had been placed on his head and he had to get
ready for death. Here is the verse:

" He said: 'My Lord! verily my bones are weakened and my head is all
aflame with hoariness, …"

Then, immediately after that statement, he adds that he had been
accustomed to the acceptance of his supplications by his Lord and that
He had never withheld His blessings from him. Now that he was old and
feeble, he was more in need of answers to his prayers, and that he would
not be unblessed. The verse continues saying:

" …and, my Lord! I have never been unblessed in prayer to You."

After that, he explained his supplication to Allah, as follows:

" And verily I fear my kindred after I am gone, and my wife is barren.
So grant me from your presence a successor (a child)."

**Explanations:**

The Arabic word /'aqir/ is applied for a man or a woman that cannot
produce offspring.

The term /'is(ti'al/ means: 'the blaze of a fire when it flames and
spreads'. Thus, the holy phrase 'and my head is all aflame with
hoariness' means that the whiteness of the hair on my head blazed like
fire and has spread.

Some of the commentators have said that the objective meaning of the
Qur'anic word /waliyy/, mentioned in this holy verse, is 'a righteous
son who succeeds the father'. Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said that Zechariah's
anxiety was about his uncle and his cousins.(1)

**Commentary : Verse 6.7.8**


6- يَرِثُنِى وَيَرِثُ مِنْ ءَالِ يَعْقُوبَ وَاجْعَلْهُ رَبِّ رَضِيّاً

7- يَا زَكَرِيَّآ إِنَّا نُبَشّـِرُكَ بِغُلاَمٍ اسْمُهُ يَحْيَى لَمْ
نَجْعَل لَّهُ مِن قَبْلُ سَمِيّاً

8- قَالَ رَبِّ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لِى غُلاَمٌ وَكَانَتِ امْرَأَتِى عَاقِراً
وَقَدْ بَلَغْتُ مِنَ الْكِبَرِ عِتِيّاً

6. " (One that) shall be my inheritor and the inheritor of the
posterity of Jacob; and make him, my Lord, well-pleasing."

7. (His prayer was answered:) O' Zakariyya! verily We give you good
tidings of a son whose name is Yahya (John). We have given the same name
to none before (him)."

8. " He said: 'My Lord! How shall there be for me a son while my wife
is barren and I have reached infirm old age?' "

**Commentary:**

Zechariah, the prophet, in his prayer, invoked Allah to grant him a
successor to be the inheritor of him and the posterity of Jacob, and He
would make him well-pleasing. The verse says:

" (One that) shall be my inheritor and the inheritor of the posterity
of Jacob; and make him, my Lord, well-pleasing."

The purpose of the phrase 'to inherit', here, has been rendered
differently by the Islamic commentators. Some of them believe that
'heritage' in this verse is heritage in properties, while some others
have said that it refers to the rank of prophethood.

A group of the commentators have also thought that the objective
meaning of it is an inclusive concept which probably envelops both of
them.

Many of the Shi'ite scholars have taken the first interpretation, while
some Sunnite scholars have seized the second meaning, and some others,
among Islamic scholars, such as: Sayyid-i-Qutb in Fi-Zilal and 'A-lusi
in Rouh-ul-Ma'ani, have chosen the third idea.

Those who have taken it, confined to the inheritance of property, have
reasoned to the existence of the word /yari?u/ (inheritor) in this
sense. For, when this word is used apart from other evidences, it means
'the inheritance of the wealth'. But when it is used in the sense of
spiritual affairs, it is usually for the sake of the existence of some
evidence in that verse; like Sura Fatir, No 95, verse 32 which says:
"Then We gave the Book for an inheritance to those whom We chose from
among Our servants, …"

Moreover, the wife of Zechariah, who was from the progeny of
Solayman-ibn-Dawood, regarding the very good condition of Solayman and
Dawood's wealth, had inherited some considerable properties.

Zechariah was afraid that those properties would be obtained by some
impious persons who might amass them, or use them in a false way, which
itself could be the source of a corruption in the society.

That was why he asked his Lord to grant him a righteous child so that
this offspring might protect those properties and spend them in the best
way.

It is narrated in a tradition that Fatimat-uz-Zahra (a.s.), the pure
daughter of the Prophet of Islam (p.b.u.h.) , reasoned to defend her
claim to Fadak. This incident is another evidence upon the above idea.

The Late Tabarsi, in his book 'Ihtijaj, has said regarding this issue
concerning the Lady of Islam (a.s.), as follows:

When some people had decided to withhold Fadak from Fatimah (a.s.), and
she was informed of it, she said: "Is there in the Book of Allah that
you inherit from your father and I do not inherit from my father? Verily
you have done a very indecent thing.(1) Did you deliberately leave out
from the Book of Allah where, in the story of Yahya-ibn-Zakariyya, it
says: 'O Lord! Grant me from Your presence a successor (a child); (One
that) shall be my inheritor and the inheritor of the posterity of
Jacob?' "

For more information on the idea of 'inheritance' as something
spiritual, or both spiritual and material you may refer to
Tafsir-i-Atyab-ul-Bayan, as well as other great commentaries of Islamic
scholars.

However, the Arabic word /radiyy/ means both: 'being well-pleased with
Allah' and 'being loved by people'. The rank of Allah being well-pleased
with a person, and vice versa, is the best rank, a great salvation.

The subsequent verse states that the prayer of Zechariah was accepted
in the presence of Allah, an acceptance with full grace and particular
favour. The words of Allah in the verse are recited as follows:

"(His prayer was answered:) O' Zakariyya! Verily We give you good
tidings of a son whose name is Yahya (John). We have given the same name
to none before (him)."

1- Sura Maryam, No. 19, verse 27

The Qur'anic phrase 'the same name to none before (him)' means either
that the name 'Yahya' had not been used before him, or that such
personal qualities were not found in any one before him.

Zechariah, who did not see the relevant preconditions to assist in
gaining what he desired, asked Allah to explain the circumstance for
him. The verse says:

" He said: 'My Lord! How shall there be for me a son while my wife is
barren and I have reached infirm old age?' "

Zechariah, saying: "How shall there be for me a son…?" means whether he
and his wife would become young again, or they would have a child in the
same state of old age. (Tafsir-i-Kabir by Fakhr-i-Razi)

Yes, even the prophets' knowledge is limited, and their surprise about
something does not contrast with the rank of their prophethood.

However, the Qur'anic word /'itiyya/ means 'to go beyond the limit'
which is usually said upon a person whose body has lost its elasticity
as a result of old age.

Imam Baqir (a.s.) said that five years elapsed between the time when
the glad tidings was given and when the birth of Yahya occurred.
(Majma'-ul-Bayan, and Bihar-ul-'Anwar, vol. 14, p. 176)


**Commentary : Verse 9.10**


9- قَالَ كَذَلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَيَّ هَيّـِنٌ وَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ
مِن قَبْلُ وَلَمْ تَكُ شَيْئاً

10- قَالَ رَبِّ اجْعَل لّـِى ءَايَةً قَالَ ءَايَتُكَ أَلاَّ تُكَلّـِمَ
النَّاسَ ثَلاَثَ لَيَالٍ سَوِيّاً

9. " He said: 'So (it will be)'. Your Lord says: 'It is easy for Me,
for indeed I created you aforetime when you were nothing'."

10. " He (Zechariah) said: 'My Lord! appoint for me a sign.' Said He:
'Your sign is that you shall not be able to speak to the people for
three nights, though sound (in health)."

**Commentary:**

Allah (s.w.t.) is able to do every thing and every work is easy for
Him, as in this verse, He says: "It is easy for Me". In Sura Al-Hadid,
No. 57, verse 22 and in Sura At-Taْqabun, No. 64, verse 7, the words are
recited: " …that is easy to Allah"; and in Sura Al-Baqarah, No.2, verses
20 and 106, it is recited: "…Allah is All-powerful over everything"; and
in Sura Al-Kahf, No. 18, verse 45 the Qur'an says: "…Allah is omnipotent
over everything". Therefore, Zechariah asked Allah how that matter could
happen, and He said: "So (it will be)" and Allah (s.w.t.) can strengthen
his power in old age to give him offspring.

In other words, Allah is the One Who is able to create all things from
aught, and then it is not surprising that He bestows a child upon
Zachariah in his old age and in those conditions. The verse says:

" He said: 'So (it will be)'. Your Lord says: 'It is easy for Me, for
indeed I created you aforetime when you were nothing'."

By hearing the abovementioned hope-inspiring statement, Zechariah
became very happy and encouraged and the light of hopefulness
illuminated his entire being, however, since that message was very
magnificent and constructive for him, he asked Allah for a sign, as
follows:

" He (Zechariah) said: 'My Lord! appoint for me a sign.' …"

No doubt Zechariah believed in Allah's promise, but, in order to be
more assured, he asked Him for such a sign. This was similar to
Abraham's, way who was certain of the Resurrection, yet he asked to see
an aspect of the resurrection in this world in order that his heart
would become more certain. Then Zechariah (a.s.) received this answer:


" …Said He: 'Your sign is that you shall not be able to speak to the
people for three nights, though sound (in health)."

During those three days and nights Zachariah's tongue (a.s.) could move
only for prayers to Allah (s.w.t.) as well as in supplicating unto
Him.

This was a clear sign, of course, in that a person would not able to
speak with people while his tongue and his body were utterly sound and
he could pray and worship to Allah fluently.

In the books of commentaries of Majma'-ul-Bayan, of At-Tabari, and
Al-Mizan, it has been said that, at the time of recitation of the Divine
communications and the remembrance of Allah (s.w.t.), Zachariah's tongue
could utter words fluently and correctly, but when he wanted to use his
tongue to speak with people, his tongue remained silent. Of course,
Zechariah (a.s.) asked Allah (s.w.t.) for a sign to recognize between
right and wrong, and between the divine revelations and satanic
delusions. (Tafsir-i-Al-Mizan)

This itself is an evidence to the fact that all our actions are under
the Will and device of Allah, so that if He let not we are not able to
speak even when we are in a complete health.

**Commentary : Verse 11**


11- فَخَرَجَ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ مِنَ الْمِـحْرَابِ فَاَوْحَى إِلَيْهِمْ أَن
سَبّـِحُوا بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيّاً

11. " Then he went out (of the sanctuary) unto his people and made
signs unto them that they should glorify (Allah) morning and evening."

**Commentary:**

The Qur'anic word /bukrah/ is used for the length of time between the
dawn until the sunrise.

The term /mihrab/ (sanctuary) is called such since it is a
fighting-place against Satan and the temptations which hinder man's
concentration of thought. Perhaps, the sanctuaries of the Children of
Israel had been the same places of prayer which people had chosen for
their Divine service and they worshipped therein.

According to what Tabarsi and Fakhr-i-Razi have said, the purpose of
/tasbih/ (to glorify), used in this verse, is 'prayer', because 'prayer'
contains 'glorification'. After this glad tidings and that clear Sign,
Zechariah came out of his prayer niche and went unto his people. Then he
signed to them that they should glorify Allah every morning and evening.
For, the result of the great bounty, which Allah had bestowed Zechariah,
would encompass all those people and could be effective in their fate
totally. The verse says:

" Then he went out (of the sanctuary) unto his people and made signs
unto them that they should glorify (Allah) morning and evening."

Moreover, this bounty, which was counted a miracle, could firm the
foundations of belief in their hearts.


**Some Traditions:**

1. The Messenger of Allah (p.b.u.h.) said: "The most beloved sayings
with Allah, the Glorious, is that the servant says: 'Glory be to my Lord
and praise be to Him'." (Kanz-ul-'Ummal, vol. 1, p. 466)

2. Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said: "Whoever glorifies Allah thirty times every
day, Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, may remove seventy afflictions
from him, the least of which is poverty." (Amali by Sadugh, p. 55)

3. Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said: "The hymns of Fatimatuz-Zahra, after every
prayer, is more beloved with me than one thousand units (rak'ah) of
prayer in a day." (Muhajjat-ul-Bayd?', vol. 2, p. 348)


**Commentary : Verse 12.13**

12- يَا يَحْيَى خُذِ الْكِتَابَ بِقُوَّةٍ وءَاتَيْنَاهُ الْحُكْمَ
صَبِيّاً

13- وَحَنَاناً مِن لَّدُنَّا وَزَكَاةً وَكَانَ تَقِيّاً

12." 'O' Yahya! Take hold of the Book with might.'And We gave him
wisdom (apostleship) while yet a child."

13." And (also) compassion from Us and piety; and he was
God-fearing."

**Commentary:**

The Qur'anic term /hukm/ means: 'knowledge and understanding.'(1) It
has also been applied in the sense of 'ability and judgment'(2), while
it is cited in Tafsir-i-Al-Mizan that the objective meaning of /hukm/,
in this verse, is: 'knowledge unto the Divine sciences and the removal
of the curtain of Unseen'.

Three persons became prophets in childhood. They were Solomon, Jesus,
and John (a.s.). There were also three persons who became Imam in their
childhood: Imam Jawad (the ninth Imam), Imam Hadi (the tenth Imam) and
Imam Mahdi (the twelfth Imam), peace be upon them all, because the rank
of prophethood and Imamate is granted by Allah. Moreover, Divine
prophets and the Immaculate Imams were bestowed upon all virtues and
sciences in the same World of Light. Therefore they could speak and
solve the problems even when they were in the wombs of their mothers, in
their cradles, and at the moment of their birth. There are recorded many
Islamic

1- Lisan-ul-'Arab

2- Qamus-ul-Qur'an

traditions in this regard in which it is also said that even
S?iddighah-Tahirah, who was neither a prophet nor an Imam, had this
quality, too.(1) However, former verses denoted that Allah bestowed on
Zechariah a son named Yahya (John) when he was in old age. Following
that matter, in this verse, the great commandment of Allah unto John is
recited, as follows:

" 'O' Yahya! Take hold of the Book with might.' …"

The objective meaning of 'the Book' here is Turah, and the purpose of
'taking hold of the Book with might' is that he should carry through its
content with an intensive sharp conclusiveness, and should act
accordingly, so that he could enjoy any material and spiritual power,
whether personal and social, in the way of its expansion and
generalization.

Next to this commandment, the Qur'an points to the merits that Allah
had granted to John, or he had obtained them with the grace of Allah,
where it says:

"… And We gave him wisdom (apostleship) while yet a child."

1. Allah gave him the command of prophethood, wisdom, talent and
perspicacity in childhood.

2. And he was also given mercy and compassion in respect to people from
the side of Allah:

" And also compassion from Us …"

3. And Allah gave him piety and purity of soul, spirit, and action:

" …piety; …"

4. And he avoided whatever was other than the command of Allah:

" …and he was God-fearing."

1- Tafsir-i-Atyab-ul-Bayan, and Reyhanatun-Nabiyy, p. 60

By the way, the Qur'anic term /hanan/ means 'compassion, kindness'.
Thus, it was the compassion of Allah to John and John's love to Allah,
which caused the kindness of people to John and John's affection unto
people, all of which were from the Grace of Allah and His Mercy.

**Commentary : Verse 14.15**


14- وَبَرَّا بِوَالِدَيْهِ وَلَمْ يَكُن جَبَّاراً عَصِيّاً

15- وَسَلاَمٌ عَلَيْهِ يَوْمَ وُلِدَ وَيَوْمَ يَمُوتُ وَيَوْمَ يُبْعَثُ
حَيّاً

14. " And kindness to his parents, and (unto the people) he was neither
insolent (nor) disobedient."

15. " And peace on him the day he was born, and the day he dies, and
the day he shall be raised alive!"

**Commentary:**

Hadrat Yahya (John) was very kind to his parents and obeyed them. He
tried to make them happy, because obeying parents is obligatory, and
opposing them is forbidden. He also did not commit any sin,
transgression, and was never proud. He hurt no one. The verse says:

" And kindness to his parents, and (unto the people) he was neither
insolent (nor) disobedient."

Therefore, since Yahya (a.s.) was qualified with all prominent epithets
and great honours, then peace upon him, as the verse says:

" And peace on him the day he was born, and the day he dies, and the
day he shall be raised alive!"

Some commentators have said that the most horrible states of a person
may appear in three circumstances: 1) The day when he comes out from the
mother's womb and enters into the world. 2) The day he dies and finds
himself among the people whom he has not seen. 3) The day when he will
be raised alive and finds himself in a great place of gathering. Allah
favoured John by His Grace and endowed security on him in these three
circumstances. Thus, Yahya (John) passed all the narrow passages
successfully with the safety of religion and belief in Allah.

To hold dear the annual birthday, and remembrance of the annual day of
death of the saints of Allah, of course, is a Qur'anic matter.

**Some Points upon John's Martyrdom:**

Not only was the birth of John marvelous, but so was his death from
some points of view. Most Muslim historians, as well as some famous
Christian sources, have recorded the event of this martyrdom, (with
slight differences), as follows:

Yahya (John) was sacrificed because of the liaison one of the tyrants
of his age had with a woman related to him within the forbidden degrees.
Herod, the sensual king of Palestine, was in love with Herodias, his
niece, whose beauty had captured his heart in the fire of love.
Therefore, he decided to marry her.

When Yahya (John), the great prophet of Allah (a.s.), was informed of
this he promptly announced there and then that their marriage was
unlawful and it was contrary to the laws of the Torah and that Yahya
(John) would struggle against it.

This news was spread throughout the city and the woman, Herodias,
became aware of it. She, considered Yahya (John) the greatest barrier on
her way, and decided to take revenge upon him at the most suitable
opportunity, and remove this obstruction in her way.

She intensified her relation with her uncle and made her beauty as a
trap for him. She had such a deep influence that one day Herod told her
to ask him whatever desire she had and she could be certain that her
demand would assuredly be performed.

Horodias said that she wanted nothing but the head of Yahya, because
Yahya had defamed both of them, and all people found fault concerning
them. She replied if Herod wanted to comfort her heart and make her
happy, he should do that accomplishment.

Herod, who was madly in love of that lady, inattentive to the end of
that action, submitted and very soon the head of John was presented to
that wicked woman. But, finally, the painful results of that hideous
action encompassed her.(1)

Some Islamic traditions indicate that Imam Hussayn (a.s.) the Great
Martyr, said; "From among the mean aspects of this world is that the
head of Yahya-ibn-Zechariah was brought as a present to a wicked woman
from the Children of Israel."

This statement means that, from this point of view, the conditions of
Yahya and those of Imam Hussayn (a.s.) were alike, because one of the
aims of his rising was standing against the evil deeds of the tyrant of
his time, Yazid.

1- Some Evangels and some religious literatures denote that Herod
married his brother's wife, which was forbidden in the laws of the
Turah. Yahya scorned him for that action. Them that woman, by misusing
the beauty of her daughter, caused Herod to kill Yahya (John). (The
Gospel according to ST. Matthew, Chapter 14; and accrding to ST. Mark,
Chapter 6, No. 17 on)
