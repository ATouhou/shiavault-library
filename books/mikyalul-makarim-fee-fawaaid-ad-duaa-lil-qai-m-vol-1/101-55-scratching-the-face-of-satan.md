55. Scratching the face of Satan
================================

That which proves this is matter is a tradition mentioned in *Usool
Kafi* through his own chain of narrators from Ishaq bin Ammar that he
said: His Eminence, Abu Abdillah Sadiq (as):

“O Ishaq, as much as you can, do good to my friends as no believer does
a favor to or helps another except that he scratches the face of Satan
and injures his heart.”[^1]

I say: This tradition proves that helping a believer and doing favor to
him are two causes for scratching Satan’s face and injuring his heart,
and we have repeatedly stated that praying for an early reappearance of
our master, the Master of the Time (aj) is helping and favoring, and His
Eminence is the root of faith and the leader of religion, thus this
benefit would be perfectly achieved through helping and doing favor to
His Eminence.
