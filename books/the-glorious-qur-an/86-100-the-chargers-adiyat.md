100: the Chargers (adiyat)
==========================

This chapter of 11 early Meccan verses was revealed after Eventide 103
and before Plenty 108. Its panting racehorses (which are mares) make a
vivid picture, but they also give a keen sense of foreboding, somewhat
as in Winnowing [Wind! 51 and [Winds) Sent Forth 77. The final
syllables -a (n), -id, and -ur carry the rhymes.
