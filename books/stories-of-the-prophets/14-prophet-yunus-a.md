Prophet Yunus (a)
=================

The prophet Yunus

was sent to Ninevah.

He became known as the

Lord of the Fish (Dhan-Nun).

He warned the people about

their evil ways and told them

to follow Allah but they

would not listen.

Yunus was so angry he left.

He sailed away but the ship

was so full and heavy,

poor Yunus

was thrown

overboard.

He was

swallowed by an

enormous fish and he

lived in its belly

for three days.

Then the fish spewed

him out on a shore.

He was very ill but

Allah was protecting him.

A plant grew

and its leaves protected

Yunus from the sun and

kept the flies away.

A wild goat provided him

with milk. When he became

better he went back to

Ninevah and gave the

people Allah's message

once more. This time

the people listened

and Allah forgave them.
