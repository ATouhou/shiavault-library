Translator’s Preface
====================

Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds, Who bestowed me with the
knowledge and perseverance necessary to translate this valuable work of
Ayatollah Amini into English. Translation of Islamic works is a
demanding job, especially when the assigned work is lengthy. Keeping the
same tone and style throughout the work requires outstanding attention
and concentration. It will be very much appreciated for the readers to
point out their viewpoints on my translation, including any constructive
criticism.

I’d like to express my thanks to my father, Hujjatul Islam Elahinia, for
helping me with jurisprudential issues and Arabic terms.

I am very much indebted, also, to my husband, Mr. Seddighian, for his
constant help and support during this translation project.

I sincerely dedicate this little attempt in propagating Islamic beliefs
to the presence of infallible Imams (a.s.) of the Shi’ah. May Allah
accept their intercession for us in the Last Day;

***“the day when We call every person with their Imams”***[^1] and
***“the day on which property will not avail, nor sons.”***[^2]
