Preface
=======

The main purpose of the article is to explain the importance of the
Third Testimony in the Adhaan and the Namaaz.

Those Hadeeth that establish the Third Testimony to be the main crux of
the matter of religion and emphasise its importance are simply too many
to mention here. For the sake of the brevity of this article, I will
take it for granted that we all regard this as an established fact.

This testimony was established when the heavens and the earth were
established, and it permeates every nook and cranny of the Universe.
Basically there is no place that is devoid of it.

The very first thing that the Pen was told to write on the Tablet was
this testimony, whereas the Heavens did not calm down after their
creation until such time as the Third Testimony was inscribed on them.

BIHAR UL ANWAAR - VOL 27 CH 10 H 16

The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) said: "By the One who sent me as a giver of
good news, Neither the Chair and the Throne was set up nor were the
heavens and the earth established but Allah (s.w.t.) Wrote on it -
'There is no God but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, Ali is
the Commander of the faithful'".

All the Prophets from the first to the last have borne this testimony.
This was inscribed on the seal of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) in between
his shoulder blades. and was revealed in the previous Divine Scriptures
of the Torah and the Evangel and the Book of the Holy Prophet Ibrahim
(a.s.). The list goes on and on and on. Let us just take a look at a
couple of examples.

AL YAQEEN - SYED IBN TAWOOS 589 - 664 AH

The Holy Imam Ja'far Al Sadiq (a.s) said: 'A man came to the Commander
of the Faithful (a.s.) in the Mosque of kufa and said, 'O Commander of
the Faithful! Surely there is in the Quran a Verse which has corrupted
the religious.' He (a.s) said: 'And which one is that?'

The Statement of Allah (s.w.t.) 'And ask those of Our Messengers whom
We sent before you: Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides
the Beneficent Allah? (43:45).' And where were the Prophets during the
time of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) that he (s.a.w.) would have
asked them?' The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) said to them: 'Take a
seat! God Willing I shall inform you of this.

Surely Allah (s.w.t.) has Said in His Book 'Glory be to Him Who made
His servant to go on a night from the Sacred Mosque to the remote mosque
of which We have blessed the precincts, so that We may show to him some
of Our signs' -

One of the signs of Allah (s.w.t.) that he (s.a.w.) saw was that
Jibraeel stopped at the Bayt Al Ma'moor and the ablution was performed
at the Mosque of Al Aqsa and Jibraeel stood and recited the Adhaan said
to him (s.a.w.), 'Go forward and Pray and the angels behind you of a
number known only to Allah (s.w.t.).

In the first line were Adam (a.s.) and Nooh (a.s.) and Ibrahim (a.s.)
and Hud (a.s.) and Musa (a.s.) and Isa (a.s.) and every Prophet that
Allah the Holy the High had sent since the creation of the Heavens and
the earth and then sent Muhammad (s.a.w.). The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.)
moved forward and led them in Prayer with dignity and without
bashfulness.

Allah (s.w.t.) revealed in the twinkling of an eye 'And ask those of
Our Messengers whom We sent before you: Did We ever appoint gods to be
worshipped besides the Beneficent Allah? (43:45)'. The Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.) turned towards them and addressed them altogether: 'How did you
bear the testimonies?'

They replied, 'We bore that surely there is no Deity except Allah
(s.w.t.) Who is One without Partner and you are the Messenger of Allah
and that the Commander of the Faithful Ali is your Trustee, and you are
the Messenger of Allah and the Master of all Prophets and Ali is the
Master of all the Trustees, and these testimonies were taken as a
covenant from us.' The man said, 'You have revived my heart and rescued
me O Commander of the Faithful!'

BIHAR UL ANWAAR - VOL 6 - H 16

In Amaali of Sheykh Toosi it has been narrated that the Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.) said to the Holy Imam Ali (a.s.): 'Take this ring of mine and
get inscribed on it 'Muhammad Bin Abdullah'.

The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) took it and gave it to the
engraver and said to him, 'Inscribe on it 'Muhammad Bin Abdullah'.' The
engraver mistakenly inscribed on it 'Muhammad the Messenger of Allah' on
it. The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) went to him and asked him what
he has done. He said that he had engraved it as such.

The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) said that: 'Indeed it is true but
I will take it to the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) and see what he
(s.a.w.) has to say about this and so he (a.s.) did and said: 'O
Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.)! The engraver has made this error and has
engraved this as such.' The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) took and look and the
engraved ring and said: 'I am Muhammad Bin Abdullah and I am Muhammad
the Messenger of Allah.' He (s.a.w.) decided to keep it.

The next morning when he (s.a.w.) looked at the ring he saw inscribed
on it 'Ali is the Trustee of Allah' and was surprised. The Archangel
Jibraeel descended and told him (s.a.w.) that Allah (s.w.t.) has Said:
'O Muhammad! You have written on it what you desired and We have written
on it what We have Desired.'

As you can see from this that the Third Testimony is the Desire of
Allah (s.w.t.), our Creator.

There is simply too much evidence to provide for the importance of the
Third Testimony. The objective of this article is mainly to discuss it
in the context of the Adhaan and the Namaaz.

Whatever the evidence, one thing is for certain, that the Third
Testimony is the axis around which the whole wheel of our religion
rotates. This is the key to salvation. Without this there is nothing
left worthy of mention.
