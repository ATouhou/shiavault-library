Adverbal Qualifications and Adverbal Qualifications of Time and Place
=====================================================================

35. What is an adverbal qualification of purpose?  
 An adverbal qualification of purpose is a noun mentioned after the verb
to express the purpose of the verb. For example: **وَقَفَ** **الجُندُ**
**ﺇجلالاً** **للامیر** (The army stopped, honoring the commander.) In
this sentence the word honoring is the adverbal qualification of purpose
because it is expressing the reason why the army stopped.

36. What are the signs of an adverbal qualification of purpose?  
 The sign of an adverbal qualification of purpose is that it should be
the answer to the question why after the verb. For example: **زُیّنَتِ**
**المدینةُ** **ﺇکراماً** **للحاکمِ** (The city was beautified to respect
the governor.)

37. What is an adverbal qualification of time and place?  
 An adverbal qualification of time and place is a adverb of time or
place or noun mentioned to express the time of the verb or where it took
place. For example: **حَضَرتُ** **صباحاً** **ﺃمام** **المُعلّم** (I was
present in the morning in front of the teacher.)

38. Are all of the nouns that denote time or place able to put into the
accusative case because of their being adverbs?  
 Every noun that denotes time is able to be put into the accusative case
because of their being adverbs. For example: **سافَرتُ** **شهراً** **و**
**یوماً** **و** **ساعةً** (I travelled a month and a day and an hour.)
But, not all nouns that denote a place are able to be put into the
accusative case, only words that are not clear are able to be put into
the accusative case, for example directions or distances.
