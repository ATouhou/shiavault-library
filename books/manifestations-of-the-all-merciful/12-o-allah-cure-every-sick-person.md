O Allāh, Cure Every Sick Person
===============================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَللٌّهُمَّ اشْفِ كُلَّ مَرِيْضٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Meaning
-------

The Arabic word *marīd* literally means ‘one who is sick or disordered.’
It originates from its infinitive ‘*marad*’ which means:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الْخُرُوْجُ عَنِ الاِعْتِدَالِ الْخَاصِّ بِالإِنْسَانِ وَذٌلِكَ
ضَرْبَان : الأَوَّلُ مَرَضٌ جِسْمِيٌّ...وَالثَّانِي عِبَارَهٌ عَنِ
الرَّذَائِلِ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“…to exit from the state of the equilibrium particular to the human
being[^1]; and this is of two kinds: (1) bodily sickness… (2)
vices.”[^2]

Therefore, in reality, marad is another extension (*misdāq*) of the
state of disequilibrium (*fasād*), and thus can be discussed under the
previous verse of the supplication too.

Extensions of Illnesses
-----------------------

In the Holy Qur’ān and traditions the word “*marad*” (illness) has been
mostly employed to denote one of the abovementioned kinds of human
disequilibria. Look at the following:

1. The Holy Qur’ān [26:80] narrating the words of Prophet Ibrāhīm (as),
says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 وَإِذَا مَرِضْتُ فَهُوَ يَشْفِينِ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And when I turn ill, He (alone) cures me.”***

Two points should be noted here:

(i) The above verse does not imply that the Prophet (s) would not seek
the natural means for the cure. What the verse means is that the
Principal Curer (*al-Shāfī*) is only Allāh. This is because the
existence, subsistence, and effect of the agent of cure is entirely by
His Will and Permission.

(ii) Apparently what is meant in this verse is the physical extension of
illness, for Prophets of Allāh (as) are free from spiritual illnesses.
They are infallible in their thoughts, words and actions. And that
enables them to be propagators and Messengers of God.

2. The Holy Qur’ān [2:8-10] describing the hypocrites says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ فَزَادَهُمُ اللٌّهُ مَرَضاً 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“In their hearts is a sickness; and Allāh increased their
sickness.”***

The sickness referred to here is hypocrisy, which concerns the heart and
not the body. Therefore marad is not limited to physical ailments.

3. Prophet ‘Īsā (as), is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
...مَا مَرِضَ قَلْبٌ بأَشَدَّ مِنَ الْقَسْوَةِ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“…The heart did not fall sick with [a malady] more severe than the
hardness of the heart…”[^3]

4. Imām ‘Alī (as) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لاَ مَرَضَ أَضْنـى مِنْ قِلَّةِ الْعَقْلِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“There is no malady more debilitating that the paucity of
intellect.”[^4]

Here the ‘silliness’ or simplicity of a person is considered to be
another kind of sickness. Therefore marad can also employed to denote
the dull-wittedness of a person.

5. And he (as) is also reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَلْحِقْدُ خُلْقٌ دَنِيٌّ وَمَرَضٌ مُرْدٍ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Resentment (*al-hiqd*) is a degenerate characteristic and a destructive
illness.”[^5]

Therefore, in short, marad is not limited to physical illness, but
covers mental and spiritual illnesses as well.

Supplication for a Sublime Purpose
----------------------------------

Health, like any other Divine blessing is meant for a sublime purpose.
To underutilize it would be tantamount to unthankfulness on the part of
the human being. Our supplications for the betterment of ourselves and
others should be purposeful: we must pray for health as a means to
affect equilibrium in our souls. Were we to pray for health for the sake
of sheer material enjoyment, we would be unthankful to Almighty Allāh,
since the practical reality of shukr is to employ the Divine Blessing
for the purpose it was created.

Imām al-Sajjād in his well-known prayer manual al-Sahīfat al-Sajjādiyyah
prays:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
‏فَمَا أَدْرِي يَا إِلٌهِي أَيُّ الْحَالَيْنِ أَحَقُّ بِالشُّكْرِ
لَكَ. وَأَيُّ الْوَقْتَيْنِ أَوْلَى بِالْحَمْدِ لَكَ. ‏أَوَقْتُ
الصِّحَّةِ الَّتِي هَنَأْتَنِي فِيهَا طَيِّبَاتِ رِزْقِكَ
وَنَشَّطْتَنِي بِـهَا لاِبْتِغَاءِ مَرْضَاتِكَ وَفَضْلِكَ
وَقَوَّيْتَنِي مَعَهَا عَلَى مَا وَفَّقْتَنِي لَهُ مِنْ طَاعَتِكَ‏...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“For I know not, my God, which of the two states deserves more my
thanking You, And which of the two times is more worthy for my praise of
You: the time of health, within which You Make me delight in the
agreeable things of Your provision, through which You Give me the joy to
seek the means to Your Good Pleasure and Bounty, And by which You
Strengthen me for the acts of obedience which You Have Given me success
to accomplish…”[^6]

Here the Imām (as) teaches us that health should be sought to achieve
Allāh’s pleasure (*libtighā’i mardātika*) and to perform acts of His
obedience (*waffaqtanī lahu min tā‘atika*). Therefore, when we seek the
well-being of every member of the human race, we should do so because we
would like the means of their perfection to be facilitated and not
because they can regain their health to continue more damage to
themselves or others.

The delight of our eyes, Sayyid Radī al-Dīn bin Tāwūs in section 7 of
his *Falāh al-Sā’il*, where he enumerates the characteristics of a
supplicant, says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مِنْ صِفَاتِ الدَّاعِي: أَنْ يُرِيْدَ بِالدُّعاءِ مُرَادَ اللٌّهِ
جَلَّ جَلاَلَهُ بِهِ، وَيُقَدِّمُ إِرَادَةَ اللٌّهِ عَلَى إِراَدَةِ
نَفْسِهِ. وَمِثَالُهُ: إِذَا مَرِضَ لاَ يَكُوْنُ قَصْدُهُ مِنَ
الدُّعَاءِ بِعَافِيَتِهِ مُجَرَّدَ بَقَاءِهِ لِشَهْوَتِهِ
وَعَاجِلَتِهِ وَدُنْيَاهُ الشَّاغِلَة عنْ آخِرَتِهِ، بَلْ لِيَبْقَى
عَلى مُرَادِ اللٌّهِ جَلَّ جَلاَلَهُ فِيْ طَاعَتِهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“And among the characteristics of a supplicant is that he should seek
through his supplication what Allāh wants of Him and prefer Allāh’s
desire over his. For example: when he becomes ill, the purpose behind
his supplication for his well-being should not be merely subsistence for
the sake of lustful desire, temporal enjoyment and worldly existence
that disengages him from his Hereafter, rather it should be for the
purpose of living according to what Allāh wants, which is His
Obedience.”[^7]

Beyond the Immediate Causes of Illnesses!
-----------------------------------------

Although it is true to say that we must seek the natural causes of the
various maladies to eradicate them, our aspiration should be loftier
then to merely search for the immediate causes. Physicians categorize
“illness prevention” into four stages:

### 1. Primordial prevention

The Holy Qur’ān says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 إِنَّ اللٌّهَ لاَ يُغَيِّرُ مَا بِقَوْمٍ حَتَّى يُغَيِّرُوا مَا
بِأَنفُسِهِمْ... 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Allāh does not change what is with a community save that they change
what is in them.”***[^8]

Primordial prevention is to avoid the emergence and establishment of
social, economic and cultural patterns of living which are known to
elevate risk of disease.

This is certainly the most important of all kinds of prevention. The
human being is taught that his lifestyle can indeed determine what kind
of future awaits him. To establish those social, economic and cultural
patterns that would secure the health of the human being largely depends
on the validity of the political body that governs the human society.
Only an Islamic government subservient to the principles of Islam, can
create a physically healthy environment. This is because the social,
economic and cultural patterns would be defined by God, Who Created the
human being for prosperity in both this world and the Hereafter, and
Knows what laws would lead him to this prosperity. There is an
interesting anecdote narrated about the situation prevailing in the
Muslim community during the time of the Holy Prophet (s):

During the Holy Prophet (s)’s time, the king of Egypt sent a skilled
doctor to the Holy Prophet (s). He lived one year with the Arabs but
found no one approaching him for treatment. He therefore came to the
Prophet (s) to complain. The Holy Prophet (s) explained to him that the
reason behind the situation was that his people had adopted a path of
moderation: they did not eat unless their appetite for food overcame
them, and (ii) They stopped eating while they still had some appetite
for food left. Hearing this, the doctor said: ‘This is the cause of
[their] health.’ Then he kissed the earth, and left.[^9]

In other words, they obeyed the Holy Prophet (s) and applied his
well-known saying:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كُلْ وَاَنْتَ تَشْتَهِي وَاَمْسِكْ وَاَنْتَ تَشْتَهِي.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Eat while you have the appetite, and refrain from eating while you
still have the appetite.”[^10]

If the laws of Almighty Allāh prevailed in the environment they would
deter the human being from engaging in sin, which leads to a substantial
number, if not most of the prevalent illnesses. In a society where
capitalism and consumerism prevail, what should one expect save the
culture of overindulgence? In an environment where the woman is used as
an item of advertisement and sale, what can one anticipate save sexual
perversion? And these two major factors contribute to a great number of
illnesses. In such a situation primordial prevention is a far fetched
phenomenon.

One must understand that the fundamental unit for the realization of
primordial prevention, is the government. It is the ideology of the
ruling power that determines what kind of society it would like and what
kind of lifestyle it encourages.

### 2. Primary Prevention

The Holy Qur’ān says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ لاَ تُلْقُوا بِأَيْدِيكُمْ إِلـى التَّهْلُكَةِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Do not lay yourself into destruction.”[^11]

Primary prevention is action taken prior to the onset of disease, which
removes the possibility that a disease will ever occur. For example the
preventive measures taken to avoid diseases such as heart attacks, high
cholesterol levels, ulcers, etc. is called primary prevention. Often
these simple measures are not taken seriously, which leads us to the
second stage of prevention i.e. secondary prevention.

In primary prevention, the human being refrains from the causes that
would amplify the vulnerability of illness. Abstinence [abstaining from
sex beyond marriage], consuming low cholesterol foods, nominal sugar,
etc. are known to be kinds of primary prevention. This kind of
prevention is also difficult for those suffering from spiritual maladies
such as avarice, overindulgence, etc. The following traditions emphasize
the important role of denial before sickness:

i) Imām Amīru’l Mu’minīn (as) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الْمَعِدَةُ بَيْتُ الأَدْوَاءِ، وَالْحِمْيَةُ رَأْسُ الدَّوَاءِ. لاَ
صِحَّةَ مَعَ النَّهَمِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“The stomach is the house of maladies, and denial is the principal
medicine, and there is no well-being in greed.”[^12]

ii) And he (as) has also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
صَلاَحُ الْبَدَنِ الْحِمْيَةُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“In denial is the equilibrium of the body.”[^13]

iii) Imām Abū Ibrāhīm al-Kazim (as) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَيسَ الْحِمْيَةُ أَنْ تَدَعَ الشَّيْ‏ءَ أَصْلاً، وَلٌكِنَّ
الْحِمْيَةَ أَنْ تَأْكُلَ مِنَ الشَّيْ‏ءِ وَتُخَفِّفَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Denial does not mean that you avoid a thing totally, and do not eat it;
rather, it means that you have a light consumption of something.”[^14]

iv) And Imām Abu‘l Hasan al-Ridā (as) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
رَأْسُ الحِْمْيَةِ الرِّفْقُ بِالْبَدَنِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“The peak of denial is to treat the body gently and with
friendliness.”[^15]

To deal with the body in a friendly manner does not mean to eat whatever
you want. This wise dictum of Imām al-Ridā (as) calls us to identify
those things that the body needs and provide it with the same.
Overindulgence in eating would therefore be contrary to what our body
requires. Although it would give utter pleasure to the taste buds of our
tongues, but its consequences are detrimental to our bodies.
Uncontrolled sexual activity is the same. The utmost pleasure can be
sought from these acts, but the consequences are harmful for the body.

There is a beautiful poem attributed to Avicenna where he considers the
secret of medicine in the moderation of food consumption and sex:

He says:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />

Listen to all what I have to advise, and act accordingly  
 For medicine is gathered in the poetry of my word  
 Lessen your copulation as much as you can  
 For verily it is the water of life that is placed in the wombs  
 And make your meal once a day  
 And beware of eating before the digestion of what you have eaten

### 3. Secondary Prevention

Imām Abū ‘Abdillāh al-Sadiq (as) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ نَبيًّا مِنَ الأَنْبِيَاء مَرِضَ فَقَالَ: لاَ أَتَدَاوَى حَتىّ
يَكُوْنُ الّذِيْ أمْرَضَنِي هُوَ الَّذِي يَشْفِيْنِي. فَأَوْحَى
اللٌّهُ تَعَالـى إِلَيْهِ: لاَ أشْفِيْكَ حَتىّ تَتَدَاوَى، فَإِنَّ
الشّفَاء مِنِّي.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“One of the Prophets [once] got ill, whereupon he said: I shall not cure
myself until He Who made me sick treats me Himself. Thereupon Almighty
Allāh revealed unto him: I will not cure you, until you treat yourself,
for surely ‘cure’ comes from Me.”[^16]

Secondary prevention is action, which halts the progress of a disease at
its incipient stage and prevents complications. Treating diseases with
medicines constitutes secondary prevention. The health programs
initiated by governments are usually at the level of secondary
prevention.

Islam does not encourage one to immediately seek medicine for illnesses
that only need time to disappear. As long as the human being can bear
the difficulty and pain of a certain sickness like mild flu, he or she
is encouraged to do so. To immediately resort to medicine is not a wise
course. Instead, one is highly advised to seek the natural foods that
have a medicinal effect on the body. Yes, there are illnesses, which
should be controlled at their incipient phases. If one is in doubt or
detects such an illness, he should immediately seek medical treatment so
that the situation does not get worse.

### 4. Tertiary Prevention

Tertiary prevention is a preventive measure used late in the stage of
the disease. It includes limiting disabilities and carrying out
rehabilitation programs.

Can Illness Be Totally Avoided?
-------------------------------

With scientific advancement, the causes of many illnesses and their
remedies have been discovered. But can we limit the causes of the
various illnesses to what has been discovered so far? Both the scientist
and the philosopher will respond in the negative. This is because there
is always a probability of there being other unknown causes of certain
maladies. The scientist has no right to limit the causes of a certain
malady to what the latest empirical data suggests, since there is always
a chance of discovery of other causes to different maladies. The
scientist can also not claim that no psychological or spiritual factor
is responsible for physical illnesses, for he does not comprehend the
link between the body and the soul, and cannot transcend the senses.

Imām al-Sādiq (as) was once asked by an atheist as to why is it
deserving for a small child to suffer from ailments and sicknesses while
he is sinless and has committed no crime. The Imām (as) responded
saying:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ الْمَرَضَ عَلَى وُجُوهٍ شَتَّى: مَرَضُ بَلْوَى، وَمَرَضُ
الْعُقُوبَةِ، وَمَرَضٌ جُعِلَ عَلَيْهِ الْفَنَاءُ، وَأَنْتَ تَزْعُمُ
أَنَّ ذٌلِكَ مِنْ أَغْذِيَةٍ رَدِيئَةٍ وَأَشْرِبَةٍ وَبِيئَةٍ أَوْ
مِنْ عِلَّةٍ كَانَتْ بِأُمِّهِ، وَتَزْعُمُ أَنَّ مَنْ أَحْسَنَ
السِّيَاسَةَ لِبَدَنِهِ وَأَجْمَلَ النَّظَرَ فِي أَحْوَالِ نَفْسِهِ
وَعَرَفَ الضَّارَّ مِمَّا يَأْكُلُ مِنَ النَّافِعِ لَمْ يَمْرَضْ،
وَتَمِيلُ فِي قَوْلِكَ إِلـى مَنْ يَزْعُمُ أَنَّهُ لاَ يَكُونُ
الْمَرَضُ وَالْمَوْتُ إِلاَّ مِنَ الْمَطْعَمِ وَالْمَشْرَبِ، قَدْ
مَاتَ أَرَسْطَاطَالِيسُ مُعَلِّمُ الأَطِبَّاءِ، وَأَفْلاَطوُنُ رَئِيسُ
الْحُكَمَاءِ، وَجَالِينُوسُ شَاخَ وَدَقَّ بَصَرُهُ وَمَا دَفَعَ
الْمَوْتَ حِينَ نَزَلَ بِسَاحَتِهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Indeed, illnesses are of various kinds: the illness of Divine
tribulation, the illness of Divine punishment, and illness as a means
for death. You think that the reason behind the illness is the partaking
of rotten food and contaminated water, or a malady that was present in
the child’s mother. You think that whosoever manages his body properly
and takes good care of the conditions of his spirit and distinguishes
the harmful foods from the advantageous will never fall sick? Your
thinking resembles one who imagines that sickness and death do not occur
save through food and drink; surely Aristotle, the mentor of physicians
and Plato, the chief of the philosophers died; and Galen became old and
his eyesight failed, and he could not repel death when it came to
him.”[^17]

Therefore even if one puts great efforts in observing hygiene as well as
primary prevention, he cannot guarantee himself immunity from illness.

Illness - a Means of Self-Purification
--------------------------------------

The apparent form of physical illness may seem to be affliction and
trouble, but its kernel manifests nothing but love, mercy and attention.
In our traditions, illness for a believer plays the role of a detergent
of the human soul that purifies it from the burden of sins so that the
soul can qualify to be receptive and perhaps start the journey to
Almighty Allāh.

Following are some of the many traditions that clearly show how
illnesses can be an advantage to the believing souls:

1. The Holy Prophet (s) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَكُوْنُ لَهُ الدَّرَجَة عِنْدَ اللٌّهِ لاَ
يَبْلُغُهَا بعَمَلِهَِ يُبْتَلى ببَلاَءٍ فِي جِسْمِهِ فَيَبْلُغُهَا
بذٌلِكَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Indeed a person may have a station near God which he could not attain
only by his actions, (and thus) he would be afflicted by an ailment in
his body by which he would attain the station.”[^18]

2. Imām ‘Alī (as) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إذَا ابْتَلى اللٌّهُ عَبْدًا أَسْقَطَ عَنْهُ مِنَ الذُّنُوْبِ بِقَدْرِ
عِلَّتِهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“When Allāh afflicts His servant with a calamity, He reduces his sins in
accordance with his malady.”[^19]

3. Imām al-Ridā (as) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الْمَرَضُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ تَطْهِيْرٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ، وَلِلْكَافِرِ تَعْذِيْبٌ
وَلَعْنَةٌ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Sickness is purification and mercy for the believer and a punishment
and curse for the disbeliever…”[^20]

4. Imām al-Sādiq (as) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
صُدَاعُ لَيْلَةٍ تَحُطُّ كُلَّ خَطِيْئَةٍ إِلاَّ الْكَبَائِر.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“A night’s headache removes all of one’s sins, save the major
ones.”[^21]

Mediation by those who possess Existential Influence
----------------------------------------------------

The human being has an ability to soar to such heights that he can
influence the world of contingent existence (*takwīn*) by the permission
of Almighty Allāh. As for the Prophets of Almighty Allāh, this is a fact
that one can observe in different places of the Holy Qur’ān. An example
is that of Prophet ‘Īsā (as):

Almighty Allāh says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 وَإِذْ تَخْلُقُ مِنْ الطِّينِ كَهَيْئَةِ الطَّيْرِ بِإِذْنِي
فَتَنفُخُ فِيهَا فَتَكُونُ طَيْرًا بِإِذْنِي وَتُبْرِئُ الأَكْمَهَ
وَالأَبْرَصَ بِإِذْنِي وَإِذْ تُخْرِجُ الْمَوْتَى بِإِذْنِي... 
  </p>
</blockquote>

“…and when you fashioned out of clay a thing like the form of a bird by
My permission, then you breathed into it and it became a bird by My
permission, and you healed the blind and the leprous by My permission;
and when you brought forth the dead by My permission....”[^22]

In all the abovementioned wonders that Prophet ‘Īsā (as) was able to
perform, he required Divine permission to lay his influence on
contingent existents. That is why the phrase “by My permission” is
iterated after every wonder described.

As regards the infallible Imāms of the Ahlu’l Bayt (as), we do have
reports of such influence by them and there is enough evidence to
indicate that such phenomena are normal and simple for them, since they
enjoy *al-wilāyah al-takwiniyyah* (the powers to lay influence in
contingent existence), and they are intermediaries of Divine Grace
(*wasā’it al-fayd al-ilāhī*) as well. Following are some instances
worthy of contemplation:

1. Uprooting the door of Khaybar is a phenomenon that is beyond the
scope of science to explain. No strong human being can do this with his
bodily strength. While explaining to Sahl bin Hunayf how he managed to
uproot the heavy door of Khaybar, Imām (as) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَاللٌّهِ مَا قَلَعْتُ بَابَ خَيْبَرٍ وَقَذَفْتُ بِهِ وَرَائِي
اَرْبَعِيْنَ ذِرَاعًا لَمْ تَحُسّ أَعْضَائِي بِقُوّةٍ جَسَدِيّةٍ
وَحَرَكَةٍ غَرِيْزِيَّةٍ بَشَرِيَّةٍ، وَلٌكِنّي اُيّدْتُ بِقُوَّةٍ
مَلَكُوْتِيَّةٍ وَنَفْسٍ بِنُوْرِ رَبِّهَا مُضِيْئَةٌ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“I swear by Allāh, I did not uproot the door of Khaybar and throw it 40
forearms away while the members of my body did not feel anything, with
bodily strength, or nutritive momentum, but I was supported by celestial
power and the spirit which is radiant with the Light of its Lord.”[^23]

2. History tells us that once in the gathering of the ‘Abbasid Caliph
Ma’mūn, Hamīd bin Mahrān, a supporter of the Caliph, belittling Imām
al-Ridā (as) tried to challenge him saying that his prayer for rain
which was followed by heavy rains after a long drought was something
ordinary and that rain came at its normal season. He said that if the
Imām (as) could perform miracles which were beyond the powers of
ordinary men, then he should order the pictures of the two lions that
were painted on the curtains of the court of Ma’mūn to become real lions
and jump on him and swallow him up. The Imām (as) pointed to the two
pictures and they became real lions, and pounced at Mehrān and ate him
up and then turned toward Ma’mun and started gazing at him. Thereafter
facing the Imām (as) the lions said to the Imām: what do you order us to
do with this one (i.e. Ma’mūn)? On seeing this, Ma’mūn fell unconscious.
The Imām (as) said to the lions to return where they came from.[^24]

These were instances that transpired through the Imāms(as). However, is
this possible also with other human beings who attain heights of
perfection? Do the *Awliyā’ullāh* (near ones to God) possess such power
too? Can they cure a sick person without employing the conventionally
known methods?

Let us look at the Holy Qur’ān and find the answer:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

عِنْدَهُ قَالَ هٌذَا مِنْ فَضْلِ رَبِّي لِيَبْلُوَنِي أَأَشْكُرُ أَمْ
أَكْفُرُ وَمَنْ شَكَرَ فَإِنَّمَا يَشْكُرُ لِنَفْسِهِ وَمَنْ كَفَرَ
فَإِنَّ رَبِّــي غَنِيٌّ كَرِيـمٌ 

“Said one who had knowledge of the Book: “I will bring it to you within
the twinkling of any eye!” Then when (Solomon) saw it placed firmly
before him, he said: “This is by the grace of my Lord! To test me
whether I am grateful or ungrateful! And if any one is grateful, truly
his gratitude is (a gain) for his own soul; but if any is ungrateful,
truly my Lord is Free of All Needs, Supreme in Honor!”[^25]

According to the traditions of the Ahlu’l Bayt (as), the ‘one who had
knowledge of the book’ in the above verse, was the minister of Sulaymān
called Āsaf bin Barkhiyyah[^26]. He was the person who with Divine
consent brought the throne of queen Bilqīs within the twinkling of an
eye. He was known to possess knowledge of *al-Ism al-A‘zam* (the great
Name of Allāh), and therefore could perform such powerful feats.

We must understand however that according to authoritative Muslim
scholars, neither does the *al-Ism al-A‘zam* (Great Name) actually
consist of letters and words, nor is the knowledge of the Great Name the
conceptual or mental knowledge of a certain word or specific letters as
the majority of the laity imagined and believed so far. The knowledge of
*al-Ism al-A‘zam* is a maqām and station that the human being attains
after self-purification and attaining human perfection. ‘Allāmah
Tabātabā’ī in volume 7 of his exegesis, *al-Mīzān* has explained this
fact at length.[^27]

Salmān al-Muhammadī and his Powers
----------------------------------

One of the companions of the Holy Prophet (s) who enjoyed the station of
*al-wilāyah al-takwīniyyah* was Salman al-Farsi, who was also known as
Salman al-Muhammadī by the Ahlu’l Bayt (as). Being utterly subservient
to the Ahlu’l Bayt (as), he was also known to be from among them. Once
Salmān al-Fārsī’s name was mentioned near Imām Muhammad al-Bāqir (as),
and he said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لا تَقُولُوا سَلْمَانَ الْفَارِسِيَّ، وَلَكِنْ قُولُوا سَلْمَانَ
الْمُحَمَّدِيَّ. ذَاكَ رَجُلٌ مِنَّا أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Do not say Salmān al-Farsī, but say Salmān al-Muhammadī, for he is a
man from us, the Ahlu’l Bayt (as).”[^28]

It is important and necessary for us to realize and understand that
ma’rifah and gnosis are of various levels. Those who attain the lower
levels cannot comprehend the higher levels. Rather, the matter becomes
so intricate that if those of lower levels were to hear what the exalted
ones have to say, they would have termed them as disbelievers and done
things worse than that. Salmān al-Muhammadī enjoyed a very high rank,
such that Imām Zayn al-’Ābidīn is reported to have said about him:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَاللٌّهِ لَوْ عَلِمَ أَبُو ذَرّ مَا فِي قَلْبِ سَلْمَان لَقَتَلَهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“I swear by Allāh, if Abū Dharr knew what was in the heart of Salmān, he
would have killed him.”[^29]

And Imām Muhammad al-Bāqir (as) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
دَخَلَ أَبُو ذَرٍّ عَلَى سَلْمَانَ وَهُوَ يَطْبَخُ قِدْراً لَهُ،
فَبَيْنَا هُمَا يَتَحَادَثَانِ ‏إِذَا انْكَبَّتِ الْقِدْرُ عَلَى
وَجْهِهَا عَلَى الأَرْضِ، فَلَمْ يَسْقُطْ مِنْ مَرَقِهَا وَلاَ مِنْ
وَدَكِهَا شَيْ‏ءٌ، فَعَجِبَ مِنْ ذٌلِكَ أَبُو ذَرٍّ عَجَباً شَدِيداً،
وَأَخَذَ سَلْمَانُ الْقِدْرَ فَوَضَعَهَا عَلَى حَالِهَا الأَوَّلِ
عَلَى النَّارِ ثَانِيَةً، وَأَقْبَلاَ يَتَحَدَّثَانِ فَبَيْنَمَا هُمَا
يَتَحَدَّثَانِ إِذَا انْكَبَّتِ الْقِدْرُ عَلَى وَجْهِهَا فَلَمْ
يَسْقُطْ مِنْهَا شَيْ‏ءٌ مِنْ مَرَقِهَا وَلاَ مِنْ وَدَكِهَا، قَالَ
فَخَرَجَ أَبُو ذَرٍّ وَهُوَ مَذْعُورٌ مِنْ عِنْدِ سَلْمَانَ،
فَبَيْنَمَا هُوَ مُتَفَكِّرٌ إِذْ لَقِيَ أَمِيرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ (ع)
عَلَى الْبَابِ، فَلَمَّا أَنْ بَصُرَ بهِ أَمِيرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ (ع)
قَالَ لَهُ: يَا بَا ذَرٍّ! مَا الَّذِي أَخْرَجَكَ وَمَا الَّذِي
ذَعَرَكَ؟ فَقَالَ لَهُ أَبُو ذَرٍّ: يَا أَمِيرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ!
رَأَيْتُ سَلْمَانَ صَنَعَ كَذَا وَكَذَا، فَعَجِبْتُ مِنْ ذٌلِكَ.
فَقَالَ أَمِيرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ(ع): يَا أبَا ذَرٍّ! إِنَّ سَلْمَانَ
لَوْ حَدَّثَكَ بِمَا يَعْلَمُ لَقُلْتَ رَحِمَ اللَّهُ قَاتِلَ
سَلْمَانَ!
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Abū Dharr once came to Salmān while he was cooking in a cooking pot;
while they were conversing with each other, the cooking pot overturned
and fell down on the ground, but not a drop of its curry or cooking fat
fell down; Abū Dharr was highly amazed at seeing this; Salmān picked up
the cooking pot and placed it on the fire the second time, and they
began conversing once again; while they were talking to each other, the
pot overturned again, and nothing of the curry or cooking fat spilled,
Abu Dharr then left Salmān in the state of great astonishment , and
while he was deep in thought, he suddenly met Amīr al-Mu’minīn (as) at
the door. When the Imām (as) saw Abū Dharr’s state of amazement, he said
to him: O Abā Dharr, what made you leave the presence of Salmān? And
what made you frightened? Abū Dharr said to the Imām (as): O Amīr
al-Mu’minīn, I saw Salmān doing such and such a thing, and I was amazed
by that. Thereupon Amīr al-Mu’minīn (as) said to him: O Abā Dharr, If
Salmān were to tell you what he knows, you would have said: May Allāh
have mercy on the killer of Salmān.”[^30]

This incident reveals much. It is important to note the following:

1. *Īmān* (belief) and *ma‘rifah* (knowledge of God) have different
levels. Those who enjoy the lower levels cannot bear the knowledge of
the high ranking ones like Salmān al-Muhammadi. Imām Muhammad al-Bāqir
(as) is also reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
سَلْمَانُ بَحْرُ الْعِلْمِ لاَ يُقْدَرُ عَلَى نَزْحِه.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Salmān is an ocean of knowledge, which cannot be drained and
exhausted.”[^31]

Abū Basīr is reported to have said that he heard Imām al-Sādiq (as)
saying:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ سَلْمَانَ عَلِمَ الإسْمَ الاَعْظَمَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Surely Salmān knew the Greatest Name of God (*al-ism al-a‘zam*).”

And as we said, this name is not a word to be memorized but an exalted
spiritual state. Men of gnosis describe it as the state of exemplifying
in oneself the beautiful attributes of Almighty Allāh according to one’s
limitations.

2. Salmān al-Muhammadī had powers that enabled him to lay influence in
existence, and that is why not a drop of curry spilled off even if the
vessel overturned. Other incidents are also narrated about him, which we
have not considered here, due to the limited scope of this work.

3. The statement that if Abū Dharr would have known what Salmān knew he
would have said ‘May Allāh have mercy on the killer of Salmān’ should
not make us imagine that the belief of Salmān and Abū Dharr contradicted
each other. Not at all. It is the stages of knowledge, as ‘Allāmah
Majisī[^32] and Mawlā Fayd al-Kāshānī[^33] allude in their works, that
differ. A narrow receptacle cannot contain more that its capacity. Can
you fill a bucket full of water in a small cup? Otherwise, Abū Dharr was
one of the great companions of the Holy Prophet (s) about whom it is
narrated from the Holy Prophet (s) that:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يَنْظُرَ إِلَى زُهْدِ عِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ (ع)
فَلْيَنْظُرْ إِلَى أَبِي ذَرٍّ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Whosoever would like to look at the *zuhd* (detachment of the world) of
‘Isā (as) bin Maryam, should look at Abū Dharr.”[^34]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الْجَنَّةُ تَشْتَاقُ إِلَيْكَ يَا عَلِيُّ، وَإِلَى عَمَّارٍ
وَسَلْمَانَ وَأَبِي ذَرٍّ وَالْمِقْدَادِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“O’ ‘Alī, verily Paradise yearns for you and for ‘Ammār, Salmān, Abū
Dharr and Miqdād.”[^35]

In short, both the examples of Āsaf bin Barkhiyyah and Salmān
al-Muhammadī reveal that other human beings too, are able to attain a
station that can enable them to do things that those far away from God
cannot do.

Ibn Sīnā in his great work Remarks and Admonitions, says: “You may
receive information about the gnostics that almost runs counter to
custom, and then you begin to disbelieve. And this is like saying a
knower (*‘ārif*) sought rain for people, hence, they received rain; or
sought recovery for them, hence, they recovered; or wished them ill,
hence they were cast down, inflicted by earth tremors, or perished in
another way. This is also like saying he wished them well, hence they
were emancipated from diseases, murrain, torrential stream and flood; or
a beast submits to some of them, or no birds flees from them, or other
similar things occur that do not count as belonging to the kind of
things that are clearly impossible. Stand still and do not rush into
rejecting these things, for such things have causes in the mysteries of
nature. Perhaps it will be possible for me to relate some of these
causes to you.”[^36]

Does Seeking Help from the Ahululbayt (as) for Curing Our Maladies Amount to Shirk?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human beings have different degrees of power and strength. It is an
obvious phenomenon that the less powerful seek assistance from the more
powerful. When seeking support and assistance from other human beings,
do we commit *shirk* (polytheism)? Certainly not, for we do not seek
assistance from the strong ones and at the same time consider them to
possess independent power. We are also not certain whether they would
complete the job. Why? This is because they do not have anything of
their own. They are contingent and dependent beings. They and their acts
all depend and subsist by the All-Powerful Being. This truth is
understood by contemplating on the adjective “al-Qayyūm” in the
well-known verse of the Throne (*Āyat al-Kursī*):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 أَللٌّهُ لاٌ إِلٌهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Allāh; Except Him there is no God; He Alone is All-living and
All-Subsisting.”***[^37]

*Al-Qayyūm* is defined as *al-Qā‘imu bidhātih wa al-Muqawwimu
lighayrih*, which means “One who is Essentially Subsisting and every
other entity and being subsists by Him[^38]. Therefore no one can ever
claim to have any kind of independent perfection whatsoever.
Consequently, seeking assistance from anyone other than Him in any
limited degree, with the intention that every power solely comes from
Him and belongs to Him is nothing but tawhīd.

The Holy Qur’ān says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 وَ اللٌّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ وَ مَا تَعْمَلُونَ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“But Allāh created you and what you do.”***[^39]

The same applies with regard to the Infallible Imāms (as) of the progeny
of the Holy Prophet (s), who have more power than others and have access
to the higher realms too. Should we consider seeking their support to be
shirk? The answer is clear: shirk is out of question because we do not
consider them to have independent power. We certainly know that every
effect that they would lay would be entirely with Allāh’s leave. This
reality is aptly stated in the verse of the Throne of the Holy Qur’ān:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 مَنْ ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Who can mediate near Him save by His permission.”***[^40]

It should be noted that shafā’ah and mediation here refers to
existential mediation.

‘Allāmah Tabātabā’ī in his *al-Mīzān* says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وقد فاتهم أولاً أن ثبوت التأثير سواء كان مادياً أو غير مادي في غيره
تعالى ضروري لا سبيل إلى إنكاره، وقد أسند تعالى في كلامه التأثير بجميع
أنواعه إلى غيره، ونفي التأثير عن غيره تعالى مطلقاً يستلزم إبطال قانون
العلية والمعلولية العام الذي هو الركن في جميع أدلة التوحيد، وفيه هدم
بنيان التوحيد. نعم، المنفي من التأثير عن غيره تعالى هو الاستقلال في
التأثير ولا كلام لأحد فيه، وأما نفي مطلق التأثير ففيه إنكار بديهة
العقل والخروج عن الفطرة الإنسانية.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“They however did not realize the following: establishing influence, be
that material or immaterial with regard to other than Allāh is necessary
and inarguable. Further, God has attributed in his speech all kinds of
influence to other than Him; and the absolute negation of influence from
other than Him necessitates the annulment of the [intellectually
established] universal law of causality [every effect necessitates a
cause] which is a fundamental principle in all the proofs of monotheism;
and in that [i.e. the annulment of..] is the destruction of the
foundation of monotheism.

Yes, that influence which is unacceptable from other than God is
‘Independent Influence’ and there is no contradiction in this. However,
negating ‘influence’ in the absolute sense is contradicting the
rationally self-evident and transgressing the bounds of the human
disposition (*fitrah*)…”[^41]

Visiting the Sick: A Manifestation of True Concern
--------------------------------------------------

One of the manifestations of true concern for the sick is to visit them
and seek information about their well-being. To verbally pray for them
but be indifferent of their condition seems to be somewhat paradoxical.
Of course this is different from a situation in which one does pray for
sick people, but has no opportunity to visit them due to his or her
important schedule.

Besides psychological research, which proves that visiting the sick
confers a lot of solace and sometimes can radically improve the
condition of the ailing one as well, our traditions enumerate lots of
blessings for visiting sick people. Following are traditions worthy of
contemplation:

i) The Messenger of Allāh is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَنِ النَّبِيِّ (ص) قَالَ: يُعَيِّرُ اللٌّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ عَبْداً
مِنْ عِبَادِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَيَقُولُ: عَبْدِي مَا مَنَعَكَ
إِذَا مَرِضْتُ أَنْ تَعُودَنِي؟ فَيَقُولُ: سُبْحَانَكَ سُبْحَانَكَ!
أَنْتَ رَبُّ الْعِبَادِ، لاَ تَأْلَمُ وَلاَ تَمْرَضُ. فَيَقُولُ:
مَرِضَ أَخُوكَ الْمُؤْمِنُ فَلَمْ تَعُدْهُ، وَعِزَّتِي وَجَلاَلِي لَوْ
عُدْتَهُ لَوَجَدْتَنِي عِنْدَهُ ثُمَّ لَتَكَفَّلْتُ بِحَوَائِجِكَ
فَقَضَيْتُهَا لَكَ، وَذٌلِكَ مِنْ كَرَامَةِ عَبْدِيَ الْمُؤْمِنِ،
وَأَنَا الرَّحْمَنُ الرَّحِيمُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

On the Judgment Day Almighty Allāh would reproach a servant among his
servants, and say: ‘O My servant, what hampered you from visiting Me
when I fell sick.’ The servant thereupon would say: ‘Free from
imperfections are You! Free from imperfections are You! You are the Lord
of the people, neither do You sense any pain, nor do You fall sick.’
Thereupon Allāh would say: ‘Your mu’min brother fell sick, and you did
not visit him; I swear by my Invincibility and Majesty, were you to
visit him, you would have found Me near him, and I would have taken the
responsibility of attending to your needs and would give them to you;
and this is due to the nobility of My believing servant, and I am the
All-Beneficent, the All-Merciful.’”[^42]

2. Imām Muhammad al-Bāqir (as) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كَانَ فِيمَا نَاجَى بِهِ مُوسَى (ع) رَبَّهُ أَنْ قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ مَا
بَلَغَ مِنْ عِيَادَةِ الْمَرِيضِ مِنَ الأَجْرِ؟ فَقَالَ اللٌّهُ عَزَّ
وَجَلَّ: أُوَكِّلُ بِهِ مَلَكاً يَعُودُهُ فِي قَبْرِهِ إِلَى
مَحْشَرِهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Among those things that Mūsā (as) whispered to his Lord was : ‘O Lord
inform me the extent of reward that a person who visits the sick would
get?’ Allāh said: ‘I would entrust an angel over him who would visit him
in his grave until his resurrection [on the Judgment Day].’”[^43]

3. Imām Abū ‘Abdillāh al-Sādiq (as) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ عَادَ مَرِيضاً شَيَّعَهُ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفَ مَلَكٍ يَسْتَغْفِرُونَ
لَهُ حَتَّى يَرْجِعَ إِلَى مَنْزِلِهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Whosoever visits a sick person, 70,000 angels escort him while they
seek for forgiveness for him, until he returns back to his house.”[^44]

Despite all the above merits, a selfless and concerned human being would
visit the sick because his innate disposition (*fitrah*) calls him to do
that, and not due to the attraction of the reward.

Visiting the sick, however, should be brief as has been indicated in
various traditions, and one must also try to observe the etiquette of
visiting the sick. Due to the brevity of the present work, we will avoid
going into details about this. However, those who are interested to know
the details can refer to traditional texts such as vol. 81 of *Bihār
al-Anwār* of ‘Allāmah Majlisi.

“Āh” is One of the Names of Allāh
---------------------------------

Both the Holy Qur’ān as well as the traditions of the Ahlu’l Bayt (as)
greatly emphasize that one should not complain in the state of sickness
and affliction. And whosoever observes patience is promised great
reward. Look at the following traditions:

1. The Holy Prophet (s) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَرْبَعٌ مِنْ كُنُوزِ الْجَنَّةِ: كِتْمَانُ الْفَاقَةِ، وَكِتْمَانُ
الصَّدَقَةِ، وَكِتْمَانُ الْمُصِيبَةِ، وَكِتْمَانُ الْوَجَعِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Four things are from among the treasures of Paradise: to hide one’s
need; to give sadaqah secretly, to hide one’s calamity, and to hide
one’s pain.”[^45]

2. ‘Abdullāh bin Mas’ūd is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بَيْنَا نَحْنُ عِنْدَ رَسُولِ اللٌّهِ (ص) إِذْ تَبَسَّمَ، فَقُلْتُ
لَهُ: مَا لَكَ يَا رَسُولَ اللٌّهِ تَبَسَّمْتَ؟ فَقَالَ (ص): عَجِبْتُ
لِلْمُؤْمِنِ وَجَزَعِهِ مِنَ السُّقْمِ، وَلَوْ يَعْلَمُ مَا لَهُ فِي
السُّقْمِ مِنَ الثَّوَابِ لأَحُبَّ أَنْ لاَ يَزَالَ سَقِيماً حَتَّى
يَلْقَى رَبَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“While we were in the presence of the Holy Prophet (s), when he suddenly
smiled. So I asked him: What happened; why did you smile O Messenger of
Allāh? He said: I am surprised at the believer and his apprehension due
to his illness; were he to know what reward there is for him in the
illness, he would have loved to be ill until he meets his Lord, the
Invincible and Majestic.”[^46]

3. The Holy Prophet (s) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ مَرِضَ يَوْماً وَلَيْلَةً فَلَمْ يَشْكُ إِلَى عُوَّادِهِ،
بَعَثَهُ اللٌّهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ مَعَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ خَلِيلِ
الرَّحْمٌنِ، حَتَّى يَجُوزَ الصِّرَاطَ كَالْبَرْقِ اللاَّمِعِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Whosoever is ill for a day and night but does not complain about his
situation to his visitors, Allāh would raise him on the Judgment Day
with Prophet Ibrāhīm (as), the Friend of the All-Merciful, so that he
would cross the path like radiant lightening.”[^47]

The meaning of complaint and *shikāyah*, however, should be understood
properly. One who expresses the sensation of pain that he encounters
cannot, for example, be known to be complaining against Almighty Allāh.
In fact in some traditions of the Ahlu’l Bayt (as) the expression “āh”
from the ailing one is considered as one of the Names of Almighty Allāh.
Observe the following:

Ja’far bin Yahyā al-Khuzā’ī is reported to have narrated from his father
that he said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
دَخَلْتُ مَعَ أَبِي عَبْدِ اللٌّهِ (ع) عَلَى بَعْضِ مَوَالِيهِ
يَعُودُهُ، فَرَأَيْتُ الرَّجُلَ يُكْثِرُ مِنْ قَوْلِ آهِ. فَقُلْتُ
لَهُ: يَا أَخِي، اذْكُرْ رَبَّكَ وَاسْتَغِثْ بِهِ. فَقَالَ أَبُو
عَبْدِ اللٌّهِ (ع): "آهِ" اسْمٌ مِنْ أَسْمَاءِ اللٌّهِ تَعَالَى،
فَمَنْ قَالَ آهِ، اسْتَغَاثَ بِاللٌّهِ عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“I accompanied Imām al-Sādiq (as) who came to visit one of his [ailing]
slaves, and I saw the slave saying “*āh*” many times. So I said to him:
O my brother, remember your Lord and seek His Support. Thereupon Imām
al-Sādiq (as) said: ‘*Āh* is a Name among the Names of Allāh, and
whosoever says “*āh*” seeks the Help of Allāh, the Invincible and
Majestic.’”[^48]

It should be known that expressing the sensation of pain by employing
the word “*āh*” is in reality expressing one’s poverty and need for
perfection and bodily equilibrium. And it is a known fact that NONE but
the All-Affluent and the Principal Curer (*al-Shāfī*) can relieve the
ailing patient.

Prophet Ibrāhīm (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 وَ إِذَا مَرِضْتُ فَهُوَ يَشْفِينِ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And when I turn sick, then He Alone Cures Me.”***[^49]

Therefore in reality, one is seeking the support of the Almighty, and is
well-aware that no doctor or nurse or anyone whatsoever can relieve him
from any kind of malady independently. Hence by saying ‘Āh’ he is in
reality calling ‘*al-Shāfī*’ (the Curer) or ‘*Ghiyāth al-Mustaghīthīn*’
(the Helper of the Seekers of help) and Allāh is the All-Knowing.

The Suffering Believer in the Garden of Paradise
------------------------------------------------

There are purified souls who have been bestowed with inner vision and
can thus behold the reality of different people. They need not to wait
for the Hereafter to know the inner reality. Almighty Allāh has already
gifted them with the knowledge thereof in this world. One such
personality is Imām ‘Alī (as) who expressed this reality in the
following dictum:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَوْ كُشِفَ الْغِطَاءُ مَا ازْدَدْتُ يَقِيناً.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“If the curtains are unveiled no conviction would be added to what I
have.”[^50]

In other words, nothing among the higher realities such as Paradise and
Hell was hidden for the Imām (as). He could behold things that others
could not.

There is an interesting narrative in which Imām ‘Alī (as) is reported to
have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وُعِكَ أَبُو ذَرٍّ فَأَتَيْتُ رَسُولَ اللٌّهِ (ص) فَقُلْتُ: يَا
رَسُولَ اللٌّهِ! إِنَّ أَبَا ذَرٍّ قَدْ وُعِكَ. فَقَالَ (ص): امْضِ
بِنَا إِلَيْهِ نَعُودُهُ. فَمَضَيْنَا إِلَيْهِ جَمِيعاً، فَلَمَّا
جَلَسْنَا قَالَ رَسُولُ اللٌّهِ (ص): كَيْفَ أَصْبَحْتَ يَا أَبَا
ذَرٍّ. قَالَ: أَصْبَحْتُ وَعِكاً يَا رَسُولَ اللٌّهِ. فَقَالَ (ص):
أَصْبَحْتَ فِي رَوْضَةٍ مِنْ رِيَاضِ الْجَنَّةِ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Abū Dharr [once] fell sick; so I came to the Messenger of Allāh and
said: O Messenger of Allāh, verily Abū Dharr has fallen sick. He said:
let us go to visit him. So, all of us together went to visit him. And
when we sat besides him, the Messenger of Allāh asked him: O Abū Dharr,
how did you confront your morning? He said: I have confronted the
morning in sickness. The Holy Prophet (s) thereupon said: Surely you
have confronted the morning while you are in a garden among the gardens
of Paradise…”[^51]

Here the Holy Prophet (s) beheld the kernel of Abū Dharr’s situation,
and informed him of his higher rank which he could not vision.

Sadaqah - A Powerful Means of Curing the Sick
---------------------------------------------

The human being due to his limited knowledge cannot perceive all the
means to the cure of the different maladies and diseases. Further, since
he or she perceives the world of matter and cannot witness the celestial
realm (*‘ālam al-malakūt*) or beyond that, he or she is oblivious of so
many other ways to the cure of maladies. This is where the important
role of *wahy* (revelation) and Imāmate comes. Those entrusted with
Divine secrets, acknowledging the need of unveiling them, have informed
us of much to learn. With regard to curing the sick, we have traditions
worthy of contemplation. Observe the following:

1. Imām al-Sādiq (as) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
دَاوُوا مَرْضَاكُمْ بِالصَّدَقَةِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Treat your sick by giving *sadaqah*.”[^52]

2. He (as) is also reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ذِكْرُنَا أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ شِفَاءٌ مِنَ الْوَعْكِ وَالاَسْقَامِ
وَوَسْوَاسِ الرَّيْبِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Remembering us the Ahlu’l Bayt (as) is a cure from illness and diseases
as well as from the insinuation of doubt.”[^53]

One should note however that giving *sadaqah* (alms) has some etiquette,
a most important of which is *al-mubāsharah* which means that the sick
person should himself or herself give the sadaqah. Observe the following
tradition:

Imām al-Sādiq (as) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يُسْتَحَبُّ لِلْمَرِيضِ أَنْ يُعْطِيَ السَّائِلَ بِيَدِهِ وَيَأْمُرَ
السَّائِلَ أَنْ يَدْعُوَ لَهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“It is recommended for the sick person to give a beggar with his own
hands and tell him to pray for him.”[^54]

Why are Spiritual Illnesses Worse than Physical Maladies?
---------------------------------------------------------

One of the very important discussions that the *‘ulamā* of *akhlāq*
present in their ethical texts is how spiritual ailments are more
dangerous to the human being than the physical illnesses. Mawlā Muhammad
Narrāqī, the great ethician in his ethical corpus *Jāmi‘* *al-Sa‘ādāt*
says in his introductory discussions on ethics:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اعلم أن الإنسان منقسم إلى سر وعلن، وروح وبدن، ولكل منهما منافيات
وملائمات، وآلام ولذات، ومهلكات ومنجبات. ومنافيات البدن وآلامه هي
الأمراض الجسمانية. وملائماته هي الصحة واللذات الجسمانية. والمتكفل
لبيان تفاصيل هذه الأمراض ومعالجاتها هو علم الطب. ومنافيات الروح وآلامه
هي رذائل الأخلاق التي تهلكه وتشقيه. وصحته رجوعه إلى فضائلها التي تسعده
وتنجيه، وتوصله إلى مجاورة أهل اللّه ومقربيه. والمتكفل لبيان هذه
الرذائل ومعالجاتها هو (علم الأخلاق). ثم إن البدن مادي فانٍ، والروح
مجردٌ باقٍ، فإن اتصف بشرائف الصفات كان في البهجة والسعادة أبداً، وإن
اتصف برذائلها كان في العذاب والشقاوة مخلداً...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Know that the human being is divided into “the kernel” (*sirr*) and
“the apparent” (*‘alan*) and [or in other words] “the spirit” and “the
body” and for each of these two dimensions there are incompatibilities
(*munāfiyāt*) and compatibilities (*mulāyimāt*), pains and pleasures,
elements of destruction and salvation. The incompatibilities of the body
and its pains are the physical illnesses whereas its compatibilities are
good health and physical pleasures. And the discipline that caters to
expound the details of these illnesses and their treatments is medicine.
And the incompatibilities of the soul and its pains are bad
characteristics that destroy it and make it wretched, and its wellbeing
is to return towards good morals that bring it felicity and emancipate
it and make it attain the neighborhood of the people of God and His Near
ones, and the discipline that caters to expound these evil
characteristics and their treatment is the discipline of ethics. Then it
should be known that the body is material and prone to destruction,
whereas the spirit and soul is eternal, and therefore if the soul
characterizes itself with noble qualities it would be in the state of
joy and felicity forever, but were it to characterize itself with evil
ethics it would be in the state of punishment and wretchedness
forever….”[^55]

Therefore since the spirit has always to remain, one should be very
careful and purify it before it is too late. The material body on the
other hand would have to stay in this world and probably turn into earth
after burial.

Spiritual Illnesses Is The Principal Cause
------------------------------------------

If one were to understand the aim of human life, the gravity of
spiritual sickness over physical sickness would become more apparent. In
fact, if we painstakingly ponder over the causes of the different
illnesses, we would come to realize that the principal cause of many of
the physical illnesses stem from spiritual illnesses, either from
oneself or from others: sometimes the source of physical illnesses is
oneself, sometimes others, and at times, a product of cooperation with
others. An example of the first is when a person has no sense of
temperance and allows his faculty of desire to prevail over his faculty
of intellect, and engages in overindulgence in eating, copulation, etc.
Such a lifestyle would be replete with illnesses. Sometimes however, you
are invited to a friend’s house and served with delicious food, but
because your friend did not observe some religious or hygienic
precautions while cooking, you turn ill. If you are invited by one who,
for example, does not care whether the meat he buys is from a believer
or non believer or whether he earns through lawful or unlawful means,
you would undoubtedly be affected spiritually. This can then be a basis
for immoderation, which would lead to physical illnesses. An example of
the third situation is when genetically made food is produced, and you
show your cooperation in purchasing the same. Here the fault is both
yours and the producer’s. If your purchase is due to your mundane
attachments and you know that the producer’s aim is nothing but to
satisfy his capitalistic demands, you would have cooperated with him to
cause physical illnesses in your self. Here greed and avarice enveloped
your intellect and you were led to physical illnesses. However, if the
circumstances are such that you have to cope with these foods and you
have no option, then you remain in danger of the physical illnesses but
can be free from spiritual maladies.

The Traveling Physician
-----------------------

Imām ‘Alī (as) is reported to have described the Prophet (s) in the
following manner in one of his sermons compiled in the *Nahju’l
Balāghah*:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
طَبِيبٌ دَوَّارٌ بِطِبِّهِ، قَدْ أَحْكَمَ مَرَاهِمَهُ، وَأَحْمَى
مَوَاسِمَهُ، يَضَعُ ذٌلِكَ حَيْثُ الْحَاجَةُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ قُلُوبٍ
عُمْيٍ وَآذَانٍ صُمٍّ وَأَلْسِنَةٍ بُكْمٍ، مُتَتَبِّعٌ بِدَوَائِهِ
مَوَاضِعَ الْغَفْلَةِ وَمَوَاطِنَ الْحَيْرَةِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“The Prophet (s) was like a traveling physician who has set ready his
ointments and heated his instruments. He uses them wherever the need
arises for curing blind hearts, deaf ears, and dumb tongues. He went
with his medicines to the places of negligence and places of
perplexity.”[^56]

One of the excellent methods of treating the ailing ones is to go to
them for treatment. Amīr al-Mu’minīn ‘Alī (as) calls the Holy Prophet
(s) طَبِيْبٌ دَوَّارٌ بِطِبِّهِ *tabībun dawārun bitibbih*- A traveling
physician. Physicians who deal with the human body normally treat others
in return for payment. This is because it is a means of their
livelihood. Nevertheless, not all physicians have the same financial
status. Whereas some work in certain hospitals or clinics, others own
hospitals and clinics themselves. There are different poverty-stricken
areas in the world where due to indigence, people do not have the
privilege of getting treated from illnesses. Physicians who truly have
concern for all the poor to get cured would either personally arrange a
team of doctors to visit the area, and thereafter treat the various
patients, or if resources do not permit, try to form a friendly circle
of doctors who would voluntarily contribute what they can. By visiting
these poverty-stricken areas, not only would they practically show their
concern for the ailing ones, but also practise the Prophet’s way of life
in the physical dimension. Hence, although this beautiful narrative of
Imām ‘Alī (as) refers to the spiritual dimension, it can also be applied
in the life of the physicians of the body too.

A very interesting narrative is reported in the historical text al-Sīrah
al-Nabawiyyah of Ibn Hishām, where the practical import of Imām ‘Alī’s
(as) statement is brilliantly reflected. Ibn Hishām quotes Ibn Ishāq to
have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَكَانَ رَسُولُ اللٌّهِ (ص) يَعْرُضُ نَفْسَهُ فِي الْمَوَاسِمِ إذاَ
كَانَتْ عَلى قَبَائِلِ العَرَبِ، يَدْعُوْهُمْ إِلـى اللٌّهِ،
وَيُخْبِرُهُمْ أَنَّه نَبيٌّ مُرْسَلٌ، وَيَسْئَلُهُمْ أَنْ
يُصَدِّقُوْهُ…
  </p>
</blockquote>

“The Messenger of Allāh (s) would present himself to [to the people] in
[different] occasions; and when he would confront the Arabs, he would
invite them to Allāh, inform them that He is an Apostle of Allāh, and
seek their verification….”[^57]

And in the same book Ibn Ishāq is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَحَدَّثَنِيْ حُسين بن عَبْدِ اللٌّهِ بن عُبَيْدِ اللٌّهِ بن عَبَّاسِ،
قاَلَ: سَمِعْتُ رَبِيْعَة بن عباد، يُحَدِّثُهُ أَبِي: قال إِنِّي
لَغُلاَمٌ شَابٌّ مَعَ أَبِي بمنى، وَ رَسُولُ اللٌّهِ (ص) يَقِفُ عَلى
مَنَازِلِ الْقَبَائِلِ مِنَ الْعَرَبِ، فَيَقُوْلُ: يَا بَنِي فُلان،
إنِّي رَسُوْلُ اللٌّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ، يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَنْ تَعْبُدُو اللٌّهَ
وَلاَ تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئاً، وَ اَنْ تَخْلَعُوْا مَا تَعْبُدُونَ
مِنْ دُوْنِهِ مِنْ هٌذِهِ الأَنْدَادِ، وَاَنْ تُأْمِنُوا بِي،
وَتُصَدِّقُوْا بِيْ، وَتَمْنَعُوْنِي حَتّى أُبَيِّنُ عَنِ اللٌّهِ مَا
بَعَثَنِيْ بِهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

“‘Ubaydullāh bin’Abbās narrates: I saw my father telling Rabī‘a bin
‘Ubbād: “During my youth I was once together with my father in Minā; I
observed that the Holy Prophet (s) would visit the different tents
(*manāzil*) of the Arabs, and say: ‘O children of such and such
personality, certainly I am a Messenger of Allāh towards you, who
invites you to worship Allāh and that you must not associate anyone with
Him, and renounce the [imaginary] partners that you worship other than
Him, and believe in Me and accept me and protect me so that I may
expound for you from Allāh that which He has sent me with.’”[^58]

It is interesting to note that in his propagation to Banū ‘Āmir, a
person called Firās bin ‘Abdillāh is reported to have said about him:’I
swear by Allāh, if I would have this youth from Quraysh, I would have
ruled over the Arabs by him. Thereafter addressing the Holy Prophet (s)
he said that we can only pay our oath of allegiance to you on the
condition that you make me your successor after you. Here was a very
sensitive moment. If the Holy Prophet (s) was merely after gaining
support of his personal fame, he would have consented to this
transaction. But it was not a matter of personal interests. The Holy
Prophet (s) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَلأَمْرُ إِلـى اللٌّهِ يَضَعُ حَيْثُ يَشَاء...
  </p>
</blockquote>

“The matter is with Allāh, He would place in whoever’s hand He
wishes…”[^59]

As a result, they did not listen to the Holy Prophet (s) and remained
adamant in their disbelief.

Our *muballighūn* should emulate this highly important tradition of the
Holy Prophet (s) within their own limitations. There is a law, we must
understand, which prevails all the verses of this supplication:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللٌّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Allāh does not burden a soul save what it can bear.”***[^60]

Hence, each one of us is responsible according to his or her abilities.
The resourceful, for example, would undertake great ventures to
disseminate Islam in different parts of the world, and thus try to treat
the maladies of the spiritually sick, whereas those who have limited
resources could struggle to do the most from the least that they have at
their disposal. There is another very beautiful law in the holy Qur’ān
that implicitly tells us how to make advantage of the limited resources
at our disposal. The secret is ‘struggle.’ The lazy carpenter by making
small things, would worry about his financial status and perhaps seek
unlawful means, but the diligent carpenter who possesses the similar
tools would struggle hard and increase his tools so that he can produce
better wooden items and develop himself financially. The Holy Qur’ān
says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 وَ أَنْ لَيْسَ لِلإِنْسَانِ إِلاَّ مَا سَعــى 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And there is nothing for man save that which he strives
for.”***[^61]

We should remember that the extent of the struggle would reflect the
firmness of our resolution to assist the ailing ones and the intensity
of our concern for their well-being.

How Can We Contribute in Dispelling Illnesses from Others?
----------------------------------------------------------

It should be well understood by now that seeking the well-being of
others is not limited to prayer only. Our contributions would vary
according to the ability that we have. Further, we should understand how
grave is our need for spiritual well-being. Therefore, we should not be
oblivious of this fundamental and decisive dimension of the human
beings.

Those who can create conditions that would obliterate illnesses from the
society are responsible to do the needful, those who can assist others
in guiding them to observe precaution before they suffer dangerous
illnesses have the duty to do so, those who can financially afford to
assist others in getting their sickness treated should take the noble
step of doing so; and those who do not have any of the preceding status
due their limited powers, are expected to pray for the ailing and visit
them as well. For those who have more power, they are required to play a
greater role in all the areas that determine the treatment of the ailing
ones.

As we humbly pray to Allāh for the well-being of everyone, we should not
forget ourselves, for although we may enjoy very good physical health,
but have we tried to diagnose ourselves spiritually yet? Are we sure
that we do not suffer from any of the spiritual illnesses? Is spiritual
illness so insignificant due to the absence of any immediate physical
pain? If one looks at the depth of the matter, he or she would realize
that eternal salvation is entirely dependent on the spiritual well-being
of a person.

Our prayers should be continual. This is because persistence in prayer
is a corollary of “true concern”. One who has no concern would not be
persistent in his prayer. In fact, as we said in our introduction to the
first volume of this commentary, du’a is a reflection of one’s true
state. There is complete harmony between one’s spirit and the prayer
that one utters.
