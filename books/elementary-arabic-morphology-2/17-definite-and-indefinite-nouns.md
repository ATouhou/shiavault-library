=============================

125. How many types of definite nouns are there?

126. How is an indefinite noun made definite?

123. An indefinite noun is a noun that is common amongst a certain
species, not specific to any one of the instances. For example:
**قَلَمٌ** (pen) and **بُستانٌ** (garden).

124. A definite noun is a noun that indicates a specific instance from a
species. For example: **القَلَمُ** (the pen) and **البُستانُ**

125. There are six forms of definite nouns:

• Proper nouns: **سلیمان** (Solomon)

• Pronouns: **أنا** (I)

• Demonstrative pronouns: **هذا** (this)

• conjuncts: **الذي** (he who)

• Made definite by a *alif-lām*: **الرجل** (the man)

• Compliment of a prefixed noun : **کتابُ** **الرجل** (The man's book)

126. A common noun is made definite in the following ways:

• if an *alif-lām* is added to it (and the nunation is erased if it was
nunated). For example: **کتابٌ** (a book) becomes **الکتابُ** (the
book).

• if it is contracted with a definite noun (and the nunation is erased
if it was nunated). For example: **کتابي** (my book).
