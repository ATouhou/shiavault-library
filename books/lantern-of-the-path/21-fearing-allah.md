Fearing Allah
=============

   
 Close the gates of your limbs and senses to all that will harm your
heart, remove your standing with Allah, and bring in its wake grief and
regret on the Day of Judgement and shame about the evil actions you
committed.  
    
 The scrupulous person must have three principles: he should overlook
the faults of all people, he should avoid offending them, and he should
balance censure with praise.  
    
 The basis of fearing Allah is to constantly take the self to account,
to be truthful in one's words and pure in one's transactions, to leave
every doubtful thing, to abandon every defect and doubt, to separate
oneself from all which does not concern you and not to open doors which
you will not know how to close.  
    
 Do not sit with anyone who obscures what is clear for you, nor with
someone who takes the faith lightly. Do not question knowledge which
your heart has no capacity for, and which you will not understand, of
whoever said it, and cut off anyone who cuts you off from Allah.
