أَللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْنِي عِنْدَكَ وَجِيهاً بِالْحُسَيْنِ فِي الدُّنْيا

“O’ Allah! Make me worthy of respect with You through Husayn, peace be
upon him, both in the transient world and also the next life.”  
 The status which we have – either in this world, or the next, is in
accordance to our level of Taqwa which can only be developed through a
consciousness and awareness of Allah. The best way to develop this Taqwa
is obviously to have perfect role models to follow who can bring us
closer to His presence – who better than the Messenger of Islam and his
Ahlul Bayt?

In this case, we refer to the character and persona of Imam Husayn and
use him as our guide and teacher to Allah. In this part of the Ziyarat
we address Allah and say to him that it is through Imam Husayn and our
spiritual connection with him that we desire respect and honour in
Allah’s presence – both in this world and the next!

Truly if we were not followers of the Prophet of Islam and his Divinely
appointed successors, we would not be worthy of having respect shown to
us by Allah as these personalities are the ‘rope of Allah’ which He has
stretched forth for His servants.
