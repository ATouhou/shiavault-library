Lesson 53: The Prayer for the Deceased (Salat al-Mayyit)
========================================================

*Salat al-mayyit* is *wajib al-kifa’i*, i.e. it is obligatory on every
Muslim but as soon as it is performed correctly by one of them, it
remains no more obligatory on others; but if no one offers the prayer
everyone is a sinner.  
 If the deceased was six years old, the prayer for the deceased is
obligatory. In offering this prayer, purity of the body or dress is not
necessary; also *ghusl*, *wudhu* or *tayammum* is not obligatory. But
the intention of the prayer (*niyyah*) and facing qibla is essential.
The dead body should be placed in such a way that the head of the
deceased remains on the right of those who offer the prayer. In the case
of the dead body of a male, the Imam should stand near his waist; and in
the case of a female, near the chest.  
 Prayer of deceased has 5 *takbirs* (including *Takbiratul-Ihram*).  
 After the first *takbir* (i.e., *takbiratul-ihram*) the *Kalima
al-shahadatayn* is recited. After 2nd the *takbir*, *salawat* is
recited. After the 3rd *takbir*, prayer is offered for all the believers
and Muslims. After the 4th *takbir*, prayer is offered especially for
the deceased one. Then the 5th *takbir* is said And the prayer comes to
end.

The shortest method of offering this prayer is as follows:

*Niyyah*: I pray *Salat al-mayyit* of this corpse *Wajib*, *qurbatan
ilal-Laah*. *Allahu Akbar*;  
*Ashhadu an-la ilaha illallahu wahdahu la sharika lah; Wa Ashhadu Anna
Muhammadan*  
*Abduhu wa Rasuluh;*  
*Allahu Akbar;*  
*Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammadin wa Aali Muhammad; Allahu Akbar;*  
*Allahummaghfir li’l Mu’minina wa’l Mu’minaat; Allahu Akbar;*  
*Allahummaghfir li haadha’l mayyit* (In case the deceased is a female,
say *Allahummaghfir li haadhihi’l mayyit*);  
*Allahu Akbar*;  
 After the completion of the prayer recite "*Rabbana aatina fid-dunya
hasanatan wa fi’l aakhera hasanatan waqina adhaban-naar.*"  
 It is necessary to mention that even if this prayer is offered by
*jama’ah*, everyone has to recite the whole prayer. It is not correct
just to say *'Allahu Akbar'* and remain silent between the *takbirs*.
Such a prayer is invalid (*batil*).
