CHAPTER X: HIS COMPANIONS AND THE REPORTERS OF HIS TRADITIONS (01)
==================================================================

Imam Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir) took great care of spreading knowledge among
the people. He spared no effort to educate his companions. He taught
them jurisprudence and sciences. So, they became prominent jurisprudents
in the Islamic world. Imam al-Baqir asked his son, Imam Ja‘far al-Sadiq,
to spend money on them to devote themselves to record the traditions
they heard from him. Imam Ja‘far al-Sadiq, peace be on him, lauded his
father’s companions. Addressing his companions, he said: “By Allah, my
father’s companions were better than you. They were leaves without
thorns while you are thorns without leaves.”[^1]

We will mention al-Baqir’s Companions and give a brief study about each
of them. They are as follows:

1. Aban bin Taghlub
-------------------

Aban bin Taghlub al-Rib’ï al-Kufi was among the most brilliant Moslem
scholars. He was among the most prominent Moslem jurisprudents. We will
talk about some of his affairs:

### His Birth and his early Life

###

He was born in Kufa, but our books have not mentioned the year of his
birth. He grew up in Kufa, the capital of the Shi‘ites. He was obedient
to the members of the house (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them, and loved
them very much.

### His Scientific Position

###

He was among the most prominent and brilliant scholars of his time. He
reported traditions on the authority of Imam ‘Ali b. al-Husayn, Abu
Ja‘far, and Abu ‘Abd Allah, peace be on them. He had priority and
importance with them. Imam Abu Ja‘far said to him: “Sit down in the
Mosque of Medina. Give religious opinions to the people. I like to see
persons similar to you among my Shi‘ites.”[^2]

Aban was the foremost in all techniques of sciences of the Koran,
jurisprudence, tradition, literature, language, and grammar.[^3]

### His Obedience to the ahl al-Bayt

###

Aban was very obedient to the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace
be on them. He learned their sciences and morals and proclaimed them
among the people. That was at the time when the love for them was among
the most intense disasters. For the Umayyads spared no effort to punish
those who loved the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on
them, and proclaimed their outstanding merits. However, Aban habituated
himself to that. So, he suffered persecutions for them. His love for ahl
al-Bayt was based on reason and proof, not on sentiments. He thought
that the outstanding merits and high positions of the Companions (of the
Prophet) were conditional on the obedience to the members of the House
(ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them. ‘Abd al-Rahman b. al-Hajjaj reported.
He said: “We were at the assembly of Aban b. Taghlub. Suddenly, a young
man came and said to him:

“O Abu Sa‘ïd, tell me. How many of the Companions of the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and his family, followed ‘Ali b. Abï Talib?”

Aban understood the young man’s purpose. So, he asked him:

“Do you want to know the outstanding merits of ‘Ali through the
Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family, who
followed?”

“Yes,” the young man replied.

Aban answered him with the answer of the one who was aware of the right
of Imam ‘Ali, the Commander of the faithful, peace be on him. He said:

“By Allah we have not known their outstanding merits but through
obedience to him.”[^4]

Aban passed by some people. The people blamed him, for he reported on
the authority of Imam Ja‘far, peace be on him. So, he mocked at them,
saying:

“Why do you blame me for my reporting on the authority of the man whom I
asked about every thing, and he said: ‘Allah’s Apostle, may Allah bless
him and his family, said.’?”

### His Reliability

###

Aban was very pious. He devoted himself to the religion. Al-‘Ajali said:
“Aban was reliable.”[^5] Ahmed b. Hanbal, b. Na‘ïm and Abu Hatam
regarded him as reliable. The proof for his reliability is that the
Imams, peace be on them, praised him. Salïm b. Abu Habba reported. He
said: “I was with Abu ‘Abd Allah, peace be on him. Before I saw him off,
I had said to him: I want you to supply me.” So, he said: “Go to Aban b.
Taghlub. For he has heard many traditions from me. What he narrates to
you, then narrate it on my authority.”[^6]

Safwan b. Yahya reported on the authority of Aban b. ‘Uthman on the
authority of Abu ‘Abd Allah, peace be on him, who said: “Aban b. Taghlub
received thirty thousand traditions on my authority, then report them on
my authority.”[^7]

Aban b. Mohammed b. Aban reported. He said: [I heard my father say] “My
father and I came to Abu ‘Abd Allah, peace be on him. When Abu ‘Abd
Allah saw my father, he ordered a cushion to be brought for him. The
cushion was brought for him. Then he shook hand with him and embraced
him and greeted him.”[^8]

When Aban came to Medina, the people gathered about him, and the
praying-place of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family, was
emptied for him.[^9]

Al-Dhahabi said: “Aban was a steadfast Shi‘ite. However, he was
truthful. His truthfulness is for us. His heresy is for him.”[^10] Some
people defamed him for his love for the members of the House (ahl
al-Bayt), peace be on them. Al-Jawzani said: “Aban was deviated (from
the truth). His doctrine was dispraised.”[^11] Such a group of people
regarded the love for the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be
on them, as deviation from the truth. Without doubt, the love for the
members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them, is part of Islam.
Whoever denies them denies Islam. Whoever loves them believes in Islam.

### His Books

###

As for his books, they show his wide knowledge and sciences. The
following are some of them:

1. Tafsïr Gharïb al-Qur’an. He mentioned some examples from poetry
concerning it. Then ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Mohammed al-Azdi al-Kufi gathered
in one book the book of Aban, of Mohammed b. al-Saiyib al-Kalbi, and of
b. Rawaq b. ‘Atiya b. al-Harth.

2. Al-Fada’il.[^12]

3. Al-Usool fi al-Ruwaiya ‘ala Madhhab al-Shï‘a.[^13]

### His Death

###

Aban died in the year 264 A.H.[^14] This is a mistake. For he died in
the year 141 A.H. When Imam al-Sadiq, peace be on him, heard of his
death, he became very sad. He praised him, saying: “By Allah, the death
of Aban b. Taghlub has hurt my heart.”[^15] Abu al-Bilad said: “The
death of Aban was a disaster for all Shi‘ites everywhere.”[^16]

Indeed Aban was the most knowledgeable of the Moslem main figures in the
religion. So, his death was among the heaviest disasters that hit Islam.

2. Aban bin Abï ‘Ayyash Fayruz
------------------------------

Shaykh al-Tusi numbered him as one of the companions of Imam al-Baqir,
peace be on him. He said that Aban was a weak narrator who belonged to
the next generation.[^17] Ibn al-Ghada’iri said: “Aban bin Abï ‘Ayyash
was a narrator who belonged to the next generation. He reported on the
authority of Anas b. Malik. He reported on the authority of ‘Ali b.
al-Husayn, peace be on him. He was weak. No one pays attention to
him.”[^18] A large group of the traditionists regarded him as weak.

Yazïd b. Harun said: [Shu‘ba said:] “If b.‘Ayyash did not narrate false
traditions, I would give my garments to the poor as alms.”[^19] Shu‘ba
said: “To drink from my donkey’s urine is more lovable with me than to
say: Aban relates to me.”[^20]

Many main traditionists dispraised and refused his traditions.

### His Death

###

Aban bin Abï ‘Ayyash Fayruz died in the year 128 A. H. It was said that
he died in a year other than this.[^21]

the retainer of b. ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Atfan. He was given the kunya of Abu

Hammad b. ‘Isa and others reported the book.

Ibn al-Ghada’iri regarded Ibrahim as a weak narrator. However, our
Professor said: “Ibrahim is reliable, for al-Najashi regarded him as
reliable, and al-Qummi mentioned him in his chain of authorities.[^30]

11. Ibrahim bin Mohammed
------------------------

He was called al-Madani. Al-Najashi said: “Ibrahim reported on the
authority of Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir) and Abu ‘Abd Allah (al-Sadiq), peace
be on them. He devoted his life to them. For this reason, the non-Shi‘a
regard him as a weak narrator.

“Some of our companions narrated on the authority of the non-Shi‘a:
‘Al-Waqidi plagiarized the books of Ibrahim b. Mohammed b. Abu
Yahya.’”[^31] Ibn Hajar slandered him. It was reported on the authority
of b. Abu Maryam, who said: [I heard Yahya say:] “Ibrahim had three
qualities: He was a liar. He was a fatalist. He was a Rafidite.”[^32]

Al-Shafi‘i regarded Ibrahim as a reliable narrator, and reported on his

and Zarara b. A‘yun.” Dauwd b. Sarhan reported. He said: [I heard Abu
‘Abd Allah (al-Sadiq), peace be on him, say:] “I relate traditions to my
companions. I prevent them from analogy. Then they leave me. They
explain my traditions contrary to my explanations. I have ordered a
group of them to talk. Meanwhile I have prevented another group from
talking. However, both groups explain my traditions according to their
explanations. So, they disobey Allah, the Most High, and His Apostle. If
my companions had listened and obeyed, I would have supplied them with
knowledge as my father did. My father’s companions were an ornament
before and after their death. I mean Zarara, Mohammed b. Moslem, Layth
al-Muradi, and Barïd al-‘Ajali. It is they who are just and
truthful.”[^86] Other narrations praised Barïd. They showed his high

non-Shi‘a (‘amma) say that the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr pleased
Allah, the Glorified, when the people assembled, and that Allah would
not divide the community of Mohammed, may Allah bless him and his
family, after him.” So, al-Baqir, peace be on him, said: “Do they not
recite Allah’s Book? Does Allah not say: ‘And Mohammed is no more than
an Apostle. The apostles have already passed away before him. If then he
dies or is killed, will you turn back upon your heels? And whoever turns
back upon his heels,

he will by no means do harm to Allah in the least. And Allah will reward
the grateful.’?” Thabit said: “They explain the verse in another way.”
So, al-Baqir, peace be on him, said: “Has Allah not told them about the
past communities, who disagreed with each other after the clear proofs
had come to them? In this connection He said: ‘We gave clear Miracles to
Jesus, son of Mary. And We strengthened him with the holy spirit. And if
Allah had pleased, those after them would not have fought one with
another after clear arguments had come to them. However, they disagreed.
So, there were some of them who believed and others who denied. And if
Allah had pleased they would not have fought with one another. However,
Allah brings about what He intends.’”[^127] This is evidence for that
the Companions of Mohammed disagreed after him.[^128]

them, on the authority of Allah’s Apostle, may Allah less him and his
family, who said: “The stars of the sky are safety for the people of the
sky. If the stars of the sky went away, abominable events would come to
the people of the sky. The members of my family are safety for the
people of the earth. If the members of my family went away, abominable
events would come to the people of the earth.”[^129] Some people said

81. Thuwayr bin Abï Fakhta
--------------------------

Al-Najashi said: “Thuwayr bin Abï Fakhta was called Abu al-Jahm al-Kufi.
The real name of Abï Fakhta was Sa’ïd b. ‘Illaqa. He reported on the
authority of his father. He was the retainer of Umm Hani, daughter of
Abu Talib.[^130] Shaykh al-Tusi numbered him as one of the companions of
Imam ‘Ali b. al-Husayn, peace be on him, and of Imam Imam al-Baqir,
peace be on him.[^131]

Thuwayr reported the following: “I went out to perform the pilgrimage
(to Mecca). ‘Amru b. Dharr al-Qadi (the judge), b. Qays al-Masir,
al-Salt b. Bahram accompanied me. They said that they wrote four
thousand problems to ask Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir), peace be on them. That
made me sad. When we entered Medina, we separated. I went to Abu Ja‘far
(al-Baqir), peace be on him and said to him: ‘May I be ransom for you,
b. Dharr, b. Qays al-Masir, and al-Salt accompanied me. I heard them
say: ‘We have written four thousand problems. We will ask Abu Ja‘far
(al-Baqir) about them.’ I became sad. So, Abu Ja‘far said: ‘What made
you sad? When they come to me, let them enter.’ On the following day, a
retainer of Abu Ja‘far, peace be on him, came in and said: ‘May I be
ransom for you, b. Dharr a long with a group of people are at the door.’
So, Abu Ja‘far said to me: ‘ Abu Ja‘far said to me: ‘Thuwayr, go and ask
them to come.’ So, I went and asked them to come. When they entered,
they greeted the Imam and sat down. They were silent for a long time.
So, Abu Ja‘far spoke first to them. Still, they were silent. When Abu
Ja‘far knew that, he said to his slave-girl called Jariya: ‘Bring the
food-cloth.’ She brought it and spread it over. Then Abu Ja‘far said:
‘Praise belongs to Allah, Who has set precepts for all things. For
example, this food-cloth has precepts.’ So, b. Dharr asked Abu Ja‘far:
“What are its precepts?”

“When it is put, Allah should be mentioned. When it is raised, Allah
should be thanked,” replied Abu Ja‘far.

Then the Imam asked them to have the food. Then he ordered his
slave-girl to bring him water. She brought him a jug of water. So, he
said: “Praise belongs to Allah, Who has set precepts for all things. For
example, this jug has precepts.”

“What are its precepts?” asked b. Dharr.

“One should mention Allah’s name before drinking. He should thank Allah
after drinking. He should not drink out of its handle, nor should he
drink out of a hole in it,” replied the Imam.

When they had finished eating their food, the Imam, peace be on him,
asked them about the traditions. However, they were silent. So, the Imam
asked b. Dharr: “Do you not tell us about some of our traditions?”

Bin Dharr replied: “Yes, son of Allah’s Apostle, Allah’s Apostle, may
Allah bless him and his family, said: ‘I leave behind me among you two
things, if you cleave to them, you will never go astray-that is the Book
of Allah and my offspring from my family.’”

“Bin Dharr, you will meet Allah’s Apostle, may Allah bless him and his
family. He will ask about his family. What will you say to him?” asked
Imam Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir), peace be on him.

So, b. Dharr wept, and then he said: “As for the Book of Allah, we tore
it. As for the members of the Prophet’s family, we killed them.”

Abu Ja‘far said: “Bin Dharr, with that you will tell him the truth. On
the Day of Judgment, you will be asked: Where had you finished your
lifetime? From where had you earned your money? On what had you spent
it? Had you loved the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt)?”

Then they left the house of the Imam, peace be on him. The Imam ordered
his retainer to follow them to hear their words. The retainer returned
and said to the Imam: [I heard them say to b. Dharr:] “Why did we come
with you?” Then b. Dharr answered them: “Woe unto you! Keep silent. I
did not think that Allah would ask about al-Baqir’s authority. I was
unable to ask him, for he knows the religious rules of the food-cloth
and of the jug.”[^132]

82. Jabir bin ‘Abd Allah
------------------------

He was the son of ‘Amru b. Huzam al-Ansari al-Khazraji. He was a
prominent companion of al-Baqir. He was among the excellent Moslems. He
devoted his life to the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on
them. He was the last survival Companion of the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and his family. Abu al-Zubayr al-Makki reported on his authority. He
said: “I asked Jabir b. ‘Abd Allah about ‘Ali b. Abï Talib. So, he
raised his eye brows from his eyes, and then he said: ‘He was the best
of all mankind. By Allah, during the lifetime of Allah’s Apostle, we
knew the hypocrites through their detest towards him.’”[^133]

Jabir loved the Commander of the faithful, peace be on him, very much.
So, he leant on his rod and walked through the streets of Medina. He
said: “‘Ali is the best of all mankind. Whoever denies that is
unbeliever. O People of Ansar, educate your children to love
‘Ali.”[^134]

Jabir was very obedient to the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace
be on them. So, Imam al-Sadiq, peace be on him, reported on the
authority of his grandfathers. He said: “Allah revealed this verse: ‘Say
I demand not, of you any reward for it (the toils of preaching) except
the love of my relations.’ Then Allah’s Apostle, may Allah bless him and
his family rose and said: ‘A right for me has been imposed on you. Will
you pay it to me?’ No one answered him, so he went away. On the
following day, he stood up and asked the same question. No one answered
him, so he left them and went away. On the third day, he also asked the
same question. Then he explained: ‘The right is not gold nor silver nor
food nor a drink.’ ‘Therefore, say it,’ they demanded. ‘Allah has
revealed these Words of His: ‘Say I demand not, of you any reward for it
(the toils of preaching) except the love of my relations.’ ‘This is the
best right,’ they said” Then Abu ‘Abd Allah (al-Sadiq), peace be on him,
said: “By Allah, no one was loyal to this right except seven persons.
They are Salman, Abu Dharr, ‘Ammar, al-Muqdad b. al-Aswad, Jabir b. ‘Abd
Allah al-Ansari, the retainer of Allah’s Apostle (may Allah bless him
and his family), and Zayd b. Arqam.”[^135]

Jabir took part in eighteen campaigns headed by the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and his family. He took part in the Battle of Siffin headed by
the Commander of the faithful, peace be on him.[^136] It was he who
recited the greetings of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his
family, to Imam al-Baqir

The Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family, asked Allah twenty-five
times to forgive Jabir.[^137] Jabir held a seminar of knowledge in the
mosque.[^138] He died at the age of ninty-four.[^139]

83. Jabir bin Yazïd
-------------------

He was called al-Ju‘fi. He was among the main religious scholars. He was
among the greatest jurists of the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt),
peace be on them. He came to Imam Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir), peace be on
him. He learnt many sciences from him, so he became among the foremost
Moslem religious scholars. When he reported anything on the authority of
Imam Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir), peace be on him, he said: “The trustee of
the trustees (of the Apostle) and the heir of the knowledge of the
prophets, Mohammed b. ‘Ali (al-Baqir), peace be on him, told me.”[^140]
Ibn Shahrashub numbered him as a door to the sciences and secrets of
Imam Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir), peace be on him.

It was reported on the authority of Imam al-Sadiq, peace be on him, who
said: “He was called Jabir because he helped (jabar) the believers with
his knowledge. He is an inexhaustible sea. He is the door (to knowledge)
at his time. He is the proof over the creatures. Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir),
peace be on him, is among Allah’s proof.”

It was said that four persons encompassed the knowledge of Imams, peace
be on them. They were Salman al-Farisi, Jabir b. Yazïd, Sayyid
al-Himyari, and Younis b. ‘Abd al-Rahman.

related to us or I heard (from him). So, he was among the most reliable

people.’” Zuhayr b. Mu‘awiya said: “He (Jabir) was among the most
truthful people.”[^141] Wakï‘ said : “Jabir was reliable.”[^142] Sufyan
al-Thawri said to Shu‘ba: “If you talk about Jabir, we will not talk
with you about him.”[^143] Sufyan said: “Jabir al-Ju‘fi is the most
pious person in the tradition.”[^144]

### His Mental Disorder

###

Hisham b. ‘Abd al-Malik ordered his Governor over Kufa to send him
Jabir. Imam Abu Ja‘far, peace be on him, ordered Jabir to pretend
insanity. So, Jabir went out wearing a cane container. Thus, the people
said: “Jabir has become crazy.” The Governor asked the people about
Jabir. They testified that he had become crazy. The Governor informed
Hisham of that. So, Hisham did not mistreat him. Then Jabir refrain from
the precautionary insanity.[^147]
