Foreword
========

Sheikh al-Mufid wrote nearly 194 books and treatises, out of which few
have survived passage of time, and meticulously planned destruction of
the Shi’ah resources. Among the surviving ones, we have his
"**Al-Amaali**" which is also known as "**Al-Majaalis**". His student
al-Najashi has mentioned it as "**Al-Amaali Al-Mutafarriqaat**".

These were sessions held in the month of Ramadhan where al-Mufid read
the traditions giving the chain of narration ending up to himself and
the students wrote them down. Those who were absent wrote down from the
recording of their colleagues, and then got it ratified by reading the
text over to him.

The session began in the month of Ramadhan, 404 Hijra at the residence
of one of his students Dhamrah Abul Hasan ‘Ali ibn Muhammad Ibn Abd al
Rahman al-Farsi who lived in Baghdad. It ended in the month of Ramadhan
411 Hijra, just two years before his death. It has 42 sessions of
varying durations.

With his profound insight of the subject matter, familiarity with all
the other works of the author, and mastery of both Arabic and English
languages, Mulla Asgharali M.M.Jaffer has renderd this work with much
flair and lucidity. The comprehesive contents pages with subject
subtitles will make this a useful publication for the lay reader as well
as the serious researcher. We hope that this first attempt at publishing
the translation of an ancient resource on Hadith will be well
received.
