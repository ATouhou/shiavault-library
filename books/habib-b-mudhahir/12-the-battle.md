The Battle
==========

Yazeed's army began attacking Imam Husayn's army, throwing many arrows
at them.

Imam Husayn [a] said to his companions:

Good companions, stand up for death!

The two sides met for the first time in a small clash. The clash was
over and the Imam's companions came back to their places.

Then Yazeed's Army launched savage attacks against the Imam Husayn's
companions.

Imam Husayn's companions resisted the attacks bravely. Some of them fell
over the ground and died martyrs for the Prophet's grandson.
