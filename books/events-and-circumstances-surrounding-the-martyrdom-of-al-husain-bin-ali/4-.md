Yazid's succession to Mu’awiya and the letters sent to al-Husayn
After the destruction of Hujr, the Shi'a in al-Kufa took al-Husayn's
advice and went underground. It has already been noted that by demanding
the cursing of 'Ali, Mu'awiya was breaking the spirit of the concord he
had reached with al-Hasan. He was to break another article of that
agreement by appointing his son Yazid as his successor. Al-Husayn
resolutely refused to pledge allegiance to Yazid. After Mu'awiya's
death, al-Husayn left Medina and went to Mecca in order to avoid paying
homage to Yazid18 .

The Shi'a in Iraq, particularly al-Kufa, saw this as an opportunity to
escape from Syrian domination and give back to al-Kufa and themselves
some of the privileges they had enjoyed under 'Ali. They wrote to
al-Husayn urging him to lead a revolt against Yazid. The support from
the Shi'a rank and file must have been increased quite con­siderably.
For not only did al-Husayn receive letters from the ordinary Shi'a,
there were also letters from several of the tribal leaders19 .

It seems that these men seeing that the mood of the Kufans was
favourable to the Shi'a and al-Husayn, had decided to try to safeguard
their own tribal positions by joining the movement in favour of
al-Husayn. Al-Husayn decided to act prudently by sending his cousin
Muslim b. 'Aqil to al-Kufa to assess the actual situation there.
