The Prison
==========

Many companions of Imam Ali [a] supported Imam Husayn [a]. Many Muslims
supported him, too.

Ubaidullah bin Ziyad arrived in Kufa, He began arresting and imprisoning
Imam Husayn's supporters.

Maytham, Mukhtar al-Thaqafy, Abdullah bin al-Harith were in the same
prison.

Imam Husayn [a] died a martyr for Islam. The prisoners felt pain for
him.

Mukhtar said to his two friends:

*Be ready to meet Allah! After Imam Husayn's killing, Ubaidullah bin
Ziyad will kill the Imam's supporters!*

Abdullah bin al-Harith said:

*Yes, he will kill us sooner or later!*

Maytham said:

*No, he won't kill you. My dear Imam Ali [a] has told me that you
(Mukhtar) will get revenge of Imam Husayn's killers. And you will kick
Ubaidullah's head with your foot.*

Then Maytham said to Abdullah bin al-Harith:

*You'll rule Basrah.*
