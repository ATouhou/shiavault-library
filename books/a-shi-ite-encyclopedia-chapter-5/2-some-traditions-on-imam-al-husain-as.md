(AS), by sacrificing himself and his family, preserved the religion of
Prophet Muhammad (PBUH&HF) from full annihilation.

Abu Huraira narrated:

The Prophet (PBUH) looked toward Ali, Hasan, Husain, and Fatimah (AS),
and then said: "I am in war with those who will fight you, and in peace
with those who are peaceful to you."

The third son of Lady Fatimah (AS) who was pre-named by the Prophet as
Muhsin, was miscarried shortly after the demise of Prophet.

Usamah ibn Zayd narrated:

I went to the Prophet (PBUH&HF) one night about something I required
and he came out with something (I did not know what) under his cloak.
When I had finished telling him my business I asked him what he had
under his cloak, and when he opened it I saw al-Hasan and al-Husayn on
his hips. He then said, "These are my sons and my daughter's sons. O
Allah, I love them, so I beseech Thee to love them and those who love
them."

was dearest to him, he replied, "Al-Hasan and al-Husain." He used to say
to Fatimah, "Call my two sons to me," and then would sniff and cuddle
them.

Imam Husain (AS) said: "Don't you see that the truth is not followed and
the falsehood is not discouraged? (The situation is so severe) so that a
Believer wishes to meet Allah (i.e., to die). And today I don't see
death but prosperity, and living with tyrants is nothing but disgust and
disgrace."

Sunni Reference: Hilyatul Awliyaa, by Abu Nu'aym, v2, p39

Imam Husain (AS) said in the day of Ashura: "If you do not have any
religion, then at least be free (open-minded) in your present life."

Imam Husain (AS) said: "By Allah, I shall not give my oath to you like
a humiliated one, and nor shall I flee like the captive."

al-Bukhari Narrated from Ibn Abi Na'm:

I have heard Prophet saying: "They (Hasan and Husain) are my two sweet-
smelling flowers in this world."

Sunni Reference: Sahih al-Bukhari, Arabic-English, v8, Tradition \#23

Again al-Bukhari narrated from Ibn Abi Nu'm:

A person asked Abdullah Ibn Umar whether a Muslim could kill flies. I
heard him saying (in reply): "The people of Iraq are asking about the
killing of flies while they themselves murdered the son of the daughter
of Allah's Apostle . The Prophet said, They (i.e. Hasan and Husain) are
my two sweet basils in this world."

Sunni Reference: Sahih al-Bukhari, Arabic-English, v5, Tradition \#96

Narrated Anas Ibn Malik said:

"The head of al-Husain was brought to Ubaidullah Ibn Ziyad and was put
in a tray, and then Ibn Ziyad started playing with a stick at the nose
and mouth of al-Husain's head, and saying something about his handsome
features." Anas then said (to him): "Al-Husain resembled the Prophet
more than any other people."

Sunni Reference: Sahih al-Bukhari, Arabic-English, v5, Tradition \#91

Imam Husain said: "I revolted not for wickedness nor for fame. Verily I
rose only to seek for rectification in the nation of my grandfather, The
Messenger of Allah."

Imam Husain said: "The true life is all having a strong idea and
striving (for that idea)."

Imam Husain said: "People are the slaves of this world, and religion is
just in their tong. They keep it as long as it meets their comfortable
life. But when the test comes, religion holders become very few."

Peace, with sception and hope, I seek,
(congruity's scope I know is bleak)
To mend I crave (rather than kill)
To spill blood, abhor I will.
Intend I do, no force to use (If sense in you I can infuse)
But the rules, supreme, of the divine faith
Resolved I am, to defend till death.
Face your hostile moves I will.
Thought accord I covet, seek peace still.
A holy war it means indeed
If waged to crush the devil's creed.
No rancor, \`against you,' I hold
But faith do cherish - as I told.
Islam I will resolutely shield
Burnt will stand and never yield.
Would welcome death (and make it tame)
Would rather die than live in shame.

Your Prophet's scion I'm - you know
At least some regard to his name show.
His singular dictum is my creed:
"Universal good" I adore, indeed.
Ali, the paragon, the seraphic Imam
Cham of the faith, the shield of Islam
Inimitable, impeccable: I am his son
His peerless attributes I have won.
My heart is virtues' abode and nest
Blessedness harbors in my breast.
