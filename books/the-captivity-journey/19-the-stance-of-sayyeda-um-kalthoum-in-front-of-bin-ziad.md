The Stance of Sayyeda Um Kalthoum in front of Bin Ziad
======================================================

The cursed man spoke to Um Kalthoum, the daughter of Ali (Q) and said:

"Thank is to God who killed your men! So, how do you view what He did
to you?"

She said: "O Bin Ziad! If your eyes are comforted by the killing of Imam
Hussain (Q), you shall know that the eyes of his Grandfather were
comforted by seeing him long before that, he used to kiss him, kiss his
lips, and carry him on his shoulder! O Bin Ziad, do prepare an answer
for his Grandfather, as he is your opponent tomorrow!"
