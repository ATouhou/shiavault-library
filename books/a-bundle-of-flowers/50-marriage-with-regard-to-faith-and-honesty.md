Marriage with Regard to Faith and Honesty
=========================================

The Holy Prophet (S) with no regard to the class of the one's
generation, emphasized and said: "When someone refers to you for
marriage and you approve contently, his manner and his religion, then
unite with him in wedlock. If you do not do that, you have caused a
grand pest and decadence on the earth."

Al-Tahthib, vol. 7, p. 394

Imam al-Jawad (‘a) wrote in a letter: "Whoever solicits you in marriage
and you are convinced of his religion and his honesty, then do unite
with him in wedlock."

Al-Kafi, vol. 5, p. 347  
 Man La Yahdhuruhul-Faqih, vol. 3, p. 393; Al-Tahthib, vol. 7, p. 394

Once a man told Imam Husayn (‘a) that he had a daughter and asked whom
he (‘a) would advise him to give her to in marriage, and he said: "Give
her in marriage to someone who (has Faith and) fears Allah, Almighty and
Glorious, because he will love and respect her, and if he becomes angry
with her, he will not hurt her."

Al-Mustatraf, vol. 2, p. 218

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "He who gives his daughter in marriage to an
ungodly man has indeed broken off her connection with her kindred."
