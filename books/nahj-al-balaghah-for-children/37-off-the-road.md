Off The Road
============

![](/sites/default/files/off_the_road.gif)

One who acts without knowledge

is like one who walks **off the road**.

Then his deviating from the clear path

takes him farther and farther away from

his destination.

But one who acts with knowledge

is like one who walks on the clear path.

Therefore, one should see

whether he is moving forward

towards his goal or going backwards.

(Sermon 154)
