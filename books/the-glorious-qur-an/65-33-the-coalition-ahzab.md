33: the Coalition (ahzab)
=========================

This slightly longer chapter was revealed after The House of Irnran 3
and before Examining Her 60. It contains 73 verses arranged in nine
sections. all of which were revealed in Madina. This thus represents a
break in the diminishing sequence of chapters.

The Jews and pagan Arabs around Madina had risen 10.000 strong in a
conspiracy directed against the nascent Islamic state at this point !the
year 5 / 626-7).

and the chapter bears witness to the difficulties existent in this
developingÂ  society. The troubles which Muhammad faced in Madina in the
year 5 / 626-7 were different from the ones he had met with in Mecca. We
hear graphic portrayals of meddlers and slackers who for instance. gave
rise to recruiting and defence problems (II). Salman the Persian had a
trench dug so the Mdinese could withstand a siege. Following this
success the Prophet began to achieve the hegemony of Arabia and control
over the trade routes to Syria.

The Prophet's wives appear again (IV ac VI) plus rules for divorce (VI)
and modesty (VIII). There is also a section on protocol in connection
with affairs of state (VII). The chapter ends with a statement on the
philosophy of history (VIII) plus a vivid picture of how God's trust was
offered to the mountains. but they

were prudent enough to reject it (IX).
