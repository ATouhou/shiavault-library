27: the Ants (naml)
===================

This chapter of seven sections consists of 92 Meccan verses. It was
revealed following the previous chapter on Poets 26 and before the next
one on Stories 28. 

The chapter consists of fables or allegories which give it a narrative
quality somewhat like The Cave 18.

It begins with the story of \\loses (I) and then describes King
Solomon's knowledge and his meeting with the Queen of Sheba (II), which
thus creates a beautiful allegory on that king's campaigns. The title to
the chapter comes from the ants he meets on one such campaign. Thamud
\`s ancient Arabian messenger, Salih or  Methusaleh and Lot are also
mentioned (IV). The grave sin of Association is next discussed in
section V. which leads into a splendid hymn to God Alone.

The chapter ends with consolation for Muhammad despite the apparent
thank lessness of the Prophet's mission, for it assures him that God
will take care of everything he has been worrying over. The final
section (VII) offers a description of the fate awaiting rejectors.
