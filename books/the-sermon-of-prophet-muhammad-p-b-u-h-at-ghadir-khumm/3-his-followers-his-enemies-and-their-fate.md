His Followers, His Enemies, and Their Fate
==========================================

In the sermon of Ghadir Khum, the Prophet (PBUH&HF) describes the
followers and the enemies of Imam Ali (PBUH) and the Imams after him,
and informs them of their destinies:

limited to denying any opposite in Him. In other words, we should
regard Him free from all defects such as ignorance.

1- Those who acknowledge the authority of Imam Ali (PBUH) are the
triumphant Party of Allah and the true believers who will achieve
felicity and a great reward.

2- Whoever doubts any of the Imams has doubted them all, and his abode
is the everlasting Hellfire.

Whoever doubts the sayings of the Prophet (PBUH&HF) in this sermon
concerning them has doubted all of what Allah has revealed to the
Prophet (PBUH&HF) throughout his entire mission. Such a person is
accursed and under the wrath of Allah.

3- If anyone chooses a religion other than submission to the
guardianship of Imam Ali (PBUH), Allah will never accept it from him,
nor will He accept his deeds, and he will be among the losers on the Day
of Judgement.

4- Allah loves whoever loves Ali (PBUH). He keeps up His support,
protection, guidance, forgiveness, and mercy for anyone who keeps
attached to Ali (PBUH), listens to him, and remains under his
guardianship.

5- Anyone who turns away from Imam Ali (PBUH), he has rejected Allahپfs
guardianship and has gone under the guardianship of Satan. Such a person
has attained the curse of Allah and His wrath.

6- As long as someone denies Aliپfs authority, Allah will never turn to
him nor will He ever forgive him. If he dies like that, he will remain
in Hell forever. This is a decisive decree by Allah that will never
change.

7- The friends of Imam Ali (PBUH) are those who believe in his
guardianship and never doubt their belief. They detest those who oppose
Allah and His Messenger even if they are their closest kin.

8- The enemies of Imam Ali (PBUH) are those who turn away from his
guardianship, doubt the virtues that Allah has bestowed upon him, are
jealous of him, abandon support for him, reject his sayings, disagree
with his actions, oppose his commands, or have friendship with those who
oppose him.

9- His enemies are the wretched, the misguided, the arrogant, the
brothers of Satan, and the rejecters of faith. Their deeds are all in
vain. Their lasting punishment will not be lessened, and they will never
be pardoned.

10- Those who usurped the rights of the family of the Prophet (PBUH&HF)
are the leaders who invite people to Hell. Allah and His Prophet
(PBUH&HF) are clear of them and their actions. They, their supporters,
and their followers will be in the lowest pit of the Hellfire.


**The Ghadir event leaves no excuse**

During the Sermon, the Prophet (PBUH&HF) stressed that his speech
completes Allahپfs argument against everyone until the Day of Judgement.
After the departure of the Prophet (PBUH&HF), other members of Ahl
al-Bait (PBUT)

1 emphasized

this fact as well. Lady Fatima (PBUH), the Prophetپfs daughter, said:

Allah did not leave any argument or any excuse for anyone after the
event of Ghadir Khum.پh2 Similarly, when Imam Ali (PBUH) addressed the
immigrants and the helpers in the Prophetپfs Mosque (after they had
pledged fealty to Abu Bakr), he reminded them of his exclusive right for
the leadership of the community and their covenant with the Messenger of
Allah (PBUH&HF) concerning him.

Some of the helpers said to Imam Ali, پgO Abul Hasan! Had the helpers
heard your arguments before giving their pledge of allegiance to Abu
Bakr, none would have disputed your rule.پh In response to them, Imam
Ali (PBUH) said:

1 Ahl al-Bait means People of the House. However, the Ahl al-Bait of
the Prophet (PBUH&HF) as specifically defined by him and believed by the
Shia, refers only to the divinely selected individuals of his house.
They are his daughter (Lady Fatima (PBUH)) as well as twelve divinely
appointed leaders (Imams) after him. The twelve Imams include the
Prophetپfs son in law and cousin, Ali (PBUH), Aliپfs two sons, al-Hasan
and al-Husain (PBUT), as well as nine descendants of al-Husain (PBUH).

2 Dalaپfil al-Imama, p. 38. See also, al-Khisal, vol. 1, p. 173; Bihar
al- Anwar, vol. 30, p. 124.

Did you want me to leave the shrouded body of the Messenger of Allah
without burial and come out to quarrel for his sovereignty? By Allah! I
could not believe anyone would yearn for it, dispute with us Ahl al-Bait
(PBUT) in it, and make lawful to do what you did (in usurping our
rights).

I do not see that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HF) left any place for
any controversial talks, any plea, or any argument for anyone (by his
speech) on the day of Ghadir Khum.

The above testimonies, among others, show that the speech of the
Prophet (PBUH&HF) at Ghadir Khum in defining the position of Imam Ali
(PBUH) is clear, evident, and definitive, and it exhausts arguments
brought by anyone. Thus, it can be presented as a comprehensive proof to
everyone.


**Our obligations towards the sermon and the event**

The necessity of submitting to the Prophetپfs sayings One of the
important differences that distinguishes Islam from all the early divine
religions is that it states that it is 1 al-Ihtijaj, vol. 1, p. 74;
Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 28, p. 185.

the final religion of Allah. It offers the ultimate divine instructions
for people in terms of beliefs and practices, and all its commandments
and prohibitions are effective until the Day of Judgement. Believers of
all generations are required to submit to the sayings of the Messenger
of Allah (PBUH&HF) to achieve felicity. Allah states in the Holy
Quran:

It is not permissible for a believer, man or woman, to exercise choice
in a matter for which Allah and His Messenger issued a command.

Whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has surely strayed off
(the path), a manifest straying.

Whoever does not judge according to what Allah has sent down is a
disbeliever.2

O You who believe! Do not precede Allah and His Messenger; and be
watchful of (your duties 1 Chapter 33, Verse 36 of the Holy Quran. 2
Chapter 5, Verse 44 of the Holy Quran.

toward) Allah. Verily, Allah hears and knows all things.

But no, by your Lord, they have not truly believed until they make you
judge in all disputes between them, find in their souls no resistance
against your decision, and submit (to you) with complete conviction.

O You who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those who are
given authority from among you; and if you had a dispute in a matter,
return it to Allah and His Messenger if you believe in Allah and the
Last Day.

1 Chapter 49, Verse 1 of the Holy Quran.
2 Chapter 4, Verse 65 of the Holy Quran.
3 Chapter 4, Verse 59 of the Holy Quran.

Say, پeIf you truly love Allah, follow me; Allah will love you and will
forgive you your sins; and Allah is oft-forgiving and the most
merciful.

f Say, eObey Allah and His Messenger.f But if they turn back, Allah
loves not those who reject faith.h 1 Therefore, it is necessary for a
believer to follow all the sayings of the Prophet (PBUH&HF) which have
reached us in the form of traditions.

Opposing the traditions of the Prophet (PBUH&HF) means opposing Allah
and disbelieving the above-mentioned verses of the Holy Quran.

Weakening and disregarding the sayings of the Prophet (PBUH&HF) that
have been handed down to us means believing that the Quranic verses,
which require us to follow his sayings, are useless in our time.

Particularly, for such an important issue as the message of Ghadir
Khum, rejecting it means believing that Allah and His Prophet (PBUH&HF)
have failed to convey the message that, according to the Quran, if not
conveyed, would be as if nothing of His religion was conveyed,2 and
religion would remain deficient and unsatisfactory in the sight of
Allah.3

It is, therefore, our duty to acquire and learn this final message of
the Prophet (PBUH&HF), to comply with what it entails, and to follow its
directions.

1 Chapter 3, Verses 31-32 of the Quran.
2 cf. the Holy Quran, Chapter 5, Verse 67.
3 cf. the Holy Quran, Chapter 5, Verse 3.


**Learning, acknowledging, and protecting the text of the sermon**

The sermon of Ghadir Khum constitutes the last instructions of the last
prophet of Allah in his last days. Hence, it is of prime importance for
every believer to study the text of the sermon with care, reflect on it,
and acknowledge all its implications in oneپfs heart.

In the sermon of Ghadir, the Prophet (PBUH&HF) has emphasized that all
his final commandments and prohibitions are effective forever and should
never be altered by peoples desires, needs, ideas, opinions, or
tendencies in any era.

He (PBUH&HF) considered it a duty of every believer to learn and
comprehend the instructions of the sermon as it was handed down to them,
and to protect them from any alteration or change for the use of the
current and future generations.

**Acting upon the instructions of the sermon and observing the
covenant**

After understanding and acknowledging the message of the Prophet
(PBUH&HF) in the heart, one must put it in practice in his/her life.
Calling people toward the truth by self-practice is the most beautiful
and the most effective method of propagating the truth, which protects
the message on a practical level and keeps it alive in the community.

The covenant taken by the Prophet (PBUH&HF) from all people who
eventually hear the sermon includes the following verbal declarations:

1- We heard and understood the divine message concerning the authority
and the rights of Ali (PBUH) and the Imams of his offspring.

2- We pledge our fealty to them by our hearts, our souls, our tongues,
and our hands.

3- We are satisfied with the message and submit to it.

4- We will never deny it, nor will we break the covenant.

5- We will never doubt it.

6- We will obey it by our actions.

7- We will live and die with this belief.

8- We will never change nor replace its instructions.

9- We will convey it to our children, family, and friends, near or
far.

10- We take Allah as witness to this covenant, and His Prophet
(PBUH&HF), Allahپfs Angels, His forces, and His servants, and anyone who
obeyed it.

According to the saying of the Prophet (PBUH&HF), this covenant is
taken by the order of Allah, and anyone who pledges his allegiance to
him, Imam Ali, and the pure Imams of his progeny according to the terms
of the covenant has indeed pledged his allegiance to Allah, the mighty
and the majestic. This fact is also verified by the Holy Quran.1

1 cf. Chapter 48, Verse 10 of the Holy Quran.

The Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HF) stated that those who precede others
in acknowledging their covenant with Imam Ali (PBUH) and the Imams after
him and truly believe in their guardianship are those who succeed in
attaining the gardens of bliss.
