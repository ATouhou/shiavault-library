The Publisher’s Foreword
========================

Sayyid Sharafuddeen (may Allah have mercy upon him) was a great figure
of jurisprudence, jihad and Islamic unity. He spent his blessed age in
the way of that. He produced a great scientific heritage and strove in
his jihad for the sake of the solidarity of the umma. Neither his
scientific works nor his jihad could ever be forgotten and they would
serve the Islamic matter for ever.

His style in writing was distinguished with clearness, accuracy, utmost
objectivity and respecting the others’ opinions; therefore the hearts of
his friends and enemies together were attracted to him.

He played a great role in achieving wide juristical cordiality among the
different Islamic sects through his wonderful writings, from among which
we chose this valuable booklet although it was small but we hoped to
achieve the same high aims the author had achieved.

May Allah have mercy upon the great honored jurisprudent Sharafuddeen
and may the all make use of his abundant knowledge!
