Ramadan: The Month of Good Deeds
--------------------------------

The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said: This month of
yours (Ramadan) is unlike the other months. Surely, when it approaches
you, it does so with blessings and mercy and when it turns away from
you, it does so with forgiveness of sins. This is a month in which good
deeds are multiplied and of goodness accepted.*Wasail al-Shia'h, vol.
10, pg. 312*
