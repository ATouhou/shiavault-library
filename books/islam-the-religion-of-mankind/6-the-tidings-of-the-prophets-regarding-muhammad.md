The Tidings of the Prophets Regarding Muhammad
==============================================

In the previous chapters we discussed that the grand messages of the
prophets invited mankind towards the Universal Religion called Islam;
which means submission and surrender to the commands of the Creator,
Allah.

Islam, which guided humanity in its stages of development and promises
salvation in the hereafter. Islam which was preached by such great
prophets as Abraham, Moses, Jesus (peace be upon them) and several
others, scattered across the face of the earth, reached its climax with
its final and most scientific message, the Holy Qur'an, which was
revealed to its greatest Prophet, Muhammad (s.a.w.). This last final
call or set of legislations was to supersede all previous messages,
since it is the most advanced version, equipped to serve mankind and its
scientific and technological progress till Doomsday. In other words the
previous messages were preparatory steps and paving measures to groom
mankind intellectually for the great task of shouldering this perfect
message, and believing sincerely in it.

Therefore it was natural for the carriers of previous messages, Moses
and Jesus (a.s.), to direct their followers to await this great
revelation, and whole-heartedly accept its invitation by believing in
the Seal Of the prophets, Muhammad (s.a.w). as after him neither there
will be a messenger nor a message. The sacred scriptures which contained
many passages, indicating the coming of this great Prophet, exhorted
their followers to await the auspicious event and gather under
Muhammad's (s.a.w.) banner when he appears. Despite the havoc wrought on
the Torah and the Gospel by the rabbis and the priests, fragments
remained in these very books, heralding the great Reformer. The Jews
eagerly awaited the coming of a prophet promised by God to deliver and
guide mankind.

They even wrote books describing the signs of his appearance. Jews
living in 'Yathreb' and other parts of Arabia and constantly embroiled
with the idol worshipping pagan Arab tribes of Aws and the Khazraj,[^3]
used to declare that as soon as the promised one will appear in this
very land, he will put an end to the evil practices of these Arabs.

The following verses of the holy Qur'an beautifully describe these
facts:

"And certainly We gave Moses the Book (Torah) and after him We sent
(many) apostles one after another, and We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear
proofs (of Allah's sovereignty) and we strengthened him with the holy
spirit (angel Gabriel). What! whenever then an apostle came to you with
that (teachings) which your souls did not desire, you were insolent, so
you called some (apostles) liars and some (apostles) you slew. And they
(Jews) say: Our hearts are covered. Nay, Allah has cursed them on
account of their unbelief; so little it is that they believe. And when
there came to them a Book (Qur'an) from Allah, verifying that which they
have (Torah), although before that they used to pray for victory over
those who disbelieved, but when there came to them that (Prophet) which
they did recognize, (to be the truth) they disbelieved in him; so
Allah's curse is on the unbelievers."
Sura Baqara (2:87-89)

The events which were foretold to the Jews in their books and which
they were awaiting as manifest signs of the great Reformer's appearance
did take place before the coming of Muhammad (s.a.w.), a fact towards
which the Qur'an points:

".... although before that they used to pray for victory over those who
disbelieved, but when there came to them that (Prophet) which they did
recognize (to be the truth) they disbelieved in him...".
Sura Baqara (2:89)

Commenting on the revelation of the above verse, the Prophet's cousin,
Abdullah Ibn Abbas who was a renowned exegete says: The Jews used to
invoke Allah, in the name of the awaited Prophet (before declaration of
Muhammad's (s.a.w.) prophethood) against the Arab tribes of Aws and
Khazraj . But when Allah commanded Muhammad (s.a.w.) to publicly
announce his prophethood they disbelieved in him and went back on their
words; on the pretext that he was not from the Israelites but was an
Arab and thus they shamelessly denied what they used to say in his
praise.

Upon this, three of the Arabs; Muadh ibn Jubail, Bishr ibn Bara and
Dawud ibn Salamah, who had renounced idolatory and accepted Islam,
reminded them in the following words: "O Jews; Fear Allah and accept
Islam; because you yourself used to pray for victory over us by the
right of Muhammad (s.a.w.), while we were idolators, remember you used
to praise him and foretell his prophethood and describe his attributes
to us" To this Salam ibn Mushkim; the Jew, replied that Muhammad (s.a.w)
brought nothing to them they knew and he is not the prophet, which they
were telling about. To refute these Jewish denials the above verse was
revealed.[^4]

Al-Aiyashi, in his famous exegesis on the holy Qur'an has recorded Imam
Ja'afar As-Sadeq's (a.s.) narration to Abu Basir. The Imam says that the
Jews had been informed in their books, that the migration (Hejira) route
of the last Prophet would pass through somewhere between the places
called 'Ayr' and 'Ohud'. in the Hejaz. [^5] Keen to locate the place the
Jews migrated to the Hejaz to await the eventual coming of the last
Reformer.

Passing along Mount Hadad, they thought it rhymed perfectly with the
predicted Ohud and they dispersed along the valley, making settlements
in 'Taima', 'Fadak' and 'Khaiber'. After some time a group of Taima Jews
longing to see their brethren, hired the services of a Bedouin and his
camels, who promised to show them the predicted lands, called Ayr and
Ohud. When the party reached the city of Yathreb (Medina) the Bedouin
told them that this is Ayr and that is Ohud.

Immediately the Jews dismounted and informed the Bedouin that they no
longer required either his services or his camels, because they had
reached their avowed goal and intend to settle there. They wrote to
their brethren in Fadak and Khaiber about their discovery of the
promised place and invited them to join them in Yathreb. The Khaiber and
Fadak Jews, as they had grown roots in those places showed reluctance in
deserting their settlements, but however assured the Yathreb Jews, that
since it is in close proximity to their places, when it happens (the
appearance of the awaited Prophet), they will rush to Yathreb.

Gradually as time passed the Jews, profiting in trade and commerce
amassed considerable wealth and bought large properties in and around
Yathreb . Their new found wealth and prosperity attracted the covetous
eyes of 'Tubba', King of Yemen, who raided them. The Jews fortified
themselves and after a long siege, the conflicting parties came to
terms. King Tubba revealed his intentions of permanently settling in
Yathreb , to which the Jews objected, saying that Yathreb being the
future migration place of the expected Prophet, it is sacred to them and
no one else may reside there until then. The King of Yemen persuaded
them that in that case he will leave two of his near relatives from the
Aws and Khazraj tribes in Yathreb, so that they may also support the
promised Reformer when he appears.

In course of time the numbers of the Aws and Khazraj who were Arabs
greatly increased and soon they started vying with the Jews for
supremacy and laid their hands on Jewish lands and properties. It was
during these conflicts against the idol -worshipping Arabs (the Aws and
Khazraj tribes) that the Jews who were expecting the last Prophet and
had migrated to Arabia solely for this purpose, used to rebuke the pagan
Arabs by saying:

"When Muhammad (s.a.w) finally appears, we shall drive you from our
lands and properties."

But when Muhammad (s.a.w.) did finally appear and declared his
prophethood, it were these very same Jews who generations ago had come
in his search - who rejected him saying that he was an Arab and not of
the Israelites.

Whereas the pagan Arabs of the tribes of Aws and Khazraj renounced
idolatory , accepted Islam and rallied to his cause, for which
ironically the Jews had waited so long, only to deviate at the last
moment. Thus it is towards this fact that the Holy Qur'an draws
attention."

"... although before that they used to pray for victory over those who
disbelieved..."
Sura Baqara (2:89)

It will not be out of context to cite the following passages from the
Old Testament, which to any discernible and rational mind are a pointer
to the prophethood of Muhammad (s.a.w.)

"I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto
thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them
all that I shall command him."

"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my
words which he shall speak in my name, I will requite it of him."
Deuteronomy (18:18,19)

"And as for Ishmael I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and
will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve
princes shall be beget and I will make him a great nation."
Genesis (17:20)

"Here is My servant, whom I uphold, My chosen one in whom I delight, I
have bestowed My spirit upon him, and he will make justice shine on the
nations. He will not call out or lift his mice high, or make himself
heard in the open market. He will not break a bruised reed, or snuff out
a smouldering wick; he will make justice shine on every race, never
faltering, never breaking down, he will plant justice on earth, while
coasts and islands wait for his teaching. Thus speaks the Lord Who is
God, He Who created the skies and stretched them out, Who fashioned the
earth and all that grows in it, Who gave breath to its people, the
breath of life to all who walk upon it: I, the Lord, have called you
with righteous purpose and taken you by the hand; I have formed You and
appointed you to be a light to all peoples, a beacon for the nations...
Let the wilderness and its towns rejoice, and the villages of the tribe
of Kedar (Qaydar)[^6].
Isaiah (42:1-6,11)

These prophesies could apply to none of the Hebrew prophets. Even Jesus
(a.s.) made it plain that his mission was far from being universal,
saying: "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of
Israel".
(Mathew 15:24)

His calling was limited and it was the later non Jewish converts, not
Jesus (a.s.) who gave Christianity its inclusive nature. Nor was Jesus
(a.s) or any of the Hebrew prophets related in any way to Kedar
(Qaydar). In promising a great prophet from the Arabs, Isaiah (a.s.) was
merely amplifying the prophecy made previously by Moses (a.s.).

God revealed to Moses (Deuteronomy 18:18,19) that a prophet would arise
from the brothers of the Hebrews the Arabs, who were children of the
brother of Isaac, Ishmael (peace be upon them)- who would command world
wide attention and obedience.

Ishmael's (a.s.) descendants came to be known as Arabs, a term which in
Hebrew, meant those who inhabited the 'Arabah' (desert). Further, of all
the sons of Ishmael (a.s.) the one mentioned most prominently in the Old
Testament is Kedar. In some verses Kedar is synonymous with the Arabs in
general.' This is an important indication that the line of Kedar was
marked by God for a unique purpose for it was from this line Prophet
Muhammad (s.a.w.) sprang.

**JESUS' PROPHECY ABOUT MUHAMMAD**

"And when Jesus son of Mary said: O Children of Israel! Surely I am the
apostle of Allah to you, verifying that which was (revealed) before me
of the Torah, and giving the good tidings of an Apostle who will come
after me, whose name is Ahmad..."
Sura Saff (61:6)

"Those who follow the Apostle - Prophet the Ummi whom they find
ordained for them in the Torah and the Gospel, he enjoins them good and
forbids them evil..."
Sura A'raf (7:157)

The Gospel of Jesus (a.s.) brought into sharper focus the identity of
the one who would fulfil the promise to make the line of Ishmael (a.s.)
a great nation. In the Gospel of John - a New Testament book which is
not the Gospel of Jesus (a.s.) and which may be considered as
representing only in general terms portions of Jesus' teaching - Jesus
(a.s.) informs his close companions that his work among them was drawing
to conclusion, but God would send someone else after a time to carry
forward the prophetic movement. This someone, however, would be the last
of the prophets.

The following passages of the New Testament lend further proof to the
Prophethood of Muhammad (s.a.w):

"And this is the record of John (the Baptist) when the Jews sent
priests and levites from Jerusalem to ask him, who art thou?

And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed I am not the Christ.

And they asked him, what then? Art thow Elias?

And he saith I am not. Art thou THAT PROPHET? And he answered, No.

And they asked him, and said unto him, why baptizest thou then, if thou
be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither THAT PROPHET."
John (1:19-21,25)

"If ye love me, keep my commandments.
And I will pray the Father and He shall give you another Comforter,
that he may abide with you forever.

But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send
in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your
rememberance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

Hereafter I will not talk much with you: fur the prince of this world
cometh, and hath nothing in me."
John (14:15, 16,26,30)

"But when the Comforter is come, whom I shall send unto you from the
Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he
shall testify of me."
John (15:26)

"Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient fur you that I go
away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you.

And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
righteousness, and of judgement:

Of sin, because they believe not on me;
Of righteouseness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;
Of judgement because the prince of this world is judged.
I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.

Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into
all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall
hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.

He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it
unto you."
John (16:7-14)

A careful study of these passages brings to light the following
facts:

1) Jesus Christ (a. s.) prophesies the corning of a Comforter after
him.
2) The coming of the Comforter depends on Christ's departure.
3) He is sent by Almighty Allah.
4) He will teach everything.
5) He will draw attention towards what the Christ had foretold.
6) He will testify and glorify Christ.
7) He will not speak by himself but what he divinely hears.
8) He will foretell future events.
9) The world will follow his religion.
10) He will stay forever.

In view of these glaring facts if we cast a glimpse at the life of
Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.) we will discover the amazing truth that these
points perfectly tally with his mission and hence without doubt he is
the .Comforter' whose tidings Jesus (a.s.) gave. Because the holy Qur'an
revealed to Prophet Muhammad(s.a.w.) not only confirms and glorifies
Jesus (a.s.) and his Prophethood but reminds people of Christ's
prophecy. Besides, the Qur'an is a final revelation for mankind and an
eternal message. It is an inexhaustible mine of information, foretells
future events and promises that Islam will eventually spread all over
the world uniting humanity in peace and harmony.

A closer look at the word 'Comforter' as mentioned in the Bible will
help us uncover some more startling facts.

Comforter here stands for the word 'Parakletos' mentioned in the Greek
version of the New Testament from which the English translation is made.
And more precisely the meaning of 'Parakletos' is an advocate, one who
counsels or advises another from deep concern for the other's welfare.
Or to say it more clearly 'Parakletos' would designate one who would be
considered "Mercy for all creatures" (Rahmatun lil Alameen), the term
the holy Qur'an uses in chapter 21 verse 107 to describe Prophet
Muhammad (s.a.w.).

Moreover scholars have pointed out that what Jesus' said in his native
language of Aramaic represents another similar Greek word 'Periklytos',
which means the Admirable or the Glorified One and corresponds exactly
to the Arabic word 'Ahmad'.

Hence the Qur'an's quotation of Jesus' good tidings to the Jews: "An
Apostle will come alter me whose name is Ahmad".

When Jesus declares of this coming Prophet Counsellor that he would
"abide with you forever',' he shows that there would be no need for
additional prophets to succeed him. He would be the last one. He would
lead mankind "to every aspect of the truth." So truthful and trustworthy
would he be that he will be called Al- Arnin (The Truthful) or as the
text of John 16:13 says, "the spirit of truth", one of whom it could be
said: "He has brought them the Truth." (Qur'an 23:70)

The term 'spirit' here does not mean that the corning Prophet would be
other than human. In New Testament Greek, this word has also been
applied to an inspired person, "the possessor of a spiritual
communication" or revelation. This is why the next sentence of the verse
containing this expression says: "He will guide you unto all truth; for
he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear (from God),
that shall he speak." (John 16:13).

This person would receive the revelation of truth from God and these
words alone would constitute the message, not his own opinions or the
writings of his companions. His message or revelation would be first and
foremost and literally the Word of God. Note that this corresponds
exactly to what God revealed to Moses (a.s.) about the Prophet who would
come from among the "brothers" of the Hebrews: "I.... will put My words
in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command
him." (Deuteronomy 18:18).

Now compare these to the following verse of the holy Qur'an which
drives home the ultimate truth:

"Your companion (Muhammed) does not err, nor does he go astray; Nor
does he speak out of desire. It is naught but revelation that is
revealed, The Lord of Mighty Power has taught him."
Sura Najm (53:25)

It cannot be overlooked that Jesus (a.s.) gives a unique requirement
that would help to identify the last Prophet: "He shall glorify me"
(John 16:14). If anyone had come claiming to be this Prophet, but did
not give due honor to Jesus (a.s.) as Prophet and Messiah, he would be
the wrong one. At the same time, this Prophet to come would not be a
follower of Jesus (a.s.), that is, a Christian, because Jesus (a.s.)
said that this Prophet would reveal things of which Jesus (a.s.) himself
was unaware. If Jesus (a.s.) had brought "all the truth," there would
have been no need for him to single out someone else who would come with
all the truth. Likewise, since this Prophet would bring all the truth he
would have to be the last one, the seal of the Prophets.

Therefore, we would have to look for someone who, like Abraham (a.s.)
in whose line he would come, would be neither Jew nor Christian but
would believe in God. He would "glorify" Jesus (a.s.) by insisting that
Jesus (a.s.) was a true Messenger of God and by acknowledging that Jesus
(a.s.) was the true Messiah. But the teaching of this Prophet would come
from God Himself. As a revelation from God, the message of this last
Prophet would confirm what God revealed previously by means of the
original Torah and the original Gospel, but his message would be no mere
plagiarized copy, no condensed edition of either the Torah or the
Gospel. God Almighty had said, "I... will put My words in his mouth:'
and it is proper that these words agree with previously revealed words
of the One and Same God. "Whatsoever he shall hear (from God), that
shall he speak."

History has recorded that Christians during the first few centuries
after Christ, not only believed in these above-mentioned facts but
eagerly awaited the coming of the last Prophet, as foretold by Jesus
(a.s.) It was only during the 3rd century, when hordes of Roman pagans
began converting to Christianity, the pure monotheistic message of
Prophet Jesus (a.s.) showed signs of pollution, with weird heathen ideas
such as 'God Father', 'God Son', 'Holy Ghost' and 'Trinity' creeping
in.

This strange Holy Ghost interpretation gained currency only after
Christians began to look upon God as a Trinity with the Holy Ghost being
an aspect of it. Neither the word Trinity nor its concepts can be found
anywhere in the Bible. The Paraclete would be a man, not a ghost,
because the same word is applied to Jesus (a.s.) himself, in John
(2:1).

The annals of history prove that faithful Christians from time to time
stood up against these heretical ideas.

But when Constantine assumed the reins of the Roman Empire, not only
did he espouse the cause of the heretics, but also launched a mass
persecution against the true believers, forcing them to flee to deserts
and inaccessible mountains to live as hermits.

Finally the following passage from the French Encyclopaedia,
'Larousse,[^7], is a sufficient admittance to the truth of Islam:
"Muhammad' is a derivative of the word 'Mahmood', whose root-word is
'Hamd', which means glorifying. Strangely another word is derived from
the same origin and that is 'Ahmad'. It is widely believed, Christians
in the Arabian Peninsula used the word 'Ahmad' for the Greek word
'Paraclete' mentioned in the Bible, which means 'the Glorified or
Promised one'. Muslims subsequently made great efforts saying this
refers to Prophet Muhammad, as described by the Qur'an (in Chapter
61)."

Thus it is clear that despite centuries of disastrous human
interference in the Torah and the Bible, portions remain indicating the
eternal truth of Islam.

The Encyclopaedia Brittanica has the following comments on the
Gospels:

"They resemble oil paintings rather than photographs. Legendary and
apologetic motifs, and the various preoccupations of the communities for
which they were first produced, can readily be discerned as influences
upon their narratives."[^8]

The coming of Muhammad (s.a.w.) was heralded, not only by Moses (a.s.)
and Jesus (a.s.), but by all the prophets.

Even Abraham (a.s.), the father of the prophets, foretold his coming,
and prayed God for a guide and rescuer. This is explicitly referred to
by the Qur'an which quotes Abraham's prayer:

"Our Lord! and raise up in them an Apostle from among them who shall
recite to them Your revelations, and teach them the Book and the Wisdom
and cleanse them (of false beliefs); surely You are the Mighty, the
Wise."
Sura Baqara (2:129)

The verse given below declaring the prophethood of Muhammad (s.a.w.) is
a clear answer to Abraham's (a.s.) prayer mentioned above; for Muhammad
(s.a.w.), was a direct descendent of Abraham (a.s.) through his eldest
son Ishmael (a.s.):

"He it is Who raised among the unlettered, an Apostle from among
themselves, who recites to them His revelations and cleanses them (of
false beliefs), and teaches them the Book and the Wisdom, although they
were before certainly in clear error."
Sura Jum'a (62:2)

These facts are quite obvious to a rational thinker and any seeker of
truth interested in finding the path of guidance, like Negus, the
Christian king of Abyssinia, who positively responded to the call of
truth. When the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) wrote to Negus citing proofs
of his prophethood, foretold in the Torah and the Gospel and invited him
to accept Islam, Negus immediately surrendered (became Muslim) to the
message of Islam. History has preserved his eternal words as a fair
testimony of a just man, free from the effects of the environment, or
the pressures of obstinacy and bigotry; "I call Allah as witness that he
(Muhammad s.a.w.) is the prophet awaited for by the followers of the
Scriptures..."[^9]

Thus, anyone pursuing truth can clearly discern that Muhammad (s.a.w.)
had been heralded by the previous prophets, and that he was the awaited
one to reform mankind and deliver them, from darkness and going astray.
Yes, it was he whom all the prophets had heralded and prayed Allah to
send.
