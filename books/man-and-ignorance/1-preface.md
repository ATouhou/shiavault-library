In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, The Most Merciful

***“Is it then the judgment of (the times of) ignorance that they
desire? And who is better than Allah to judge for a people who are
sure?*** Holy Quran (5:50)

*“Judgment is of two kinds -the judgment of Allah- the Great and
Almighty - and the judgment of the people of the ignorance (jahiliyah).
So, whoever misses Allah's judgment, surely will judge according to the
judgment of the people of jahiliyah.”* Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (a.s)
