The Make Up of Words and The Subject of Morphology
==================================================

15. What are words made up of?

16. What does morphology teach us?

15. Words are made up of:

• One letter, for example the *bā* preposition in **بِحَمدِ الله** (with
the praise of Allah)

• More than one letter (up to seven letters). For example: **استِخبَار**
(inquiry)

16. Morphology teaches us the forms of single words and their different
states before being joined together with other words.
