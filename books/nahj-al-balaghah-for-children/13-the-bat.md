The Bat
=======

![](/sites/default/files/bat.gif)

An example of His delicate product,

a marvel of His creation,

and a sample of His profound wisdom,

is what we see in **the bat**,

which shrinks from the daylight,

although daylight moves everything else

to action,

and is active in the night,

although the night stops the activity

of every other living being.

(Sermon 155)
