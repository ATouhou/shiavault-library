103: Eventide
=============

These 3 Meccan verses were revealed after Consolation 94 but before
Jonah 10 and The Chargers 100, and about the same time as The Earthquake
99. It offers us a consoling prayer which is recited frequently since it
brings home to us how all things change, and we must learn patiently to
face the inevitable. A final consonant in -r carries the rhyme.
