TROPES, LITURGICAL PLAYS, AND MYSTERY PLAYS.
============================================

All these forms, though they were not altogether without later
influence, were very minor affairs, and the real drama of the Middle
Ages grew up, without design and by the mere nature of things, from the
regular services of the Church.

The list of plays thus presented commonly included: The Fall of Lucifer;
the Creation of the World and the Fall of Adam; Noah and the Flood;
Abraham and Isaac and the promise of Christ's coming; a Procession of
the Prophets, also foretelling Christ; the main events of the Gospel
story, with some additions from Christian tradition; and the Day of
Judgment.
