97. The Imperative Mood
=======================

The Imperative Mood of the verb is used when someone is given a direct
command or making a request. This command/request is either (a) positive
or (b) negative.

a.**إذهبي إلی المَکتبَةِ**

You (f.s.) go to the library!

b.**لا تـَذهبي إلی المَکتبَةِ**

You (f.s.) do not go to the library!

The verb that is used in both cases is formed from the**second person**
Jussive Mood with a little modification. In (a) you need to drop the
subject marker prefix and insert a Hamza /**إ** / instead to break the
resulting consonant cluster, as in**ذهَبي** . In the case of the
negative imperative (b) you just put the negation particle**لا** in
front of the verb.
