Conclusion
==========

Based on a fundamental hatred for Islam and Muslims, a legacy of many
centuries, Christian Zionist messianism has emerged as one of the most
pressing and disastrous threats and challenges of our times. With the
massive financial and political clout that it wields, particularly in
America, it is the new face of Western imperialism, one that is
inherently and fiercely opposed to people of other faiths and even to
Christians who do not subscribe to its bloody doctrines.

Islam and Muslims have a special place in the ideology of Christian
Zionist messianic fascism: as alleged 'enemies' of God. Based on this
bizarre belief, theological sanction is sought for bloody wars against
Muslims the world over.

This ideology has instigated and is being used to justify American (and
Israeli) imperialist aggression in many Muslim countries today, and
possibly against Iran in the near future. Clearly, Muslims need to be
aware of this dangerous project and take appropriate measures. So, also,
do other non-Christians, who, like Muslims, are seen as doomed to hell
by Christian fundamentalists.

And so, too, do other Christians, who relate to their religious
traditions in different ways and who firmly believe that the Christian
Zionist messianic project represents a fundamental betrayal of the
message of Jesus Christ, ironically a betrayal being so aggressively
perpetrated in his name.
