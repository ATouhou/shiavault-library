Responsibility 16: Praying To Allah for the Noble Traits
========================================================

Another responsibility is to pray to Allah for the attainment of the
necessary traits which a believer must possess. A true believer must ask
Allah for that which is good for this world and the next. He must also
ask Allah to grant him the virtuous ethical traits such as patience,
truthfulness in speech, intelligence, aptitude, wisdom and insight.

If having patience is one of the necessary traits of the believers
during the occultation of the Imam, then its corresponding
responsibility is that a believer asks Allah for this trait to be
instilled within him. As well, if fulfilling the rights of the Imam is
considered as one of the duties of a believer, then another
responsibility is that one must pray for the ability to fulfill the
rights of the Imam.

Thus in summary, one must supplicate to Allah  to be able to fulfill
every important task.

The Messenger of Allah has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
سَلُوا اللٌّهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ مَا بَدَالَكُمْ مِنْ حَوَائِجِكُمْ
حَـتَّى شِسْعَ الْنَعْلِ فَإِنَّهُ إِنْ لَمْ يُـيَسِّرْهُ لَمْ
يَتَيَسَّرْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Ask Allah, the Majestic and Glorious, for the necessities that you
require, even for as much as your shoelace, because if He does not make
it easily available for you then it will not be attainable.”[^1]
