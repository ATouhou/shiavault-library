17. The Ethos Of Prophet Ismael, Truthful In Promise
====================================================

Introduction
------------

The late Allameh Tabatabaee commenting on the story of Ismael, truthful
in promise narrates a hadith from Ilal as-sharai in which Imam Sadeq has
been quoted saying: Ismael of True promise is not the son of Abraham but
he is a messenger whom God appointed to his nation but people skinned
his face and head. At this time an angel descended on God’s order
saying: God has sent me to you. Your ordinance will be obeyed. He said:
This is one example of how people treat the Prophets. The late Tibrisi
in Mujma al-Bayan, commenting on verse 54 of the Quranic chapter — Mary
— "And mention Ismael in the Book; surely he was truthful in (his)
promise, and he was an apostle, a Prophet" writes: Ismael the son of
Abraham died before his father and Ismael, the Truthful in promise is
the son of Prophet Ezekiel. When people skinned his head and face, God
gave him the option to torment of forgive people but he entrusted it to
God.

The late Tibrisi quotes Imam Sadeq as saying: An angel was sent to him
by his Lord greeting him and saying: I have seen how they have treated
you. God has ordered me to do whatever you want. Ismael said: I want to
be an example of Imam Husayn.

أَتَاهُ مَلَكٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِ يُقْرِئُهُ السَّلامُ وَيَقُولُ قَدْ
رَأَيْتُ مَا صُنِعَ بِكَ وَقَدْ أَمَرَني بِطَاعَتِكَ فَمُرْني بِمَا
شِئْتَ،فَقَالَ: يَكُونُ لِي بِالْحُسَيْنِ عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ أُسْوَةٌ.
يُمْكِنُ أَنْ يَكُونَ هَذا الْمَكَانُ مَوْضِعُ دَفْنِ الرَّأْسِ
الشَّريفِ بَعْدَ سَلْخِهِ، فَإِنَّهُمْ لَعَنَهُمُ اللَّهُ نَقَلُوهُ
بَعْدَ أَنْ سَلَخُوهُ.

Nomenclature Of Truthful In Promise
-----------------------------------

A person by the name Ja’afari quotes Imam Reza as saying: Do you know
why Ismael is called Truthful in promise? I said: I do not know. The
Imam said: He had an appointment with someone and kept on waiting for
him for a year. Evidently, this does not mean that he was idle during
that year, rather he was engaged in everyday life while he was on the
lookout.

عَنْ الْجَعْفَري، عَنْ أَبى الْحَسَنِ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ
قَالَ: أَتَدْري لِمَ سُمِّي إِسْمَاعِيلُ صَادِقَ الْوَعْدِ؟ قُلْتُ: لا
أَدْري، قَالَ وَعَدَ رَجُلا فَجَلَسَ لَهُ حَوْلا يَنْتَظِرُهُ.
