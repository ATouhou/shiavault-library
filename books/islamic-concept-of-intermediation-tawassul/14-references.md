Section Four: Intermediation through the Prophet’s relics
---------------------------------------------------------

It is a fact that the objects and articles associated with the righteous
and the virtuous are an overflowing source of bounty and munificence.
This is the reason that it was the usual practice of the Companions to
preserve his relics and to draw benefits and blessings out of them. This
proves that they offered them to Allah as instruments of mediation when
they needed His help and assistance. Allah Himself has made reference to
the relics of the prophets in the Holy Qur’ān. For example, the
following Qur’ānic verse indicates the mode in which Banī Israel drew on
the relics of the progeny of Mūsā (عليه السلام) and Hārūn (عليه السلام):

*And their prophet told them: ‘a sign of his authority (being from
Allah) is that there shall come to you the Ark of the covenant. In it
there shall be an assurance of security (peace of mind) from your Lord
and from the relics left by the family of Mūsā and Hārūn carried by
angels. In this is a symbol for you if you indeed have faith.[1]*

At another place in the Holy Qur’ān Allah has related the incident in
which Ya‘qūb (عليه السلام) drew blessing from Yūsuf’s shirt:

*‘Go with this my shirt and cast it over the face of my father; he will
come to see clearly, and (then) come you to me together with all your
family.’ And when the caravan left (Egypt), their father (Ya‘qūb) said
(while sitting in Kan‘ān): ‘I do indeed scent the presence of Yūsuf if
you do not think me a dotard on account of old age.’ They said: ‘By God!
Truly you are in the same old drifting state of love.’ Then when the
bearer of the good news came, he cast the shirt over Ya‘qūb’s face and
instantaneously his eyesight returned. Ya‘qūb said: ‘Did I not say to
you, I know from God that which you know not.’[2]*

A study of the books on tradition and the Prophet’s life and conduct
reveals that, in addition to relying on the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him
and His Household)* for prayer, the Companions received blessings from
him in various other ways. For example, they had their bodies touched
with his hand; they themselves touched his body as a form of
benediction; they blessed themselves with the water left over from his
ablution and also with the water he used to wash his hands; and with his
leftover food. Similarly, they received blessings from his sweat, from
his saliva, from the mucus coming out of his nose, from his hair (which
came off during his haircut and they did not let them fall on the
ground), from his nails, from his dress, from his staff, from his ring,
from his bed and cot and from his praying mat. In short, they drew
blessings from any object that was even marginally associated with his
body. Even after his death, the Companions and the leading believers
derived blessings from his grave and the pulpit. They received blessing
even from the houses and places where he had lived, the spots at which
he had prayed and the dust of the paths he had walked through. Every
successive generation after the period of the Companions and Successors
including caliphs, kings and religious leaders, preserved the Prophet’s
signs and relics with great reverence. On special days Muslims were
allowed to see them, draw blessings from them and pray to Allah through
their mediation.

This reverential attitude should be maintained in the context of the
Prophet’s traditions and in any reference to his exalted personality.
The same attitude should be reflected in our treatment of the Companions
and members of the Prophet’s family. If we consistently display this
attitude, Allah will not only reinforce our faith but also shower His
blessings on us. But if we treat them disrespectfully, Allah will curse
us with trouble and affliction, which the common man often fails to
understand. The Companions possessed a number of his relics. Not only
some of these are given below, but also the way they are used as means
is also briefly described:

### 1. Desire to be buried in the Prophet’s vicinity

###

‘Umar bin al-Khattāb had a strong desire to be buried in the vicinity of
the Prophet’s grave. When he was at his deathbed, he sent his son to
seek permission from ‘Ā’ishah as she had reserved the specific spot for
herself. But, on ‘Umar’s request, she responded: ‘I liked to keep this
spot for myself but now I give preference to ‘Umar’s desire over mine.’
‘Abdullāh returned and conveyed the glad tidings to his father. At this
‘Umar said: ‘all praise to Allah! This was the most pressing matter for
me.’ The tradition runs as follows:

*Husayn bin ‘Abd-ur-Rahmān from ‘Amr bin Maymūn al-Awdī has narrated: He
said: I saw ‘Umar bin al-Khattāb, he said: ‘O ‘Abdullāh bin ‘Umar! Go
over to the Mother of the Believers, ‘Ā’ishah, and give her my regards
and then ask her if I am permitted to be buried beside my companions.’
‘Ā’ishah replied: ‘I had this spot marked for myself and today I prefer
‘Umar to myself.’ When he came back, ‘Umar asked him: ‘what news have
you brought?’ He replied: ‘O leader of the believers! She has given you
the permission.’ At this ‘Umar said: ‘today nothing matters to me more
than this resting place. When I pass away, take me to (this place), give
my regards and request that ‘Umar bin al-Khattāb seeks permission. If I
am given the permission, then bury me there, otherwise bury me in an
ordinary graveyard for the Muslims.’[3]*

The only interpretation of the desire expressed by both ‘Umar and
‘Ā’ishah is that they wanted to receive divine blessings through the
mediation of the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* by
being buried close to him.

### 2. The small water bag of leather as a source of blessing

###

1. ‘Abd-ur-Rahmān bin Abū ‘Amrah has attributed it to his grandmother
who heard it from Kabshah Ansāriyyah:

*Allah’s Messenger*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* went over to see
her and there was a small water bag of leather hanging there. He drank
water from it while standing. Then she cut off the mouth of water bag on
account of its blessing because the Prophet’s mouth had touched it.[4]*

2. Umm Sulaym cut off the mouth of the water bag from which the
Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* had drunk water. Anas says:

*That the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* came over to see
Umm Sulaym and there was a small leather bag (of water) hanging in the
house. He drank (water) from this leather bag while standing. Anas says*

*that Umm Sulaym cut off the mouth of the leather bag so it is (still)
with us.[5]*

### 3. Cure through the mediation of the Prophet’s gown

###

It is narrated by ‘Abdullāh, a slave freed by Asmā’ bint Abū Bakr:

*That she (Asmā’ bint Abū Bakr) took out the gown that belonged to
Kasrawanī Tayālisān, its collar and slits were lined with silk cloth.
She said: ‘this was in the possession of ‘Ā’ishah, when she died, I took
it over and the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* used to
wear it. We used to wash it for the sick and along with it we asked for
the recovery of the sick.[6]*

Nawawī has commented on it:

*And this tradition confirms that it is a meritorious act to seek
blessing through the relics and robes of the virtuous.[7]*

### 4. The Prophet’s ring

###

‘Abdullāh bin ‘Umar has narrated:

![](books/0672-islamic_concept_of_intermediation_tawassul/images/image001.emz)

The Messenger of Allah*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* had a silver
ring made for himself. It was in his hand, then it remained in Abū
Bakr’s hand, then it remained in ‘Umar’s hand, then it remained in
‘Uthmān’s hand, then from his hand it fell into a well at Arīs. The
following words were engraved on it: Muhammad, the Messenger of
Allah.[8]

### 5. Blessing through the Prophet’s blanket

###

The Mother of Believers, ‘Ā’ishah lovingly guarded a blanket in which
the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* had passed away as
is attributed to Abū Hurayrah that ‘Ā’ishah took out a thick blanket and
showed it to us. She said:

*The Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* had breathed his
last in this blanket.[9]*

### 6. Blessing through the Prophet’s sandals

###

1. Anas kept with him a pair of the Prophet’s shoes and a cup from which
he used to drink. Bukhārī comments with reference to the pair of shoes:

*‘Īsā bin Tahmān reported that Anas brought out a pair of old sandals
and showed them to us. Each one of the pair had two laces. Then Thābit
al-Bunānī, reporting it from Anas, told me that the pair of shoes
belonged to the Prophet (Peac Be Up Him and His Household).* [10]

2. Similarly, according to another tradition, ‘Ubayd bin Jurayh said to
‘Abdullāh bin ‘Umar: “I see you wearing a pair of shoes shorn of hair.”
‘Abdullāh bin ‘Umar replied: “I have seen the Messenger of Allah*(Peac
Be Up Him and His Household)* wearing such shoes which are denuded of
hair,

and he used to put his feet into them after ablution. Therefore, I like
to wear such shoes.”[11]

3. Qastallānī writes in his book al-Mawāhib-ul-laduniyyah (2:118-9) that
‘Abdullāh bin Mas‘ūd was one of the Prophet’s attendants and attended
him with a pillow, a tooth-brush, a pair of sandals and water for
ablution. When the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* stood up,
he helped him put on the sandals, and when he sat down, ‘Abdullāh bin
Mas‘ūd picked up the sandals and tucked them under his arms.

Qastallānī adds: One of the virtues, benefits and blessings of the
Prophet’s sandals has been particularly stressed by Shaykh Abū Ja‘far
bin ‘Abd-ul-Majīd. He says: I gave a sample of the pair of sandals to
one of my students. One day he came over to me and said: yesterday, I
discovered a strange blessing in the sandals. My wife was on the point
of death from severe pain. I placed the sandals on the aching spot and
said: O Allah! show me a miracle from the owner of this pair of sandals.
Allah showed His mercy and my wife instantly recovered.[12]

Abū Bakr Ahmad bin Abū Muhammad ‘Abdullāh bin Husayn Qurtubī has given a
poetic expression to his feelings about the pair of sandals:

*Such shoes whose exalted status we acknowledged because only through
this acknowledgement, we exalt ourselves. Therefore, they should be kept
at a lofty place, because, in reality, these are the crown (on the head)
although they appear to be shoes.[13]*

When Imam Fakhānī cast his first glance at the sandals, he burst into a
poetic expression:

*And if the Madman of Laylā had been asked to choose between a meeting
with Laylā and the pelf of the world, he would have spontaneously
replied: “I hold the dust blowing up from her shoes even dearer than my
own soul and it is the best cure for blowing off its problems”.*

It is noteworthy that scholars from the Deoband school of thought have
written books about the Prophet’s shoes:

1. Mawlānā Shihāb-ud-Dīn Ahmad Muqrī wrote a book called Fath-ul-muta‘āl
fi madh-in-ni‘āl.

2. Mawlānā Ashraf ‘Alī Thānwī wrote a tract Nayl-ush-shifā
bi-ni‘āl-il-Mustafā, which is part of his book Zād-us-sa‘īd.

Mawlānā Muhammad Zakariyyā Kandhalwī comments:

*“The virtues and blessings of the Prophet’s sandals are found at the
end of the tract Zād-us-Sa‘īd by Mawlānā Ashraf ‘Alī Thānwī. Anyone who
is keen on details is advised to refer to it. In short, its blessings
are infinite. The scholars have performed repeated experiments. If you
keep them in your possession, you may see the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up
Him and His Household)* , you may be delivered from the oppressors and
may achieve popularity. In brief, to depend on it as a source of
intermediation is an unwavering guarantee of success. The method of
intermediation is also explained in it.”[14]*

This discussion clearly proves that the real capital is the unfathomed
love for the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* and the
unflagging respect for the things and objects directly or indirectly
associated with him, as has been poetically expressed by Imām Ahmad Radā
Khān:

*“If I have a pair of the Prophet’s sandals to place on my head.*

*Then I shall consider myself no less than a properly crowned king.”*

### 7. Blessing through the holy goblet

###

1. Abū Burdah narrates:

*‘Abdullāh bin Salām said to me, “Shouldn’t I serve you (water) in the
goblet from which the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* had
drunk.[15]*

2. Abū Hāzim from Sahl bin Sa‘d narrates:

*One day the Companions had the pleasure of the Prophet’s company at
Saqīfah banī Sā‘idah. Then he asked Sahl to get him (some water). Then I
brought out this goblet for him and served him (water) in it. Abū Hāzim
said: Sahl brought out that goblet for us and we also drank from it.
Then ‘Umar bin ‘Abd-ul-‘Azīz requested that he should hand over the
goblet to him and Sahl handed it over to him. And the tradition by Abū
Bakr bin Ishāq says: he said, O Sahl, get me some water to drink.[16]*

3. Hajjāj bin Hassān relates:

*We were with Anas that he sent for a vessel, which had three female
iron lizards and an iron ring in it. He took it out of a black cover,
which was less than medium size and more than one-eighth of it, and at
Anas’s order, water was brought in it for us. We had the water and
poured some of it over our heads and faces and sent salutations on the
Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* .[17]*

The chain of transmission of this tradition is sahīh (sound).

4. And when the goblet that was in the possession of Anas, and from
which the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* used to
drink, cracked, he took tremendous pains to repair it. His painstaking
efforts are an ample proof of the love and respect the Companions had
for the articles directly or indirectly associated with the Holy
Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* . The tradition says:

*When the Prophet’s goblet cracked, (Anas) repaired it with a silver
chain, instead of (repairing it) with something ordinary. ‘Āsim (the
narrator) says: ‘I have myself seen that goblet and have also drunk
water from it.’[18]*

### 8. Blessing through the holy hair

###

The Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* himself taught his
followers to preserve the relics and practically created in his
Companions the awareness and the urgency that they should let no
opportunity slip to collect his blessings.

1. Anas narrates that after performing the sacrificial rites at the
juncture of hajj:

*The Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* held the right
side of his head in front of the barber, he shaved off his hair. Then he
called Abū Talhah al-Ansārī and handed him the (shaved) hair. Then he
held the other side in front of the barber, he also shaved off the hair
on this side and he also handed those hair to Abū Talhah and said to
him: ‘distribute these hair among the people.’[19]*

2. Ibn Sīrīn has reported it from Anas:

*When the Messenger of Allah*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* had his
head shaved; Abū Talhah was the first person to receive his hair.[20]*

3. Similarly another tradition is attributed to Anas:

*I saw that a barber was shaving the Prophet’s head and the Companions
stood around him in the shape of a circle. They wished that each strand
of hair falling off the Prophet’s head should fall into the hand of one
of them (they did not wish it to fall on the ground).[21]*

4. Ibn Sīrīn relates:

*I told ‘Abīdah that we are in possession of the Prophet’s hair which I
obtained from Anas or his family. ‘Abīdah said: ‘if I possessed anyone
of these hair, I will hold that hair even dearer than the entire world
and whatever it contains.’* [22]

Ibn Hajar ‘Asqalānī says: “This tradition furnishes the proof that it is
valid to draw divine blessings from the Prophet’s hair and confirms the
permissibility of its acquisition.”[23]

5. Thābit al-Bunānī relates that Anas said to him:

*This is a hair belonging to the dear Messenger of Allah*(Peac Be Up Him
and His Household)* , so you should place it under my tongue. He says
the hair was placed under his tongue and when he was buried, the hair
was still under his tongue.[24]*

6. ‘Uthmān bin ‘Abdullāh bin Mawhab relates:

*My family sent me to Umm Salamah with a goblet of water. Israel
clutched his three fingers in a manner that they looked like the goblet,
which contained the Prophet’s hair, and when someone was under the
influence of an evil eye or suffered from pain, he used to send a
utensil (of water) to Umm Salamah. So when I peered into the utensil, I
saw a few red hairs.[25]*

*Badr-ud-Dīn ‘Aynī says: “Umm Salamah kept the Prophet’s hair in a
silver bottle. When people fell ill, they received blessings from those
hairs and recovered from their illness as a result of this blessing. If
someone was under the spell of a malevolent eye or just fell ill, he
would send his wife to Umm Salamah with a utensil holding water; she
would pass the hair through the water and the patient would recover by
drinking that water, and after that the hair was put away in the
bottle.”[26]*

### 9. Victory in war through the mediation of the Prophet’s hair

Qādī ‘Iyād narrates in ash-Shifā (2:619):

*Khālid bin Walīd’s cap contained some of the Prophet’s hair. When the
cap fell away during battle, he rushed to grab it. When a large number
of Companions lost their lives as martyrs in this battle, the people
blamed him. He replied: ‘I did not put up all that struggle just for the
cap, but the cap contained the Prophet’s hair. I feared I would be
deprived of their blessings in case they fell into the hands of the
infidels.’*

### 10. Making a coffin out of the clothes worn by the Prophet (SAW)

###

**1.** When Alī’s mother, Fātimah bint Asad died, her funeral rites were
meticulously observed. After the bath, when it was time to dress her up
in a shirt, the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* handed his
own shirt to the women and commanded them to dress her up in that shirt
and then wrap the coffin round it.[27]

To drape her dead body in his shirt was most presumably intended to
shower divine blessings on her.

**2.** When the Prophet’s daughter, Zaynab or Umm Kalthūm died, he
blessed her with his own trouser-sash to wrap the coffin.[28]

**3.** Similarly, a woman presented a shawl to the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be
Up Him and His Household)* . When he was dressed in it, someone said to
him: O Messenger of Allah! What a beautiful shawl! Please give it to me;
and he gave the shawl to him. The audience were displeased by it and
started cursing the person who had requested for the shawl: when you
knew that the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* never turns
down the request of a petitioner, then why did you ask for this shawl?
That person replied: I have taken this sheet of cloth not for wearing
but for my coffin to draw blessings from it. The words of the tradition
are as follows:

*Sahl bin Sa‘d says: A woman brought a burdah, that is, a sheet of cloth
for the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* . Sahl asked
the people: do you know what burdah is? People replied: it is a large
and open sheet of cloth. Sahl said: burdah is a kind of sheet which has
stripes in it. The woman said: O Messenger of Allah! I present (this
sheet) to you for wearing. The Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His
Household)* accepted the shawl because, under the circumstances, he
needed it. Then the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)*
wore it. One of the Companions had his eyes set on the shawl and he said
to the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* : What a graceful
sheet of cloth! Please give it to me. He said: Yes, you take it. When
the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* left, his Companions
rebuked him. They said: You haven’t done good (especially) when you saw
that the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* had accepted it and
also needed it, and you know that whenever a petition is made to the
Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* , he never turns it down.
The man replied: when the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)*
had worn it, I expected it to bring blessings to me in case I am buried
in it.[29]*

Sahl bin Sa‘d relates that he was buried in that sheet of cloth.

**4.** Jābir bin ‘Abdullāh narrates:

*The Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* went over to
‘Abdullāh bin Ubayy after he had been buried. He had his dead body taken
out, covered his mouth with his saliva and draped him in his own
shirt.[30]*

The same tradition has also been reported in a modified form:

*The Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* reached ‘Abdullāh
bin Ubayy when he had been placed inside the grave. He commanded him to
be taken out (and when he was taken out) he (the Prophet) placed him
over his knees, rubbed him with his own saliva, breathed into him and
draped him in his own shirt.[31]*

**5.** ‘Abdullāh bin ‘Umar narrates:

*When ‘Abdullāh bin Ubayy died, his son went over to the Messenger of
Allah*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* and said to him: ‘O Messenger
of Allah! I implore you to bless him with your shirt to make out of it a
coffin for him, and you offer prayer on it and also pray for his
forgiveness.’ So he gave him his shirt.[32]*

**6.** When ‘Abdullāh bin Sa‘d bin Sufyān was martyred in the battle of
Tabūk, the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* coffined him
in his own shirt.[33]

**7.** When ‘Abdullāh bin Hārith bin ‘Abd-ul-Muttalib bin Hashim died,
the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* buried him in his
own shirt-coffin and said: “He is fortunate and he has received
blessings from it.”[34]

### 11. Blessings through the Prophet’s spittle

###

In 6 Hegira, when the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)*
set out for Makkah with his devoted Companions to offer hajj, the
infidels intercepted him. Since the intention was to perform hajj, he
did not allow his Companions to be provoked, though they bubbled over
with the spirit of self-sacrifice for the divine pleasure. Meanwhile,
negotiations between the two parties were held. ‘Urwah bin Mas‘ūd (who
had not embraced Islam at that time) represented the infidels. At this
juncture, he directly witnessed the passionate attachment of the
Companions with the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* and
when he returned to his camp, he mentioned it to the infidels in these
words:

*O my nation, (the infidels of Makkah)! By God! I have attended the
courts of the kings (royal courts). I have also been to (the courts) of
Caesar, Khosrau and Najāshī, but I swear by Allah that I have never come
across a king who is revered as much by his Companions as Muhammad*(Peac
Be Up Him and His Household)* . By Allah, whenever he throws out his
spittle, it lands on the palm of some Companion or the other who rubs it
on his face or body. When he commands his Companions, they rush to
comply with it, and when he performs ablution, they even quarrel with
one another to obtain the leftover water, and when he is speaking, the
Companions lower their voices in his presence and, out of reverence,
they do not look at him straight. And surely he has made a good offer,
so you should accept it.[35]*

**2.** ‘Ā’ishah relates that the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His
Household)* used to mention in the context of patients:

*In the name of Allah, with the help of the soil of our land and the
saliva from the mouth of some of us, our patient shall recover by the
will of our God.[36]*

Ibn Hajar ‘Asqalānī’s comments on the tradition are as follows:

*“The Prophet’s words “from the saliva of some of us” prove that he used
to apply his saliva while using a protective invocation (ruqyah) over
something. Nawawī says: ‘the tradition means that the Holy Prophet*(Peac
Be Up Him and His Household)* put his saliva on his forefinger and
rubbed it on to the soil, then he froze it and applied it to the patient
or the wound and while applying it, he recited the words of the
tradition.’ Qurtubī says: ‘this tradition proves that it is valid to
treat any disease by using a protective invocation over it, and it also
makes it clear that it was a common and popular practice among them.’ He
is also of the opinion that the Prophet’s placing of his forefinger on
the soil and sprinkling it with earth justifies its relevance while
blowing protective invocation through it… And, surely, it describes the
mode of receiving blessings through the attributes of the Lord and the
relics of the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His**

**Household)* . Then blowing breath laden with protective invocation
into something and a divinely inspired sense of purpose and
determination have amazing implications which simply stun human
reason.[37]*

There are countless examples found in the authentic books on tradition
that when a child was born, the Companions brought him to the
Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* to name him and to
administer him the first food after his birth. He put his saliva into
the mouth of the newborn and thus the first thing the child’s belly
received was the Prophet’s saliva.

**3.** Asmā’ bint Abū Bakr says:

*I (while in Makkah) was pregnant with ‘Abdullāh bin Zubayr (that is, he
was in my belly). The period of pregnancy was near completion that I set
out for Medina. I got down at Qubā’ and gave birth to my son (‘Abdullāh
bin Zubayr) at Qubā’. Then I took him over to the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be
Up Him and His Household)* and placed him in his lap. He sent for a date
and chewed it. Then he put his saliva into the child’s mouth, and the
first thing that entered his stomach was the Prophet’s saliva. Then he
applied the date to his palate, prayed for him and offered his
congratulations.[38]*

**4.** Anas narrates:

*When ‘Abdullāh, the son of Abū Talhah al-Ansārī, was born, I brought
him to the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* . At that
time, he was wearing a shawl and rubbing oil on to a camel. He said:
have you got any dates? I replied, yes. Then I gave him a few dates, he
munched them with his teeth and then he put it into the child’s mouth by
opening it. The child started sucking it. He said: the Muslims of Medina
love the dates and then he named the child as ‘Abdullāh.[39]*

### 12. Blessing through the Holy Prophet’s perspiration

###

**1.** It is narrated by Thumāmah through Anas:

*That Umm Sulaym used to spread a leather mattress for the Holy
Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* where he enjoyed his midday
nap. Anas relates that when the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His
Household)* woke up, I collected his perspiration and his hair, put
these into a bottle and blended them with perfume. Thumāmah relates that
when Anas was on the brink of dying he willed that the scent be applied
to his coffin. He relates that the scent was applied to his coffin.[40]*

**2.** There is another tradition on similar lines:

*Anas bin Mālik relates that the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His
Household)* visited us and had his midday sleep. When he broke into
perspiration, my mother came up with a bottle. She wiped his sweat and
put it into the bottle. When the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His
Household)* woke up, he said to her: Umm Sulaym! What are you doing? She
replied: this is your perspiration which we will mix with our perfume
and this is the best perfume.[41]*

### 13. Blessing through the Holy Prophet’s handwash

###

It is narrated by Abū Mūsā:

*I was with the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* when he
visited Ji‘rānah, a place between Makkah and Medina. Bilāl also
accompanied him. A bedouin called on him and said to him: O Muhammad!*

*You haven’t kept your promise. He said to him: cheer up! He said: you
have repeated “cheer up!” a number of times. He turned in a state of
rage to Abū Mūsā and Bilāl and said (to them): this person has rejected
my glad tidings, but you should accept it. Both of them said: O
Messenger of Allah, we have accepted (the glad tidings). Then he sent
for a goblet full of water, washed both of his hands and face in it,
rinsed his mouth in it and then said to them: drink it and pour it over
your face and chest and cheer up. Both of them took over the goblet from
him and did as he had asked them to do. Umm Salamah called them from
behind the curtain. Leave some of it in the utensil for your mother. So
they left some water for her too.[42]*

### 14. Blessing through the Holy Prophet’s nail

###

Muhammad bin ‘Abdullāh bin Zayd has reported it from his father:

*The Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* had his hair cut
in a piece of cloth and gave it to him, out of which he distributed some
among the people, then he had his nails clipped and gave them to
him.[43]*

This tradition has a sound chain of transmission and its narrators are
men of credibility.

### 15. Blessing through the Holy Prophet’s staff

###

**1.** ‘Abdullāh bin Anīs has reported it from his father:

*When I called on the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* , he
said to me as he saw me: “The successful face (the successful man).” He
says: I said to him: O Messenger of Allah, I have killed him (Khālid bin
Sufyān). He said: You have spoken out the truth. Then the
Messenger*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* stood up beside me and
went to his house and blessed me with his staff and said: O ‘Abdullāh
bin Anīs! Keep it with you. When I came out carrying the staff, the
people asked me: what is this (staff)? He replied: this has been given
to me by the Messenger of Allah*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* and
he has commanded me to keep it. The people said: won’t you return it to
the Messenger*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* ? Ask the
Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* about it. ‘Abdullāh bin Anīs
says that I called on the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His
Household)* and asked him: O Messenger of Allah! why have you given this
staff to me? He replied: on the Day of Judgement this will serve as a
mark of recognition between us when few people will cooperate with
others. ‘Abdullāh bin Anīs tied the staff to his sword and always kept
it with himself until he passed away. He had willed about the staff that
it should be placed in his coffin, so we buried them together.[44]*

**2.** Anas bin Mālik has reported:

*That he had a short stick given to him by the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up
Him and His Household)* . When he died, it (the stick) was buried with
him, between his shirt and the side of his body.[45]*

**3.** Qādī ‘Iyād relates in as-Shifā (2:621):

Jahjāhā al-Ghifārī snatched the Prophet’s staff from ‘Uthmān’s hand,
placed it on his knee and made a sacrilegious effort to break it. But
people stalled him in his tracks by protesting, but (he was punished by
the unknown for this act), a boil broke out on his knee which turned
into a running sore. As a result, his leg was amputated and he died the
same year.

### 16. Blessing through the Prophet’s pulpit

###

Sitting on the pulpit, the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His
Household)* taught religion to his Companions. The lovers of the
Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* were extremely fond of this
pulpit and preserved it like his other relics to draw blessings from it.
Qādī ‘Iyād relates:

*Ibn ‘Umar was often seen touching with his hand the part of the pulpit
where the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* used to sit and
then rubbing his hand all over his body.[46]*

### 17. Blessing through the gold given by the Prophet (SAW)

###

It was the usual practice of the Companions that they held every object
associated with the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* even
dearer than their own life and went to extraordinary lengths not to let
it waste and to preserve it in its untarnished splendour. They saved the
dinars given to them by the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)*
and avoided spending them even in the face of the most pressing
temptation.

Jābir bin ‘Abdullāh has related:

*Once I was travelling with the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His
Household)* . Since I was riding a sluggish camel, I lagged behind
everyone. When the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* passed by
me, he asked: who are you? I said: Jābir bin ‘Abdullāh. He asked me:
what’s the matter? I replied: I am riding a sluggish camel. He asked me
for a stick and I brought the stick to him. He applied it to the camel
and reprimanded it. Then the same camel ran ahead of all others. He
wanted to buy my camel but I said: O Messenger of Allah! This is already
yours and you can have it without payment. But the Holy Prophet*(Peac Be
Up Him and His Household)* insisted on buying it and said: I have bought
it from you for four dinars, and permitted me to ride it to Medina. When
we reached Medina, he said:*

*O Bilāl! Pay (Jābir) his price, and add some more to it.*

Bilāl paid him four dinars, adding a carat of gold to the price.

Jābir bin ‘Abdullāh relates:

*The (carat of) gold given by the beloved Messenger of Allah*(Peac Be Up
Him and His Household)* never parted us. (The narrator says): and that
carat (of gold gifted by the Holy Prophet) always remained in Jābir bin
‘Abdullāh’s purse, and never left it.[47]*

### 18. Blessings through the Prophet’s hands and feet

###

**1.** Anas bin Mālik relates:

*After morning prayers, the servants of Medina brought their utensils
full of water to the Messenger of Allah*(Peac Be Up Him and His
Household)* . He dipped his finger into every utensil. Often it happened
in the mornings and he dipped his hand in it.[48]*

**2.** ‘Abdullāh bin ‘Umar narrates that he was in one of the regiments
of the Messenger of Allah*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* . People,
fighting the non-believers, fled from the battlefield and I was one of
them. Later, we repented and we decided to return to Medina and were
determined to take part in the next holy war. There, we expressed a
desire to meet the

Messenger of Allah*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* . We would stay
in Medina if our repentance were granted, otherwise we would move on to
some other place. Then we called on the Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His
Household)* and said to him: O Messenger of Allah! We are the fugitives.
He turned to us and said:

*No, you are going to join the fighting again. ‘Abdullāh bin ‘Umar
relates that (on hearing this we were very pleased,) we came closer to
him and kissed his hand. He said: I am the place of refuge for the
Muslims, (that is, I am their asylum and place of retreat. Where will
they go except coming to me, whether they are in error or not)?[49]*

**3.** Umm Abān bint Wazi‘ bin Zāri‘ has reported from her grandfather
Zāri‘ who was a member of the ‘Abd-ul-Qays delegation. He said:

*When we went to Medina, we hurried out of our vehicles and started
kissing the hands and feet of the beloved Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and
His Household)* .[50]*

**4.** Bukhārī has added the following words to the tradition narrated
by Umm Abān. According to him, her grandfather said:

*When we arrived (in Medina), we were told: over there is the Messenger
of Allah*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* . So we grasped his hands
and feet and kissed them.[51]*

**5.** Safwān bin ‘Assāl has narrated:

*A Jewish delegation kissed the hands and the feet of the Holy
Prophet*(Peac Be Up Him and His Household)* . [52]*

Summary
-------

All the traditions discussed in the preceding pages are sound as they
have been taken over from the certified and authentic books of
traditions. They furnish ample and irrefutable evidence that the relics
of the prophets and the saints are an effective source of divine
blessings. The Companions, who preserved them meticulously, did not use
them as display counters; on the contrary, they prayed to God through
their mediation for averting calamities. Besides, they also prove that
the Companions drew blessings from them and achieved higher objectives.
