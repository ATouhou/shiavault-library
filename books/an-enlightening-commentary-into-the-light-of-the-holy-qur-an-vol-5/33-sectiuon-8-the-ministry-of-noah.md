Sectiuon 8: The Ministry of Noah
================================

Noah's exhortations to his people to serve Allah alone – The people
belied him and were drowned

Surah Al-‘A’raf, Verses 59 - 60
-------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحًا إِلَى قَوْمِهِ فَقَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُواْ
اللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرُهُ إِنِّيَ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ
عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ الْمَلأُ مِن قَوْمِهِ إِنَّا لَنَرَاكَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ
  </p>

**59.** ***"Indeed We sent Noah to his people, so he said: 'O my people!
Serve*** Allah***. You have no god other than Him. Verily I fear for you
the chastisement of a grievous day."***  
**60.** ***"The chiefs of his people said: 'Verily we do see you in
manifest error."***

The example of ***'that which is bad springs up nothing',*** which was
referred to in the previous verse, was the people of Noah, to whom
whatever he (as) advised he got nothing.

The story of the people of Noah has been mentioned in the Qur'an in
Suras: Al-' A'hqaf, As-Saffat, Al-'Isra', al-A'hzab, Yunus, Al-Mu'minun,
Al-Ghamar, and Noah.

However, the beginning thing that prophets invite to, is the invitation
to Unity and theology. This is in common for the believers in all Divine
religions.

***"Indeed We sent Noah to his people, so he said: 'O my people!
Serve*** ***Allah*** ***you have no god other than Him. ..."***

Prophets are the true sympathizers of human beings. The verse continues
the statement of Noah, saying:

***"...Verily I fear for you the chastisement of a grievous day."***

Anyhow, this fact should be pointed out that the invitation of Noah was
worldly, since all the people of the world in that time were the people
of Noah. Then when he cursed, all the disbelievers throughout the world
were involved in his curse, and they were drowned entirely.

The Qur'an narrates the supplication of Noah, thus:

***" And Noah said: My Lord! leave not upon the earth any dweller from
among the unbelievers'."*** [^1]

The opponents of prophets have always been some groups of notable ones
among the chiefs of the rich whose dazzling glare has filled the eyes of
people.

***"The chiefs of his people said. ..."***

To know prophets as the misguided ones is worse than to disbelieve in
them. When the nature of some people is transformed, they consider a
true guide as a misguided one.

Now, in twenty first century, the world of atheism imagine themselves as
the ones of a sound and serene mind, while they introduce the adherents
of divine religions and prophets as some reactionists and simple-minded
people.

He who pursues the theical system and tries to root out the system of
paganism, should expect to face with any slunder, accusation, and
affront.

***"... 'Verily we see you in manifest error'."***

Surah Al-‘A’raf, Verses 61 - 62
-------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ لَيْسَ بِي ضَلاَلَةٌ وَلَكِنِّي رَسُولٌ مِّن رَّبِّ
الْعَالَمِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أُبَلِّغُكُمْ رِسَالاَتِ رَبِّي وَأَنصَحُ لَكُمْ وَأَعْلَمُ مِنَ
اللّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**61.** ***"He said: ' O' my people! There is no error in me, but I am a
Messenger from the Lord of the worlds."***  
**62.** ***"I deliver to you the Messages of my Lord, and I advise you
sincerely, and I know from*** ***Allah*** ***what you do not know."***

In response to the affront and harshness of the opponents, Noah, with a
calm, firm, and tender tone, said that not only he was not misguided,
but also there was no sign of misguidance in him. He added that he was a
messenger of Allah*,* the Lord of the worlds. The verse says:

***"He said: 'O' my people! There is no error in me, but I am a
Messenger from the Lord of the worlds."***

This phrase is a hint to the fact that all the different gods they
believed in were in vain.

The Lord of the whole people and the things of the world is Allah*,* the
only One God, Who is the Creator of all of them.

Noah (as) continued saying that his aim was to perform the mission of
his Lord perfectly and to convey His revealed Messages to them. The holy
verse says:

***"I deliver you the Messages of my Lord....."***

He told the opponents that he would do his best for them in the path of
benevolence.

***"... and I advise you sincerely....."***

Then, finally Noah added that:

***".... and I know from*** ***Allah*** ***what you do not know."***

This phrase may be a threat against their oppositions, indicating that
he knew some painful punishments for the evil doers that they were not
aware of yet. And also it points to the grace and mercy of Allah that if
they paved the way of obedience he would know some blessings and rewards
from him that they did not know, as well as the greatness and vastness
of them.

Surah Al-‘A’raf, Verse 63
-------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَوَعَجِبْتُمْ أَن جَاءكُمْ ذِكْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَلَى رَجُلٍ
مِّنكُمْ لِيُنذِرَكُمْ وَلِتَتَّقُواْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**63.** ***"What! do you wonder that an admonition has come to you from
your Lord through a man from among you, that he might warn you so that
you might keep from evil and so that (His) mercy may be shown to
you?"***

The Divine statement inquires:

***"What! do you wonder that an admonition hay come to you from your
Lord through a man from among you, that he might warn you so that you
might keep from evil and so that (His) mercy may be shown to you?"***

The verse implies that you should not surprise that the Divine
statement, the prophet hood and the messenger ship have been sent down
upon a man who is from among yourselves in order that he warns you of
the divine retribution if you do not believe.

When the verse implies that you should not surprise, it is for the
reason that .if a person sincerely and sympathetically arises for the
guidance and improvement of a community, it is not surprising.

The wonder is in this that people do not have pity on themselves, and
they supply the means of their own wretchedness. Moreover, prophet hood
is assigned for the interest of people. It adapts the wisdom and common
good, and besides that intellect confirms it, too.

However, the purpose of coming Noah was that those people to avoid
infidelity and sinning, so that they be shown mercy to.

Surah Al-‘A’raf, Verse 64
-------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَنجَيْنَاهُ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ فِي الْفُلْكِ
وَأَغْرَقْنَا الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ
قَوْماً عَمِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**64.** ***"But they belied him, so We delivered him and those with him
in the Ark, and We drowned those who belied Our Signs. Verily they were
a blind people."***

As a result of the very undue wonder, the people of Noah rejected him.
Therefore, Allah delivered him and those believers who were in Noah's
Ark from being drowned, and, thereafter, He drowned all those who belied
Noah and the Divine revelations. They were some blind-hearted people,
and they were misguided.

***"But they belied him, so We delivered him and those with him in the
Ark, and We drowned those who belied Our Signs. Verily they were a blind
people."***

The Arabic word / 'amin / is the plural form of / 'amy /. It is applied
upon a person whose insight and innate vision are unable to do their
functions.[^2]
