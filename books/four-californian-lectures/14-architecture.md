Architecture
============

One of those aspects is architecture. Lotus is a very outstanding and
holy motif in Indian culture. You must have seen pictures of the statues
of Gautama Buddha in which he is shown sitting on lotus. Sometimes Shiva
and Krishna are shown in the same position. It has its roots in the old
legends and myths, going back to Brahma. When the Muslims settled in
India, they brought dome and minaret from Middle East and Turkey. But
the domes built by them in the early periods were, like those of the
Middle East, simplistic in design.

Then the process of mutual give-and-take began, until we come to the
ultimate poetry in marble, which is known as Taj Mahal, pictures of
which you must have seen everywhere. If you study the upper section of
its dome, you will see that the architects have capped it with inverted
lotus. Thus by combining the Muslim dome and Hindu lotus, they have
created the master-piece of Indian architecture, which is rightfully
called the eighth wonder of the world.

 We also find many features and designs in Muslim buildings in India
which show the influence of the ancient culture that was prevalent in
India.
