O' Gracious Lord
================

We pray to Thee, O' Gracious Lord

Of heavens and of earth

The source of virtue and of love

Of dignity and worth.

You are the One who nourishes

All things both big and small

The Omnipotent, Loving, Kind

And Mighty Lord of all.

O Bountiful! We pray to Thee

For health and happiness

Be pleased to grant us faith and love

Good fortune and success.

Be kind enough to make us tread

The path of righteousness

And let our deeds reflect the same

By words what we profess.
