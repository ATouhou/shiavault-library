The Holy Prophet
================

Follow your **Prophet**, the best of the

good and purest of pure, may

God bless him and his Household.

He is the example for one to follow,

and comfort for one

who seeks happiness.

The most beloved of servants to God

is one who follows His Prophet

and walks in his footsteps.

He, may God bless him and his

Household,

would sit on the ground

when eating food,

and he would sit like a slave.

He would mend his shoes with his own

hands

and patched his clothes himself.

(Sermon 160)
