THE CLEVER BOY
A man with his donkey carrying two sacks of wheat was on his way to

the market. After a little while he was tired and they rested under a
tree.

When he woke up from his nap he could not see the donkey and started

searching for the donkey everywhere. On the way he met a boy, he

asked the boy, “Have you seen my donkey?” The boy asked, “Is the

donkey’s left eye blind, his right foot lame and is he carrying a load
of

wheat?” The man was happy and said, “Yes, exactly! Where have you

seen it?” the boy answered “I haven’t seen it.” This made the man very

angry and he took the boy to the village chief for punishment.

The judge asked, “Dear boy, if you had not seen at the donkey, how

could you describe it?” The boy answered, “I saw the tracks of a donkey

and the right and left tracks were different from this I understood that

the donkey that passed there was limping. And the grass on the right

side of the road was eaten but the grass on the left was not. From that
I

understood that his left eye was blind. There were wheat seeds scattered

on the ground and I understood that he must have been carrying a load of
wheat. The judge

understood the boy’s cleverness and told the man to forgive the boy.

This story teaches us that we should not be quick to judge the people.
