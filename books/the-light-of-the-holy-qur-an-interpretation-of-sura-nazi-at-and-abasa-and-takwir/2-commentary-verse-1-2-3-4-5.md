**Commentary:**

By The Angels Who Try Hard:

There are five important matters sworn to in the above verses and whose
aim is to settle the rightfulness and certainty of the Resurrection.

"By those (angels) who tear out (the souls of the wicked) with
violence,"

\* \* \* \*

"By those (angels) who gently draw out (the souls of the blessed) ";

\* \* \* \*

And by those(who glide along (on errands of mercy) ",

Then press forward as in a race,

\* \* \* \*

And these who manage the affair,

First, some particular terms used in these verses should be made clear
before we proceed with the commentary of the verses.

The word /nazi'at/ is based on 'naza'a' which means 'to pluck out', or
'to draw out somewhat sharply, like drawing a bow to shoot arrows'. This
word is sometimes used for spiritual matters, such as the detachment of
enmity or love from the heart.

The term /qaraqa/, according to many philologists, means 'to sink, the
act of drowning' and sometimes it has been used in the sense of 'being
entirely busy in an event or a disaster'.

Or, the term /qarq/, according to Ibn-Manzur in Lisan-al-Arab, is a
noun replacing the infinitive with the meaning of /iqraq/ 'to
exaggerate' which originally means 'to draw a bow to the extreme
possible point', hence, to exagerate in anything.

This clearly shows that, in the above verse, the word does not mean 'to
sink, or to drown', but it means 'to do something to the exreme
end'.(1)

The term /nashitat/ is derived from /nasht/ which originally means 'to
untie the knots which are easily unfastened'. 'A shallow well', from
which the bucket can be drawn easily at one pull, is called /inshat/. 'A
camel which is instigated by a subtle hint and moves very fast' is
called /nashitah/ Therefore, this word is generally used in any case
where a movement is fluently done.

The term /sabihat/ I is based on /sabh/ which means 'a quick movement
in water or air'. Hence, it is applied to swimming, or a swimming
motion, or a swift gallop, or to perform a daily affair, quickly. The
word /tasbih/ 'to praise Allah' is from the same root, as if the one who
praises Allah goes quickly forward in worship of the Lord.

The term /sabiqat/ is derived from /sabqah/ which means 'to precede'
and since the action is usually impossible without full speed, this term
is sometimes used in the sense of 'speed', too.

(1) Kisan-al-Arab; Majma'-al-Bayan, The Commentary; Kashshaf, The
Commentary; and Majma'-AL-Bahrayn.

The term /mudabbirat/ is based on /tadbir/ which means 'to mediate
upon, or consider the end of an action', and since foresight causes one
to arrange his affairs in a better manner, this word is used here in
that sense.

Now, with due attention to what was explained about the words
concerning the verses, we are going to proceed with the commentary.

To whom or to what do these five oaths refer? The oaths, at first
sight, seem rather ambiguous, while at the same time this ambiguity
stimulates us to mediate more deeply and thus causes our progressive
thinking.

In this regard, commentators have given many different ideas and
commentaries which mainly revolve around three points:

1. The oaths are aimed at 'angels' who are ordered to tear out the
souls of the wicked and the pagan, violently; those souls who have never
assumed to submit to the Truth and to the angels who are appointed to
draw out the souls of the blessed, gently and smoothly.

Then, it refers to the angels who move fast and fluently to carry out
the Divine Command. And in so doing, they race each other to fulfill
their errands.

Finally, they arrange the affairs according to Allah's plan.

2. The oaths refer to the 'stars' which continually set on one horizon
and rise above another.

A group of them moves slowly, but another goes swiftly, from one place
to another, with speed. They are floating above us in immense space,
taking the lead one after another.

And finally, these stars, having their own influence and effects (like
the effect of su!1ight and moonlight on the Earth) , arrange the affairs
according to Allah's plan.

3. The oaths are aimed at the fighters of 'Holy War' (Jihad) , or at
their horses, and who leave their own houses and cities with expressive
grief, but, then they smoothly and happily leave for the battlefield
taking the lead one after another directing and running the affairs of
war.

On occasion, some commentators have tried to combine these three ideas
by choosing one part from one commentary and another part from another
one, but the framework is the same. (1)

(1) A fourth point of probability cited refer' to the natural movements
of creatures in the world.

There is no contrast, of course, among these commentaries and it is
possible that the above verses refer to all of them. But, on the whole,
the first commentary, regarding its suitability to the main theme,
Resurrection, and with the traditions by the sinless Imams, seems to be
the most fitting.
