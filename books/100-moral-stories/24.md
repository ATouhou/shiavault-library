BENJAMIN DISRAELI
Children are remarkably perceptive. Their eyes ever observe, their ears
ever listen, and their minds

ever process the messages they absorb. If they see us patiently provide
a happy home atmosphere

for family members, they will imitate that attitude for the rest of
their lives. The wise parent

realizes that every day the building blocks are being laid for the
child’s future. Let’s be wise builders

and role models.

“Life is about people connecting with people, and making a positive
difference.

Take care of yourself, and those you love, today, and everyday!”
