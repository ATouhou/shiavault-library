Lesson One Hundred Thirty Seven: Inhabitants Of Stars
=====================================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
هذِهِ النُّجُومُ الَّتى فِى السَّماءِ مَدائِنٌ مِثْلُ الْمَدائِنِ
الَّتى فِى الاَرْضِ مَرْبُوطَةٌ كُلُّ مَدِينَة اِلى عَمُود مِنْ نُور
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

These stars in the heaven are cities like the cities of earth. Each of
the cities is connected (with the other cities) through a column of
light.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

It is very selfish to suppose that our earth is the only inhabitable
planet and millions of other celestial planets are all underutilized,
silent and without any inhabitant.

Today, we know of detailed scientific studies into the conditions
required for life to exist on other planets which suggest that millions
and millions of these may be inhabited and it is likely that many of
them may enjoy more developed civilizations because life had started
there thousands or millions of years before it did on the earth. Such
scientific knowledge did not exist fourteen centuries ago and hence the
above tradition of Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) is nothing less than a miracle.
