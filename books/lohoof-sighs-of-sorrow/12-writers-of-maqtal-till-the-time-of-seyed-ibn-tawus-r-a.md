Writers of Maqtal Till the Time of Seyed Ibn Tawus (r.a.)
=========================================================

Yazeed and his men were not the only persons who fought with Hussain
(a.s.). The rulers who came to power after Yazeed were against those who
had affection for the companions of Hussain (a.s.), and they tried to
cover up the events of Karbala, or to alter and erase them. But the Lord
decided to complete His Radiance, though the polytheists do not like it.
Yet right from the time of the event many persons have written a number
of books on this subject in various manners and in different
languages.

Unfortunately most of the old books on the subject of Maqtal have not
remained except their very names and titles. They have been burnt,
stolen, or destroyed. This has been done with the intention that Hussain
(a.s.) and his uprising may not encourage liberty-loving people to fight
oppression. What has reached us from the old writings is very little or
history has mentioned very less about it.

In this chapter the names of those persons have been listed who have,
since the event of Karbala upto the time of Sayyid Ibne Tâwûs or the
time of writing this Maqtal book, written about the martyrdom in
Karbala. (1) Abul Qâsim Asbagh bin Nubâta Majâshai Tamimi Hanzali He is
from the close friends (Khawâs) and companions of Amirul Momineen
(a.s.). He is also one of the Shurtatul Khamees (security) who lived for
a long time after Ali (a.s.) and expired after 100 A.H. He has written
Maqtale Husain and apparently he must be the first to write a book on
this topic - Allâh knows best.

Al-Fehrist: 37-38 Sh. 108, Az-Zariah: 22/23-24, Sh 5838

(2) Abu Makhnaf Lut bin Yahya bin Saeed bin Makhnaf bin Salâm Azadi
Ghamidi He is a known personality and one of the chiefs of knowledgeable
men of Kufa. He quotes Ja?far bin Muhammad (a.s.) and his statement,
that he narrates from Abu Ja?far (a.s.), appears to be true. In the
opinion of Kishi he is among the companions of Amirul Momineen, Hasan
and Husain (a.s.). But what is correct is that his father was a
companion of Amirul Momineen (a.s.) and that he himself did not meet him
(Ali). He has written Maqtale Husain - Qatlul Husain (a.s.).

The book Maqtalul Husain that was printed recently in the name of Abi
Makhnaf is, doubtlessly, not his book but rather belongs to the later
writers. Some of the later writers raise a doubt that this work might be
of Seyed Ibne Tâwûs and that he took it from Maqtal Abi Makhnaf and made
some additions and omissions in it. About Maqtale Abi Makhnaf we do not
have anything at hand except whatever has come down in Tarikh -e-
Tabari.
