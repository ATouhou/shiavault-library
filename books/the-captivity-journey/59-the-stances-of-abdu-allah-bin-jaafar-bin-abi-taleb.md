The Stances of Abdu Allah Bin Jaafar Bin Abi Taleb
==================================================

Abdu Allah Bin Jaafar had some noble stances after the tragedy of
Karbala and the martyrdom of his two sons, and they were Awn and
Mohammad, while being with their uncle Abu Abdu Allah Al-Hussain (Q).

Thus to explain his absenteeism from Karbala, someone can rely on what
was mentioned in "Ziyarat Al-Nahiya Al-Moqaddasa" that is attributed to
Imam Al-Hujja (Q), where he said about his son: "Peace be up on Mohammad
the son of Abdu Allah Bin Jaafar, who was present on behalf of his
father", to conclude that perhaps he had an excuse, that we are not
aware of, which prevented him from attending.

When Abdu Allah Bin Jaafar Bin Abi Taleb got the news of his two sons’
death while being on Hussain’s (Q) side, some of his loyalists came in
to his house while there were other people consoling him. So, Aba
Alleslas said to him: "This is what we got and gained from Al-Hussain".
Just then Abdu Allah Bin Jaafar threw his shoes at him and then said: "O
son of Lakhnaa!28 Do you say this about Al-Hussain? By Allah, if I was
with him, I would have loved not to leave him unless I die for his sake,
I swear to God that is my only consolation and what eases my sorrow for
their death is that they were killed with my brother and cousin while
facing the same destiny as him and tolerating the same suffering".

Then he turned to his guests and said: "Thank God the Al-Mighty Who had
comforted me for not being with Hussain by having my two sons there for
him instead".
