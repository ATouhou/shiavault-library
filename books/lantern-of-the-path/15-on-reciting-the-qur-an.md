On Reciting the Qur'an
======================

Whoever recites the Qur'an and does not humble himself before Allah,
whose heart is not softened, nor regret and fear provoked within him,
undervalues the immensity of Allah's affair and is in a clear state of
loss.

The person who recites the Qur'an needs three things: a fearful heart,
a tranquil and receptive body, and an appropriate place to recite. When
his heart fears Allah, then the accursed Satan flees from him. As Allah
said,


<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَإِذَا قَرَأْتَ الْقُرْآنَ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللّهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ
الرَّجِيمِ
  </p>
</blockquote>



***When you recite the Qur'an, seek refuge with Allah from the accursed
Shaytan.*** (16:98)


When he frees himself of all attachments, then his heart is devoted to
recitation, and nothing impedes him from obtaining the blessing of the
light of the Qur'an and its benefits. When he finds an empty place and
withdraws from people, having acquired the two qualities of humility of
heart and tranquility of body, then his soul and his innermost being
will feel communion with Allah, and he will discover the sweetness of
how Allah speaks to His right-acting bondsmen, how He shows His
gentleness, to them and singles them out for all the varieties of His
marks of honour and wondrous signs. If he drinks a cup of this drink, he
will never prefer any other state to this nor any other moment to this.
He will prefer this to every act of obedience and devotion, since it
contains intimate conversation with the Lord, without any
intermediary.

So beware of how you read the Book of your Lord, the guardian to whom
you aspire, how you respond to His commands and avoid His prohibitions,
and how you observe His limits, for it is a mighty Book: Falsehood shall
not come to it from before it nor from behind it,

Therefore recite it in an orderly manner and contemplatively and adhere
to the limits of His promise and His threat. Reflect on its examples and
warnings. Beware of paying undue respect to the recitation of its
letters while failing to observe the legal limits contained therein.
