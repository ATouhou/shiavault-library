Lesson Twenty Eight: Signs of a Hypocrite
=========================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

Luqman said to his son:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لِمُنافِقِ ثَلاثُ عَلامات: يُخَالِفُ لِسانُهُ قَلْبَهُ وَ قَلْبُهُ
فِعْلَهُ وَ عَلانِيَتُهُ سَرِيْرَتَهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

There are three signs of the hypocrites : their tongue is not consistent
with their heart, nor their heart with their deed , nor their outward
with their inward.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Hypocrisy is a painful , loathsome trait originating from low
personality and weak will. To make themselves look better than they are
, their tongues will tell a different story from what is in their
hearts, they will not walk their talk, will not practice what they
preach. They are a weak people , afraid to reveal their true selves ,
lacking the will and determination to improve themselves. They appear in
different garbs and are treacherous with everybody, even themselves.
Even more dangerous are the societies that display a good looking
exterior but have bad, rotting , interior. Their tongue and the mass
media, is in stark contrast with what is going on in the heart of these
societies.
