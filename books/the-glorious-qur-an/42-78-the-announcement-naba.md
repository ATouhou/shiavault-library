78: the Announcement (naba)
===========================

This chapter containing 40 short, early Meccan verses was revealed after
Staircases Upward 70. It deals with cosmogony or the subject of how the
world was created in section i; still in the first section we hear the
Last Trumpet announcing the final judgment, which continues in ii. It
achieves this message with a stirring yet quiet dignity, especially
towards the end. Again the mood is assisted by rhyme or assonance.

Chapter 78 also marks the beginning of Part XXX, the final and most
lyric part of the Qur'an. This follows the traditional manner of
dividing the sacred text into equal divisions for the purpose of
continuous reading or recitation especially during Ramadan, the month of
Fasting.
