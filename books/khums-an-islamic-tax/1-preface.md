Preface
=======

Since khums is an issue with which a Shi\`ah Muslim is faced at least
once in a year, the need for a simple and, at the same time,
comprehensive book on this subject has been felt in our community since
a long time. And therefore, when this booklet was published in 1984 in
Vancouver, it was, al-hamdu lil-lah, very well received.

In 1990, I revised and expanded the previous editions. A few pages were
added dealing with the verse of khums (in Chapter One), and also the
usage of khums during the days of the Prophet and the Imams of Ahlul
Bayt (in Chapter Four). These additions will give the reader a brief
look into the history of khums. Obviously, the size and purpose of the
booklet did not allow me to deal with this aspect of khums
comprehensively. A chapter has also been added at the end to express my
thoughts about some of the moral and "political" sides of khums.

Finally, some practical issues related to khums were also added in
Chapter Two for those who live in the West.

I hope this edition proves more useful to the members of our community.

Wa ma tawfiqi illa bi 'l-Lah.
