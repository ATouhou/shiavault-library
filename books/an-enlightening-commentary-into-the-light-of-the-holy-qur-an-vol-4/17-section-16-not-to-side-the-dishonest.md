Section 16: Not to side the dishonest
=====================================

Surah An-Nisa', Verse 105
-------------------------

Not to take up the cause of the dishonest -the Apostle may pray for his
followers-Forgiveness of Allah always there is for those who seek it
after evil with the necessary amendment.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ لِتَحْكُمَ بَيْنَ
النَّاسِ بِمَا أَرَاكَ اللّهُ وَلاَ تَكُن لِّلْخَآئِنِينَ خَصِيمًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

**105.** ***"Verily We have sent down the Book to you with that you may
judge between people by what Allah has shown (taught) you. And be not an
advocate for the treacherous."***

Basing on what is recorded in some authentic commentary books, once it
happened that, in one of the battles, a Muslim stole a chain mail.

When he was going to be marked by ignominy, he threw the chain mail into
the house of a Jew, and then gathered some men saying that the Jewish
person was a thief, not that Muslim. The subject was brought to the
Prophet (S) and the verse was revealed, announcing such:

***"Verily We have sent down the Book to you with the Truth that you may
judge between people by what Allah has shown (taught) you..."***

In this verse, at first Allah recommends the Prophet (S) that the
purpose of sending down this heavenly Book is that these rules of the
truth and equity should be practiced among people. It says:

***"Verily We have sent down the Book to you with the Truth that you may
judge between people by what Allah has shown (taught) you. ..."***

Then, it awares the Prophet (S) by saying that:

*"... And be not an advocate for the treacherous."*

It is cited in Majma'-ul-Bayan (vol. 6, p. 32 Persian translation) that
although this verse addresses the Prophet (S), the target is the Ummat
of the Prophet (S) not the Prophet himself, because, upon the consensus
of Ummat, the Prophet (S) is immaculate from all sins and disgraces.

Therefore, since the revelation of the Qur'an is based on the truth, the
judgements should be performed upon the basis of the truth, too, not
upon the relations. Thus, in Islam, treating on justice is also
necessary even towards a non-Muslim person, (regarding to the occasion
of revelation of the verse).

Surah An-Nisa', Verse 106
-------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَاسْتَغْفِرِ اللّهَ إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

**106.** "***And seek forgiveness of Allah. Verily Allah*** *is*
***Forgiving, Merciful."***

In this holy verse, the Prophet (S) is commanded that he seeks the
forgiveness of Allah, for certainly Allah *(s.w.t.)* is forgiving and l
merciful.

Yet, as it was mentioned in the commentary of the previous verse, cited
by the author of Majma'-ul-Bayan, that the verse was addressing the
Prophet's Ummat, here, too, it means to seek forgiveness for the Ummat,
and we know that the Prophet (S) is free from any fault. The verse says:

***"And seek forgiveness of Allah. Verily Allah is Forgiving,
Merciful."***

Surah An-Nisa', Verse 107
-------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلاَ تُجَادِلْ عَنِ الَّذِينَ يَخْتَانُونَ أَنفُسَهُمْ إِنَّ اللّهَ
لاَ يُحِبُّ مَن كَانَ خَوَّانًا أَثِيمًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

**107.** ***"And do not plead on behalf of those who deceive themselves.
Verily Allah does not love any who is treacherous, sinful."***

The leaders of Islam and Muslims ought to find the treacherous ones and
know their plans, so that they can decide on a suitable situation for
themselves. However, injustice and treachery unto people is doing wrong
to oneself.

Treachery pollutes the society and this social pollution reaches
ourselves. Then, pleading a treacherous person is unlawful, and it is
considered as participating in the crime and being content with the
treachery.

***"And do not plead on behalf of those who deceive themselves..."***

We should know, of course, that the state of the slight treacheries,
which are done unknowingly and gullibly, is different from the state of
the treachery of the mischievous conspirators. (The Arabic words /
yakhtanun/ (those who deceive), /khawwan/ (treacherous), and /'asima/
(sinful) indicate to a state of permanent treachery.) Then in this
verse, it says:

***"... Verily Allah does not love any who is treacherous, sinful."***

Surah An-Nisa', Verse 108
-------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَلاَ يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ اللّهِ وَهُوَ
مَعَهُمْ إِذْ يُبَيِّتُونَ مَا لاَ يَرْضَى مِنَ الْقَوْلِ وَكَانَ
اللّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

**108.** ***"They (the treacherous) hide from people but they hide not
from Allah; while He is with them when they hold nightly discourses that
do not please Him. And Allah encompasses what they do."***

*Allah (s.w.t.)* blames the treacherous ones in this verse. The verse
says they shrink from people that the inward of their deeds be
manifested, but they are not ashamed of *Allah!*

***"They (the treacherous) hide from people but they hide not from
Allah..."***

*Allah,* the One Who is Omnipresent, is always with them. So, at that
time of night, when they are designing some treacherous plans and saying
some words that are displeasing unto Him, He is with them and is aware
of whatever they do. It says:

***"...while He is with them when they hold nightly discourses that do
not please Him. And Allah encompasses what they do."***

Surah An-Nisa', Verse 109
-------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
هَاأَنتُمْ هَـؤُلاء جَادَلْتُمْ عَنْهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا
فَمَن يُجَادِلُ اللّهَ عَنْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَم مَّن يَكُونُ
عَلَيْهِمْ وَكِيلاً
  </p>
</blockquote>

**109.** ***"(Suppose that) you pleaded for them in this worldly life,
but who will plead for them with Allah on the Day of Resurrection, or
who shall be their protector?"***

In these three holy verses, the Qur'an gives three warnings to three
groups:

It tells the judge not to transgress the bounds of right:

***"... That you may judge between people by what Allah has shown
(taught) you ..."*** [^1]

It tells the treacherous one that *Allah* observes his deeds:

***"…He is with them…."*** [^2]

In the above verse, it tells the defenders of the treacherous that their
efforts will be useless for the Day of Judgement.

***"Suppose that) you pleaded for them in this worldly life, but who
will plead for them with Allah on the Day of Resurrection.....?"***

Surah An-Nisa', Verse 110
-------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءًا أَوْ يَظْلِمْ نَفْسَهُ ثُمَّ يَسْتَغْفِرِ اللّهَ
يَجِدِ اللّهَ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

**110.** ***"And whoever does evil or acts unjustly to his own self;
then seeks forgiveness of Allah, shall find Allah Forgiving,
Merciful."***

The Qur'anic word /su/, in philology, means 'to harm others', too. Thus,
the verse refers to both being unjust to people and being cruel to
oneself.

***"And whoever does evil or acts unjustly to his own self..."***

The previous verse, criticized the treacherous and protection of the
treacherous. Here, in this verse, it states the way of rescue from it.
The Qur'an says that gate of the path of return is open to the wrong
doers. Now, it is they who should decide and return from doing sin and
repent. It says:

***"….then seeks forgiveness of Allah, shall find Allah Forgiving,
Merciful."***

Surah An-Nisa', Verse 111
-------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَن يَكْسِبْ إِثْمًا فَإِنَّمَا يَكْسِبُهُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ وَكَانَ
اللّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

**111.** ***"And whoever commits a sin, indeed he commits it only
against his own self and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise."***

Sin, which is a transgression against the bound of Divine law, destroys
the inner purity, virtue of the spirit, and justice; and this very
effect is the greatest damage. In the system of existence and also in
*Allah's* way of treatment, the result of injustice toward people, soon
or late, reaches to our own selves.

***"And whoever commits a sin, indeed he commits it only against his own
self…."***

And, at the end of the verse, it implies that the Lord is both
All-Knowing, and is aware of all the deeds of the servants, and is
All-Wise, and punishes every wrong doer fitting with whatever the one
deserves. It says:

***"... and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise."***

Surah An-Nisa', Verse 112
-------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَن يَكْسِبْ خَطِيئَةً أَوْ إِثْمًا ثُمَّ يَرْمِ بِهِ بَرِيئًا
فَقَدِ احْتَمَلَ بُهْتَانًا وَإِثْمًا مُّبِينًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

**112.** ***"And whoever commits a fault or a sin, then accuses of it an
innocent, he indeed burdens (himself) with the calumny and a manifest
sin."***

This verse has pointed to the importance of committing the sin of
calumny upon some innocent people. It says:

***"And whoever commits a fault or a sin, then accuses of it an
innocent, he indeed burdens (himself) with the calumny and a manifest
sin."***

### Calumny is a Crime

To denigrate an innocent is one of the most disgraceful actions that
Islam has seriously condemned.

It has been narrated from the Prophet of Islam (S) who said: "The one
who slander a believing man or woman, or says something about them which
is not in him (her), on the Day of Resurrection Allah sets the one on a
heap of fire until he (she) comes out (of the responsibility) of what
the one has said." [^3]

Indeed, making current this unjust manner as a custom in a society
causes to disturb the order and probity of that society, to pollute the
truth unto untruth, the innocent be involved into difficulty and the
sinner be saved, and the common confidence be vanished.
