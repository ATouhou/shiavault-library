Haroun Rashid Gives  Bahlool A Reward
=====================================

One day Haroun Rashid gave the order to give Bahlool a reward. When it
was given, Bahlool didn't take it and returned it. He said, “Give this
money to the people whom you took it from. If you don't return it to
their owners, then there will certainly come a day when the Khalifa will
be demanded to repay his debt. That day the Khalifa will be
empty-handed, and, besides being shameful and regretful, there will be
nothing.”

Haroun Rashid trembled from listening to Bahlool, started crying, and
affirmed Bahlool's statement.
