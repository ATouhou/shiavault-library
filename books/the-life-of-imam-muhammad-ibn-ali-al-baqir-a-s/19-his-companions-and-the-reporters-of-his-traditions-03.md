one of the companions of Imam al-Baqir and of al-Sadiq, peace be on
them. In the biography of Salim bin Abï Hafs, al-Kashi reported on the

who said: [I said to Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir) that Salim b. Abï Hafsa asked
me: ‘Have you not heard that whoever dies and has no Imam dies as those
before Islam died?’ ‘Yes,’ replied. ‘Who is your Imam?’ he asked me. ‘My
Imams are the family of Mohammed, may Allah bless him and his family,’ I
replied. ‘By Allah, I think you do not know your Imam,’ he said. Abu
Ja‘far (al-Baqir), peace be on him, said: ‘Woe unto Salim! Does he know
what the rank of the Imam is? It is greater and better than what Salim
and all the people think.’” In the biography of Zyyad b. ‘Isa, al-Kashi

176. Zyyad bin ‘Isa
-------------------

He was from Kufa. He sold fine cloth. He was among the companions of

He was given the kunya of Abu al-Jarud. He was called al-Hamadani,
al-Kharifi, al-A’ma (the blind one). He said : “I was born blind. I have
never seen the world.”[^13] He reported on the authority of Imam

him. He has an origin (book), and he has the Book of al-Tafsïr. He
learned the book from Imam al-Baqir. His doctrine was Zaydi. The Zaydi
Jarudis are ascribed to him.[^14] He has been dispraised in many
traditions. Abu Usama reported on the authority of Abu ‘Abd Allah
(al-Sadiq), peace be on him, who said: “Abu al-Jarud will not die but
astray.” Abu Basïr reported on the authority of Abu ‘Abd Allah
(al-Sadiq), peace be on him, who said: “ Kathïr al-Nawa, Salim bin Abï
Hafs, and Abu al-Jarud are liars and unbelievers. May Allah curse them.”

Imam al-Khu’i regarded this tradition as weak. He regarded Abu al-Jarud
as reliable. For Abu al-Jarud has been mentioned in the chain of the
authorities of “Kamil al-Zyyarat”. His author, Mohammed b. Ja‘far b.
Qolwayh, testified the truthfulness of all the narrators of his book.
Besides, in “al-Risala al-Adadiya”, shaykh al-Mufïd said: “He (Abu
al-Jarud) was among the main figures, from whom (the people) took the
lawful, the unlawful, religious opinions, and legal precepts, whom no
one slanders and dispraises.

In his Tafsïr, ‘Ali b. Ibrahim testified the truthfulness of all those
who have been mentioned in his chain of authorities. He (Zyyad) reported
on the authority of Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir), peace be on him. Kuthayr b.
Abbas reported on his authority the explanation of the words of Him, the
Exalted: “When the angels said: O Mariam, surely Allah gives you good
news with a Word from Him (of one) whose name is the Messih, ‘Isa son of
Mariam.”

Imam al-Khu’i added: [Then Shaykh al-Saduq said:] “My father related to
us on the authority of Mohammed b. al-Husayn b. Abï al-Khattab, on the
authority of al-Husayn b. Mahbub, on the authority of Abu al-Jarud, on
the authority of Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir), on the authority of Jabir b.
‘Abd Allah al-Ansari, who said: ‘I come to Fatima (the Prophet’s
daughter). There was a tablet between her hands. The names of the
trustees (of the Prophet) were in the tablet (lawh). She numbered twelve
(trustees). The last of them was al-Qaa’im (the one who will rise), may
Allah quicken his appearance. Three of them were with the name of
Mohammed. Four of them were with the name of ‘Ali, peace be on
them.”[^15]

182. Zayyd al-Shahham

He was given the kunya of Abu Usama. He was called al-Azdi al-Kufi.
Shaykh al-Tusi numbered him as one of the companions of Imam al-Baqir,
peace be on him, and of al-Sadiq, peace be on him. In al-Fihrast, the
Shaykh said: “Zayd has a book.” Shaykh al-Mufïd said: “Zayd was among
the knowledgeable companions of Imam al-Sadiq, peace be on him. He was
among the main figures, from whom (the people) took the lawful, the
unlawful, religious opinions, and legal precepts, whom no one slanders
and dispraises.”

Zayd reported: “I circumambulated the Kaaba. I was hand in hand with Abu
‘Abd Allah (al-Sadiq), peace be on him. His tears were flowing down his
cheeks. He, peace be on him, asked me: ‘Do you not know what my Lord had
done for me?’ He wept and supplicated. Then he said to me: ‘O Shahham,
Sudayr, and ‘Abd al-Salam b. ‘Abd al-Rahman were in prison. I provoked
Allah for them. So, He released them.”[^20] This narration shows that
Zayd was reliable, and that was of great importance. Other traditions
have been mentioned about his truthfulness and his relationship with the
Imams.

183. Zayyd bin Qaddama

al-Saqid, peace be on them. He was given the kunya of Abu al-Hasan, and
Abu Younis. He has a book.[^22] Al-Kashi reported some accounts about
him. The accounts show that Salim was weak, and that he deviated from
the truth. Al-Kashi reported on Zarara, who said: “I met Salim b. Abï
Hafsa. He said to me: ‘Zarara, woe unto you! Abu Ja‘far said to me:
‘Tell me about the date-palms in Iraq. Do they grow vertically or
horizontally?’ ‘They grow vertically,’ I replied. He said: ‘Tell me
about your dates. Are they sweet?’ He asked me about date-palms: ‘How do
they give dates?’ I told him about that. He asked me about boats: ‘Do
they run on water or on land?’ I told him that they ran on water, and
that people push them with their chests. Then Salim said to me: ‘Shall I
follow such an Imam who has no knowledge of these matters?’” Zarara
said: “When I heard these words of Salim, I became sad. However, I
circumambulated the Kaab. There I met Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir), peace be on
him, and told him about Salim’s words. When we passed the Black Stone,
Abu Ja‘far said to me: ‘Forget Salim. By Allah, he will never see
good.’”[^23]

Zayd b. ‘Ali, peace be on him, said to Salim and his companions: “Why
have you renounced Fatima? You have cut off our affair. My Allah cut off
your affair.”[^24] Salim disappeared all through the Umayyad rule. He

remained in his house. When Abu al-‘Abbas al-Saffah became caliph, Salim
entered into the state of ritual consecration (ahrama) from Kufa. He
said :”O Breaker of the Umayyads, here I am at your service (labbayk).”
He went on saying that till he made his camel kneel. He died in the year
138 A. H. That was during the lifetime of Imam Abu ‘Abd Allah
(al-Sadiq), peace be no him.[^25]

al-Fadl. He was among the companions of Imam al-Sajjad, Imam al-Baqir,
and Imam al-Sadiq, peace be on them.[^28] He was in prison. So, Imam
al-Sadiq asked Allah to release him. With his authentic chain of
authorities, al-Saduq reported on the authority of Hanan b. Sudayr, on
the authority of his father, who said: “I, my father, my grandfather,
and my uncle entered a bath-room in Medina. Suddenly, we found a man
there. The man asked us ‘Where are you from?’ ‘From Iraq,’ we replied.
‘Which Iraq?’ asked the man. ‘From Kufa,’ we replied. ‘You are welcome,
people of Kufa,’ the man said. When we went out of the bath-room, we
asked (the people) about the man. ‘Ali b. al-Husayn and his son Mohammed
al-Baqir,’ was the answer.”[^29] Some traditions slandered Sudayr.
However, the traditions are weak and not important. He has been
mentioned the chain of authorities of “Kamil al-Ziyarat.” It was
reported on his authority, on the authority of Imam Abu Ja‘far
(al-Baqir), peace be on him, in Thawab man Zara al-Husayn, peace be on
him. Our master, professer al-Khu’i, regarded him as trustworthy.

188. Sudayf al-Makki
--------------------

He was the son of Isma‘il al-Makki. He was the retainer of the Banu
(sons) of Hashim. Shaykh al-Tusi numbered him as one of the companions
of Imam al-Baqir, peace be on him.[^30] Shaykh al-Mufïd reported on the
authority of Hanan b. Sudayr, on the authority of Sudayf al-Makki, who
said: [Mohammed b. ‘Ali, peace be on him, related to me, on the
authority of Jabir b. ‘Abd Allah al-Ansari, who said:] “Allah’s Apostle,
may Allah bless him and his family, called the Muhajirïn and the Ansar.
They cae with their weapons. Then he, may Allah bless him and his
family, went up on the pulpit. He praised Allah and lauded him. Then he
said: ‘O Moslems, whoever hates us, the ahl al-Bayt, Allah will raise
him from the dead as Jewish on the Day of Judgment.[^31]

Sudayf was among the eminent Shi‘ites. He was firm in defending the
members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them. He was an inspired
poet. He was among the prominent poets of his time. He composed most of
his poetry in praising the Imams of the members of the House (ahl
al-Bayt), peace be on them. He satirized the Umayyads. He was liable to
their persecutions. So, he hid himself from them. When the Abbasids
overthrew

the Umayyads, Sudayf hurried to meet Abu al-‘Abbas al-Saffah. He arrived
at his palace. The chamberlain asked him about his name to let him
enter. However, Sudayf refused that. The chamberlain went to al-Saffah
and said to him:

“O Commander of the faithful, there is a veiled Hijazi black man riding
a horse. He asks permission to see you, but he refuses to tell me about
his name. He swears that he will be veiled till he sees you.”

Al-Saffah recognized Sudayf. So, he said to his chamberlain: “This is
Sudayf, my retainer. Let him enter.” Sudayf entered. He saw the Umayyads
sitting on chairs. They had come to ask al-Saffah for safety over their
souls. Sudayf was full of anger when he saw them. He composed a poem to
praise al-Saffah. The poem moved the feelings and sentiments of
al-Saffah. Some of the Umayyads felt the danger. They said: “By Allah,
the black man (Sudayf ) has killed us.” Then al-Saffah commanded the
Khurasanis to hit the Umayyads severely. Thus, the Umayyads fell on the
ground. They were groaning. However, al-Saffah commanded his retainers
to spread the food-cloth. Al-Saffah ate his dinner, and then he said to
his retinues: “This is the most delicious meal I have ever seen.”

Then all the Umayyads died. Al-Saffah commanded his retainers to draw
their bodies and throw them into the roads. So, the dogs ate most of
them.[^32] Sudayf looked at them. He was full of happiness. Then he
composed some lines of poetry.[^33]

Sudayf urged al-Saffah to destroy and kill the Umayyads. He came to
al-Saffah. Sulayman b. Hisham b. ‘Abd al-Malik was with al-Saffah. So,
Sudayf was full of anger. He composed a poem to provoke al-Saffah
against the Umayyads.

“O Shaykh, you have killed me,” shouted Sulayman. Then al-Saffah ordered
him to be killed. Thus, Sulayman was beheaded.[^34] Then, Sudayf
continued his struggle the Umayyads, who destroyed the family of the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family, and violated his
sacredness. Al-Mansur al-Dawaniqi persecuted and killed the Alids. So,
Sudayf showed enmity towards him, satirized him, and treated him as he
treated the Umayyads. Accordingly, al-Mansur commanded his police men to
kill Sudayf. Thus, they killed him. He died martyr in the way of Allah,
for he defended the family of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his
family.

and Allah’s Apostle, may Allah bless him and his family, said.’ When
your brother passed away, we came to you. You are one of those to whom
we came. You did not give us complete answers to what we questioned you
about. Then we came to your nephew, Ja‘far. He said to us as his father
said: ‘Allah, the Exalted said, and Allah’s Apostle, may Allah bless him
and his family, said.’ So, Zayd smiled at me and said: “By Allah, you
believe in him, for the books of ‘Ali, the blessings of Allah be on him,
are with him.”[^67] This narration shows Sawra’s good faith.
