Pairs in Plants
===============

VERSE NO.7ِ9

Nowadays, it has been proved that duality and being in pair is among
the universal laws of God in the nature. Every kind of plant, animal, or
vegetation, are created in pairs and consist of male and female, which
fecundation is needed to fertilize them, as it is done somehow among
animals and Man. But it was more than 14 centuries ago that Qura"n has
informed Man of this fact that, plants too, like animals are created in
pairs, and have male and female! [ 431 ]

Not only animal and plants, but whatever has been created, it has been
created in pair, and the only single thing in existence which is only
One is God and nothing else.

وَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنْ ائْتِ الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ(( 10

10- AND WHEN YOUR LORD CALLED MOSES (AND SAID TO HIM) GO TO THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE OPPRESSORS.

قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلاَ يَتَّقُونَ(( 11 ))

11- TO THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH (AND ASK THEM) WILL THEY NOT AVOID EVIL
DEEDS?

قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَنْ يُكَذِّبُونِ(( 12 ))

12- HE SAID; MY LORD! I AM AFRAID THEY BELIE ME.

وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنْطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَارُونَ((

13- AND MY BREAST STRAITENS, AND I AM NOT FLUENT IN SPEECH, SO SEND FOR
AARON (TO HELP ME).

وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنْبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَنْ يَقْتُلُونِ(( 14 ))

14- AND (FURTHER), THEY HOLD A CHARGE OF CRIME AGAINST ME, (MOSES HAD
KILLED AN EGYPTIAN UNINTENTIONALLY) AND I FEAR THEM TO KILL ME.

قَالَ كَلاَّ فَاذْهَبَا بِآيَاتِنَا إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ(( 15
))

15- HE SAID:ِ \`\`IT IS NOT SO (AS YOU THINK). GO BOTH OF YOU WITH OUR
SIGNS. WE ARE WITH YOU LISTENING.'' [ 432 ]

**THE COMMENTARY
THE BEGINNING OF MOSAIC MISSION**

VERSE NO.10ِ15 In this chapter, the stories of seven of the prophets
have been narrated, beginning with Moses and his wrangling with Pharaoh
and his cruel folk, until they were all drowned together, and Moses won
the race! One may think that, these narrations have been repeated here
and there in Qura"n; but it is not so, and in every passage a different
point of the relatively long story has been discussed.

As an instance of it, the above verses about Moses was revealed, when
Muslims were very weak, and their enemies very powerful; and the two
parties had a great difference to balance. So the above verses were sent
down to console Muslims, and to assure them that, it is not the excess
of man-power, equipments, and weapons, that counts and brings forth a
victory, but having faith in God, and trusting Him is the main factor,
and the most effective weapon in the fields of life and death. Moses and
his brother Aaron, only two shepherds, with a worn out woolen clothes
on, and the shepherd's stick in their hand, were ordered to go to
Pharaoh, the greatest dictator of ages, and to warn him and admonish his
host!:ِ \`\`And forget not when your Lord called Moses and told him:ِ
\`\`Go to the people who are oppressorsِto the people of Pharaoh, and
ask them if they will cease oppression and will avoid evil deeds, and
obey their God.''

Here through the above commandment, the mission of Moses begins, but in
spite of having the miracles of the snake, and shining white hand, and
his talking with God, he still felt diffident and wanting confidence
when he was ordered to go to Pharaoh and his folk. He feared them to
belie him. He feared them to kill him, for the Egyptian whom he had
slayed unintentionally. And after all for his stammering speech. But
Allah assured him, and encouraged him to proceed on his mission. God
changed for him all his shortcomings to power, and assigned his brother
Aaron to assist him in his mission.

[ 433 ]

فَأتِيا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولاَ إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ(( 16

16- BOTH OF YOU GO TO PHARAOH, AND SAY:ِ \`\`WE ARE THE MESSENGER OF
THE LORD OF THE WORLDS.''

أَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَائِيلَ(( 17 ))

17- (WE WANT YOU) TO SEND WITH US THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.

قَالَ أَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً وَلَبِثْتَ فِينَا مِنْ عُمُرِكَ
سِنِينَ(( 18 ))

18- (PHARAOH SAID TO MOSES;) DID WE NOT CHERISH YOU AS A CHILD AMONG
US, AND YOU STAYED MANY YEARS OF YOUR LIFE WITH US.

وَفَعَلْتَ فَعْلَتَكَ الَّتِى فَعَلْتَ وَأَنْتَ مِنَ الْكَافِرِينَ(( 19
))

19- AND YOU DID THAT WHICH YOU DID (KILLING ONE OF MY PEOPLE) AND YOU
ARE OF THE UNGRATEFULS.

قَالَ فَعَلْتُهَا إِذاً وَأَنَا مِنْ الضَّالِّينَ(( 20 ))

20- (MOSES) SAID; \`\`I DID IT WHEN I WAS AMONG THE STRAYS.''

فَفَرَرْتُ مِنْكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً
وَجَعَلَنِى مِنْ الْمُرْسَلِينَ (( 21 ))

21- THEN I FLED FROM YOU WHEN I WAS AFRAID OF YOU. THEN MY LORD
BESTOWED ON ME THE WISDOM, AND MADE ME OF THE MESSENGERS.

وَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدْتَ بَنِى
إِسْرَائِيلَ(( 22 ))

22- AND IS THAT A FAVOUR OF WHICH YOU REMIND ME, THAT YOU HAVE ENSLAVED
THE ISRAELITES?

**THE COMMENTARY
THE DECISIVE AND LOGICAL ENCOUNTER WITH PHARAOH**
VERSE NO.16ِ22

The second stage of the Mosaic mission was to pay a visit to Pharaoh,
informing him of his Divine Mission, and asking him to release the
Israelites and set them free of the bonds of his slavery. The above
verse emphasizes that the brethren had to visit the king of Egypt in
person, and inform him of God's Message:ِ \`\`Both of you go to Pharaoh
and tell him that you are the Messenger of the Lord of all the worlds,
and also ask him to send with you the children of Israel.''

Anyhow, the two apostles of God, found a way and met with the king who
was among some of his courtiers. The two brothers told Pharaoh of their
mission, and put forth their request for the freedom of the enslaved
Israelites. Pharaoh with considered and chosen words, and crafty and sly
sentences, tried to prove the rights of his Lordship over the two
brothers in the form of shepherds, by reminding them of his past favour
to Moses:ِ Pharaoh said to Moses; Did we not cherish you among us and
you lived for many years of your life among us, but you did that which
you didِkilling one of my servantsِand then escaped away to avoid
retaliation.

There is an irony in the word of the king of Egypt in order to oblige
Moses for his old favour of saving him from the sea as a body and
bringing him up as a child. He also reminded Moses in a taunting manner
that he had killed one of the Egyptians, and he was no more than a
murderer, and a thankless man who had forgotten the favours of his
master.

Moses answered his irony and taunts in Pharaoh's own language, [ 435
]

saying:ِ \`\`Yes, I did kill him unintentionally and by mistake; and
that was a time when I was among you and one of you, in error and under
your influence. But now things are different. I fled from you when I was
afraid of you. Then my Lord bestowed on me wisdom, and made me of the
Messengers, and here I am to warn you.'' Then in an ironical way, Moses
continued:ِ \`\`And is that a favour of which you remind me that you
have enslaved my people!?''

قَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ وَمَا رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ(( 23 ))

23- PHARAOH SAID:ِ \`\`AND WHAT IS THE LORD OF THE WORLD?''

قَالَ رَبُّ السَّموَاتِ وَالاَْرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا إنْ كُنتُمْ
مُّوقِنِينَ(( 24 ))

24- HE SAID:ِ \`\`THE LORD OF THE HEAVENS AND EARTH AND WHATEVER EXISTS
BETWEEN THEM IF YOU ARE TO MAKE SURE.''

قَالَ لِمَنْ حَوْلَهُ أَلاَ تَسْتَمِعُونَ(( 25 ))

25- (PHARAOH) SAID TO THOSE WHO WERE AROUND HIM:ِ \`\`DO YOU NOT HEAR?
(WHAT HE SAYS)''

قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ وَرَبُّ آبَائِكُمُ الاَْوَّلِينَ(( 26 ))

26- (MOSES) SAID:ِ \`\`YOUR LORD, AND THE LORD OF YOUR FATHERS OF
OLD.''

قَالَ إِنَّ رَسُولَكُمُ الَّذِى أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ لَمَجْنُونٌ(( 27

27- (PHARAOH) SAID:ِ \`\`VERILY YOUR MESSENGER WHO HAS BEEN SENT TO YOU
IS MAD!''

[ 436 ]

قَالَ رَبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا إِنْ كُنْتُمْ
تَعْقِلُونَ(( 28 ))

28- (MOSES WENT ON AND SAID AGAIN) THE LORD OF EAST AND WEST AND WHAT
IS BETWEEN THEM IF YOU WERE WILLING TO USE YOUR MIND.

قَالَ لَئِنِ اتَّخَذْتَ إِلَـهاً غَيْرِى لاََجْعَلَنَّكَ مِنَ

29- PHARAOH SAID:ِ \`\`IF YOU TAKE ANY GOD OTHER THAN ME, I SHALL
IMPRISON YOU.''

**THE COMMENTARY
CHARGE OF MADNESS, AND THREAT TO PRISON**
VERSE NO.23ِ29

Moses made Pharaoh excited by so boldly speaking, and putting forward
the name of God as the Lord of all the worlds, which included Egypt too.
The ancient idolaters proved a certain Lord or god for every phenomenon
like; war, peace, beauty and love, and etc. Now the two shepherds so
frankly deny the many gods, including the lordship of Pharaoh even over
his own Egyptian people! So with a little play of wit, the king says to
Moses:ِ \`\`And who is the Lord of all the worlds!?'' He did not ask
that really to know who the Creator and the Cherisher of the world is.
He rather was pulling the legs of Moses. But Moses stood firmly and with
utmost seriousness and said in answer:ِ

\`\`He is the Lord and the Creator of the heavens and earth, and
whatever exists between them, if you want to make sure!'' Such answer
implies that; my Lord is the Lord of everything including you and all
your courtiers, and Egyptian folk who are buzzying around your kitchen.
[ 437 ] In order to wound the feelings of Moses, Pharaoh sarcasmically
said to his courtiers who were around him:ِ \`\`Look at this apostle who
has been sent to you! He is mad!''

Moses was not embarrassed at all, and boldly said:ِ \`\`The Lord Who
has sent me, is the Lord and cherisher of you and your fathers of old.
Wherever you go from east to west my Lord reigns over you all, and you
have to obey his commands either willingly or unwillingly.''

Usually when logic fails, a dictator resorts to power and force, and so
did the tyrant ruler of Egypt threaten Moses with prison for treason,
and accusation of attempting to overthrow his government.

قَالَ أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكَ بِشَىء مُّبِين(( 30 ))

30- (MOSES) SAID:ِ \`\`WHAT THEN, IF I BRING YOU A PERSPICUOUS
THING?''

قَالَ فَأْتِ بِهِ إِنْ كُنْتَ مِنَ الصَّادِقِينَ(( 31 ))

31- (THE KING) SAID:ِ \`\`BRING IT THEN IF YOU ARE OF THE
TRUTHFULS.''

فَأَلْقَى عَصَاهُ فَإِذَا هِىَ ثُعْبَانٌ مُّبِينٌ(( 32 ))

32- SO HE CAST HIS STICK WHICH IT TURNED TO A VERITABLE SERPENT.

وَنَزَعَ يَدَهُ فَإِذَا هِىَ بَيْضَاءُ لِلنَّاظِرِينَ(( 33 ))

33- AND HE DREW HIS HAND (OUT OF HIS ARM-PIT) AND IT WAS SHINING WHITE
TO THE BEHOLDERS.

[ 438 ]

قَالَ لِلْمَلَإِ حَوْلَهُ إِنَّ هَذَا لَسَاحِرٌ عَلِيمٌ(( 34 ))

COMMAND?

قَالُوا أَرْجِهْ وَأَخَاهُ وَابْعَثْ فِى الْمَدَائِنِ حَاشِرِينَ(( 36

36- THEY SAID:ِ \`\`GIVE HIM AND HIS BROTHER A TIME, AND SEND SUMMONERS
TO THE CITIES.''

يَأْتُوكَ بِكُلِّ سَحَّار عَلِيم(( 37 ))

37- IN ORDER TO BRING TO YOU ALL THE WELL-VERSED SORCERERS.

**THE COMMENTARY RAISE UP! THAT YOUR LAND IS IN DANGER!** VERSE
NO.30ِ37

In that meeting, which was more a general consultation than a common
gathering, Moses preached his doctrine with reason and wisdom, a brief
of which is mentioned through the above verses. On the contrary, Pharaoh
gave his views in irony and with mockery, mingled with some
dictatorship! Therefore, Moses found it better to change the mode of his
operation, and said to the king:ِ

\`\`What then if I bring you a perspicuous sign from your Lord!? Will
you still insist upon your power and prison!?'' Pharaoh could have no
other way but to admit Moses to show his miracles if he had any at all:ِ
So the king said:ِ \`\`Bring it then if you are of the truthfuls.'' And
[ 439 ] Moses cast his stick, and Lo! It turned to a huge serpent in
real movements, who frightened everyone who was present!

In a second illustration, Moses drew his hand out of his arm-pit, and
his hand was shining white to the beholders! The king felt that he was
entrapped in a serious dead-lock. Now he could not take the matter so
easy that he had thought at first, because Moses had attracted the
attentions of all the chiefs of the court enough to cause a semi-revolt.
This was when Pharaoh was far from yielding to truth, and was willing to
keep and protect his Satanic Power at any price. On the other hand, the
Egyptians were habitually given to magic and sorcery, when the true
miracles were shown to them. This was an opportunity for the king to
declare the miracles as witchcrafts, to his courtiers who were around
him. He therefore, without any pause and pondering, said to those who
were present:ِ

\`\`Verily this is a well-versed sorcerer. And he wants to expel you
from your land by his magic. What is your opinion and command then?''
The chiefs too were perplexed, and could not know what was really the
best to be done. They eventually said to the king:ِ \`\`Give them a
time, and send summoners to the cities in order to bring to you all the
well-versed sorcerers.''

فَجُمِعَ السَّحَرَةُ لِمِيقَاتِ يَوْم مَّعْلُوم(( 38 ))

لَعَلَّنَا نَتَّبِعُ السَّحَرَةَ إِنْ كَانُوا هُمُ الْغَالِبِينَ(( 40

**THE COMMENTARY
MAGICIANS WERE GATHERED FROM EVERYWHERE** VERSE NO.38ِ42

As per order of the king, many especial staff were sent here and there,
through Egypt to choose and collect the most skillful sorcerers. Enough
of them were chosen and prepared for the great challenge of an appointed
day.

People too, were ordered to come as many as possible to witness the
victory of their culture and creed, and to respect their king more
ardently. It was announced by the priests that the victory of the
magicians was the victory of their gods.

The appointment was in a day of general festival which was well known
to all Egyptians. Their propaganda was such that, the two wizards (Moses
and Aaron) had endangered the Egyptian cult and creed which was based on
the worship of their Pharaoh. It was told everywhere that the two had
come to drive the Egyptians out of their land by sorcery. The ministers
and the chief courtiers had the object of gathering as many people as
possible to witness the scenery, with the expectation that the Egyptian
sorcerers would win with their tricks and cheating [ 441 ] devices. So
the people had to come and witness the triumph of Egyptian Religion, so
as to become more faithful to the cult of being obedient to Pharaoh.

The magicians who were priests too, were chasing their own benefit and
selfish interests. They only wanted to increase their influence on the
king, as well as their country-fellows. Their strive was not based on
the loyalty to their exploiting and cruel tyrant. This was why before
starting their carrier they said to Pharaoh:ِ \`\`....Is there any
reward for us if we become the winners?'' The king too, was well aware
of the material and worldly ambitions of those wizard priests, and
therefore his answer to their plea was not only positive, but attractive
too:ِ \`\`Yes of course!'' He said, \`\`And besides, you will become of
the nearers to my person, if you win the combat.''

قَالَ لَهُمْ مُّوسَى أَلْقُوا مَا أَنْتُمْ مُّلْقُونَ(( 43 ))

43- (THE APPOINTED TIME REACHED, AND ALL THE MAGICIANS WERE READY IN
THE FIELD, WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF EGYPTIAN GAZING AT THEIR HANDS,
THEN MOSES SAID:ِ)

\`\`CAST YOU DOWN WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO CAST.''

فَأَلْقَوْا حِبَالَهُمْ وَعِصِيَّهُمْ وَقَالُوا بِعِزَّةِ فِرْعَوْنَ

**THE COMMENTARY
THE GLORIOUS LIGHT OF GOD SHONE IN THE HEARTS OF THE SORCERERS.**
VERSE NO.43ِ51

After having the promise of Pharaoh for an excellent reward, the
sorcerers did all that they could do to prepare themselves to defeat the
Serpent Stick, and to darken the Shining White hand of Moses. They
filled up their hollow ropes and rods, that were formed in the shape of
snakes and serpent, with some chemicals like mercury, so as to have a
movement when heated through the sunshine. They also provided for any
tricks of such that was possible for them. Then in the appointed time,
they were present in the congregational field, in which was waiting the
king, his courtiers, and minister, and tens of thousands of citizens.

There in the field also stood only three persons in opposition to the
whole crowd of people, namely; Moses, Aaron, and Yahovah. Every one was
silent as if a bird was on their head, waiting to see what would happen.
Moses took the lead, and said to the sorcerers:ِ \`\`Cast you down what
you are going to cast.'' Then they cast their ropes and rods, and said:-
\`\`By the exalted might of Pharaoh we are the victors.''

The ropes and rods of the magicians appeared to move here and there
like snakes and great worms. Then Moses cast his stick, and Yahovah made
it a real hungry serpent, which rushed towards the sorcerer's stuff and
swallowed them all! In other word; the truth appeared and falsehood
vanished. When so it happened, the magicians trembled with fear of God,
and fell down on the ground prostrating themselves, and frankly said:ِ
\`\`We now believe in the Lord of the Worldsِthe Lord of Moses and
Aaron!''

[ 444 ] The first party who distinguished the reality from the
falsehood were the magicians who saw something different from their own
tricks. Therefore God's Glorious light of Grace guided them and caused
them to prostrate themselves out of a sudden, to celebrate the praise of
God and to confirm the truth that was with Moses. Their unexpected
sudden act, filled the king with rage, and confused him so much that he
lost his control, and shouted upon the sorcerers saying:ِ

\`\`How dare of you to believe in any other god, before I give you
permission!? This is a conspiracy to expel Egyptians from their country
which is plotted by you and Moses, who has taught you magic. Soon shall
you come to know that I am going to cut-off your hands and feet
alternately and will then crucify you all?'' This has always been the
methodical way of cruel tyrant kings. But the sorcerers who were
converted at once to sincere believers, were ready to suffer any torture
and death. So they indifferently said:ِ \`\`Do as you like. These are of
no importance to us. You can only judge and decree in this mortal and
temporary life of us. We are turning to our Lord, and expect him to
forgive us our sins, for being the first of believers.''

**THE COMMENTARY
THEY WERE DRIVEN OUT OF THEIR GLORIOUS PALACES.**
VERSE NO.52ِ59

We read in the previous verses how Moses won the challenge in that
critical field, and great congregation of the heathens and polytheists.
Although Pharaoh and his folk did not admit the truth to be with Moses
and insisted on their blasphemy; yet the victory over the magicians had
its own marvelous effects:ِ

1ِThe Israelites were encouraged and their faith in their leader
increased.
2ِMoses obtained an important position among the Egyptians. Some of
them got faith in him, and some others left their hostility.
3ِMore important was that, Pharaoh now dared not to kill or imprison
Moses, or to get rid of him in the mysterious ways to which Dictators
are accustomed.

[ 446 ]

All these advantages gave Moses the good opportunity to stay among his
people, and to preach and teach them, and to purify and cleanse them
from evil deeds. Many years elapsed thus during which Moses showed many
other miracles, some of which are very famous like; the Bloodِthe
Frogِthe Gnatِthe Darkness and etc., which have all been narrated in
detail in the Bible, and are also confirmed through the Holy Qura"n.

But Pharaoh and his cruel folk had enslaved the poor and helpless
Israelites who were their free of charge servants, farmers, and
gardeners, and doers of all sorts of hard works. Of course, Allah's plan
was otherwise; a part of it being to drive the tyrants and oppressors
out of their gardens and springs; treasurse, and honourable positions;
and to help the helpless Israelites to inherit all that they had.

Therefore the command of the PASS OVER was issued:ِ \`\`And We inspired
Moses to take my servants by night that you shall be pursued.'' And thus
the incident of Pass Over began in which Moses took the Israelites as
per order of God by night, in order to leave Egypt for their promised
land; but Pharaoh and his host got the information, and pursued them
which ended in the triumph of the truth, and destruction of falsehood,
and the hosts of evil.

60- THEN (PHARAOH AND HIS HOSTS) PURSUED THEM (AND APPROACHED THEM) AT
THE SUNRISE.

فَكَانَ كُلُّ فِرْق كَالطَّوْدِ الْعَظِيمِ(( 63 ))

63- WE THEN INSPIRED MOSES TO STRIKE THE SEA WITH YOUR STICK. THEN IT
CLEAVED; (A PATH ACROSS THE SEA WAS MADE) AND EACH PART OF THE SEA
BECAME LIKE A GREAT, HUGE MOUNTAIN!

وَأَزْلَفْنَا ثَمَّ الاْخَرِينَ(( 64 ))

64- AND THERE WE BROUGHT (IN THE CLEAVAGE) THE OTHERS TOO. (i.e.
PHARAOH AND HIS HOSTS)

وَأَنْجَيْنَا مُوسَى وَمَنْ مَّعَهُ أَجْمَعِينَ(( 65 ))

65- AND WE SAVED MOSES AND WHOEVER WAS WITH HIM, ALL TOGETHER.

ثُمَّ أَغْرَقْنَا الاْخَرِينَ(( 66 ))

66- AFTER THAT WE DROWNED THE OTHERS.

إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لاَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ(( 67
))

67- VERILY IN THAT THERE IS A SIGN, BUT MOST OF THEM WERE NOT
BELIEVERS.

وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ(( 68 ))

68- AND TRULY YOUR LORD IS EXALTED IN MIGHT, COMPASSIONATE.
