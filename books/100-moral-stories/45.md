THE FOX WHO GOT CAUGHT IN THE TREE TRUNK
Once upon a time, there was a hungry fox that was looking for something
to ear. He was very

hungry. No matter how hard he tried, the fox could not find food.
Finally he went to the edge of the

forest and searched there for food. Suddenly he caught sight of a big
tree with a hole in it.

Inside the hole was a package. The hungry fox immediately thought that
there might be food in it,

and he became very happy. He jumped into the hole and when he

opened the package, he saw there were a lot of food, bread, meat

and fruit in it!

An old woodcutter had placed the food in the tree trunk while he

cut down trees in the forest. He was going to eat it for his lunch.

The fox happily began to eat. After the fox had finished eating, he

felt thirsty and decided to leave the trunk and drink some water

from a nearby spring. However, no matter how hard he tried, he

could not get out of the hole. Do you know why? Yes, the fox had

eaten so much food that he became too big to fit through the hole.

The fox was very sad and upset. He told himself, “I wish that I had

thought a little before jumping into the hole.”

Yes children, this is the result of doing something

without thinking about it first.
