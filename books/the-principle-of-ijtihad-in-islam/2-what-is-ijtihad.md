What Is Ijtihad?
================

The question of ijtihad is a very topical one these days.[^10] Many
people ask, either aloud or to themselves, what form ijtihad takes in
Islam, and from where Islam got the concept. Why should one practice
taqlid? What are the conditions for ijtihad? What are the duties of a
mujtahid?

Broadly speaking, ijtihad has the meaning of being an authority in the
matters of Islam; but there are two ways of being an authority and
deriving opinions in the matters of Islam in the eyes of us Shi\`i
Muslims: one which is in accordance with the shari\`a, and one which is
forbidden by it. Similarly, taqlid is of two kinds: one which is in
accordance with the shari\`a, and one which is forbidden.
