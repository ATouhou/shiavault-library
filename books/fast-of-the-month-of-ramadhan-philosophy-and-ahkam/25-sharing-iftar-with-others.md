Sharing Iftar with Others
=========================

The Almighty and Praised One has said,

***"O people! You are the ones who stand in need of Allah, while Allah
is the self-Sufficient One, the Praised" (Holy Qur'an, 35:15).***

Islam, which has carried the banner of protecting the poor, the
indigent, the orphans, and the wayfarers, has urged the faithful to
share the *iftar* with one another, to visit each other, and to invite
others to break their fast with them. Islam, which does not favor an
Arab over a non-Arab except on the basis of piety, according to the
tradition of His greatest Prophet Muhammad ibn Abdullah (S), has
established the fast in order to remind the rich of what the poor have
to endure.

The greatest Prophet Muhammad ibn Abdullah (S) has said, "No poor person
feels hungry except due to what another rich one is enjoying." Islam has
informed us of all of this through the Islamic code of ethics, I.e., the
Holy Qur'an, and through the revered Sunnah of the Prophet (S) and his
progeny (as), about whom the greatest Prophet Muhammad (S) has said, "I
am leaving among you the Two Weighty Things: the Book of Allah, and my
progeny, that is, my family; you shall never go astray so long as you
follow them both."
