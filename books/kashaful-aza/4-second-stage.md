Second Stage
============

After stopping the processions, they made "shair Allah" (replicas, ie
alams, Zuljenahs, taboots, etc) a target. These "shair Allah" are a sign
of the juloos of Imam Hussain (as) and the life?s breath to all
Hussainis. Upon seeing these "shair Allah", even an ignorant person will
remember the message of Karbala.

Now they have started to speak against Alam, Zuljenah, taboot, jhoola,
and tazia. They distribute pamphlets during the Ashura juloos
criticizing and making fun of these "shair Allah". Maaz?Allah they are
issuing fatwas which declare these "shair Allah" as haram (forbidden).

Simply by changing their appearance, the offspring of yazid (la), who
have been opponents of these "shair Allah" for the last 50 years, have
been able to gain entrance into our religion. Now a new war has begun
between the true Shia religion and these so called scholars, but the
enemies of Imam Hussain (as) have been defeated until the day of
judgment. Their fate is ever lasting turmoil.

Alam

Once again the people have started opposing the Alam. They say ,"Why do
these ignorant people buy a stick for 20 rupees and a piece of cloth for
10 rupees? They then put the cloth on the stick and give it so much
respect. They kiss it and put it on their eyes." These so called
scholars call this "idol worshipping?.

All the political parties have their own flags. You can see them on the
buildings, houses, and roads. Their evil tongues do not say a single
word against these type of flags, but when it comes to the Alam of Imam
Hussain (as), their evil tongues start barking against it. If they are
really true in their words, then show us a fatwa against the flag of
Pakistan.

Everyone knows when the Pakistani flag is raised, it is compulsory to
stand and give it the honor and respect its due. Now issue a fatwa
against this. After they go to jail for ten years, all of their "scholar
ness" will disappear.

Zuljenah

In Iran the taking out of Zuljenah is a crime punishable by jail.
Iranian people call it "horse worshipping?. As per my knowledge, I know
they have martyred a Zuljenah in Iran.

The animals we buy for Eid ul Adha are a replica of that animal which
was slaughtered in the place of Hz Ismael (as). The people decorate the
replica of this animal and take it out into the streets and roads.

No one says a single word against these practices, but they hate the
loyal and mujahid horse of Imam Hussain (as). In reality, it is not the
Zuljenah itself which they hate. They actually hate Imam Hussain (as).
For momineen it is a great honor to kiss the feet of Zuljenah. It is
considered a source to take their tears to the Holy Mother of Imam
Hussain (as).

If the enemies of Imam Hussain (as) call it horse worshipping, then
tell me why is it that when those same people go to Mecca and kiss the
cover of the Kaaba, do they not think this is cloth worshipping? The
horse of Imam Hussain (as) is a thing which has life, and that is only a
piece of cloth.

When you stand in front of Hajar e Aswad and say "O?Hajar e Aswad! Be
my witness that I have fulfilled my promise". You do not remember the
stone worshipping at that time. In reality when we circulate around the
Kaaba and kiss it, our purpose is not Kaaba. Our purpose is that which
is associated with Kaaba. Likewise, when we kiss the Alam and Zuljenah,
it is Imam Hussain (as) which is in our minds.

**Third Stage**

Now they have taken a third step. The enemies of Imam Hussain (as) knew
matam of zanjeer and qama zani is the spirit and life of the Ashura
processions. This macabre act is in the heart of the people.

It has such great influence over the people that numerous individuals
become Shia every year after witnessing this act. The enemies of azadari
waited a long time, but not even cruel government oppressors could
destroy these acts of matam. The fitna that comes from our own house is
the most harmful.

In order to be able to fulfill their shaitanic purposes, a fatwa was
issued from the highest authorities. They declared zanjeer and qama zani
to be a haram act. When this fatwa was issued, a severe earthquake tore
through the entire Shia world. People became confused. A war began
between those who follow love and those who follow sharia. Those who
follow love would say "Get up and hurt your body so Syeda (sa) becomes
pleased". Those who follow the so called sharia will say "Stop! Don?t do
this so that mulla becomes pleased".

Matam e Hussain (as) was not begun by a fatwa nor will it end by any
fatwa. May Allah protect our matamis and azadars for completely denying
this shaitani fatwa. Amazingly the zanjeer and qama zani increased after
this fatwa was issued. We want to present that fatwa for you and will
discuss its different aspects.

"Philosophy of Azadari" by Agha Khamenei page 18-20.

"Qama (sword matam) is one of those acts which is wrong. It is wrong
for the people to take qama (sword) in their hand and hit their heads
causing their blood to flow. What is the purpose of this act? This is
not azadari by any means. This is a false act and has nothing to do with
religion. Certainly Allah is not pleased with such acts.

Therefore, we should refrain from doing such acts as these. By doing
such acts, the great Islamic society whose honor is Imam Zamana (ajf),
the great sacrifice of Imam Hussain (as), and holy name of Ameerul
Momineen (as), becomes an ignorant and uncivilized society in the eyes
of non muslims and muslims alike. You should abstain from doing such
acts because I am not pleased by these acts.

If someone does qama zani openly, I become angry from within my heart.
I do not know upon what basis they perform this act nor do I know which
hidden hands are encouraging such acts in our Islamic and revolutionary
society."

You read this fatwa and certainly you have understood the main points
which were mentioned in this fatwa.

1. Fake, baseless, ignorance
2. It has nothing to do with religion.
3. Muslims and non muslims make fun of this act.
4. Mr. Mufti is angry from his heart and it is most important to make
him pleased even if Syeda (sa) becomes angry.
5. Zanjeer and qama matam was invented recently.(It was not in
existence in previous times and some hidden hands established this
act.)

Only that person who has nothing to do with the love of Imam Hussain
(as) can use such false and evil words. Such a person has not even the
minutest amount of respect for Imam Hussain (as) in his heart, he has no
fear of Allah, and he gives no importance to the anger of Syeda (sa) at
all. Whoever disassociates the Matam e Hussain (a) from the religion
does not understand that Imam Hussain is Himself the religion.

Without Imam Hussain (as), the religion of Allah loses all of its worth
and value. As far as people making fun of these acts are concerned,
people also make fun of the acts of hajj. So should we then abandon
performing hajj because people make fun of it?

Claiming zanjeer and qama zani is a recent invention is also a false
claim. This matam was established in the Shia nation centuries before.
This is not a recent invention nor is it associated with a specific
group of people. A vast majority of different people from every part of
the globe do this type of matam.

On the day of Ashura in Karbala, the numbers of those who perform
zanjeer and qama zani are more than one million. We see these scenes on
the television with our very own eyes. If Mr. Mufti cannot see these
scenes, this is not our problem.

In reality matam has nothing to do with fatwas. In previous times a lot
of people, even our Aimmah (as), use to practice phlebotomy (The act or
practice of opening a vein by incision or puncture to remove blood as a
therapeutic treatment) causing a tremendous amount of blood loss. It
proves the loss of one?s blood in order to maintain your health is a
sunnah of the Imams (as). Therefore we must think very carefully.

If sharia remains silent, when we lose our blood for the benefit of our
health, then how is it possible for sharia to say one single word
against our shedding of blood in the love of Imam Hussain (as) who is
the owner of sharia? Even if we look at the sharia aspect, we see a
human is put into two conditions in this world.

One is "halat e ikhtiar?. This is when you have no choice except to
follow sharia laws. If it is haram (forbidden) then it is always haram
and there is no exceptions for it. If it is halal (lawful), then it is
always halal and there is no condition which makes it haram
(forbidden).

The other condition is "halat e istrar?. This is when you can ignore
the sharia laws under certain circumstances and not become sinful. If
you find yourself in such a situation where nothing is available to eat
and you are in danger of losing your life, then you can even eat a dead
dog.

The same way when the grief reaches its maximum level, at that moment
whatever you do will not fall under the scope of sharia. When Hz Owais
Qarni (ra) broke all of his teeth, RasoolAllah (saw) did not object.

When Syeda Zainab (sa) hit Her head on the bar of the camel which She
was sat upon, the Imam of Her Time (as)(Imam Zainul Abideen as) remained
silent. These incidents are undeniable proofs that the love of Imam
Hussain (as) does not need any permission from sharia.

When someone injures his body in the love of Imam Hussain (as), there
is no sharia law which forbids it.

When we look at halat e ikhtiar, we see it is the will of Allah to have
those who love His Beloved to endure the same intense pain and suffering
as His Beloved endured.

Because Imam Hussain (as)?s dead body was left in the sunshine, Syeda
Rubab (sa)(wife of Imam Hussain (as);mother of Hz Ali Asghar (as) and
Syeda Sakina (sa)) never sat in the shade for the remainder of Her
life.

This was happening right in the front of the eyes of the Imam of the
Time (as) (Imam Zainul Abideen as), but He did not object. This is a
sharia law for us. When we look at the incident of Hz Hajar (as) and Hz
Ismael (as), we see Hz Ismael (as) was so thirsty and His Mother
circulated around Safa and Marwa seven times in search of water.

This act of Hz Hajar (as) was so pleasing to Allah; He made this act
wajib upon the people to circulate seven times around Safa and Marwa
during Hajj. Even though they are not thirsty nor are they in search of
water. The act is deliberate and intentional.

The same way if a lover of Imam Hussain (as) wants to feel the same
pain which the Imam (as) felt, then certainly his act will be pleasing
to Allah. It does not matter if you injury yourself intentionally or
unintentionally, so called fatwas will never be able to stop the azadari
of Imam Hussain (as).
