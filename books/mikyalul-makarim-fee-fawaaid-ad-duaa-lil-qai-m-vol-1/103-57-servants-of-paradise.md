57. Servants of Paradise
========================

The Almighty Allah, Mighty and the High, would give him servants from
Paradise to serve him because *Dua* is a good deed and a favor. And in
*Usool Kafi* through his own chain of narrators it is narrated from Zaid
bin Arqam that he said: The Messenger of Allah (S) said:

“Every person of my Ummah that does a favor or kindness to his brother
in the path of Allah, the Almighty Allah shall give him servants of
Paradise.”[^1]

Kindness implies goodness and favor, whether it be through the tongue or
in any other way. On the basis of this, praying for an early
reappearance of our master, the Master of the Time (aj) shall be
included in it first of all.
