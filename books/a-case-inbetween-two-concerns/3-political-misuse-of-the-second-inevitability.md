Political Misuse of the Second Inevitability
============================================

The way politics had a role in misusing the first inevitability, it
also had a role in widely misusing the second inevitability, for
universal inevitability necessarily leads to segregate the Divine will
from the universe, that does not contradict believing that Allah the
Sublime is the Creator of the universe,

for the Jews used to believe in Allah the Sublime and that he is the
Creator of this universe, but also they used to believe that this
universe runs and moves – after being created by Allah the Sublime –
within an obligatory system established on causes and reasons with no
role for Allah the Sublime in managing and administrating it, in other
words they used to believe that Allah the Sublime is the Creator of this
universe,

but He does not have a role in managing or dominating it, while the
Holy Quran certifies that Allah the Sublime maintains all qualities of
creation, domination, management, simultaneously. Proportionate to the
amount of weakness that befalls Allah’s sovereignty, domination and
practical influence on the universe from man’s point of view – man’s
relation and connection to Allah in turn, turns weaker.

And the way man’s faith in Allah’s sovereignty, authority and direct
practical influence on the universe weakens, his relation with Allah
also weakens, and the more his adherence and connection to Allah
weakens, he himself gets weaker, furthermore his potency, power and
resistance will weaken. Opposite to this however, the more man’s faith
in Allah the Sublime,

His domination, authority and practical influence on the universe
increases, his adherence to Allah and his relation with the Sublime on
the other hand will increase. The more strong his relation with Allah
becomes, the more strong and potent he will be, for he will get strength
and potency from Allah, thus his resistance and hope will increase.

This matter naturally concerns the rulers and the oppressive terrorist
regime; this is in the first place.

Second: such a concept of universal inevitability deepens man’s sense
of the role of matter and materialism in his mind and soul giving them
more value than they deserve meanwhile weakening and flattening the
metaphysical sense in man’s soul and consciousness decreasing their real
value, quite opposite to what the Quran does to man.

In the Quran we notice that a great attention has been paid to the
faith in the unseen, in an attempt to deepen, fix and establish this
faith in man’s soul, meanwhile AlQuran through a great number of verses
emphasizes the effect and importance of matter in the universe.

Faith in the unseen has a great impact on man’s way of thinking, on the
course of his movement, on his aspirations and ambitions, then on his
flexibility and potency to face and withhold difficulties, troubles and
challenges.

Weakening and flattening faith in the unseen, and strengthening and
deepening faith in matter (more than it really deserves) weakens man’s
role, activity and dynamism, influencing directly his style of
thinking.

The Holy Quran tells about the Jews ultimate faith in the universal
inevitability, which cancels Allah the Sublime’s authority and potency
to alter the order of the historical and universal events within the
frame that the initial episodes of these events impose.

[The Jews said: Allah’s hand is fettered. Be their hands fettered and
they be cursed for what they uttered! Nay, Allah’s hands are widely
outstretched; He spends (of His bounty) as He wills] Al Maidah v. 64


**Relation Between Both Inevitabilities**

Although these two inevitabilities are different in shape and
significance, yet they meet so as to cripple man’s transitional and
pioneering role in the political and social system.

For change depends on two things:

1. Man’s faith in Allah the Sublime and His sovereignty, potency and
power; and man’s reliance and dependence on Allah the Sublime and his
trust in Him; and if man delivers himself to Allah the Sublime, he will
gain from Allah the Sublime some super strength and potency, further he
will gain unlimited hope and confidence.

Man, however powerful, influential and efficient might be, but for
delivering himself to Allah cannot attain that hope and confidence. And
if ever he loses hope and trust in Allah, disconnecting himself from
Him, he will become too weak to confront life, and he will have to face
the challenges of work and life movement on his own, depending on his
own strength and potency which are weak and limited.

Belief in the universal inevitability and denial of Allah the Sublime’s
authority to influence and penetrate the serially related events of the
universe the way the Jews believe – make man lose his psychological
contact with Allah the Sublime, robbing him his trust in Allah and hope
in the metaphysical aid expected from Him all the way through his
actions and movement.

2. Man’s faith in his free will and potency to change the course of
history and decide his destiny and the destiny of history.

Such a faith enables man to act, move and change opposite to which he
loses his psychological potency to move and change things, and if ever
he loses this faith, he will turn to believe that his history and fate
has inevitably been predetermined and there is no way to alter or change
it, and that he is only a wheel that is part of a big instrument which
makes him act and move with no control over his acts, moves, history and
fate. Thus faith in both inevitabilities blocks man from Allah the
Sublime concealing him from his ego and abilities, robbing him of hope
and freedom to move and make a decision.

Man thus will turn into a piece of wood floating into the current of
event and history.

Both this and that are things that rulers and oppressive terrorist
regimes seek.

**Al Quran position towards these two inevitabilities


** Al Quran has a clear position towards these two inevitabilities. In
dealing with the historical and behavioural inevitability the Holy Quran
frankly approves man’s free will and responsibility for his deeds, the
Sublime said:

[Then we showed him the straight path; it is up to him to choose to be
grateful or ungrateful and disbeliever.]

Revised by translator Al Insan v. 3.

[Verily, Allah does not do any injustice to mankind, but men do wrong
to themselves.] yunus v. 44.

[Say, (O messenger!) O, men! The truth has come to you from your
Creator and Nurturer. Whoever is guided it is only to his own loss.]
Revised by translator. Yunus v. 198.

[And whoever wishes can find through it a way towards his Creator and
Nurturer.] Revised by translator Al Insan v. 29.

Meanwhile Al Quran clearly confirms the doctrine of Allah the Sublime’s
will that dominates man’s life and history without canceling man’s free
will. The Sublime says:

[And you mankind does not decide something unless Allah decides so;
verily, Allah is the knowing Decreer.] Al Insan v. 30.

[And you shall not wish the truth and shall not be in search of the
straight path unless it be the will of Allah the Creator of the worlds]
At Takwir v. 29.

[Say (O, messenger!) Allah leaves in his error whom he regards
unworthy, and guides to his path those who turn to Him invokingly.] Ar
Ra'd v. 27.

[Allah does guide to His light whomever He wills.] Revised by
translator An. Nur v. 35.

[And if your Creator and Nurturer had willed, verily, all those who are
on the earth would have believed; can you (O, Messenger!) compel people
against their wish to become believers? And it is not possible for any
(disbelieving) person to believe except by Allah’s will and Allah will
put the wrath on those who do not use their reason.] Yunus. V 99 –
100.

This direct influence of Allah the Sublime’s will of domination on
man’s life and history in addition to man’s free will and choice is the
well known doctrine of (A case in between two concerns) which has been
attributed to the progeny of Muhammad (A.S.).

It is a midway dogma inbetween (determinism) that has been adopted by
(Al Asha’irah) and (free choice) that has been adopted by (Al
Mufawidha).

We shall elaborate more about this in the following chapters of this
research.

In relation to the second inevitability, the Holy Quran clearly
approves the doctrine of Allah the Sublime’s sovereignty of will over
the universe, and His permanent and continuous control over it.

The Sublime says:

[The Jews said: Allah’s hand is fettered, be their hands fettered and
they be cursed for what they uttered! Nay, Allah’s hands are widely
outstretched, He spends (of his bounty) as He wills] Al Maidah. V. 64.

The Sublime also says:

[Allah abrogates whatever He wills and keeps confirmed whatever He
wills, and with Him is the preserved Book]. Ar-Ra'd v. 39.

This doctrine, which the Holy Quran approves, does not connote
suspending inevitability and casualty dogma, in addition to all the
regulations and reasonable laws resulting from casualty dogma.

We find in the Holy Quran many verses other than those mentioned above,
that confirm clearly and accurately the casualty doctrine.
