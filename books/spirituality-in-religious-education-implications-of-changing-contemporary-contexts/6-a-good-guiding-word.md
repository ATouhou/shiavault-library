[A Good Guiding Word]
=====================

* “Huxley described two thought patterns to all the main religions, the
esoteric and the exoteric. The first subscribes to the metaphysic of a
divine Reality at the core of being; it is the spiritual, almost
secretive face of religion and is practised by only a few adherents. The
second is the exoteric form which is the public form by which the
religion is usually identified, that is, through its rituals, practices,
architecture and so on”.*
