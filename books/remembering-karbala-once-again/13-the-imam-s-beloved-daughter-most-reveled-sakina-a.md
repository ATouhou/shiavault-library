The Imam’s Beloved Daughter Most Reveled Sakina (‘a)
====================================================

(" Bevon kaa mulke Shaam mein jis dum guzar hua" )

When in Shaam the caravan of widows arrived

In embarrassment they bowed their heads and cried

Seeing the spectators lined up on the streets

Tears of humiliation filled their eyes

Having trailed through the roads, shops and streets

The Queens reached the court of the infamous Yazid

There Yazid conversed with Abid at length

Hearing Abid's responses, the attendees wept

Disgraced, Yazid brought the confrontation to a close

Enraged at Sajjad's character and strength

while all spectators went back to their homes

To prison the kin of the Prophet went on

In the dark prison, they sat heads bowed

Frightened of the darkness, Sakina looked around

So exhausted was Abid from His journeys on foot

He dropped to the floor without a sound

Many nights He had stayed up, many miles He had walked

He slept now, resting His ahead on the wall

"why is it so dark" Sakina wanted to know

"What place is this mother, where no air flows?

The darkness is smothering, I can't see a thing

Not the earth beneath or the sky above"

"We cannot stay here, no one will survive

Won't lamps be lit when evening arrives?"

"If it stays this dark, I will certainly not last

I'm convinced that this night will not pass

My Father would cradle me on his chest at night

Now sleep on the dirt? I cannot alas"

"If a lamp blew out, I'd wake with a start

Have I ever, Oh Mother, slept in the dark"

Her mother replied, wiping Sakina's tears

"Hush my little one, lest the guards hear

Morning will come soon, the dark will be gone

The moon will illumine this place my dear"

"The breeze will flow, the night will cool down

I'll hold you in my arms, rest Oh little one"

Thus the mother consoled, cajoled and calmed

The girl was restless, the night stretched on

Sakina sobbed and wept through the night

Weary she curled up in her mother's arms

Her frail body weak and drowsy, she slept

And Banu held Sakina in her arms and wept

Within moments Sakina was restless again

She dreamt of her Father, His presence she felt

Stretching wide her arms, she woke with a start

And peered in the darkness, her eyes seeking Him

She cried "Oh Mother, not a thing I can see

My Father was here, tell me where is Hue"

Everyone wept at Sakina's state

And so did the prison guard, hiding his face

And Yazid learned of Sakina's distress

That she's crying for her Father, for Him she prays

Inconsolable she weeps, nothing calms her down

She wants her Father, she wants Him now

"Then take His head" Yazid ordered his men

And Husain's severed head was carried thence

Its glory and radiance lighting the path

Fragrant and glorious Its noble presence

Sensing the approach, the prisoners hastily rose

impatiently Sakina waited by the door

Anxious to see Him, smiling through her tears

The air grew fragrant as His head drew near

With His halo the prison aura transformed

Gone with the gloom was Sakina's fear

In reception the prisoners lined up at the door

in respect and salutation Abid arose

To receive her Father, Sakina held out her dress

And hugged His head close to her chest

She kissed His forehead, His cheeks, His lips

The prisoners circled her in awe and respect

Where Zainab stood hair strewn, head bare

Husain's glance was affixed to her face

Holding her Father's severed head

Sakina sat on the floor and said

Words of love, of her loss, her pain

Then unconscious she was, close to death

Her face resting on her Father's face

She sighed, shuddered and took her last breath

Her silence at first gave no one alarm

For everyone thought she was feeling calm

But as the silence stretched, the mother said

"Wake up dear Sakina, pass the head to you Aunt"

Hearing no response, terror filled Banu’s heart

"She's fainted" said everyone, "Banu take heart"

Banu lifted Sakina into her arms

Saw the lifeless limbs, eyes shut, face calm

Neck limp, face drooping to her chest, not a sound

"what is this?" She cried, "What is this now?"

"What healer do I consult, where do I go?

The prison door is locked my dear, what do I do?"

She fanned Sakina's chest, lifting her shirt

"Pray my lady," she turned to Zainab and urged

She called out for Abid to come to her aid

"Come here my Son, Your sister won't stir"

"I'm trying to rouse her, I see no response

She's passed out I gather, but her breathing has stopped"

Feeling her pulse Abid moaned and tensed

And the mother cried "I have no more strength"

"Yet I'll face the truth, do not hide from me Son"

Abid replied "Dear mother, she is dead"

"Lay her down on the sand, let her rest

Her body is bruised, yet she's peaceful in death"

"In this dark prison my daughter is dead"

Banu cried "This death I will never forget"

And Fizza went to the prison door and asked

The guards for a lamp for the house of the dead

"No one keeps a body laying so in the dark

Yet our little girl lies in the prison night black"

With the light of dawn, the prison was lit

And Banu bent over Sakina and looked

Saw the bruised ears, dried blood on her neck

Her dress blood‑stained, tattered and burnt

Pale and gaunt, resting on the prison floor

Hair laden with dust, crying no more

"My dearest" She cried, "Wake up now

Its time for Namaz (Salat), your head you must bow

"You've never needed my help to wake up before

You'd wake on your own, what's happened now?"

"You know the guards' fury, do not so doze

This isn't home Sakina, they'll come to the door"

"The darkness troubled you, you couldn't rest

You'd pray for a breeze, you'd get upset

The breeze from heaven gill cool you tonight

in your new home Sakina my dear, sleep well"

"I hope you find comforts you couldn't find here

The grave is roomier than this prison my dear"
