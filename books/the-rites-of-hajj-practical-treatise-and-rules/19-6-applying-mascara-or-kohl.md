6. Applying Mascara or Kohl
===========================

Article 114
-----------

Applying mascara or kohl or black materials or other kinds is Haraam for
men and women in the state of Ihram if it is for decorating purposes. If
it is not for decorating e.g. for eye treatment, then it has no problem
if it is applied in a form other than decoration.
