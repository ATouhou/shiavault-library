Repentance
==========

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "The sigh of the people of Hell is mostly
because of the postponement of repenting."

Al-Mahajjat-ul-Bayda

Imam al-Baqir (‘a) said: "He who repents of his sins is as the one who
has not any (burden of) sin.

Wasa'il-ush-Shi'ah vol. 16, p. 74

Imam Amir ul Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) said: "How numerous procrastinators
there are who postpone (repenting and doing good deeds) until when death
overtakes them!

Ghurar-ul-Hikam, p. 240

The Holy Prophet (S) told ‘Ali-ibn-Abi-Talib (‘a): "O' ‘Ali! Blessed is
he who Allah looks upon while he is weeping for the sin that none is
aware of except Allah.

(Various traditions emphasize that one must not let others know of his
sins. One must make confessions about his sins only to Allah and, then,
repent.)

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 77, p. 63

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "During the third part of every night and on
the night before Friday from the beginning (until the break of dawn)
Allah sends an angel unto the sky of the earth in order to call: 'Is
there any needy who asks that I may bestow upon him his need? Is there
any repentant one that I may return to him? Is there any seeker of
forgiveness that I may forgive him?'"

Note:

Islamic traditions teach that sleeping on the night before Friday is
called 'the regret sleep'; for, on the Reckoning Day, people will regret
very much that they had been asleep on the nights before Fridays.

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 3, p. 314

Imam as-Sadiq, the sixth Imam, (‘a) said: "Shut the doors of sins
through seeking refuge to God, and open the doors of obedience by
(reciting) 'Bismillah'."[^1]

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 92, p. 216

[^1]: Bismillah, here is a short form of /bismillah-ir-rahman-ir-rahim/
