Part One : Osool Al-deen Or (the Fundamental Principles of Islam)
=================================================================

The fundamental principles or beliefs of Islam (Os}ool al-Deen), [or
the ‘pillars’ of Islam], are five:

1. Tawh}eed or the indivisible oneness of the supreme being and creator
of all things.

2. ‘Adl or the justice of the supreme being.

3. Nobowwah or the Prophethood.

4. Imamah or the Leadership of mankind.

5. Me‘a\>d or Resurrection.

**1. The Indivisible Oneness of Allah**

Tawh{eed is the belief that the universe, all existence, has a deity
who created them all, and brought everything into existence from
non-existence and that he sustains and maintains everything.

Therefore creation, sustenance, bestowing, denying, death, life,
sickness, health, etc. are all under His control and will: .Verily His
command is that if He wills a thing, He says to it “Be”, and it
becomes..4

The evidence for the existence of Almighty Allah is what we see around
us; the sky and whatever there is in it; the illuminating sun, the
bright moon, all other stars and galaxies, the clouds, the winds, the
rain . . . and the earth and whatever in it such as the seas and rivers,
the trees and fruits, the various kinds of precious minerals 4 The Holy
Qur’an; Ya\>seen (36): 82.

such as gold, silver, emerald and suchlike. As well as the various
categories of animals; those that fly, and those that swim in water or
those that walk or move on land in various forms, having distinctive
sounds and similar and dissimilar shapes and sizes.

And then there is this astonishing being, the human, who has a variety
of sensory powers such as hearing and seeing, smelling and tasting,
touching as well the gut feeling or hunch, and has many organs and limbs
such as eyes and ears, tongue and heart, hand and legs, and other states
or aspects such as health, disease, contentment, anger, happiness,
sadness, and suchlike.

All of these are evidence of the existence of an all-wise and
omniscient deity, in whom we believe, whom we worship, from whom we seek
help and in whom we trust and rely upon.

Almighty Allah and the Attributes of Beauty Allah, the Most High, has
many attributes:

He is omniscient, He knows about all things big and small. He knows
what people may have in their hearts.

He has the power and ability to do everything, He has the power of
creation, of giving sustenance, and He has the power of life and death,
and suchlike. He is forever living and never dies. He wills things that
are useful, and He does not will things that are not useful.

He sees all things, He hears all sounds even if a whisper in the ears,
or a thought or an imagination. His existence is from eternity to
eternity; for He, exalted and high, alone who is eternal, perpetual,
endless, and ceaseless. He was before everything else, then He created
all the things, and He will live forever after them. The universe in its
entirety is created by His power, in need of Him not only for its
existence but also for its survival and continuance. Everything that is
created is h}aadith [i.e.

an event, something that has taken place], and there is no qadeem [i.e.
perpetual, a being that has always been and will eternally be] except
for Almighty Allah. He speaks to any of His sincere servants whom He
wills; such as His messengers, and the angels.

He is truthful and never breaks His promise. He is the Creator, the
provider, the life giver, the source of bounties with the power to stop
them also; He is Merciful, Forgiving, Mighty, Honourable, and Noble.

Almighty Allah and the Attributes of Majesty Allah – Immaculate and
Most High – is free of all shortcomings: He is not matter, nor is He a
composition [of other constituents]. He does not occupy any space. It is
not possible to see Him, neither in this world nor in the hereafter.

He is not subject to effects, changes, or developments. So He does not
feel thirsty or hungry, He never ages, ceases, sleeps, or is oblivious
or unaware. He has neither partner nor peer, but He is One and Singular,
Unique and Absolute, who takes neither spouse nor offspring. His
attributes are the same as His Essence, they are not secondary to Him.

Thus, He is Omniscient, Almighty, along with all His other attributes,
since eternity, unlike us who were ignorant at times and then acquired
knowledge, or were weak at times and then became strong.

He is not in need of anything or anyone. He does not need any
consultation, or helper, or assistant, or any troops, and suchlike.

**2. Divine Justice**

Divine justice means that Allah does not do any injustice to anyone and
does not do anything that would be contrary to wisdom. Therefore,
whatever He has created, or whatever amount of sustenance He has given
to someone or withheld from someone are all on the basis of wisdom and
on good grounds even though we do not know the reasons for.

It is like a physician prescribing a certain medicine for a patient;
that we consider is good and useful even though we may not know all the
evidence for its usefulness. If we see that Allah has granted someone
wealth and He did not do so for someone else, or He made one to have
certain qualities and not the other, or He caused someone to become sick
and has kept another person healthy, and suchlike in all such cases we
must believe that all such cases are based on some kind of benefit and
wisdom even though we may not be aware of their benefit and wisdom.5

It is stated in a hadith, or tradition, that “Moses (A) asked Allah to
let him know something about His Justice, which looks otherwise on the
surface. Allah ordered him to go to a certain water fountain in the
wilderness to monitor the events that would take place therein. When
Moses (A) arrived at the fountain, he saw a horseman who had arrived at
the fountain to freshen up. When the horseman left the scene, he forgot
a bag of money behind.

Afterwards, a boy came to the fountain, saw the bag by the fountain,
with all eagerness and happiness picked it up and hurriedly left the
scene. Then a blind man came to the fountain to wash himself for prayer,
and at this time the horseman came back searching for his bag of money,
and when he did not find it, he accused the blind man of taking it.
Consequently a dispute flared up between the horseman and the blind man,
and eventually the horseman killed the blind man, and left the scene.

Moses was astonished at all this. Allah then revealed to Moses (A) that
the horseman had stolen the bag of money from the father of the boy (who
had found the bag of money left behind at the fountain by the horseman.)
In this way the property was returned to the rightful owner. The blind
man had previously killed the father of the horseman and therefore the
horseman at the end punished the killer of his father.”6

This is how Allah’s justice and wisdom works, even though it may look
some how far from the conventional rules.

**3. Prophethood**

When Almighty Allah created man, He wished him happiness and prosperity
in this world, and felicity and paradise for the hereafter. And this
cannot be achieved unless mankind has a programme that coincides with
his mind and nature, and a course that is in harmony with his body and
soul.

And such a comprehensive programme that addresses all the requirements
of the mind and nature, and the complete course that attends to the
entire needs of the body and soul may not be perfected except by the
creator of man who is well aware and knowledgeable of all his needs and
requirements.

And since Almighty Allah wished happiness for man when He created him,
it is necessary for Him to perfect this comprehensive programme to bring
about happiness to him, and to send this programme to the masses by
those of his creation and servants who are trustworthy, who are immune
to error, negligence and forgetting, purified from deficiencies and sins
– who are none other than the prophets and messengers, peace be upon
them. Thus, a prophet is the human being whom Almighty Allah reveals to.
And so a prophet conveys from Almighty Allah without the 5 Needless to
say many cases of poverty, disease, and suchlike are due to mankind’s
inappropriate dealing and management.

intermediary of any human being. The prophets are of two kinds of
status:

**(1) The Mursal Prophets**

The mursal or dispatched prophets were those who were commissioned to
guide people out of darkness to light, out of falsehood to the truth,
from myths and superstition to reality, and out of ignorance to
knowledge.

**(2) The non-mursal Prophets**

They were those prophets who received divine revelations for themselves
only and they had not received orders to preach such revelations to
people.

In total there were one hundred and twenty four thousand prophets but
the mursal prophets among them were just a few. The first of the
prophets was Prophet Adam (A) and the last of them was Prophet Muhammad
(S).

The mursal prophets are in two categories,

1. Olul-Azm prophets,
2. non-Olul-Azm prophets.

The Olul-Azm prophets are universal prophets whom Almighty Allah had
sent to the east and west of the Earth, and to the whole of mankind. The
non-Olul-Azm prophets are those who have been sent to limited areas, or
specific territories, particular groups or nations.

The Olul-Azm prophets are five:

i. Noah, (Nuh}) peace be upon him,
ii. Abraham, (Ibra\>him) peace be upon him,
iii. Moses, (Mosa\>) peace be upon him,
iv. Jesus, (Esa\>) peace be upon him,
v. Muhammad, peace be upon him and his pure progeny.

6 Bihhar al-Anwar, vol. 61, p117.

The followers of Moses (A) are the Jews, and the followers of Jesus (A)
are the Christians, and the followers of Muhammad (S) are the Muslims.
However, Islam has abrogated and superseded all the previous religions,
and therefore one may not persist on them, and it is imperative upon all
to follow the Teachings of Islam, as Almighty Allah says:

.Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted
from him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.7 Therefore
Judaism and Christianity are false and Islam remains the Law of Allah
until the Day of Judgment and will never be abrogated or superseded.

**The Final Prophet**

Therefore, Prophet Muhammad (S) is the last of all prophets, and the
religion revealed to him, which is Islam, abrogates other religions and
supersede them all, and that his Law – the shari’ah – remains effective
and valid until the Day of Judgment, and it alone is the law capable to
bring happiness to mankind, and realise his hopes and dreams in this
world and in the hereafter.

Similarly he – the prophet Muhammad – is the symbol of leadership for
mankind and the perfect example and complete model for the essence of
the good and the virtue. Therefore it is imperative upon all the Muslims
– rather all the peoples of the world if they wished good for themselves
– to follow his model in his way of life, and adopt his morals and
ethics, peace be upon him and his pure progeny. In order to know some of
his historical background, it is necessary to mention some of his
traits8:

7 The Holy Qur’an; The Family of ‘Emran (3): 85
8 For more details see the books “for the first time in the history of
the world”, vols. 1-2, “a scented bouquet of the life of the seal of the
prophets”, “the He is Muhammad the son of Abdullah, and his mother is
Aminah bint Wahab.

He was born in Mecca at the dawn of Friday on the seventeenth day of
the month of Rabi’-I in the year of the Elephant9, and that was during
the reign of Khosrau I or Chosroes I (also known as Anushirwan the Just
in Persian), the Just King of Persia.

**The Noble Prophetic Mission**

He received divine revelation on the twenty-seventh day of the month of
Rajab at the age of forty. Archangel Gabriel, peace be upon him, one of
Almighty Allah’s elite angels, descended upon him while he was in cave
H{ara\>’ in the Meccan mountains, and revealed to him five verses from
the surah of ‘alaq:

.In the name of Allah, the Beneficent the Merciful,
Read in the Name of your Lord who created,
Created man from a clot (of congealed blood),
Read, and your Lord is most bountiful,
Who taught by the pen,
Taught man that that he knew not.10.

After that, from mount S{afa\>, from within the Grand Mosque11, and
from other public places the Prophet Muhammad began preaching the divine
message to the people, guiding them to Almighty Allah, perfumed way of
life”, and “Muhammad and the Qur’an” by the late Grand Ayatollah Sayyid
Muhammad Shirazi.

9 The year of the Elephant, circa 570 CE, is in reference to the year
when Abrahah, king of the Yemen, decided to invade Mecca and demolish
the Ka’bah in a bid to pave the way for making his capital city the
centre for trade and the focal point for religious festivities. This
episode is referred to in the holy Qur’an in the surah of the Elephant,
\#105.

10 On various occasions the entire content of the Qur’an was revealed
to the Messenger of Allah – .We brought it down on the night of Qadr. –
and thenceforth, in a gradual process particular verses, ayahayat, were
revealed on the occasions of various events. The occasion of this
revelation was the first instance of the ‘official’ or ‘public’
revelation of the Holy Qur’an. Editor. 11 The Grand Mosque is that that
houses the Ka’bah.

and inviting them to believe in Him, saying to them “O people! Say la
ila\>ha illal-la\>h – there is no god but Allah – you will prosper”.12

The Meccans were polytheists and idolaters, and as their leaders had
personal interests in polytheism and idolatry, and in order to protect
their interest they opposed him, they began mocking him and ridiculing
him, and caused him great sufferings, and as the prophet persisted on
his attempts to guide them the polytheists persisted on causing him
greater and greater hardship and hurt him to the extent that he said,
“No other prophet was hurt as much as I have been hurt.”13

Only a few people from Mecca accepted his Divine message and the first
among them was Imam Ali (A) and then the Prophet’s wife, Khadijah (A)
and then a few others.

The first to believe in him amongst the men was Ali ibn Abu T{a\>lib,
peace be upon them, and from amongst the women was Khadijah bint
Khoweilid peace be upon her.

When the prophet’s persecution at the hands of the polytheists mounted,
the prophet migrated to the Medinah, and this migration is marks the
starting point of Muslim calendar.14

In Medinah the number of Muslims increased, and their strength and
valour augmented, and by the grace of the prophet’s outstanding and
beautiful teachings and the wise and generous laws of Islam, they became
a model of moral and human values, and an example for progress and
civilisation such that they exceeded and excelled all other
civilisations and religions – the divine ones and the non-divine.

13 Kashf al-Ghummah, by Ali ibn Esa al-Erbeli, vol. 2, p537
14 The lunar calendar used by the Muslims. The word hijri is in
reference to the hijrah or migration of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca
to Medina, which was about 621CE.

During his abode in Medina, the Prophet (S) faced wars and conflicts
all of which were defensive wars in a bid to repel the aggressions of
the polytheists, Jews and Christians against the Muslims. In all of
those conflicts the Prophet would always adopt the policy of peace,
mercy, forgiveness, and moral virtues with his enemies. Therefore in all
of the some eighty such conflicts [that took place] the total number of
casualties on both sides – the Muslims and their opponents – was not
more than fourteen hundred, as recorded by history.

**The Sorrowful Demise**

From the first day of his divine mission until his death, the divine
revelation always supported him. Archangel Gabriel, peace be upon him,
the Trustee of the revelations, used to reveal the Qur’an from Almighty
Allah bit by bit on various occasions until [the revelation of] this
great book was complete [for the people] in twenty-three years. He then
ordered for this book to be compiled and collated, and thus it was
compiled and ordered during his lifetime, peace be upon him and his pure
progeny, just as it is today without any addition or deletion.

Indeed, the Prophet used to formulate and organise the religious and
worldly affairs of the Muslims; he used to teach them the Divine Book
and wisdom, he used to show them the laws of worship and obedience,
business and transaction, social coexistence, politics, economics, and
various other issues from amongst the teachings of Islam.

After the perfection of the religion, which was by appointing Ali ibn
Abi T{a\>lib as the Commander of the Believers (Amir al- Mo’mineen) and
the Leader of the Pious (Imam al-Muttaqeen) and the (caliph) Successor
to the Prophet, which took place on the Day of Ghadir on the eighteenth
day of the month of Dhil-H{ijjah of the year of the Farewell Hajj, and
the Almighty Allah revealed .Today I have perfected your religion for
you, completed My grace upon you and approved Islam as a religion for
you.15, Allah’s Messenger (S) suddenly fell seriously ill and died as a
result of this particular illness on the twenty-eighth day of the month
of S{afar, year 11 Hijri.

The prophet’s was } i (executor of his will and the teachings revealed
to him) and caliph (successor) Imam Ali (A) undertook the task of
preparing the Prophet’s body for burial, and buried him in his house, in
the holy city of Medinah where his holy shrine stands today.

Allah’s Messenger (S), in all his states and in every situation was an
exemplary model and an example of the highest merit in trust and
sincerity, truthfulness and honesty, high morals and noble disposition,
knowledge and forbearance, kindness and forgiving, generosity and
bravery, abstinence and piety, modesty and virtue, justice, humbleness
and striving.

His body and physique was in the best and most beautiful shape possible
with total balance and excellence, and his face was bright, radiant and
attractive. Similarly, his heart and high spirit was in the peak of
spiritual perfection, his morals and etiquettes were most perfect they
could possibly be, and his way of life, conduct, teachings, and
practices were luminous and bright like a shining sun in the middle of
the day.

In short, he was the collection of all excellence and noble traits, the
focal point of honour and dignity, source of knowledge and justice, and
piety and virtue. He was the axis of religion and civilization, the
world and the hereafter. There has never been a man like him before, and
there will never come anyone like him in the future.

This is the Prophet of the Muslims, and this is the religion of Islam .
. . his religion is the best of all religions, and his book is the best
of all books, just as the Almighty said, .Falsehood shall not come 15
The holy Qur’an, The Table Spread (5): 3.

to it from before it nor from behind it; a revelation from the Wise,
the Praised One.16.

**Hadith from Allah’s Messenger**

‘The example of my Ahl al-Bayt is that of Noah’s ark; whoever boards it
is saved and whoever turns away from it drowns.’ ‘O people! I have left
behind for you that which if you adhere to, you will never go astray:
the Book of Allah (i.e. the Qur’an) and members of my Ahl al-Bayt . .
.’

‘Indeed, He who dies with the love of Al-Muhammad (the descendants of
Muhammad) in his heart, he dies a martyr, Indeed He who dies with the
love of Al-Muhammad in his heart, he dies and his sins are forgiven,
Indeed, He who dies with the love of Al-Muhammad in his heart, he dies
as a repentant, Indeed, He who dies with the love of Al-Muhammad in his
heart, he dies as a faithful whose faith has been perfected, Indeed, He
who dies, with the love of Al-Muhammad in his heart, the angel of death,
as well as Munkar and Nakir17 give him the good news of Paradise,

Indeed, He who dies, with the love of Al-Muhammad in his heart, he is
received in Paradise just as a bride is received in her (new) house.’

‘Cursed is he who burdens others with his responsibilities and lives
off them.’

‘On the Day of Judgement, one will not move one step unless he is
questioned about four things:

About his life and what he spent it on,
About his youth and what he used it for,
About what he earned, where he earned it from, and how he spent it,
16 The holy Qur’an, (41): 42.
17 They are the angels of the grave.

About the love of us, the Ahl-ul-Bayt’.

‘My Lord has recommended nine things to me:

Sincerity in private and in public,

Justice and equity in contentment and in anger,

Moderation in poverty and in wealth,

To forgive he who transgressed against and oppressed me,

To give to he who deprived me,

To keep bond with he who severed ties with me,

To contemplate when I am silent,

To say dhikr, [remember Allah and adhere to His laws, orders and
creations] when I talk,

To take heed and learn when I observe.’

‘O Aba Dharr! Value five things before five others:

Value your youth before your old age,

Value your health before your sickness,

Value your wealth before your poverty,

Value your calm (time) before your hectic (time),

Value your life before your death.’

‘O servants of Allah! You are like the patients and the Lord of the
worlds is like the physician. The interest of the patient lies in
(implementing) what the physician knows and administers, and not in what
the patient desires or suggests. Therefore obey the command of Allah so
that you would be amongst the victors.’

‘O Muslim people! Avoid adultery at all cost! For it has six features;
three of which are applicable to this world and three to the hereafter.
As for those of this world, it (adultery) destroys dignity, brings about
poverty, and shortens the life span. And as for those of the hereafter,
it brings about the wrath and anger of Allah, severity and graveness of
judgement, and eternity and perpetuity in the hell fire.’

‘Whoever from you observes something evil (in society) must change it
physically; if he is not able, then he must object to it verbally, and
if that is not possible, he must object to it by his heart, (he must not
remain indifferent) for this is the lowest status of faith.’

‘He who drinks alcohol is similar to he who worships an idol. He who
drinks alcohol, Allah would not accept his prayers for forty days, and
if he dies within those forty days, he would have died an infidel.’

‘The looking (of a man at a woman and vice versa) is a poisonous arrow
from Satan’s arrows. He who avoids it in fear of Almighty Allah, Allah
would bestow upon him a faith the wetness of which he can find in his
heart.’
