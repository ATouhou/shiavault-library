Regarding the Denial of Both Constraint And Delegation
======================================================

Says the Shaykh, our belief concerning this is the saying of Imam Ja’far
as-Sadiq: There is neither (complete) compulsion (or constraint on human
beings), nor (complete) delegation (or freedom), but the matter is
midway between the two (extremes).[^1] He was asked to define what was
meant by “an affair midway between the two.”

He said: For instance you see a man intent upon a crime and you dissuade
him; then he commits the crime. Now, it is not because he did not accept
(your advice) and you left him, that you are the person who commanded
him to commit the crime.[^2]
