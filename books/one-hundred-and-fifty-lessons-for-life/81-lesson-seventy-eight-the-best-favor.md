Lesson Seventy Eight: The Best Favor
====================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَجَلُّ النِّعَمِ اَلْعافِيَةُ وَ خَيْرُ مادَامَ فِى الْقَلْبِ
الْيَقيِنُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation

The best favor is health and the best thing which could fill man’s heart
is belief in God.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) has actually referred to the greatest material and
spiritual favors. Physical health is the greatest divine favor in the
material realm and it is indispensable for an active and a happy and
prosperous life. And among spiritual favors, nothing is higher than the
light of belief and faith. It is the most illuminating light for the
path of life and the most effective remedy for diseases of ignorance,
humiliation, inferiority and taint . It bestows tranquility to the heart
and the soul!
