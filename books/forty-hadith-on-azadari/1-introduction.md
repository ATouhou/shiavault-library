The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) has said:

*Those people from amongst my ummah, who memorise forty traditions
pertaining to those issues of religion, which they are in need* of,
*Allah shall resurrect them on the Day of Judgment as jurisprudents and
scholars. (Bihar al‑Anwar, vol.2, p.156; Al‑Ikhtasaas, p.2)*

In following the above hadith, The Islamic Education Board of The World
Federation of KSIMC (IEB ‑ WF) has decided to publish a series of
booklets of 40 ahadith on different subjects. The ahadith, which have
been selected from various sources, are short and simple and therefore
easy to understand and memorise. It is envisaged that the booklets will
not only be useful for zakireen, madrasah teachers and students, but
will be of benefit to the ummah at large.

For this first booklet of the series, the main source of reference was a
collection of forty traditions on A'zadari by Agha Jawad Muhaddathi.
More ahadith were added to the collection from which the final 40 were
selected for publication. The collection of the ahadith, together with
their translation in English, was carried out by Shaykh Shahnawaz
Mahdavi. IEB ‑ WF would like to thank Agha Muhaddathi and Shaykh Mahdavi
for their efforts.

May Allah s.w.t. accept this work as a further attempt by IEB ‑ WF to
propagate Islam.
