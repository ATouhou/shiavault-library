===============================

This blessed *Dua* is clinging to the Divine Rope as mentioned in the
verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And hold fast by the covenant of Allah all together.” (Qur’an, Surah

We are the rope of the Almighty Allah mentioned in the verse:

“And hold fast by the covenant of Allah all together and be not
disunited.”[^1]
