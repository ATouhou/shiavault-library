Maytham al-Tammar
=================

It was dawn. As usual, Maytham went to the date-palm trunk. He splashed
it with water. The good ground sent out a sweet smell. Maytham said two
Raka'as. Then he put his back against the date-palm trunk.

Maytham had visited the date palm for more than twenty years. It had not
been a mere dry trunk. It had been a tall date palm before twenty years.

Days, months, and years passed.

Maytham said two Raka'as near the date palm. Then he addressed it:

Allah has created you for me. And He has created me for you.

Maytham liked that date palm. He watered it when it was green.

One day, he came to the date palm. He found it a dry trunk. He cut the
top of the trunk. That tall date palm became a mere short trunk. Still
Maytham went on visiting that dry trunk.
