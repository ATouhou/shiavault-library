Articles of Faith
=================

1. Unity of God
---------------

The Islamic creed is that there is no God except Allah and Muhammad is
his Prophet. (la ilaaha illa-Allah Muhammadur- rasoolillah).

Muslims believe that Allah is **one.** He was neither begotten nor does
He beget. He has no Partner. He is the Beginning and He is the End. He
is omniscient and omnipresent.

The Qur’an says that He is closer to man than his jugular vein yet He
cannot be encompassed by human intellect.

See the following verses of the Qur’an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلِلَّهِ الْمَشْرِقُ وَالْمَغْرِبُ ۚ فَأَيْنَمَا تُوَلُّوا فَثَمَّ
وَجْهُ اللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And Allah's is the East and the West, therefore, whither you turn,
thither is Allah's purpose; surely Allah is Amplegiving, Knowing.
(2:115)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ
الرَّحِيمُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And your Allah is one Allah! There is no god but He; He is the
Beneficent, the Merciful.(2:163)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ ۚ لَا تَأْخُذُهُ
سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ ۚ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ
مَنْ ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ ۚ يَعْلَمُ مَا
بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ ۖ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِنْ
عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ ۚ وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ
وَالْأَرْضَ ۖ وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ
الْعَظِيمُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Allah is He besides Whom there is no god, the Everliving, the
Self-subsisting by Whom all subsist; slumber does not overtake Him nor
sleep; whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His;
who is he that can intercede with Him but by His permission?***

***He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot
comprehend anything out of His knowledge except what He pleases, His
knowledge extends over the heavens and the earth, and the preservation
of them both tires Him not, and He is the Most High, the
Great.(2:255)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بَدِيعُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لَهُ وَلَدٌ وَلَمْ
تَكُنْ لَهُ صَاحِبَةٌ ۖ وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ ۖ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ
عَلِيمٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Wonderful Originator of the heavens and the earth! How could He have
a son when He has no consort, and He (Himself) created everything, and
He is the Knower of all things.(6:101)***

خَلَقَ مَا اتَّخَذَ اللَّهُ مِنْ وَلَدٍ وَمَا كَانَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Never did Allah take to Himself a son, and never was there with him
any (other) god-- in that case would each god have certainly taken away
what he created, and some of them would certainly have overpowered
others; glory be to Allah above what they describe!(23:91)***

“Oh God, verily I ask Thee by Thy Name, in the name of Allah, the
All-merciful, the All-compassionate, O the Possessor of Majesty and
Splendour, the Living, the Self-subsistent, the Eternal, there is no God
other than Thou, Oh He of Whom no one knows what He is, or how He is, or
Where He is, or in respect of what He is, And yet, we know that He is.”

2. Justice of God
-----------------

Allah is **Just**. The Qur’an says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَلَيْسَ اللَّهُ بِأَحْكَمِ الْحَاكِمِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Is not Allah the best of the Judges?”*** **(95:8)**

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِنْ خَرْدَلٍ أَتَيْنَا بِهَا ۗ وَكَفَىٰ بِنَا
حَاسِبِينَ وَنَضَعُ الْمَوَازِينَ الْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ
فَلَا تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئًا ۖ وَإِنْ كَانَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And We will set up a just balance on the day of resurrection, so no
soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and though there be the
weight of a grain of mustard seed, (yet) will We bring it, and
sufficient are We to take account.”*** **(21:47)**

The Sunni School of thought subscribes to the view that nothing is good
or evil per se. What God commanded us to do become good by virtue of His
command. What he forbade became evil.

The Shi’as believe that there is intrinsic good or evil in things. God
commanded us to do the good things and forbade the evil. God acts
according to a purpose or design. Human reason cannot comprehend this
design or purpose in its entirety though man must always strive to
understand as much as he can.

### Compulsion or Freedom?

The various schools of thought are divided.

• Mutazzilas believe that man is totally free and God exercises no power
over his action. Those who subscribe to this view are also known as
Qadariyyas.

• Mujabbira school of thought believes that man has no freedom and is
only a tool in the hands of God.

• The Asharia school of thought to which most Sunnis subscribe believe
that though man has no free will, he will earn the reward of his good
deeds. The Sunni scholar Al-Ghazzalli sums up this doctrine as follows:
“No act of any individual, even though it be done purely for his
benefit, is independent of the will of Allah for its existence. There
does not occur in either the physical or the extra-terrestrial world the
twinkle of an eye, the hint of a thought, or the most sudden glance
except by the Decree of Allah, of His Power, Desire, and Will. This
includes evil and good, benefit and harm, success and failures, sin and
righteousness, obedience and disobedience, polytheism and true belief.”

• The Shi’as believe that there is neither total compulsion nor total
freedom. The true position is the one in-between. They maintain that
Allah has fore-knowledge of human action but does not compel man to any
particular course of action.

See Qur’an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ يُحَاسِبْكُمْ بِهِ اللَّهُ ۖ فَيَغْفِرُ لِمَنْ
يَشَاءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ
ۗ وَإِنْ تُبْدُوا مَا فِي أَنْفُسِكُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَشَاءُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah's;
and whether you manifest what is in your minds or hide it, Allah will
call you to account according to it; then He will forgive whom He
pleases and chastise whom He pleases, and Allah has power over all
things.(2:284)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَمِنْ نَفْسِكَ ۚ وَأَرْسَلْنَاكَ لِلنَّاسِ رَسُولًا ۚ وَكَفَىٰ
بِاللَّهِ شَهِيدًامَا أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَا
أَصَابَكَ مِنْ سَيِّئَةٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Whatever benefit comes to you (O man!), it is from Allah, and
whatever misfortune befalls you, it is from yourself, and we have sent
you (O Prophet!), to mankind as a messenger; and Allah is sufficient as
a witness (4:79)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
هُوَ ۖ وَإِنْ يَمْسَسْكَ بِخَيْرٍ فَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ

  </p>
</blockquote>

***And if Allah touch you with affliction, there is none to take it off
but He; and if He visit you with good, then He has power over all
things. (6:17)***

  </p>
</blockquote>

is our Patron; and on Allah let the believers rely. (9:51)***

بِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ۚ وَهُوَإِلَّا هُوَ ۖ وَإِنْ يُرِدْكَ
بِخَيْرٍ فَلَا رَادَّ لِفَضْلِهِ ۚ يُصِيبُ وَإِنْ يَمْسَسْكَ اللَّهُ
بِضُرٍّ فَلَا كَاشِفَ لَهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
االرَّحِيمُلْغَفُورُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And if Allah should afflict you with harm, then there is none to
remove it but He; and if He intends good to you there is none to repel
His grace; He brings it to whom He pleases of His servants; and He is
the Forgiving, the Merciful.(10:107)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا ۚ كُلٌّ فِي كِتَابٍ مُبِينٍ وَمَا
مِنْ دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And there is no animal in the earth but on Allah is the sustenance of
it, and He knows its resting place and its depository all (things) are
in a manifest book. (11:6)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
دَابَّةٍ إِلَّا هُوَ آخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهَا ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي عَلَىٰ
صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ إِنِّي تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللَّهِ رَبِّي
وَرَبِّكُمْ ۚ مَا مِنْ
  </p>

  <p>
خُلَفَاءَ الْأَرْضِ ۗ أَإِلَٰهٌ مَعَ اللَّهِ ۚ قَلِيلًا مَا
تَذَكَّرُونَ أَمَّنْ يُجِيبُ الْمُضْطَرَّ إِذَا دَعَاهُ وَيَكْشِفُ
السُّوءَ وَيَجْعَلُكُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Or, Who answers the distressed one when he calls upon Him and removes
the evil, and He will make you successors in the earth. Is there a god
with Allah? Little is it that you mind! (27:62)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَاصْبِرْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ ۖ وَلَا يَسْتَخِفَّنَّكَ

those who have no certainty hold you in light estimation.(30:60)***

  </p>
</blockquote>

***Do they not know that Allah makes ample the means of subsistence to
whom He pleases, and He straitens; most surely there are signs in this
for a people who believe.(39:52)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

  </p>
</blockquote>

***And whatever affliction befalls you, it is on account of what your
hands have wrought, and (yet) He pardons most (of your faults).

3. Prophethood
--------------

God created mankind to serve Him.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنْسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And I have not created the jinn and the men except that they should
serve me (51:56)***

He endowed man with faculties and freedom of action and out of His Grace
(LUTF) and Justice sent Prophets to instruct and guide mankind. No
nation or community was left without such guidance.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْقِسْطِ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ
رَسُولٌ ۖ فَإِذَا جَاءَ رَسُولُهُمْ قُضِيَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And every nation had a messenger; so when their messenger came, the
matter was decided between them with justice and they shall not be dealt
with unjustly. (10:47)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لطَّاغُوتَ ۖ فَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ حَقَّتْ
عَلَيْهِ وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا
اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا سِيرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ فَانْظُرُوا كَيْفَ كَانَ
عَاقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ الضَّلَالَةُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And certainly we raised in every nation a messenger saying: Serve
Allah and shun the Shaitan. So there were some of them whom Allah guided
and there were others against whom error was due; therefore travel in
the land, then see what was the end of the rejecters.(16:36)***

Some of these prophets were sent with Divine Revelation, scripture and
miracles. The first Prophet was Adam and the last was Muhammad, the Seal
of Prophets.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كَائِكُمْ مَنْ يَفْعَلُ مِنْ ذَٰلِكُمْ مِنْ شَيْءٍ ۚ سُبْحَانَهُثُمَّ
يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ۖ هَلْ مِنْ شُرَاللَّهُ الَّذِي
خَلَقَكُمْ ثُمَّ رَزَقَكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ يُشْرِكُونَوَتَعَالَىٰ
عَمَّا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Allah is He Who created you, then gave you sustenance, then He causes
you to die, then brings*** ***you to life. Is there any of your
associate-gods who does aught of it? Glory be to Him, and exalted be He
above what they associate (with Him). (30:40)***

While Qur’an mentions only twenty-five most prominent of the prophets it
also states that there were many more whose names have not been revealed
in the Qur’an.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لِرَسُولٍ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ بِآيَةٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِقَصَصْنَا عَلَيْكَ
وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ لَمْ نَقْصُصْ عَلَيْكَ ۗ وَمَا كَانَوَلَقَدْ
أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلًا مِنْ قَبْلِكَ مِنْهُمْ مَنْ فَإِذَا جَاءَ أَمْرُ
اللَّهِ قُضِيَ بِالْحَقِّ وَخَسِرَ هُنَالِكَ الْمُبْطِلُونَاللَّهِ ۚ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And certainly We sent messengers before you: there are some of them
that We have mentioned to you and there are others whom We have not
mentioned to you, and it was not meet for a messenger that he should
bring a sign except with Allah's permission, but when the command of
Allah came, judgment was given with truth, and those who treated (it) as
a lie were lost.(40:78)***

Muslims believe that there have been 124,000 prophets. Amongst those
specifically mentioned are Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Ismail, Issac,
Loot, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Moses, Aaron, Ezekiel, David, Solomon, Jonah,
Zachariah, John the Baptist, Jesus and Muhammad (saws).

Five of these prophets brought new codes of law. These were Noah,
Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad (saws). These are called the “ulu
l-azm” prophets meaning those of great constancy.

Qur’an mentions Five Divine books:

The Book of Abraham sometimes referred as the Booklet.

  </p>
</blockquote>

***These are they of whom Allah knows what is in their hearts; therefore
turn aside from them and admonish them, and speak to them effectual
words concerning themselves.(4:63)***

</blockquote>

***And your Lord best knows those who are in the heavens and the earth;
and certainly We have made some of the prophets to excel others, and to
Dawood We gave a scripture. (17:55)***

The Torah granted to Moses:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

بِمَا لَا تَهْوَىٰ أَنْفُسُكُمُ اسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ فَفَرِيقًا كَذَّبْتُمْ
وَفَرِيقًا تَقْتُلُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***And most certainly We gave Musa the Book and We sent messengers after
him one after another; and We gave Isa, the son of Marium, clear
arguments and strengthened him with the holy spirit, What! Whenever then
a messenger came to you with that which your souls did not desire, you
were insolent so you called some liars and some you slew. (2:87)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

  </p>
</blockquote>

***He has revealed to you the Book with truth, verifying that which is
before it, and He revealed the Tavrat and the Injeel aforetime, a
guidance for the people, and He sent the Furqan.(3:3)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مِنْ قَبْلُ هُدًى لِلنَّاسِ وَأَنْزَلَ الْفُرْقَانَ ۗ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ

***Surely they who disbelieve in the communications of Allah they shall
have a severe chastisement; and Allah is Mighty, the Lord of

***And they do not assign to Allah the attributes due to Him when they
say: Allah has not revealed anything to a mortal. Say: Who revealed the

Taurat and a guidance and an admonition for those who guard (against
evil).(5:46)***

The Qur’an revealed to Muhammad (saws).

A Muslim must believe in all the Holy Books.

The Shi’as also believe that all the prophets were Infallible and
Sinless. Not all the Sunnis subscribe to this belief.

4. Resurrection
---------------

The world will come to an end on the Day of the Rising (Qiyamah), the
day of final human accountability. All men will be resurrected and
presented before God Who will decide their fate according to their
deeds. The good will be rewarded with paradise (jannah) and the evil
will be punished with hell (jahannam).

  <p>

***Every soul shall taste of death, and you shall only be paid fully
your reward on the resurrection day; then whoever is removed far away

The dominant factor in the administration of His Justice by Allah will
be His Mercy.

  <p>
قُلْ لِمَنْ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ قُلْ لِلَّهِ ۚ كَتَبَ

لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Say to whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth? Say: To
Allah; He has ordained mercy on Himself; most certainly He will gather
you on the resurrection day-- there is no doubt about it. (As for) those
who have lost their souls, they will not believe. (6:12)***

5. Imaamah
----------

Only the Shi’as believe in the institution of Imaamat. Literally Imam”
means a Leader. In Shi’a belief an Imam is the person appointed by God
and introduced by the Prophet and then by each preceding Imam by
explicit designation (nass) to lead the Muslim community, interpret and
protects the religion and the law (shariah), and guide the community in
all affairs.

An Imam is first and foremost the Representative of God and the
successor of the Prophet. He must be sinless and possess divine
knowledge of both the exoteric and the esoteric meaning of the verses of
the Qur’an.

There are many Shiah sects e.g. the Zaidis, the Ismailis etc. The
principal sect is the Twelvers (Ithnasharis).

(NOTE: In these Notes, unless specifically stated otherwise, references
to the Shi’as and Shi’a beliefs, should be construed as references to
the Shi’a Ithnasheriyya school of thought.)

The Twelvers believe that the Prophet was succeeded by Twelve Imaams.
These are:

1. ‘Ali ibn Abu Talib (as) Died 40 A.H./659 A.D

He was the Prophet\`s son-in-law, having married his daughter Fatimah.

2. Hassan ibn ‘Ali (as), Died 50 A.H./669 A.D.

3. Hussain ibn ‘Ali (as), Died 61 A.H./680 A.D.

4. ‘Ali ibn Hussain (as), Died 95 A.H./712 A.D.

5. Muhammad ibn ‘Ali (as), Died 114 A.H./732 A.D.

6. Ja'far ibn Muhammad (as), Died 148 A.H./765 A.D.

7. Musa ibn Ja'far (as), Died 183 A.H./799 A.D.

8. ‘Ali ibn Musa (as), Died 203 A.H./817 A.D.

9. Muhammad ibn ‘Ali (as), Died 220 A.H./835 A.D.

10. ‘Ali ibn Muhammad (as), Died 254 A.H./868 A.D.

11. Hassan ibn ‘Ali (as), Died 260 A.H./872 A.D.

12. Muhammad ibn Hassan (ajtf), Born 256 A.H./868 A.D.

On the death of his father in 260 A.H. the twelfth Imam went into
occultation (Gaybah), appearing only to a few leading Shi’as. Until 329
A.H./939 A.D. he performed the functions of the Imam through
representatives appointed by himself. He then went into major
occultation which will continue until the day God grants him permission
to manifest himself.

The Sunni View
--------------

The Sunnis use the term Imam synonymously with the term khalifah. A
khalifah may be elected, or nominated by his predecessor, or selected by
a committee, or may acquire power through military force. A khalifah
need not be sinless. It is lawful for a person of inferior qualities to
be made a khalifah while persons of superior qualities are present.
