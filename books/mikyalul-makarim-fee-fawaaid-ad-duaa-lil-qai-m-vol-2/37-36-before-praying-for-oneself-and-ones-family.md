36. Before Praying For Oneself And Ones Family
==============================================

Authentic traditions have declared that true belief demands that one
should pray for the reappearance of Imam az-Zaman (aj) before he prays
for himself and his family. The concept of a quote from the Holy Prophet
(S) is as follows: “Surely a person will not be a believer till he
considers Allah’s messenger (S) dearer than his own life, and the
progeny of the Prophet (S) more beloved than his own family, and
finally, anything regarded by the Prophet (S) as significant is more
precious for him than what he considers as important.

There is no doubt that praying for the early reappearance of Hazrat
Vali-e-Asr (aj) is among the most important affairs, through which
hearts will gain peace and satisfaction. Hence, it is proper for a
believer that before he starts praying for himself and his family, he
should pray for the reappearance, thereby observing the due right of the
Holy Prophet (S).
