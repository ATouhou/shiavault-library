Unique Achievement
==================

One of the unique achievements of Islam is the fact that Muslims never
upgraded the Holy Prophet of Islam to godhood. It speaks eloquently of
the humility and selflessness of Muhammad (s.a.w.), who easily could
have been acknowledged (had he only wished so) as a deity in those days
when people were used to worship human beings; and especially so when
people were so much impressed by his matchless character and
unparalleled conduct that a mere hint would have been enough to make him
a god.

He did not want the people to take him as other than a man. He never
gave any room in any of his utterances which would in the least mislead
the people to raise him to godhood.

We know how easily a ‘son of man’ can be construed to be a god if he is
metaphorically spoken of as a ‘son of God’. Muhammad avoided all such
metaphorical references about himself. He always proclaimed all power,
knowledge and glory for the true God. He always presented himself as a
servant of Allah who did nothing but the will of his Lord. The frankness
with which he always presented himself to the world entitled him to the
title ‘The Plain Preacher’. As he has been addressed by Allah in the
Holy Qur’an. He presented the truth in its pristine purity and
originality without any misleading ambiguity.
