Abstract
========

*During the last centuries, great religious traditions as well as
prominent philosophical and theological schools have been facing the
so-called "problem of evil" and trying to solve it in a reasonable and
convincing way. This paper seeks to explore Muslim philosophers'
approach to the problem and examine their proposed solutions for it.
After the main versions of the problem in Islamic philosophy are briefly
sketched, the author explains its view about the non-existential nature
of evil. At this stage, he discusses the challenge of "apprehensional
evil" and three reactions to it. Then he turns to three main solutions
proposed by Muslim philosophers in order to meet three versions of the
problem of evil, i.e., the problem of evils and God's decree, the
problem of creation-dualism and the problem of evils and Divine wisdom.*
