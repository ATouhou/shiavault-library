Bahlool and the Amir of Kufa
============================

Ishaq bin Mohammad bin Sabah was the commander of Kufa. His wife bore
him a daughter. For this reason the Amir was very sad and depressed. He
stopped eating and drinking. When Bahlool heard about this he went to
the Amir and said, “O Amir, why this sorrow and grief?”

“I hoped for a son, but regretfully, my wife had a daughter.”

“How would you like it if Allah gave you, instead of these beautiful
hands and feet, and a healthy and perfect girl, a crazy boy like me?”

The Amir of Kufa laughed uncontrollably at Bahlool's speech, thanked
Allah, ate his meal and drank water, and permitted people to come and
congratulate him.
