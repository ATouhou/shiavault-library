Lesson Fifty Five: Self Sacrificing Lovers
==========================================

Imam Al-Baqir (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ أَصْحَابَ جَدِّىَ الْحُسَيْنِ لَمْ يَجِدُوا أَلَمَ مَسِّ
الْحَدِيْدِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The devoted companions of my grandfather, Imam Husayn (a.s.) did not
feel any pain under the strokes of sword and spear of enemy.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

When man’s affection for a goal reaches the stage of deep love , all of
his feelings are so concentrated on it that any amount of inconvenience
is tolerable for him. Not only tolerable, but it can even become
painless. When Egyptian women, based on a figurative transient love on
seeing Prophet Joseph’s face, could lose their awareness and cut their
fingers instead of fruits, it is not surprising that restless lovers in
the path of God and self-sacrificing persons in the path of truth and
virtue, would not feel pain and toil of heavy strokes of the enemy.
First , one shall be a lover, then self-sacrifice and tolerance will
inevitably follow.
