Open Conferences
================

Meet the oppressed and the lowly periodically in an open conference and
conscious of the divine presence there, have a heart-to-heart talk with
them, and let none from your armed guard or civil officers or members of
the Police or the Intelligence Department be by your side, so that the
representatives of the poor might state their grievances fearlessly and
without reserve.

For I have heard the prophet of God say that no nation or society, in
which the strong do not discharge their duty to the weak, will occupy a
high position.

Bear with composure any strong language which they may use, and do not
get annoyed if they cannot state their case lucidly. Even so, God will
open for you his door of blessings and rewards. Whatever you can give to
them, give it ungrudgingly and whatever you cannot afford to give, make
that clear to them in utmost sincerity.

There are certain things which call for prompt action. One of them is
correspondence regarding the redress of grievances, which your heedless
staff have been unable to tackle. See to it that petitions or
applications that are submitted for your consideration, are brought to
your notice without any delay, however much your officers might try to
intercede them. Dispose of the dayâ€™s work that very day, for the coming
day will bring with it its own tasks.
