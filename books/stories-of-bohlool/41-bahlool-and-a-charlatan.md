Bahlool and a Charlatan
=======================

They say that Bahlool had a gold coin in his hand, and was playing with
it. A fraud who had heard that Bahlool was insane, came to him and said,
“If you give me that coin, I will give you ten coins that color.”

When Bahlool saw his coins, he understood that they were copper, and
said, “I agree on one condition, which is that you bray like an ass, Hee
Haw, Hee Haw.”

The fraud agreed, and brayed like a donkey.

Bahlool said to him, “You are a strange ass that even after this
foolishness- you know that the coin in my hand is gold- you think that I
don't know that your coins are copper.”

As soon as he heard this, he ran away from Bahlool.
