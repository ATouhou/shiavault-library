2- Rifa'a At-Tahtawi (1801-73) was the first to campaign for interaction
with the European civilization with the objective of borrowing from it
that, which does not conflict with the established values and principles
of the Islamic Shari’ah. A graduate of Al-Azhar, the well-known Islamic
university in Cairo, he was appointed as an Imam to the Egyptian
regiment that was dispatched by Muhammad Ali to France. Although sent
there as an Imam and not as a student, and as a descendant of an ancient
family with a strong tradition of Islamic knowledge, he threw himself
into study with enthusiasm. He acquired a precise knowledge of the
French language and read books on ancient history, Greek philosophy and
mythology, geography, mathematics and logic and, most importantly, the
French thought of the 18th century - Voltaire, Rousseau's Contrat Social
(Social Contract) and other works. Returning home after five years, he
diagnosed the illness of the ummah (community) as being due to lack of
freedom and suggested multi-party democracy as a remedy. At-Tahtawi
criticized those who opposed the idea of taking knowledge from Europe,
saying: 'such people are deluded; for civilizations are turns and
phases. These sciences were once Islamic when we were at the apex of our
civilization. Europe took them from us and developed them further. It is
now our duty to learn from them just as they learned from our
ancestors.' A. Hourani, Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age 1798-1939
