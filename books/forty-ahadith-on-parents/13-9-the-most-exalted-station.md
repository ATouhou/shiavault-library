قَالَ رَسُولُ اللٌّهِ (ص): أَلْعَبْدُ الْمُطِيعُ لِوَالِدَيهِ وَ
لِرَبِّهِ فِي أَعْلَى عِلِّيِينَ.

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his family) has stated:
“One who is obedient towards his parents and his Lord shall be
accommodated in the most exalted of places on the Day of Judgment.”
