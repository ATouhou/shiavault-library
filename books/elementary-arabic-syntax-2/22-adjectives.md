141. What is an adjective?  
 An adjective is a word that describes a characteristic found in the
word before it. For example:  
**جاءَ التلمیذُ المجتهدُ** (The striving student came.)

142. How many types of adjectives are there?  
 There are two types of adjectives: essential and non-essential.

143. What is an essential adjective?  
 An essential adjective indicates a characteristic that is in the
described word. For example:  
**جاء الرجل العاقلُ** (The rational man came.)

144. What is the ruling regarding an essential adjective?  
 An essential adjective follows the described word in:  
 • being definite or indefinite: **الثوبُ الممزّقُ** (torn clothes)

• being masculine or feminine: **وَلَدٌ مُهَذَّبٌ** (well-behaved child)

• being singular, dual, or plural: **عاملانِ ماهرانِ** (two skilled
workers)

• the state of the word: **عاملَین ماهرَین** (two stilled workers)

145. What is a non-essential adjective?  
 A non-essential adjective indicates a characteristic of a word that
follows the described word. For example: **جاء الرجلُ الکثیرُ مالُهُ**
(The man who has a lot of money came.)

146. What is the ruling regarding a non-essential adjective?  
 A non-essential adjective is  
 • always singular: **رأیتُ الوَلَدَینِ الممزَّقَ ثَوبُهُما** (I saw two
children with torn clothes)

• follows the word after it in being masculine or feminine: **رَأیتُ
الغلامَ المُهَذَّبَةَ أختُهُ** (I saw a servant whose sister was well
behaved.)

• follows the described word in being definite or indefinite and the
state that the described word has: **رَأیتُ غلاماً عالمةً أمُّهُ** (I
saw a servant whose mother was a scholar.)

147. What state does the word that comes after a non-essential adjective
have?  
 The word that comes after the non-essential adjective is:  
 • an actor in the nominative state if the non-essential adjective is an
active participle noun or an adjective that is similar to a verb:
**رَأیتُ غلاماً عالمةً أمُّهُ** (I saw a servant whose mother was a
scholar.)

• a subject of the predication if the non-essential adjective is a
passive participle:

 **رأیتُ الوَلَدَینِ الممزَّقَ ثَوبُهُما**

148. When is a sentence or fragment considered an adjective?  
 A sentence or fragment can be an adjective only after an indefinite
word, for example:  
**سمعتُ شاعراً یُنشدُ** (I heard a poet reciting poetry.)
