Lesson Thirty: Speech and Silence
=================================

Imam Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لاَ خَيْرَ فِى الصَّمْتِ عَنِ الْحُكْمِ كَما أنَّهُ لا خَيْرَ فِى
القَوْلِ بالْجَهْلِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Neither the silence of a wise man nor the speech of an ignorant has any
profit.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

God has urged those who are informed and learned not to remain silent
against deviations, misbehavior, injustices and divisive actions of
enemies . They should radiate the light of guidance, truth and justice
on the hearts through their warm and reasonable logic and expression.
Everybody is considered informed and responsible for what he knows,
although it may be little. On the other hand, those who do not have
sufficient information should not mislead people through their improper
interference. That silence and this speech both cause misfortune.
