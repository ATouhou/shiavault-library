The Sunnis and the Idea of Al-raj'a
===================================

Quran aside, we have no Hadith from the Sunnis to support the idea of
al-Raj'a, except probably for the case of return of Prophet Jesus
(AS).

To disclaim the idea that the Imams of Ahlul-Bayt will finally have
rule on the Earth without any rival, and to make contrast between the
beliefs, the Sunni traditionists and commentators have suppressed any
Hadith that could imply the issue of al-Raj'a. Wherever they found any
narrator who has narrated a tradition implying al-Raj'a, they have
accused him of being Shia and extremist.

They also interpreted the verses of al-Raj'a/al-Karra in Quran to the
Day of Judgment, though we have already seen from the words of
Ahlul-Bayt (AS) (who are the most and only qualified individuals to
interpret Quran) that this would require believing in contradiction and
non-sense.

The Sunnis discredit the notion of al-Raj'a as being a kind of
transmigration of the soul. They have not, or choose not to
differentiated between transmigration and bodily resurrection. The
meaning of transmigration is that the soul moves into another body, and
this is not the same as bodily resurrection.

The meaning of the latter is that the soul returns to the same body
with all its individual characteristics; and al-Raj'a is the same as
this. If al- Raj'a were a kind of transmigration, the restoring to life
by Jesus (AS) must also be transmigration, and the Resurrection in the
Day of Judgment would be like that as well, which we know it is not
true.

The same evidence that proves the possibility of resurrection will also
prove the possibility of al-Raj'a. There is no reason for amazement,
except in that it is unusual for us and we are not accustomed to such
things in the life of this world.

But we know of no cause or impossibility that would bring us near to
refutation of al- Raj'a, except that human imagination does not find it
easy to accept what is extraordinary. So there is no more reason to
refute it than there is to refute resurrection. Allah states in Quran:

He said: Who will revive these bones when they have rotted away. Say:
He will revive them Who brought them into existence in the first place,
and He is Cognizant of all Creation. (36:78-79)

Those who belittle the idea of Raj'a of the Prophet (PBUH&HF), and mock
the followers of Ahlul-Bayt (AS) for their belief, should also know that
their master Umar was one of those who claim a similar idea according to
the historical evidences. Muslim historians agree that:

Umar stood at the Mosque of the Prophet when the Prophet passed away,
and said: "There are hypocrites who allege that the Messenger of God has
died. Certainly the Messenger of God did not die, but he went to his
Lord, as Moses, son of Imran, went to his Lord (for receiving the
heavenly commandments). By God, Muhammad will return as Moses returned,
and he shall cut off the hands and legs of those who alleged that the
Messenger of Allah has died."

Sunni Reference: al-Sira al-Nabawiyya, by Ibn Hisham, v2, p655

Although Umar's motives in this regard was different and his opinion
was not completely identical to the notion of al-Raj'a, yet we can not
say that Umar took this idea from Abdullah Ibn Saba. Ibn Saba did not
exist at that time, not even in the imagination of Saif Ibn Umar al-
Tamimi who invented this character. Saif wrote that Ibn Saba came to
Medina and became Muslim during the reign of Uthman, which is far after
the death of Prophet (PBUH&HF).


**The Doctrine of Ali's Executorship**

Sayf further alleged that Ibn Saba is the one who propagated the idea
that Ali Ibn Abi Talib is the executor and the successor of the
Messenger of God. He said that there were a thousand prophets before
Muhammad, each of which had an executor after him, and that Ali is the
executor of the Prophet. Furthermore, Sayf alleged that Ibn Saba said
that the three caliphs who ruled after the Prophet were usurpers of the
Islamic rule.

Sayf and his disciples forgot that they mentioned in their fiction that
Abdullah Ibn Saba came to Medina and adopted Islam during the reign of
Uthman.

This is long after the death of the Messenger of Allah. On the other
hand, Sunni history testifies that the Messenger of God himself is the
one who declared that Ali would be his executor right at the \*beginning
of his mission\*. Here is the tradition concerning the first open preach
the prophet (PBUH&HF):

Ali (AS) narrated: When the verse: "And warn your closest tribe" was
revealed, the Messenger of God called me and said:" Ali, certainly Allah
commanded me to warn my closest tribe, and I feel the difficulty of this
mission. I know that when I confront them with this warning, I will not
like their response." Then Prophet invited the members of his clan to
dine with him on a small amount of food and little milk. There were
forty of them. After they ate, the Prophet spoke to them:

"O Children of Abdul Muttalib, by God, I do not know of any young man
from the Arabs who brought to his people better than I brought to you. I
have brought to you the goodness of this world and the Hereafter. The
Almighty commanded me to invite you to it. Who among you will assist me
on this mission and become my brother, my executor, and my successor?"

No one accepted the invitation, and I said: "O Messenger of God, I
shall be your assistant." He held my neck and said to them: "This is my
brother, my executor (Wasi), my successor (Caliph) among you. So listen
to him and obey him." They laughed, saying to Abu Talib: He (Muhammad)
commanded you to listen to your son and to obey him.

The above tradition was also reported by important Sunni figures such
as Muhammad Ibn Is'haq (who is the most celebrated Sunni historian), Ibn
Abi Hatem, and Ibn Mardawayh. It is also recorded by orientalists such
as T. Carlyle, E. Gibbon, J. Davenport, and W. Irving.

Here we would like ask the following question: Imam Ali reported that
the Messenger of God is the one who granted him the office of
executorship, brotherhood, and successorship. Sayf Ibn Umar reported
that the idea of the executorship of Ali had came from a Jew called
Abdullah Ibn Saba. We should ask the members of the Takfeer University
(who call everyone who disagree with them unbeliever) the following
question: Do you believe in Imam Ali's report or Sayf Ibn Umar's? Sayf
was accused by prominent Sunni scholars of weakness, forgery, and
heresy.

Of course, we should not expect any true Muslim to choose the report of
a liar such as Sayf Ibn Umar and to reject the report of the Imam Ali
Ibn Abi Talib, the Leader of the Faithful, the "brother" of the Prophet
(PBUH&HF). The Messenger of God used to say to Ali:

"Your position to me is like the position of Aaron to Moses, except
that there shall be no Prophet after me"

The Prophet (PBUH&HF) thereby meant that as Moses had left behind Aaron
to look after his people as his Caliph when he went to receive the
Commandments, in the same way he was leaving Ali behind as his deputy to
look after the affairs of Islam after him. Allah said in Quran:

"... And Moses said unto his brother Aaron: Take my place among my
community." (Quran 7:142).

Notice that "Ukhlufni" and "Khalifa" (Caliph) are exactly from the same
root.

Do the mercenary writers who endeavor to spread hostility among Muslims
forget that while returning from his farewell pilgrimage, and in the
presence of over a hundred thousand pilgrims in Ghadir Khum, the
Messenger of God declared:

"Do I not have more right over the believers than what they have over
themselves?" People cried and answered: "Yes, O' Messenger of God." Then
Prophet (PBUH) held up the hand of Ali and said: "Whoever I am his
leader, Ali is his leader. O' God, love those who love him, and be
hostile to those who are hostile to him."

... And hundreds more...

No Muslim would ever doubt that the Messenger of God is the leader of
all Muslims for all generations. The Prophet in his statement granted
Ali the same position as his, when he said that Ali is the leader of
everyone who follows the Prophet.

This declaration which was narrated by more than one hundred and ten
companions and rated authentic (Sahih) and frequent (Mutawatir) by the
leading Sunni scholars, not only indicates that Ali is the executor of
Messenger, but also indicates that Ali takes the place of the leadership
of all Muslims after the Messenger of Allah.

However, these mercenaries still allow themselves to say that the
belief that Ali was the executor of the Messenger had come from a Jew
who declared his Islam during the days of Uthman!!!

Abdullah Ibn Saba has no base on the disputes immediately after the
death of prophet related to his successorship, and all relevant claims
of Shia is proven to be on the death of the prophet or even before that,
not during the reign of Uthman which is far long after prophet's
demise.

At the very start and immediately after the death of the prophet
(PBUH&HF), the Shia of Ali included those companions who where loyal to
Imam Ali, such as Ammar Ibn Yasir, Abu-Dhar al-Ghafari, Miqdad, Salman
al-Farsi, Ibn Abbas ...etc., all gathered in the house of Fatimah (AS).
Even Talha and Zubair were loyal to Imam Ali at the beginning and joint
the others in the house of Fatimah. al-Bukhari narrated:

Umar said: "And no doubt after the death of the Prophet we were
informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of
Bani Sa'da. 'Ali and Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while
the emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr."

Sunni Reference: Sahih al-Bukhari, Arabic-English, v8, Tradition
\#817

Other Sunni traditionists narrated that on the day of Saqifah:

Umar said: "Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Zubair Ibn Awwam and those who were with
them separated from us (and gathered) in the house of Fatimah, the
daughter of the messenger of Allah."

Also:

They demanded confirmation of the oath, but Ali and al-Zubair stayed
away. al-Zubair drew his sword (from the scabbard), saying, "I will not
put it back until the oath of allegiance is rendered to Ali." When this
news reached Abu Bakr and Umar, the latter said, "Hit him with a stone
and seize the sword." It is stated that Umar rushed (to the door of the
House of Fatimah) and brought them forcibly while telling them that they
must give their oath of allegiance willingly or unwillingly.

Certainly that Jew did not have any role in the division of the
companions into two factions right at the death of Prophet since he was
non-existent at that time.
