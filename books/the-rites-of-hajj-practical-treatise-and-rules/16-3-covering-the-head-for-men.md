3. Covering the Head for Men
============================

Article 98
----------

Covering all of the head in the state of Ihram is Haraam for Muhrim men,
and the obligatory precaution is that they do not cover even a part of
the head. But covering the head with hands or with a pillow during sleep
is permitted. Also putting the strap of bag on the head is permitted.
Covering the face is permitted for men.

Article 99
----------

It is an obligatory precaution not to cover the ears, too.

Article 100

Tying a handkerchief around the head because of headache has no problem,
also drying the head with handkerchief or towel is permitted on
condition that the pilgrim does not cover the head with that.

Article 101
-----------

Whenever a Muhrim forgets and covers the head, it is Mustahab to say
Labbayk again but it is not obligatory.

Article 102
-----------

It is an obligatory precaution not to cover the head with “mud” or
“henna” etc. or putting something like a basket on the head.

Article 103
-----------

A Muhrim is not permitted to sink his/her head into the water, even if
the rest of the body is out of the water, but pouring water on the head
for Ghusl or other purposes and taking a shower is permitted; but a
Muhrim should not sink his head into the water in the bathtub.

Article 104
-----------

The atonement of covering the head is one sheep for men as an obligatory
precaution, but in case of ignorance or forgetfulness there is no
atonement.
