In Sharra Fiqa Akbar we read that the Prophet (s) parents died Kaffirs
(God forbid). This is the Fatwa of the Imam of the Deobandi Nasibis,
elevated as a great man! These Nasibis are in fact swearing at the
Prophet (s) because to swear at his parents is tantamount to swearing at
him.

**Sharrah Al Fiqah'al Akbar, page 130**

The greatest insult that one can hurl at a fellow Muslim is to accuse
his parents of apostasy. There is no doubt that if such a comment were
made to the Nasibi on the street he would react violently. The reaction
if of course natural, it is a personal attack, for an insult on them is
in turn an insult on him - and the violent reaction is so as to defend
their honour as well as his own. This is how they would react if this
allegation was aimed at them - and yet these same Nasibis have no shame
whatsoever in declaring that the Prophet's parents were kaffir. What
explanation will they provide to for uttering such obscenity on the Day
of Judgement?

According the Nasibis / Wahabis if someone disrespects the Prophets
Sahaba hes a kaffir, what fatwa should we pass on those that have issued
takfeer against the parents of Rasulullah? Imam Abu Hanifa is your Imam
and declares the Prophet (s)s parents kaffir hence calling Shi'as kaffir
is not surprising.

**The Nasibis leader's Fatwas that the Prophets parents were Kaffir**

When confronted by the faithful about this belief they side track or
remain silent, but the book of the Nasibis are not silent, and their
Imam Ibn Taymeeya writes the following from his cursed hands:

"The Prophet's parents are in hell and he was forbidden from asking for
their forgiveness". Ikhthaza us Sirathul Mustaqim by Ibn Taymeeya, page
401 (Arabic)

"Ikhthaza us Sirathul Mustaqim" by Ibn Taymeeya, Urdu translation by M.
Hamid Fakeeh page 401 Ibn Kathir another devotee of Mu'awiya writes:

"Why can't the Prophet's parents and grandparents be in Hell? They were
idol worshippers and died with that faith yet this did not effect the
Prophets lineage because a Kaffirs marriage is valid" Ibn Kathir makes
efforts in both his books referred (see his footnote 21) to prove the
Prophet (s)'s parents were kaffir (unsuccessfully). How can the poor
Shi'a survive from takfir when the parents of our beloved Prophet (s)
are not even protected from such blasphemy?

**Fakhradin Radhi's kufr Fatwa on the Prophets parents**

Another scholar Radhi in his Tafsir al Kabir writes:

"The Shia's believe the Prophet's parents were momins and they have
relied on this verse and we believe that according to the companions
they were kaffir". It is interesting that Radhi admits that the belief
of his school is in line with the opinion of the Sahaba, rather than the
verdict in the Quran and the testimony of the Ahlul bayt (as). At the
forefront of those that have declared the Prophets parents kaffir are
Imams Abu Hanifa, Radhi, Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Kathir.

To counter this we present the writings of Allamah al Hafidh Jalaladeen
Suyuti and Qadhi Ibn Arabi:

"Whoever declares the Prophets parents to be 'Kaffir' is hell bound and
cursed".

"Manifa fi abbaya Shareefa" by Allamah al Hafidh Jalaladeen Suyuti

"Risala Turzul Imama" by Qadhi Ibn Arabi

**Another Nasibi attack on the parents**

Imam Muslim in Sahih (see footnote 21 in Sahih Muslim); writes the
following:

Abu Hurayra states that once the Prophet visited his mothers grave and
cried profusely so much so that those with him did likewise, he said I
asked my Lord if I could pray for my mothers salvation this was denied
me This is the high-ranking second of the Sihah Sittah, most authentic
after al-Bukhari. It declares that the Prophet (s)s parents were kafir,
Suyuti said those who say this are cursed, the Wahabis call each other
kafirs, if the enemies of the Sahaba are kafir enemies of the Prophet
are even more cursed.

The Nasibis further slander on the Prophets parents
In Mukhat Sharra Mishkat we read from the pen of Mullah Ali Qari:

The Prophet went to the grave of his Kaffir mother because he wanted to
show the importance to the Ummah of a mother, despite her kaffir status,
he prayed for her forgiveness It is curious the Nasibis regard those
that insult the Prophet (s) as Imams.

Another Fatwa on the Prophets parents being in hell Mullah Moin Kashafi
revered by the Sufis in his Maarij Chapter Miraaj he writes:

The Prophet states on the night of miraj I was near hell and saw a man
and woman burning. I inquired from the person in charge of Hell, Who is
this? The reply was I am ashamed to introduce them to you, you ask them
he (The Prophet) asked the woman said dont you recognise us? I am your
mother Aminah and this is Abdullah your father. Thousands have been
saved by your intercession but not your parents, the Prophet heard this
was saddened and tears filled his eyes a voice came from the hidden
Either save the Ummah or save your parents the Prophet chose the Ummah
and left his parents to the decree of Allah.

Ma'arijj by Mullah Moin Kashafi Chapter "Miraaj"

Can we rely on kufr Fatwas made by these individuals that insult the
Prophet (s) question his faith as a child and insult his parents?

**Shi'a belief about the Prophet (s)'s parents**

The Shi'a book Usul by al-Kafi records the following:

Imam Jafar (as) said the Prophet (s) said that Gibrael came to him and
said, Oh beloved of God, Allah showers his blessings on you. The fire of
hell has been made haram on your male lineage from whence came your
light and that womb that carried you and that lap from which you was
raised. Male lineage means your father Abdullah and his ancestors and
womb is that of your mother Aminah and lap refers to that of your Uncle
Abu Talib"

Usul, by al Kafi Chapter 1 "Mawalid Nabi" page 247

The Nasibis believe that the Prophet (s)'s parents were kaffir we
believe that they were momin and are in heaven.

**Nasibis attack on the Prophets lineage**

The Sunni scholar Ibn Qutaybah in Al Maarif on page 20 of his "Dhikr
Ansab ai Arab" writes:

Kannanah is the son of Khuzayma and he married his fathers wife, her
name was Barra binte Murr, their son Nazar was born from them.
Rasulullah comes from the lineage of Nazar. Ibn Qutaybah is a renowned
adherent of the Sahaba, and yet a clear blasphemer. These people accuse
the Shia of disrespecting the Sahaba our answer is clear, what of Nasibi
/ Wahabis who accuse the Prophets lineage of incest?

**The Nasibis defamation of the Holy Prophet (s)**

As part their propaganda campaign the common lie spread by the Nasibi
is that we believe that we elevate Imam Ali (as)s virtue above those
possessed by the Prophet (s). When saying so they pay no notice to the
rank that we given the infallible Prophet in our books. When the Nasibi
make the comparison they do so next to their deviant blasphemous
depiction that lowers the position of the Prophet (s) to that of an
ordinary man on the street going about his daily business.

It is the Shia alone that believe that the Prophets (S) were infallible
in all regards. We are proud to believe that the Holy Prophet (s) was
free from error, whose obedience is unconditional. Curiously the Nasibis
attack us for adhering to this belief! This is what their Imam Ibn
Taymeeya writes:

The view that the Prophets were protected from major sins (kabaair) but
not from minor sins (saghaair) is the view of the majority of the
scholars of Islam and all the sects It is also the view of the majority
of the scholars of Tafseer and hadeeth, and of the fuqahaa. Nothing was
reported from any of the Salaf, Imams, Sahaba, Taabieen or the
successive generation that does not agree with this view...

Most of the reports from the majority of scholars state that they were
not infallible with regard to minor mistakes, but they were not allowed
to persist in them; they do not say that this could never happen at all.
The first suggestion that they were completely infallible came from the
Raafidis, who say that they are so infallible that they could never make
any mistake even by way of forgetfulness and misunderstanding.

**Majmoo' al-Fataawaa, by Ibn Taymeeya Volume 4 pages 319 -320**

The Nasibi belief in the Prophet (s) is the sort of belief that Salman
Rushdie would be proud of. Suffice it to say they believe that the Seal
of all Prophets would urinate whilst standing up(1) sleep with nine
wives in one night(2) fondle his wives during their periods(3)
mistakenly lead the prayers whilst Junub (in an impure state) (4),
forget the number of rakaats that he had prayed(5) was affected by
witchcraft(6) and was unsure as to would happen to him on the Day of
Judgement(7).

"Sahih al Bukhari", Arabic-English, translated by Dr Muhsin Khan

1. Volume 1 hadith number 225
2. Volume 1 hadith number 165
3. Volume 1 hadith number 298
4. Volume 1 hadith number 682
5. Volume 7 hadith number 661
6. Volume 2 hadith number 334

This is what these self declared defenders of the Sunnah want us to
believe is the position of our beloved Prophet (s) or should we state a
lack of one. How are we going to invite non-Muslims to Islam when we
have Nasibis propagating filth like this? If a Kaffir interested in
Islam read these types of accounts would his respect for the Prophet (s)
increase or decrease? With this pathetic Nasibi position let us now
delve in to the rank they give to the Prophet (s).

**The Nasibi fatwa that Rahmat Lil Alameen is not an exclusive title
for the Holy Prophet (s)**

We have in the previous chapter highlighted the beliefs that the
Nasibis hold about the Prophet (s) the mercy of mankind, the greatest of
Allah (swt)s creations. Of interest is the fact that these Nasibis dont
even apply much significance to this sacred title bestowed on Rasulullah
(s) in the Quran. The prominent Nasibi the late Rashid Ahmad Gangohi
delivers this fatwa:

The title Rahmatul Lil Aalameen (Mercy to all the Worlds) is not an
exclusive attribute of the Holy Prophet (Sallal Laahu 'Alaihi Wa
Sallam). Other saintly persons also can be called Rahmatul Lil
'Aalameen.

Fataawa Rasheediyah, by Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, 218 Is there anything
more insulting than this? To state that a title Allah (swt) bestows on
his beloved can also be held by fallible human beings like us!

**Nasibi attack on Rasulullah (s)'s knowledge
**
Deobandi Nasibi Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi commenting on Rasulullahs
knowledge of the unseen states:

The knowledge of the unseen that was possessed by Rasulullah (s) is
nothing special it is just like that possessed by madmen and animals"
Hifzul Iman, by Maulana Ashraf Ali Thavi page 8

With comments such as these one wonders why the Muslims were so
outraged by the comments of Salman Rushdie. Here we have a Deobandi
scholar equating Rasulullahs Ilm ai Ghayb to animals and lunatics. Had a
Christian missionary written this it would not have been as bad, after
all they dont believe in Rasulullahs Prophethood and will hence seek to
play down any of the miracles he possessed. Unusually we are here
presented by a Deobandi Mullah seeking to cast doubts on Rasulullahs
knowledge of the unseen in effect suggesting that it means nothing.
Perhaps the Deobandis could elaborate and tell us how many mad men and
animals had foretold future events such as wars, famine and the coming
of Imam Mahdi (as).

**The Nasibi belief to think about the Prophet (s) during prayers
lowers you to the status of a donkey**

This is what the high ranking Nasibis Shah Ismail Shaheed and Sayyid
Ahmad Shaheed write: "If fornication comes into your mind whilst
offering Salat it is better to think about having sex with your wife. If
you think about anyone during prayers, even about the Prophet, then you
are worse than a donkey".

Siratul Mustaqim, page 169 by Sayyid Ahmed Shaheed & Shah Ismail
Shaheed, Maktaba Salafiyya, Lahore Does thinking about the Prophet (s)
reduce an individual to a donkey? Would anyone with sincere love for the
Prophet (s) hold such an opinion? Salat is undoubtedly for Allah (swt)
alone - but to suggest that to lapse and think about the Prophet reduces
ones status to that of a farmyard animal is the type of comparison that
is only fitting, having been uttered by those Shah Abdul Aziz had
compared to animals.

The Nasibi fatwa that Shaythan can take the form of the Prophet (s)

This is the filth written by Ibn Taymeeya: Angels cannot help the
people, but Shaytan can by appearing in human form, sometimes he can
take the form of Ibrahim, Esau, Prophet Muhammad, Khizr ..." Al Waseela,
by Ibn Taymeeya, translated into Urdu by Ehsan Ali Zaheer page 41,
(Idara Tarjamun ul Sunna - Sheeysh Muhall) The Nasibis readily accuse
others of being deceived by the devil and yet their Imam believes that
the Devil can deceive the people by appearing as the Prophet (s).

**The Nasibi fatwa that Shaythan fears Hadhrath Umar and not the Holy
Prophet (s)**

In Ahlul Sunnahs authentic Mishkat al Masabih we read:

The Prophet returned from one of the Holy Wars. When he came back a
black girl came and said O Apostle of Allah! I have taken a vow that if
Allah takes you back sound I shall beat this Daf in your presence with a
song. The Apostle said if you have taken a vow then beat, and if not,
not. Then she began to beat. Abu Bakr entered while she was beating,
Thereafter Ali entered while she was beating. Usman entered while she
was beating. Thereafter when Umar entered, she threw the Daf under her
buttock and sat on it. The Apostle of Allah replied O Umar the Devil
certainly fears you. I was sitting and she was beating, then Ali entered
and she was beating. Then Usman entered and she was beating. When you
entered O Omar she threw down the Daf.

Mishkat al Masabih by Tabrizi, English translation by al Haj Maulana
Fazlul Karim under the Chapter dealing with the virtues of Umar Volume 4
hadith 14

This is an alleged hadith that the Nasibis propagate to their
followers. First and foremost it is haraam for a man to listen to a
woman singing. The Nasibis are therefore suggesting that the Prophet (s)
was indulging in a sin! Then the Nasibi would want us to believe that
Hadhrath Umar was the hero of the hour who brought this activity to an
end. Hadhrath Umar saved the Prophet (s) from the clutches of Shaytan he
had been taken in by the activity, as were Hadhrath Abu Bakr and
Hadhrath Ali.

There is no other interpretation possible the words of the Prophet Only
Shaytan is afraid of you proves that Hadhrath Umars rank is above that
of the Prophet (s). Perhaps those that allege we view Imam Ali as better
in rank than the Prophet (s) should stroke their long beards and ponder
over this matter! Shaytan fear Hadhrath Umar not the Holy Prophet (s)!
What utter nonsense! But then Nasibi ideology is nonsense. They proudly
relay flaws in the Prophet (s)s character citing books joyfully
recollecting the filthy fabricated traditions that we have cited
earlier.

The Nasibi dont even flinch when they narrate these fairy tales the
fact that this is the type of filth can only best be described, as
ammunition for Christian Missionaries does not bother them in the
slightest! Highlighting the Prophet (s) alleged wrongs are tolerated and
permissible, but to highlight flaws in the companions can never be
tolerated and makes you a kafir! The Nasibi have more respect for the
companions than they do the Holy Prophet (s) hence an even more absurd
fatwa.

**The Nasibi belief that Hadhrath Abu Bakr was superior to previous
Prophets**

The Indian Nasibi Maulana Muhammad Naeem Lucknawi declares the
following:

Hadhrath Abu Bakrs superiority can not be matched by Musa or Esa. Kitab
ay Shahaadat by Maulana Muhammad Naeem Lucknawi, Volume 2 page 11
(Kurzan Press Publishers)

Can you believe this! This coming from the Nasibis mock the Shias for
believing that the position of the Prophet (s) designated Imam is
superior to previous prophets. We of course are referring to the duty
upon the Imam is greater and cite countless Sunni traditions proving
that Hadhrath Esa (as) will pray Salat behind Imam Mahdi (as). Compare
this to the belief of the Nasibis one that degrades the Prophet (s)s
life, believes that a stick is better than him, wants us to accept that
Shaytan is scared of Hadhrath Umar and not the Prophet and that Hadhrath
Abu Bakr is superior to previous Prophets!

**The Nasibi substitution of the Kalima with the name of one of their
Ulema**

Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi (d. 1943) was a very famous leading Deobandi
/ Nasibi scholar from Pakistan. In his monthly magazine Al-Imdad he had
the audacity to publish a letter written to him by one of his beloved
Salafee adherents. This is what he wrote:

I see in a dream that while reciting the Kalima, There is no god but
Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah', I am using your name
instead of 'Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah'. Thinking that I am
wrong, I repeat the Kalima, but despite wishing in my heart to say it
correctly, my tongue involuntarily says 'Ashraf Ali' instead of the Holy
Prophet's name. .... When I wake up and remember my mistake in the
Kalima, to make amends for the mistake I send blessings upon the Holy
Prophet. However, I am still saying: 'O Allah, bless our master, prophet
and leader Ashraf Ali', even though I am awake and not dreaming. But I
am helpless, and my tongue is not in my control.

Al-Imdad, issue for the month of Safar, by Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi
1336 A.H., circa 1918, page 35

Thanvi in his reply to the letter (also printed straight after)
interprets the dream as follows:

"In this incident, it was intended to satisfy you that the one to whom
you turn [for spiritual guidance, i.e. Ashraf Ali] is a follower of the
Holy Prophet's example"

Al-Imdad, issue for the month of Safar, by Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi
1336 A.H., circa 1918, page 35

Is there anything more outrageous than this? The Nasibis love for his
Master is such that he substitutes the name of the Prophet (s) with that
of Maulana Thanvi. Rather than condemn his follower for this kufr act,
Thanvi seeks to rationalise the dream in order to elevate his position
to his audience. Would it not have been incumbent on Thanvi to put his
follower in his place putting this dream down to a Devils deception? If
a Nasibi scholar condones an action that takes you out of Islam, and
fails to rebuke the perpetrator for this act, what religion are the
Nasibis following? What is left of Islam and the finality of the
Prophethood if a Nasibi can substitute the Shahada in preference of his
teacher and yet this is not deemed kufr? What faith should anyone have
in the Nasibi Ulema in light of this blasphemy?
