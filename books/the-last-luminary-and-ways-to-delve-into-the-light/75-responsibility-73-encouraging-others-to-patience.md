Responsibility 73: Encouraging Others to Patience
=================================================

Encouraging others to observe patience and staying firm on this path
during the period of the occultation (as was mentioned in the previous
section) is another responsibility that the true believers must perform.

One must command and encourage his family, friends, brothers and sisters
to observe patience and stay firm on the true faith.

The Messenger of Allah (S) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ فِـي عَلِيٍّ نُزِّلَتْ ] وَ الْعَصْرِ [ وَ تَفْسِيرُهَا: وَ رَبِّ
عَصْرِ الْقِيَامَةِ، ] إِنَّ الإِنْسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ [: أَعْدَاءَ آلِ
مُحَمَّدٍ ] إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا [ بِوِلاَيَـتِهِمْ ] وَ عَمِلُوا
الصَّالِحَاتِ [ بِمُوَاسَاةِ إِخْوَانِهِمْ ] وَ تَوَاصَوا بِالْحَقِّ
وَ تَوَاصَوا بِالصَّبْرِ [ بِالصَّبْرِ فِي غَيْبَةِ غَائِبِهِمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Surat al-’Asr was revealed about ‘Ali (as) and its exegesis is as
follows: I swear by the time, I swear by the Lord of the Day of
Judgement. Verily all of mankind is at loss, the enemies of the family
of Muhammad Except for those who believe in their (the Ahlul Bayt’s)
wilayah, And perform righteous actions showing kindness to their
brothers in the faith, and encourage others to observe the truth and
encourage others to observe patience they encourage the observing of
patience during the occultation of the one who is in occultation.”[^1]
