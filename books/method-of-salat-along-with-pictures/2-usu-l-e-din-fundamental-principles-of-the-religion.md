Usu l-e-Din (Fundamental Principles of the Religion)
====================================================

**Fundamental Principles of the Religion are five:**

1. Tawhid [Oneness ofAllah]
---------------------------

Tawhid means that God is One. He has no associates or partners. He was
not born from anyone, nor is anyone born from him, and there is nothing
like Him.

2. Adl [Just]
-------------

'Adl means that Allah is just and he does not oppress any of His
creations. He will reward and punish everybody according to his or her
actions.

3. Nubuwat [Prophethood]
------------------------

Allah sent Prophets to mankind for guidance, and among their great
characteristics is that they were Ma'sum - meaning that they were immune
from committing sins and errors. A Prophet excels all other people for
he is sent by Allah to perfect mankind and teach them the correct code
of life. The first of the Prophets was Adam (Peace be upon him), and the
last of them was Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah (Peace be upon him and his
family). In total, Allah sent 124,000 Prophets to us.

4. Imamat [Leadership]
----------------------

After the death of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him and his family),
Allah designated and appointed twelve Imams, one after the other, to
lead and guide the community until the Day of Judgement. Just like the
Prophets, the Imams too are immune from committing sins or errors. The
Imams which are twelve in number and they are the only rightful
successors to the Prophet of Islam. The first of them was 'Ali (Peace be
upon him) and the last of them is Imam al-Zaman (may Allah hasten his
reappearance), who is still alive.

5. Qiyamat [Resurrection]
-------------------------

Qiyamat means that when the Day of Judgement comes, all people will be
brought back to life. Those who had performed good deeds in this world
will be rewarded and will go to Heaven and those who did bad deeds will
be punished for their actions.
