The Aoris and Imperative Tenses
===============================

33. How do you form the aorist tense?

34. How do you form the imperative?

33. The aorist tense is formed by adding one of the aorist letters at
the beginning of the preterite stem. These are four letters: *alif*,
*nūn*, *tā'* and *yā'*. This letter is given a *dummah* if the verb has
four letters and a *fathah* if it has anything other than four letters.
So **نَصَرَ** becomes **یَنصَرُ** and **دَحرَجَ** becomes **یُدَحرِخُ**

34. The imperative is taken from the aorist tense. The aorist letter
must be replaced by a glottal stop and the first letter of the verb
should not be given a vowel. For example; **یَنصَرُ** becomes **اُنصُر**
