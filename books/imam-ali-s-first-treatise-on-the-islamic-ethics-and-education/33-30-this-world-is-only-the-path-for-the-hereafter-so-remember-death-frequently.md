*“My son! Know that you were created for the Hereafter, not for this
world, for extinction (in this world), not for permanence, and for
death, not for life. You are in an abode from which you must depart, in
a place from which you acquire your provisions, and on a path to the
Hereafter. You are being chased by death from which no fleeing one is
saved, none whom it seeks escapes from it, and it will inevitably catch
up with him. So be on your guard against it, lest it should overtake you
while you are in a state of sin from which you were telling yourself
that you would repent, and it (death) prevents you from that. In such a
case you will have destroyed yourself.*

*My son! Remember death frequently, and the place that you will suddenly
fall into and reach after death, so that when it comes, you are on your
guard against it and have prepared yourself for it. Do not let it
(death) come suddenly such that it overcomes you.*

*Beware of being deluded by what you see of the people of the world
inclining towards it (the world), and their avidity for it, for God has
informed you of it and the world itself has announced to you its
mortality and revealed to you its vices. Its adherents are only howling
dogs and rapacious beasts snarling at one another. Their strong devour
their weak and their old subjugate their young. (They are like) cattle,
some confined and others left untended. They have lost their intellects
and ventured into what is unknown. They are (like)* *diseasesd cattle
left free to graze in a valley of soft sand, difficult to traverse. They
have neither a shepherd to keep them in order nor a herdsman to take
them to pasture.*

*The world has taken them them on the path of blindness, and taken their
sights from the beacon of guidance, so they are wandering in its
perplexities and drowned in its pleasures. They have taken it (the
world) as a lord, so it plays with them and they play with it and they
have forgotten what is beyond it. Gradually the darkness will become
dawn, and it is as if the caravan has arrived; soon those who hasten
will meet (the caravan)”.*

Commentary
----------

In this letter by Imam ‘Ali (as) there are some educational points
concerning the philosophy of creation, man's readiness for death, a
picture of the world and the world-worshippers. These points are taken
up separately in the following sections:

### 1. The Philosophy Of Man's Creation:

From the viewpoint of the Holy Qur’an, the philosophy of man's creation
is sometimes based on Allah's Generosity and Magnanimity:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَلَوْ شَاءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَلَا
يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ إِلَّا مَنْ رَحِمَ رَبُّكَ وَلِذَلِكَ
خَلَقَهُمْ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"And if your Lord had pleased He would certainly have made people a
single nation, and they shall continue to differ, except those on whom
your Lord has mercy; and for this did He create them***;***".***[^1]

And sometimes the philosophy of man's creation is introduced as a way
for man to see God's traits and magnificent powers and His domination
over all creatures.

> "اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ وَمِنْ الْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ
> يَتَنَزَّلُ الْأَمْرُ بَيْنَهُنَّ لِتَعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى
> كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ أَحَاطَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ
> عِلْمًا"536

***"Allah is He who created seven heavens, and of the earth the like of
them; the decree continues to descend among them, that you may know that
Allah has power over all things and that Allah indeed encompasses all
things in His knowledge."***

In another occasion, the philosophy of creation is defined as "Worship"
***“And I have not created the jinn and the men except that they should
serve Me.**”*[^2]

At another occasion, the philosophy of creation is supposed to be
"Trial" ***“Who created death and life that He may try you-which of you
is best in deeds."***[^3]

All of these interpretations, however, have one thing in common. Man
possesses different skills and capabilities in differing areas of
thought, ethics and rights which could be manifested only through
programs. Thus, carrying out these programs is interpreted as worship;
the way these plans are carried out is interpreted as "trial"; the
guidance of Allah in the materialization of these aims is interpreted as
God's benevolence; and the recognition of Allah and His traits which is
the main factor behind all of this collection (Thought, ethics, and
duties) is interpreted as God's recognition.
Thus, it is right to say that the philosophy of man's creation is a
combination of worship, God's benevolence, man's trial and God's
recognition. And these four factors all lead to man's perfection.[^4]

But sometimes in the philosophy of man's creation there are some
interpretations which show the direction of his perfection, and not the
agent for his perfection.

This is said in ‘Ali's letter.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"خُلِقْتَ لِلآخِرَةِ لا لِلدُّنيا ولِلفَناءِ لا لِلبَقاءِ ولِلمَوتِ لا
لِلحَياةِ واِنَّكَ في قَلعَةٍ ودَارِ بُلغَةٍ وطَرِيقٍ الى الآخِرَة"
  </p>
</blockquote>

"..*you were created for the Hereafter, not for this world, for
extinction (in this world), not for permanence, and for death, not for
life. You are in an abode from which you must depart, in a place from
which you acquire your provisions, and on a path to the Hereafter* ".

In such interpretations the main issue is that man is not eternal;
sooner or later he will leave this world to live in his eternal shelter.
He has to prepare provisions to make him at ease in the other world. But
what is the nature of that provision? What is going to happen to him?
These are not discussed in this letter. But one thing is clear: the aim
is to be prepared for the Hereafter with the right form of provisions.
This is included in the philosophy of the creation of man and shows the
direction of man towards perfection.

### 2. He Warns Us Through A Delicate Simile

Imam ‘Ali (as) in this letter compares man to a game that is made to run
by the hunter who is about to hunt it. And finally he is trapped. In the
same way, death, like the hunter, has made man run, only to be trapped
and caught a little later. This does not depend on his will to either
surrender or to go free.
For this reason, man should be careful not to indulge in wrong-doings
and not to lose the right of repentance. He might be willing to repent;
then let him not waste his time.

The Holy Qur’an talks about the Pharaoh when getting drowned. At that
critical time he said "I believe", but God said: ***“..indeed you
disobeyed before..”***[^5]***.***

### 3. Always Remember Death And Be Prepared For It

Since one day we will inevitably taste the flavor of death and will be
defeated by it, we should not destroy and annihilate one another like
savage dogs and animals and be deceived by the luxuries of this world.
Let us not walk like beasts which are wandering in the desert with no
shepherd to guide us. Let us not be in a situation where we are deprived
of Imam's obedience. In such cases we might either act like those beasts
which are dominated by wrath, such as wild beasts, or we might act like
those beasts which are dominated by lusts, such as game. In both cases
we might go after our wishes and stay world-mongers. The world may make
dolls out of us and we may forget the Hereafter. In doing so, we might
be less than beasts because we have intellect and should do otherwise.

Thus, we have to:
Firstly: remember death and its consequences. The remembrance of death
kills lusts and the roots of negligence, strengthens the heart to
believe in God's promises and softens man's nature and breaks the flags
of wishes and whims and belittles this world.

Secondly, be prepared for death and get ready for leaving. This state of
affairs prohibits man from living like beasts and forces him to improve
himself by practicing his religion and obeying the just Imam. It is for
this reason that the Great Prophet (S) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِستَعِدَّ لِلمَوتِ قَبلَ نُزُولِ المَوتِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Get ready for death before it arrives"*[^6]

Somebody asked Imam ‘Ali (as) "What do you mean by being prepared for
death?" He answered:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اَداءُ الفَرائِضِ واَجتِنابِ المَحارِم, والاِشتِمالُ على المَكارِم
ثُمَّ لا يُبالي اَوقَعَ على المَوتِ اَم وَقَعَ المَوتُ عَلَيهِ. والله
ما يبالي ابن ابي طالب اوقع على الموت، ام وقع الموت عليه
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“To perform the obligations of the religion, to avoid the forbidden
things, to possess the best kind of ethics. Then (such a person) will
not care whether he meets death or death meets him. I swear to God that
son of Abu Talib does not fear whether he comes upon death or death
comes upon him."*[^7]

Imam ‘Ali (as), in his Nahj al-Balaghah, always addressed his followers
with the following words: "Equip yourselves, may God have mercy on you,
because you have been called for departure. Lessen your desire to stay
in this world. Return (to God) with the best of provisions with you, for
before you is a mountain road difficult to ascend, and fearful and
terrible stations which you must enter and stop at."[^8]

Thirdly: not to be deceived by this world because only gullible people
are carried away by flashy things in this world. Wise men are
unaffected. They realize that in this world the flowers are not
continuously fresh, neither are the lucky ones always happy. If they are
happy one day, they are saddened the other day: The poet says:
Kesra and the golden orange, Parviz and the golden vegetable,
All have gone with the wind, all have been leveled to the ground;
Parviz would take golden vegetable to every party,
With gold, he made a garden of vegetables;
Parviz is lost now, do not say much of him,
Read where is the golden vegetables, go and read kam taraku.

But the feeble-minded persons, like beasts and four-legged animals, can
only see the prey, stable and grass and lusts and enjoy being indulged
in them without knowing that the hunter and the butcher are prone to
receive them and their pleasures will soon be over.

It is for precisely this reason that The Holy Qur’an calls the world a
means of deceit. It only could deceive the feeble minded souls,
however.[^9]

But the true believers of God will never be deceived by the world.[^10]
They are continuously at the mercy of temptations,[^11] but since they
are realistic, they are not deceived by the world and they provide
themselves with appropriate provisions for the coming world. They try to
learn from the world and its ups and downs. There are two traditions
regarding this:
The first tradition: Imam ‘Ali (as) heard somebody blaming this world.
Imam ‘Ali (as) told him:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اَيُّها الذَامُّ للدُّنيا المُغتَرِّ بِغرُورِها المَخدُوعِ
بأباطِيلِها، اتَغتَرُّ بالدُّنيا ثُمَّ تَذمُّها؟ اَنتَ المُتجرِّم
عَلَيها اَم هِيَ المُتَجَرِّمَة عَلَيكَ؟ مَتى استَهوَتكَ اَم مَتى
غَرَّتكَ؟ اَبِمصَارِعِ آبائِكَ مِنَ البَلى، اَم بِمَضاجِعِ اُمَّهاتِكَ
تَحتَ الثَرى؟..
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وقَد مثّلَت لَكَ بِهِ الدُّنيا نَفسَكَ وبِمَصرَعِهِ مَصرَعَكَ، اِنَّ
الدُّنيا دارُ صِدقٍ لِمَن صَدَّقها ودَارُ عَافِيةٍ لِمَن فَهِمَ عَنها
ودَارُ غِنى لِمَن تَزَوَّدَ مِنها ودَارُ مَوعِظَةٍ لِمن اتَّعَظَ بِها،
مَسجِدُ اَحبّاءِ الله ومُصَلّى مَلائِكَةِ الله، ومَهبِطَ وَحي الله،
ومَتجَرِ اَولياءِ الله، اكتَسَبُوا فِيها الرَّحمَةَ، ورَبِحُوا فِيها
الجَنَّة، فَمَن ذا يَذِمُّها وَقَد آذَنَت بِبَينِها ونادَت بِغُراقِها
ونَعَت نَفسَها واَهلَها"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“O you who blame the world, while you are beguiled by its vanities and
deceived by its falsehoods! Are you beguiled by this world, and then
blame it? Do you accuse it of sin or does it accuse you?* *When did it
seduce you and when did it deceive you? Through the places where your
fore-fathers have fallen and decayed? Or through the sleeping-places of
your mothers under the earth?...... Through him (the dying man), the
world has given you an example for yourself; and through his place of
death (an example of) your place of death.*

*Indeed, this world is a house of truth for one who confirms it, a house
of well-being for one who understands it, a house of riches for one who
takes provisions from it, and a house of admonition for one who is
admonished by it. (It is) a place of worship for the lovers of God, a
place of prayer for the angels of God, the place of descent for the
revelation of God and a trading place for the friends of God; in it they
earn mercy and in it they gain Paradise. So who is it that blames it,
when it has announced its departure, proclaimed its separation and
announced the death of itself and its inhabitants”?*[^12]

The second tradition: Imam al-Baqir (as) one day saw Jabir b. Abdullah
al-Ansari sighing deeply. Imam al-Baqir (as) asked him: “What are you
sighing about? Are you sighing about the world”? Jabir said: “Yes”. Imam
al-Baqir (as) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَلاذُّ الدُّنيا سَبعَةٌ: المأكُولُ والمَشرُوبُ والمَلبُوسُ
والمَنكُوحُ والمَركُوبُ والمَشمُومُ والمَسمُوعُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

> فألَذُّ المأكُولاتِ العَسَلُ وهُوَ بَصقٌ مِن ذُبَابَةٍ، وَاحلَى
> المَشرُوباتِ الماءُ وَكَفى بِابَاحَتِهِ وسِياحَتِهِ على وجهِ الارض،
> وَاحلَى المَلبُوساتِ الدِيباجُ وهُوَ مِن لُعابِ دُودَةٍ، وَاحلَى
> المَنكُوحَاتِ النِساءُ وهُو مَبالٌ في مَبالٍ ومِثالٌ لمِثال، واِنَّما
> يُرادُ اَحسَنُ ما في المَرأةِ لِأقبَح ما فِيها، وَاحلَى المَركُوبَاتِ
> الخَيلُ وَهو قَواتِل، واَجَلُّ المَشمُومَاتِ، المِسكُ وهُو دَمٌ مِن
> سُرَّةِ دَابَّة، واجَلُّ المَسمُوعَاتِ الغِناءُ والتَرنُّمُ وهُوَ
> اِثْمٌ، فَمَا هذِهِ صِفَتُهُ لَم يَتَنَفَّس عَلَيهِ عَاقِلٌ". قالَ
> جابر ابنً عبدالله: فوالله ما خَطَرَت الدُّنيا بَعدَها على قلبي" 548

“The pleasures of the world are seven: eating, drinking, clothing,
marriage, riding, smelling and hearing. The most delicious of foods is
honey which is the bee's saliva. The sweetest drink is water which flows
on the earth. The best clothing is silk which is from the saliva of the
silk-worm. The sweetest of mates (among all creatures) to be taken in
marriage are women, yet it (the act of mating) is a urethra inside a
urethra, and a thing matched to another in kind (ugliness). So one
desires the prettiest features in a woman for the sake of the ugliest
(part) in her. The best mounts are horses and they are deadly. The most
sublime of odors is musk which is blood from the navel of an animal. The
best of what is heard is singing and trilling, which is a sin. If this
is the quality of the world, then an intelligent man does not sigh over
it”. Jabir said: “I swear to God, upon hearing this speech from al-Baqir
(as), I never thought of the world after this”.

Fourthly, at the end of this portion of the letter, Imam ‘Ali (as) warns
us that soon the curtains will move to one side and this dark night of
the world will change into the morning of the Day of Judgment. Now the
caravans have reached their destinations. Let the true believers
separate themselves from the groups of beasts and join the caravans.

Hafiz, the Iranian poet, says in this regard:
Our life passed with no aims in sight,
O boy, give me the wine bowl, because you will not arrive at the old
age;
What sort of sugars are here that the royal
Falcons have belittled themselves to the position of a fly;
The caravan went away but you are asleep and the desert is ahead of
you,
How come you are negligent of the beels?
Open your wings and go ahead toward the heaven trees,
It is beyond a bird like you to be cage-ridden.

### 4. The Event Narrated By Ibn Abi Al-Hadid

In describing this portion of Imam ‘Ali's letter, Ibn Abi al-Hadid says:
Abu al-Fath Mohammad ibn ‘Ubbad, who was a cruel man, asked me to read
this part of the letter. Upon hearing this last part, he shouted and
fell to the ground.[^13]

This shows that this portion of Imam ‘Ali's letter, especially its
Arabic expressions, which are difficult to translate into any other
language, stands at a lofty place in eloquence. You cannot find any
equivalence for it in the discourses of others and even among other
words of Imam ‘Ali (as).
