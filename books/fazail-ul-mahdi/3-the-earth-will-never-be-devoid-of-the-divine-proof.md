The Earth Will Never Be Devoid of The Divine Proof
==================================================

Amirul Momineen Ali (as) said,

"The earth shall never be devoid of the Divine Proof, He may be apparent
and prominent or he may be concealed and hidden. And it is because of
him that the proofs and signs of Allah are not wasted."[^1]

Imam Jafar as Sadiq (as) said:

"The (Divine) Proof was existing before creation (of other things),
during creation and after creation".[^2]

Imam Jafar as Sadiq (as) said:

"Because Allah is great and mighty, He has never made the earth devoid
of a just Imam".[^3]

Imam Jafar as Sadiq (as) said,

"Even if two people remain on the earth. One of them shall be a Hujjat
upon the other. And if one of them dies, it will be the Hujjat that
remains".[^4]

Imam Ridhaâ€™ (as) said,

"Certainly, the earth shall never be devoid of one of us. Imams".[^5]
