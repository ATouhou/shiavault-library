50. Plurals
===========

There are three types of plural in Arabic:

a. The Masculine Sound plural is created by**(** **ونَ** **)** suffixed
to the noun in the nominative case, and ( ** ينَ** **)** in both
genitive and accusative cases.

teachers (m)**         ** **مُدرِّسونَ  ، مُدرِّسينَ  ،  مُدرِّسينَ**

b. The Feminine sound plural is created by dropping the Taa’ MarbuuTa
and replacing it with**(** ** اتٌ** **)** for the nominative case
and**(** **اتٍ** **)** for the accusative & genitive cases.

teachers                    **مُدرِّساتٌ  ، مُدرِّساتٍ  ، مُدرِّساتٍ**

c. The Broken plural is an irregular form. Even though several nouns may
exhibit the same "broken" pattern, one has to learn the words
individually.

dog(s),  cat(s)**       ** **کلبٌ / کِلابٌ   ،  قِطـٌّ / قِططـٌّ**
