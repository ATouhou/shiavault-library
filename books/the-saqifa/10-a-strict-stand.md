A Strict Stand
==============

The Imam was very much serious to compaign to regain his right. At the
very face a reader can judge this from the Imam's behavior with them and
from his sayings.

For instance, in his speech of SHAKH SHAKHIA he says: "I swear upon Him
who opens a grain and creates people51, had not there stood the
obligation for me and had not there been those present before me and the
existence of a helper, I would have thrown the reins upon its neck52 and
squenched the last of it by the cup of its first. God has forbidden the
men of knowledge to concur with the gluttony of a tyrant and with the
hunger victim."

How meaningful the words! He purports to say that his piety persuades
him to leave off his right the last time too as he left at the first.
But the difference is great between these two circumstances.

In the first one lie did not demand to fight because he lacked the
help. But this time he had to fight and to squench the circumstance by
the cup of the first one, which he turned his face from and endured the
thorn.

Ali used to say: "Had I found forty men of determination I would have
raised against them." Mawiya took these words and taunted Ali. Once he
wrote to Ali: "Whatever I forget I wouldn't your word to Abi Sifyan that
you would have raised against the tyrants had you found forty men of
determination." Ali did not deny this in his answer to Mawiya.

In the history of YAKHOBI it is recorded that the companions of Ali
demanded him to rise against the tyrants and that they would support
him. Ali asked them to come to him the next day with their heads shaved.
The next day came to him only three.

When he lacked forty supporters what could he do? Let us hear what he
has to tell himself (from the speech of SHAKH SHAKHIA): "I raised my
head to see either to reach with an amputated hand or to endure the dark
pit wherein a grownup becomes senile and an infant becomes old and toils
a faithful till he meets his Lord." Then a little further he proceeds to
tell: "I saw there is no helper to me except my own household members
and I preserved them from death."

There was no third to him; either to risk his household members or to
accept the things as they were. In the first case he had to preserve
them in order to preserve Islam. If his household members were killed
then the earth would be deprived of God's authority and Quran would be
deserted without its parallel.

Guidance would have been missed. The Prophet had said: "You will not go
51- It is a swearing purporting God. To be honest with the text I have
translated the phrase as it is.(TRANSLATOR)

52- When a rider reaches a station and makes a brief halt, he ties the
horse to a tree or a pole or anything else in order to keep the animal
far the rest of his journey. But when he is no more in need of the
animal he leaves the reins upon its neck-a sign to the horse to go. The
Imam has used this elegant simili referring to the caliphate. He
purports that he has no business with caliphate. But at the same time,
the obligation upon him and the people who finally gathered around him
with an importunity to persuade him to accept the caliphate made him &
concede. Those words are spoken after he agreed to become their caliph.

astray as long as you adhere to these two." He had also said: "These
two will not separate from each other till they return to me at the
fountain on the Day of Judgment. So, he had to choose the second, to
endure what the tyrants afflicted upon him."

In the protection of Islam which one is the best; the Imam knows better
as it is his duty and incumberant upon him. He chose to yield as others
did. In his words: "I saw the patience better." He shook his shirt from
any dust of incongruous conclusion. The very survival of Islam stood
above all to him.

While we look at the other side of the coin we see Ali has gained
public sympathy. Had he campaigned without the needed help he would
certainly have lost the whole issue. Today no one would have even
remembered him. History would have mentioned him as a rebellion -- one
that rebelled against religion and was, therefore, killed by the sword
of Islam.

His wise judgment and a salubrious decision kept him alive and the ball
ultimately halted at his feet. As he is alive so the conspiracy against
him too remains disclosed and known to all.

To quote his words addressed to his uncle Abbas and Abu Sifyan: "It
will not fall down which flies with wings. He who surrenders is at ease.
To pluck a fruit not in its season is to spoil it -- like a peasant
without his field." The interest of Islam was the prime factor of
consideration with him. Nothing attracted him except the public
prosperity and Islam's safety.

To put it in his own words, "One who eats bites upon the morsel?"
Footwear that would not cost more than a shilling is a matter of
importance to Ah if it happened to be the outcome of injustice. He
advises to Abu Sifyan and Abbas: "Squelch the waves of mischief by a
boat of safety, and do pace the path of argument and crown yourselves
with distinction and honor."

Abbas and Abusifyan treated the matter with a parochial view, which did
not go beyond a tribe. Therefore, surrendering to a fellow man of
Teem -- a small district in Quraish did not appear to them a matter of
any complexity. But, Ali made them to comprehend the prestige and the
honor -- an issue far beyond the myopic tribal one. Ali in his letter to
Mawiya says: "Lowliness is not for a Muslim. If one is armed with Faith
he can not remain a victim."

According to Abil Hadeed(3:1)Omar told Abubaker that he did not take
the funds from Abu Sifyan and asked him to keep it for himself (i.e.
Abusifyan). This he had to do to avoid his mischief. Abusifyan had
recently returned having had collected ZAKAT (charity tax) from the
surrounding districts.

Ali was aware of this fact that Islam had not yet spread its roots into
the soil of the hearts. Every neck had lengthened itself to overlook
where a chance resides and to overpower the circumstance for personal
fulgor and eclat. He feared not upon his life but for the life which was
yet infancy to Islam.

He saw in the officing every evil and mischief had he to contest for
his right. He did what was the best -- not to him but to the newly
introduced religion. According to him; "I never doubted the right ever
since I saw it." He saw the right and he was a boy often years. Hence,
he was well qualified to protect the right and the cost whatever dear to
him was cheap. "One who is sure of water will not become thirsty."

Once Abusifyan told Ali: "By God, if you want I will fill the grounds
with men and horses." Ali replied to him "By God, you purport a mischief
out of this. You had rebelled against Islam and we do not need your
sympathy." This shows the straightforwardness of Ali. He rejects the
help in order to avoid the bad for Islam.

**4. HIS BEHAVIOUR WITH THE CALIPHS**

As we told he persuaded the path of patience. He remained to respond
where the need called him and the interests of religion obliged him.

Some historians, among the ancients and among the recent ones, have
interpreted his stand as a total surrender to the existing authority and
with an absolute willingness and desires. The facts are ignored. In a
review let us see the facts. He did not recognize Abubaker as long as
Fatima was alive.

Ibn Atheer, Bukhari and Muslim -- all have estimated the period of his
abstenance six months. This period he stayed at home, never attended a
meeting, nor entertained a delegation, nor obeyed, nor ordered, nor took
part in a battle. In the nights he used to knock the doors of Ansaar and
the men of age. He did this and with him his wife, Fatimah, and his two
sons, Hassan and Hussain, were.

He reminded them what the Prophet has told and said. He did this so
that there should not be left any excuse on anyone's part that they did
not know or that no one remarked the point to them. He kept open what
was already an open fact to all.

He as an Imam deemed upon him the obligation to mention to them the
mistake they did and remark them the need to turn to right. He says: "O,
God, you know it is not a contest for power nor a search for gain. It is
to show the good in your religion and in Your domain."

Abubaker taunted him in one of his speeches: "They depend upon the weak
and seek succor from women like Om Tahal, the dear to her family. If I
want I would say you will be ruined. I am silent. I leave it aside." In
this there is a taunt to Ali and a threat too. What he wanted to say;
nobody knows.

If he said, havoc and a ruin would have hailed on Ali, How and why? No
one ever knew. I do not think even today any one could be there to
presume what actually the purport was. Abubaker was not a man to not
disclose a thing had he known it and that too pertaining to Ali. There
was nothing. So, he disclosed nothing.

It was just to create doubt and doubt does not rest; it roams about.
But Ali's personality was so open and so known to all that every attempt
fails to harm the reputation. A threat in itself is the outcome of
weakness.

As long as Fatima was alive he boycotted them and remained at home.
Fatima herself was a great support to him. Her stand had a great
influence upon people. Her immortal speech still rings into our ears the
facts that surround her and her husband Ali. After her death he
recognized Abubaker. As the situation demanded, he extended his
compliance. By this he safeguarded Islam. He says in his letter to
Egyptians... "I feared. So I help Islam. Else, the calamity was even
greater." His help was in his silence.

His advice and his admonishment to the people was his obligation which
he discharged as the situation demanded. He remained aloof for twenty
years. It is a great sacrifice. All this shows than an obligation upon
him demanded the sacrifice from him. For Islam he stood and for Islam he
underwent every bitter.

One might say that the caliphs did not invite Ali to participate with
them in the battles or in the government as it was the case with all the
Hashimies. The caliphs were afraid of Bani Hashim people. They remained
a constant dread to the caliphs. They were not given any post in the
government because they feared they might act that not to their
interest. A conversation between Omar and Ibn Abbas is recorded in
MUROWAJ AL-ZAHAB (427:1):

Omar: "There is something in me which I don't see in you." He further
says: "I am afraid, Ali would come and you in your post. I saw the
Prophet left you and utilized the services of others."
Ibn Abbas: "We did not see that."

Omar: "I am afraid of your station in the society.

This conversation occurred when Omar wanted to give Ibn Abbas a post in
Humz (Syria). Ibn Abbas did not accept. This shows that Bani Hashim were
a dread to the Caliphs. Ali was accordingly no exception to them.

Othman asked Omar to send Ali to conquer Persia. Omar communicated the
idea to Ali. After a long argument Ali rejected the mission. This shows
the limited co-operation that too because of the common interests of
Islamic society that had come into being. His co-operation only at
needed situations was so prolific that on several occasions Omar had
declared: "If there was not Ali, Omar had died."
