Lesson Ninety Five: Throwing Off A Habit
========================================

Imam Hasan Al-’Askari (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
رَدُّ الْمَعْتادِ عَنْ عادَتِهِ كَالْمُعْجِزْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Throwing off bad habits is like performing a wondrous act.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Habit is one of the great divine favors because it facilitates difficult
human tasks and automates a lot of complicated and necessary aspects of
living (such as speaking, walking, etc).

When a bad habit is acquired, it becomes a dangerous addiction and very
difficult to shed. So much so that Imam Hasan Al-’Askari (a.s.) has
compared the shedding of an entrenched habit to an amazing or wondrous
act.
