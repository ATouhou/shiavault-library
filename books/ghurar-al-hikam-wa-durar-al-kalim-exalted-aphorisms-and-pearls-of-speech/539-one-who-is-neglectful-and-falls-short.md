One Who Is Neglectful And Falls Short
=====================================

**One who is neglectful and falls short-التقصير والمقصّر**

1. The tongue of the neglectful is short.

> 1ـ لِسانُ المُقَصِّرِ قَصيرٌ.

2. One who falls short is deficient.

> 2ـ مَنْ قَصَّرَ عابَ.

3. One who is neglectful in his days of hope, before his death comes,
has indeed made a loss in his life and is harmed by his death.

> 3ـ مَنْ قَصَّرَ في أيّامِ أمَلِهِ قَبْلَ حُضُورِ أجَلِهِ فَقَدْ خَسِرَ
