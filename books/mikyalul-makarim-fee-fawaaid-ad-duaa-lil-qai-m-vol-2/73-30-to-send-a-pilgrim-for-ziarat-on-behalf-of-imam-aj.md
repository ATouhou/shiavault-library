30: To Send A Pilgrim For Ziarat On Behalf Of Imam (aj)
=======================================================

It is Mustahab (recommended) to send a pilgrim on behalf of Imam
az-Zaman (aj). It is a highly rewarding act because it helps in goodness
and piety and it is a gesture of love for the kinsfolk of the Prophet
(S). It is a goodwill gesture to Imam (aj). All the arguments that prove
the recommended nature of sending proxy for Hajj and Tawaf are
applicable for this also.
