In The Land of Mina
===================

The pilgrims had assembled in Mina. Imam Sadiq and his companions
sitting in a place were eating some grapes placed before them.

A beggar appeared and asked for alms. The Imam took some grapes to give
him, but he refused to accept it and asked for money. Imam told him to
excuse him as he did not have money. The beggar went away disappointed.

After going a few steps he had second thoughts came back and asked for
the same grapes. The Imam now refused to give him those grapes too.

Soon after, another beggar appeared. The Imam again took some grapes and
gave to him. He accepted it and said, "Thanks to the Lord of universe
who gave me my sustenance" On hearing these words, the Imam told him to
wait and gave him two handfuls of grapes.

The beggar thanked God for the second time.

The Imam again told him to wait and then turning to one of his friends
asked, "How much money is with you?" The man searched his pockets and
produced nearly twenty Dirhams which he gave to the beggar at the order
of the Imam.

The beggar thanking God for the third time said, "Thanks are exclusively
to God. O God! Thou art the Bestower of the good, and thou hast no
companion'." On hearing these words, the Imam took off his garment and
gave it to the beggar. Now, the beggar changed his tone and spoke a few
words of thanks to the Imam himself. Then the Imam did not give him
anything and he went away.

His friends and companions who were present there said, "We thought that
had the beggar conti- nued thanking God in the same manner as before,
the Imam would have continued giving him more and more. But when he
changed his talk and praised and thanked the Imam himself, the Imam did
not continue his help.
