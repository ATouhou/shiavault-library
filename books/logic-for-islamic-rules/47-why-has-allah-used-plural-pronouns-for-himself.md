Why Has Allah Used Plural Pronouns For Himself?
===============================================

**Question:** When the Almighty Allah is One, unique and peerless, and
knows about His oneness, then why in the Holy Quran he uses the plural
pronoun (We) for Himself?

**Answer:** The use of first person plural noun (We) is the sign of
greatness and magnificence of the person (entity) who is speaking and
this use is most appropriate and befitting to Allah. Arabs say that the
reason for the use of first person plural noun is considered as proof of
greatness that great people generally are not alone. The servants,
attendants and other people are always around them to fulfill their
needs. That is why they always used the pronoun We and the use of this
word is a metaphor for greatness.

In this respect, wherever in the words of Allah plural noun is used it
reminds us about His greatness and magnificence and we start thinking
about those apparent and hidden powers of the universe, which are
subordinate to Him. In this way our belief in *Tawheed* become stronger
and our attention towards the sanctified self becomes more.
