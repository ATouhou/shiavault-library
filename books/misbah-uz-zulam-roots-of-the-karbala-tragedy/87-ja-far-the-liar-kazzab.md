Ja’far, The Liar (Kazzab)
=========================

Ja’far, generally known as Kazzab, was the son of Imam Ali Naqi (a.s.)
and the brother of Imam Hasan Askari (a.s.). Since he had claimed
Imamate against Imam Mahdi (a.j.), the biographers refer to him as
Kazzab (liar). He was initially a wayward and an evil person. He had
left no stone unturned in his enmity to Imam Hasan Askari (a.s.). He did
not give up trying to get the Imam (a.s.) imprisoned, though he always
failed in his efforts.

Regarding Ja’far Kazzab and his son, there is a saying of Imam Mahdi
(a.j.) that they are like the brothers of Yusuf (a.s.). Tabarsi and some
other scholars are of the view that Ja’far had repented like the
brothers of Yusuf (a.s.) and that after this repentance, he came to be
known as Ja’far Tawwab (Ja’far the repentant). This is also supported by
the tradition of Riyazush Shahadat.
