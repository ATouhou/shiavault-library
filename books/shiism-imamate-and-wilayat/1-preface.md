Preface

**In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful**

**O Allah, send Your blessings upon Muhammad & his Progeny**

This treatise deals with some fundamental issues of the Shí'a Islamic
faith. Although not all the chapters were written at the same time, they
are inter-related and connected by the theme of imamate and *wilayat* of
the Imams of Ahlul Bayt. Chapter 2 was written in 1998, chapter 3 in
1990, chapter 4 in 1997, while the first and last three chapters have
been written this year. While revising chapter 3, I have added the
section 'The Meaning of *Mawla*' in order to complete the discussion on
Ghadír Khumm.

It is hoped that the reader will gain some insight into the Shí'a
Islamic point of view on the most fundamental issue that has defined its
existence in the past as well as in the present. This book also reflects
some issues that are being discussed among some sections of the Shí'a
community in North America. Such discussions and debates, at the least,
provide the opportunity to further study and clarify the essential
beliefs of Shí'a Islam.

May Allah, *subhanahu wa ta'ala,* bestow upon us the ability to open our
hearts to the Divine guidance, and may He lift the veils of academic
arrogance and tribal solidarity from our hearts and minds when we see
the truth. Amin.

*Wa ma tawfíqí illa billah.*
