The Final Agony; placid face of the man of God
==============================================

On the day of Ashura, the 10th day, Imam Husayn's own person was
surrounded by his enemies. He was brave to the last. He was cruelly
mutilated. His sacred head was cut off while in the act of prayer. A mad
orgy of triumph was celebrated over his body. In this crisis we have
details of what took place hour by hour.

He had 45 wounds from the enemies' swords and javelins, and 35 arrows
pierced his body. His left arm was cut off, and a javelin pierced
through his breast. After all that agony, when his head was lifted up on
a spear, his face was the placid face of a man of God. All the men of
that gallant band were exterminated and their bodies trampled under foot
by the horses.

The only male survivor was a child, Husayn's son ‘Ali, surnamed
Zain-ul-'Abidin - “The Glory of the Devout.” He lived in retirement,
studying, interpreting, and teaching his father's high spiritual
principles for the rest of his life.
