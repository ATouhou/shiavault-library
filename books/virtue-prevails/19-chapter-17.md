Chapter 17
==========

Sumayah returned home and wrote along letter to her fianc√©. A few days
later Sumayah and her father went to the public park where her father
met some of his friends. Not long after Sumayah sat down, she was
addressed by Hamid, who quickly said, "Please Miss, may I speak with
you?"

Sumayah tried to discourage him with a look of annoyance and
disapproval, but he persisted saying, "You are like an angel; you have
done me a lot of good. Please do not hold back this light that has
removed the darkness around me."

Surprised by his words, Sumayah asked, "What has made you speak like
this?"

"I have behaved badly towards you. I ask your forgiveness for my
rudeness."

Sumayah was aware of the changed tone of his voice. She looked at him
for a moment and felt that he was being honest.

She said, "I do forgive you. Actually, I feel sorry for men like you."
