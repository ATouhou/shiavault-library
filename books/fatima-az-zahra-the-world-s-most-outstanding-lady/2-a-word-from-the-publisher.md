*Fatimah is a part of my Flesh*[^1]. (The Holy Prophet)

Who is this shining Jewel,

Luminous star,

Bright star in the heavens of Sainthood

Hidden and unknown?

The essence of creation,
Intermediary for earthly and heavenly creation wise one, daughter of
the Prophet (spirit of beauty between the two), and the worthy wife of
the saint of Allah, Hazrat Ali (a.s). Fatimah (s.a,) unparalleled heroin
and unequalled herald throughout the history of Islam and Shi’ism.
Always appearing as the manifestation of self sacrifice, bravery,
affection, abundant generosity in the way of the presentation of Islam
and the Qur'an, and support of the frontage of the vicegerency.

Naba’ Organization in accordance with its objectives strives to
introduce and make known to the Public, the Holy Quran and the blessed
family of the holy Prophet (S) and in the course of this effort has
first endeavoured in the translation of the book, “Fatimah Zahra”.

This book has been arranged into three booklets, of which the first has
been allocated for a brief study and description of the life of this
great Lady. In its contents, while introducing the Parents and spouse of
that Hazrat, an explanation and description of the particulars and
historical Proceedings of that great lady’s lifetime from childhood
until marriage, is given then the sufferings and hardships of the life
of that Hazrat after the martyrdom of the Holy Prophet (S) are regarded,
and the account is proceeded by a depiction of the events that occurred
until the moment of her martyrdom.

The second and third booklets of this series after a description of
Fatimah’s characteral qualities give a presentation of the Superiorities
of her spoken words. With reliance on God’s special assistance, and
after acknowledging of the glorified status of the blessed Family of the
Holy Prophet (S) and the inability of our thoughts in their
understanding. We ask God to make us successful in the way of
introducing this glorious family and we request of all the able and
thoughtful to help and support us in making known the different aspects
of the Personal identity of this honourable Family.
