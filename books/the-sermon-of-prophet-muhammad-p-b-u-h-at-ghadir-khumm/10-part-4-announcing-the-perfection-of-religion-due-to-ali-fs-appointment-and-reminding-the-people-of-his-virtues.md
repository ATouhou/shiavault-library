Part 4 : Announcing the Perfection of Religion Due To Aliپfs Appointment and Reminding the People of His Virtues
================================================================================================================

O Allah! (I testify that) You did send down [this verse regarding Ali,
Your authorized representative, at the time of the explanation of his
authority and appointment today:

This day, I perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon
you, and was satisfied that Islam be your religion.

The Prophet (PBUH&HF) has entrusted Imam Ali (PBUH) with the divine
knowledge. Then, all other creations, from the first to the last,
receive their share of divine knowledge through the light of Imam Ali
(PBUH).

It has been narrated that Imam Ridha (PBUH) was asked, پgWhy is Ali
(PBUH) called Amir al-Muپfminin?پh He (PBUH) answered, پgBecause he
provides them (i.e., the believers) with knowledge. Havenپft you heard
(a word with the same root) in the Book of Allah, پeand we provide for
our family (namiru ahlanaa)پf (12:65)?پh (al-Kafi, vol. 1, p. 412,
Hadith 3). For more tradition in this regard, see Bihar al-Anwar, vol.
37, p. 294, Hadith 8, p. 295, Hadith 11, and p. 334. 1 Chapter 5, Verse
3 of the Holy Quran.

You (also) said, پgIf anyone desires a religion other than Islam
(submission to Walaya of Ali), never shall it be accepted from him, and
in the Hereafter, he shall be one of the losers.

O Allah! I implore You to witness that I have conveyed (Your
message).

O people! Allah, the mighty and the majestic, has indeed perfected your
religion through his (i.e., Aliپfs) leadership.

Thus, whoever does not follow his example and the example of those of
my children from his loins who will take his position until the Day of
Judgement.
when deeds are presented before Allah, the mighty and the majestic.

1 Chapter 3, Verse 85 of the Holy Quran. On the commentary of this
verse, Imam al-Sadiq (PBUH) said, پgIt means: he who does not submit to
our Walaya.پh (al-Manaqib, vol. 4, p. 283; Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 23, p.
358, Hadith \#12).

they are the ones whose deeds become vain and fruitless, and they shall
be in Hellfire forever.1

Their torment shall not be lightened, nor shall it be postponed.

O people! This is Ali, who has been my greatest aid, the most worthy of
you before me, the closest in relation with me, and the dearest to me
amongst you (all).

Both Allah, the mighty and the majestic, and I are pleased with him.

No verse [in the Quran]. has been sent down expressing (Allahپfs)
pleasure except that (in its absolute sense) it is about him,

nor has Allah addressed with honor پgthose who believeپh but that He
meant him first,

1 cf. Chapter 2, Verse 217 of the Holy Quran.
2 Chapter 3, Verse 88 of the Holy Quran.

nor has any verse of praise been revealed in the Quran but that it is
in his honor,

nor did Allah testify Paradise in (the chapter starting with) پgHas not
passed over man a long period of timeپh1 but for him, nor did He reveal
it for other than him, nor did He mean to praise by it save him.

O people! He is the patron of the religion of Allah, and the one who
argues on behalf of the Messenger of Allah.

1 Referring to Chapter 76, Verses 7-22 of the Holy Quran: پgThey
perform (their) vows, and they fear a Day whose evil shall be
widespread. They feed, for the love of Allah, the indigent, the orphan,
and the captive, (saying), پeWe feed you for the sake of Allah alone; no
reward do we desire from you, nor thanks. We fear a Day of severity and
distress. But, Allah has kept away from them the evil of that Day, and
has offered them radiance and (blissful) Joy. And for what they observed
patience, He has rewarded them with a Garden and (garments of) silk . He
is the pious, the pure, the guide, and the rightly guided.

Your prophet is the best prophet, the executor (of my will) over you is
the best executor and deputy, and his sons are the best deputies.

O people! The progeny of every prophet was from his own loins whereas
my progeny is from the loins of O people! Surely, Iblis (the greater
Satan) caused Adam to be dismissed from the garden through envy.

Thus, do not envy him or your deeds shall be nullified and your feet
shall slip,

Verily, Adam was sent down to earth only because of one mistake, while
he was the elite of Allah, the mighty and the majestic.

How, then, will be your condition, and you are what you really are, and
among you are the enemies of Allah?

Indeed, none hates Ali but a wretched person, none keeps himself
attached to Ali but a pious person, and none has faith in his (virtues)
but a sincere believer.

And in the honor of Ali, by Allah, was the Chapter of al- Asr (Ch. 103)
revealed:

پgIn the name of Allah, the compassionate, the merciful. By the Time
(of rising)!1 Most surely man is in loss, except those who believe, do
righteous deeds, and enjoin on each other the truth, and enjoin on each
other patience and constancy.

1 The time in this verse, as Imam al-Sadiq (PBUH) commented, refers to
the time of rising of Imam al-Mahdi (PBUH). cf. Kamal al-Din, p. 656,
Hadith 1.

2 Imam al-Sadiq (PBUH) interpreted these verses as follows: پgMost
surely man is in loss, except those who believe in the guardianship
(Walaya) of the Commander of the Believers (PBUH), do righteous

O people! I have sought Allah to be my witness and have conveyed my
communication to you,

پgand the messenger is only obligated to convey clearly.

O people! پgBe cautious of (your duties towards) Allah, the caution
that He deserves, and do not die except in the state of submission.

deeds, i.e., perform the religious duties, and enjoin on each other the
truth, i.e., al-Walaya (accepting the leadership and guardianship of Ali
(PBUH)), and enjoin on each other patience and constancy, i.e., urge
their progeny and their next generation to it and to observe patience in
that path.پh (Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 24, p. 215, Hadith 4).

1 Chapter 24, Verse 54 of the Holy Quran.
2 Chapter 3, Verse 102 of the Holy Quran. Since one does not know his
time of death, this verse implies that one should always be in the state
of submission.
