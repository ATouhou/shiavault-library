Supplications of the Friends of God
===================================

One of the most important instructions of the Shaykh was planning
regular periods to spend in seclusion with God for supplications and
whispered prayers which he referred to as "begging at the doorstep of
God" and stressed:

"Recite supplications for an hour every night; even if you are not in
the right mood for it, do not give up seclusion with God."

He also said:

"There are amazing blessings in waking up at dawn and the last one third
of the night. Whatever you want from God can be obtained through begging
at dawns. Do not be negligent of begging at dawns; whatever blessings
you achieve can be gained by that. A lover hardly goes to sleep and
yearns nothing but union with the beloved. Dawn is the time of meeting
and union with Him."

Any treasure of happiness that God granted to Hafiz.

Was by virtue of supplications at nights and litanies at dawns.

Supplications of the Shaykh
---------------------------

The reverend Shaykh would recite the following supplications very
frequently and recommended his disciples to recite them too:
supplications of *Yastashir*, *Adila, Tawassul;* whispered prayers of
Amir al-Mu'minin Ali (a) in the Masjid of Kufa which begins with, "اللهم
اني أسألك الأمان يوم لاينفع مال ولا بنون" *"Allahumma inni as 'aluka al-
aman yawma la* *yanfa 'u malun wa la banun* (O Lord! I beseech You to
bestow safety on me the day neither property nor children will be of any
benefit)," as well as the fifteen whispered prayers *(Munajat Khamsa
'Ashar)* of Imam al-Sajjad (a). From among the latter, the Shaykh
stressed reciting 'The Whispered Prayer of the Utterly Poor' *(Munajat
al- Mufta qirin)* and especially 'The Whispered Prayer of the Devotees',
*(Munajat al-Muridin).* He would say:

"Any of these fifteen *Munajats* (whispered prayers) has got its own
virtues (blessing)."

His Regular Supplication
------------------------

Dr. Farzam narrated that one of the Shaykh's regular supplications was
the following one:

"O Lord! Teach, perfect, and train us for Thyself O Lord! O Sustainer!
Prepare us for meeting with Thyself."

Thursday evenings, after prayers the reverend Shaykh would usually
recite the Supplication of Kumayl or one of the above mentioned
whispered prayers or supplications, and commented on them.
**"Recite the Supplication of** ***Yastashir!"***

Ayatollah Fahri[^1] quoted the reverend Shaykh as saying:

"I said to God: O God! Everybody has amorous and joyful whispering with
his Beloved; I too wish to enjoy this blessing, what supplication should
I read? I was told in a spiritual state to recite the supplication of
*Yastashir.* "

That was why he would recite the supplication of *Yastashir* very
fervently and lively.

"Find a Pretext to Seek 'Him'!"
-------------------------------

The reverend Shaykh believed that if one has a real longing for God and
is not content with other than Him, the Almighty God will eventually
undertake his affairs and lead him to (sublime) destination. In this
regard, the Shaykh related the following interesting example:

"A child who is quibbling and throwing around every toy or sweetie that
he is given and would not stop the grudge and cry so much that finally
his father embraces and caresses him; then he calms down. Thus if you do
not care for the luxury of world and quibble and (this way) find a
pretext to seek 'Him', the Almighty God will finally undertake your
affairs and raise you up. That's when you attain the real joy."

The Value of Weeping and Whispered Prayer
-----------------------------------------

The reverend Shaykh believed that a man will merit whispered prayer and
dialogue with God Almighty only when he drives away the love of other
than God from his heart. If a person's vain desire is his god, he cannot
say "O Allah!" truthfully. He said in this regard:

"Weeping and whispered prayers are worthwhile only when man has no love
other than love of God in his heart."

An instructive intuition is quoted from the shaykh which confirms the
above statement

A Penny in Response to "Ya Allah!"
----------------------------------

Ayatollah Fahri quoted the Shaykh as saying

"I was walking through the Bazaar when a beggar asked me to give him
something. I reached into my pocket, to give him some money, my hand
felt a two Rial coin, I pushed it aside and found a ten *shahr* coin[^2]
to give him instead. At noon I went to the mosque and said my prayers.
After performing prayers, I raised my hands to pray to God, saying "O
Allah!" As I uttered the phrase, I was shown (intuitively) the same two
Rial coin which I left in my pocket (and held back from giving to the
beggar)!"

There are some points in this intuition to be pondered about:

1 The analogy of taking one's vain desire as his god, as the HolyQur'an
clearly asserts:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
(أفرأيت من اتخذ الهه هواه)
  </p>
</blockquote>

(Then seest thou such a one as takes as his god his own vain desire?)
(al-Jathiyah: 23)

2 To the same extent that man obeys his vain desire, he will be away
from God; he is, rather, a slave to what he desires and thus "God" turns
into a "two Rial coin" in the realm of intuition!

3. It is worthwhile to give as charity what you like best. A believer
should give away in the way of his Beloved what he is fond of rather
than what is of no interest to him to give away:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
(لن تنالوا البر حتى تنفقوا مما تحبون)
  </p>
</blockquote>

(By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you give (freely) of
that which you love.) (Ale 'Imran: 92)

The Way to Proximity to God
---------------------------

The reverend Shaykh believed that the way to attain proximity to God is
through doing benevolence to people. If a person wants to find a proper
state of mind for prayer and to enjoy *dhikr* and *munajat* with God, he
must be at the service of God's creatures for God's sake. He commented
in this regard as follows:

"If you want to be graced with proximity to God and take pleasure in
whispering prayer to Him, practice benevolence to God's creatures by
learning it from the Ahl al-Bayt (a) (about whom the Holy Qur'an says):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ويطعمون الطعام على حبه مسكيناُ ويتيماُ وأسيرا إنما نطعمكم لوجه الله
لانريد منكم جزاءً ولا شكوراٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

(And they feed for the sake of Allah, the indigent, the orphan, and the
captive -( saying), 'We feed you for the sake of Allah alone: no reward
do we desire from you, nor thanks.) (al-Insan: 8, 9)

He further said:

"What creates in man a spiritual state of servitude to God after
performing obligatory duties is doing good to people."

What should we implore from God?
--------------------------------

One of the most significant issues in supplication is that the
supplicant should know what to say in his whispered prayer to God and
what to request from Him. In his commentary on supplications, the
reverend Shaykh emphasized on supplicatory phrases such as:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"يا غاية آمال العارفين" و "يا منتهى أمل الآملين" و "يا نعيمي وجنتي ويا
دنياي وآخرتي"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Ya ghayati amali'l arifin", "Ya muntaha amali'l amilin",* and " *Ya na
'imi wa Jannati wa Ya dunya i* *wa akhirati"* (O Goal of the hopes of
Thy knowers! O Ultimate abject of hope of the hopeful in thee! O my
bliss and my garden! O my this world and my Hereafter!)"

and then would say:

Friends! Learn sagacity from your Imam (a)! See how the Imam whispers to
God, saying' I am seeking refuge in you! I have come to embrace you! I
want You (I rejoice in You)!

The reverend Shaykh himself would say in his supplications and whispered
prayer:

"O God! Accept these (supplications) as preliminary (means) to reunion
with Thyself!"

What Does a Lover Want from the Beloved?
----------------------------------------

After quoting the above instructions from the reverend Shaykh, Dr. Hamid
Farzam said: 'Sometimes the reverend Shaykh would relate simple and
delicate analogies in order to explain highly mystical issues such as
the following:

"A lover knocked at the door of his beloved's house. The latter asked:
'Do you want bread?'
'No.' Replied the lover.
'Do you want water?'
'No.'
'What do you want then?'
I want you! Answered the lover.

Friends! The Landlord must be loved, not His feast and food. As Sa'di
said:
'If you expect benevolence from the Friend.
You are bound up in your self, not in love with the Friend.'

He would recite the above poem to us and say:
"You must be in love only with God, and whatever you do must be only
for Him. Be in love with Himself; do not even worship Him for rewards!"

He would sometimes tell me in a cute tone:
"Do something that your ringlets entangle yonder (meaning to fall in
love with the Eternal Beloved)!"

He would add some very befitting poems -especially from Hafiz - to his
instructions that were of great effect, such as the following: 'If you
wish the Beloved may not break off the union.
Keep holding on to the (love) link so that He may hold on, too.'

"Complain of being Forlorn!"
----------------------------

The reverend Shaykh would say: "Whenever you manage to engage in nightly
begging, complain of being forlorn and implore: 'O God! I have no power
to challenge the carnal soul; it has crippled me, come to my aid and
deliver me from its grip! 'And (also) appeal to the Ahl al-Bayt for
intercession."

And then he would recite the following verse from the Holy Qur'an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
(ان النفس لأمارة بالسوء الا ما رحم ربي)
  </p>
</blockquote>

(The (human) soul is certainly prone to evil, unless my Lord bestow his
Mercy.) (Yusuf: 53)

The Real Reason for Appealing to the Ahl al-Bayt (a)
----------------------------------------------------

The reverend Shaykh used to say:
"Majority of people do not know what appealing to the Ahl al- Bayt (a)
is for. They appeal to the Ahl al-Bayt (a) for solving their own
problems and difficulties of life,[^3] whereas we should go to the
doorsteps of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) for traveling on the path to monotheism
and the knowledge of God. This path is so difficult to pass and it is
impossible for man to traverse this path without a light and guide."

The Ziyarat of 'Ashura
----------------------

One of the points that the reverend Shaykh stressed about appealing to
the Ahl al-Bayt (a) was recitation of ziyarat of 'Ashura and would
relate accordingly:

"I was instructed in a spiritual state to recite the ziyarat of Ashura."

He recommended:

"Do not miss recitation of ziyarat Ashura as long as you are living. One
of the Shaykh's disciples continued reciting ziyarat of 'Ashura for
forty years on the instructions of the Shaykh.

The Condition for Getting Answers to Supplications
--------------------------------------------------

One of the important conditions for a supplication to be answered is the
lawfulness (being *halal)* of one's food. A person asked the Holy
Prophet (s): 'I would like my supplications replied'. His Holiness said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"طهر مأكلك ولا تدخل بطنك الحرام"
  </p>
</blockquote>

"Purify your food and avoid eating *haram* (unlawful)"[^4]

"First, Pay for the Salt!"
--------------------------

One of the Shaykh's disciples said: ' A group of us together with the
Shaykh set out to go to (mount) Bibi Shahrbanu for supplication and
whispered prayer. We bought some bread and cucumbers. Meanwhile, we
picked some salt from the cart of the cucumber vendor (without paying
for it) and then went up the mountain. When we arrived there the Shaykh
said:

"Let's go down, we are rejected. They say: First pay for the salt and
then come for prayer and supplication."

The Capacity of the Worshipper
------------------------------

One of the subtle issues for a worshipper to take into consideration is
that his demands from God should be proportionate to his spiritual
capacity; if he lacks the required capacity he may put himself in
trouble by supplication.

One of the Shaykh's friends related: Once business happened to become
sluggish and I was so upset about that. Until one day the Shaykh asked
me why I was disturbed and I told him the story. He asked if I did not
recite the *ta'qibat* (supplications read after obligatory prayers). I
answered, yes. He asked what I read. I told him I read the supplication
of Sabah of Amir al-Mu'minin Ali (a) and he said:

"Instead of supplication of Saba, read the surah al-Hashr and the
supplication of 'Adilah in your *ta'qibat* so that your problems
vanish."

I asked him why I should not read Saba. He said:

"This *du'a* consists of such (heavy) statements and phrases that a
person must have the capacity and capability to stand.

Imam Ali (a) beseeches the Almighty God in this *du'a:* 'O God! Grant me
a pain that I do not neglect you even in those moment (of suffering the
pain)'. Thus, this *dua* demands the required capacity, and you have
read it without having such capacity which has created these problems
for you. So, instead of Sabah, you read the *sura* al-Hashr and *dua*
Adilah; it will solve your problems God willing."

After some time that I had started to read the *sura* al-Hashr and *dua*
Adilah, one of my friends lent me ten thousand *tomans,* I worked with
that money, bought a house, and gradually my business improved, too.

Courtesy of the Worshipper
--------------------------

Dr. Farzam also said: 'One of the things that the Shaykh emphasized
about supplication was the courtesy of the worshipper. Dr. Farzam quotes
the Shaykh as saying in this respect:

"Once supplicating, one must be humble and fearful, and sit in a kneeled
courtly position facing the *qibla.*

Once my legs were discomforted, it crossed my mind to stretch my legs.
The Shaykh who was sitting behind me at the back of the room said:

"Sit aright; in supplication sit in a kneeled position and be
courteous."
