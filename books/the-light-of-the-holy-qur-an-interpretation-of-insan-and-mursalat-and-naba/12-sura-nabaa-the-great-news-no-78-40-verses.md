Sura Nabaa (the Great News) No. 78 (40 Verses)
==============================================

**In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful**

**Contents of the Sura:**

Most of the verses of the last part of the Qur'an were revealed in
Mecca. The nature of these Suras is that they put emphasis on the
Creation and the Resurrection, furnished with glad tidings and warnings;
usually in a shocking and awakening tone. All the verses of the Suras,
except a few, are short and full of implications. For the same reason,
they affect, deeply, on any conscious person and they awaken some of the
unaware, too. They give spirit to dead-like people and make the
indifferent ones feel responsibility. On the whole, they have a specific
case and an enthusiastic world of their own, full of enlightenment and
attraction.

Sura Nabaa is not an exception to this general principle. It begins
with an awakening question, and ends with a wonderful sentence full of
warning.

The contents of the Sura can be divided into several parts:

1. The question that is stated in the first verse about the 'great
News' /naba'-in-'azim/ or the Hereafter.

2. Examples of the types of Divine Power in the Heavens and on Earth,
and also of men's lives and their gifts as evidences to the possibility
of the Resurrection and the Hereafter.

3. Preliminary signs of the Resurrection.

4. Reference to the painful chastisement of the transgressors.

5. The encouraging gifts and blessings of Heaven.

6. Finally, the Sura ends with some intensive warnings about the
dreadful punishment, and then, the sad destiny of the Unbelievers.

The name of the Sura, Nabaa, is taken from its second verse, but
sometimes it is called /amma/, which is the first word in the first
verse.

**The Virtue in studying Sura Nabaa:**

There is a tradition from the Prophet (p.b.u.h.) which says: He who
studies Sura Nabaa will be satiated, by Allah, with a cold drink in
Heaven".(1)

Another tradition from Imam Sadiq says: He who continues studying Sura
Nabaa, everyday, will meet the Holy Shrine at Mecca (Kaaba) before the
year ends.(2)

Again, another tradition from the Prophet (p.b.u.h.) says: He who
studies it (Sura Nabaa) and learns it by heart, on the Day of Judgment,
his reckoning will be concluded (so quickly) equal to the same length of
time it takes to say a single prayer.
