The Hajj
========

The entire journey of Hajj is a spirituality excursion that covers three
stages:

**The First Stage:** Cutting oft affinity from all things with the
exception of Allah in order to reach to Allah.

**The Second Stage:** Continuing towards Allah and strengthening the
alliance (with Him), until one reaches to Allah and (the true) essence
of worship.

**The Third Stage:** Once a person has reached to the level of
perfection and has arrived at the stage of (true) worship, he then
returns (to the people) to guide the creations of Allah towards Him
