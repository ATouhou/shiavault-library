Days and Times for Sex
======================

When is Sex Forbidden?
----------------------

Islam has forbidden sexual intercourse during menstruation.  
 The Qur’an says: **“*****They ask you about menstruation. Say:
Menstruation is a discomfort (for women). Do not establish sexual
relations with them during the menses and do not approach them
(sexually) until the blood stops. Then when they have cleansed
themselves, you go into them as Allah has commanded you.” (Surah
al-Baqarah, 2:222)***  
 According to the Shariah, the duration of the monthly period is between
three to ten days. If the bleeding was for less than three days, it is
not menstruation; if it is for more than ten days, then it is
menstruation for the regular number of days and *istehadha* for the rest
of the bleeding during which sex is permitted.  
 The prohibition of sex during the periods is limited strictly to sexual
intercourse; other intimate contact (with the exception of the vagina
and anus) is allowed. However, it is better not to play with her body
between the navel and the knees.  
 If a person who is engaged in sexual intercourse with his wife
discovers that her period has begun, then he should immediately withdraw
from her.  
 It is clear from the verse mentioned above (“*…until the blood
stops.*”) that once the blood has stopped, intercourse becomes lawful
even if the woman has not performed the major ritual ablution *(ghusl).*
But *mujtahids* say that it is better to refrain from intercourse till
she performs the *ghusl* or, at least, washes her private parts.[^1]  
 Sexual intercourse is also not allowed during the post-natal bleeding
called *nifas* (maximum 10 days), during daytime in the month of
*Ramadhan*, and when a person is in *ihram* during the pilgrimage to
Mecca. At all other times, sexual intercourse is allowed.  
 Times when Sexual Intercourse is *makruh:*  
 1. During frightful natural occurrences, e.g., eclipse, hurricane,
earthquake;

2. From sunset till *maghrib;*

3. From dawn till sunrise;

4. The last three nights of lunar months;

5. Eve of the 15th of every lunar month;

6. Eve of 10th *Zil-hijjah*;

7. After becoming *junub*.

Recommended Days and Times for Sex
----------------------------------

We have certain *ahadith* which say that it is better to have sexual
intercourse at these times:  
 1. Sunday night;

2. Monday night;

3. Wednesday night;

4. Thursday noon;

5. Thursday night;

6. Friday evening;

7. Whenever the wife wants to have sex.

When is it Obligatory to have Sex?
----------------------------------

It is *wajib* on man to have sex with his wife at least once in every
four months; this is considered as one of the conjugal rights of the
wife. This obligation stays in force unless there is a valid excuse or
the wife waives her right.
