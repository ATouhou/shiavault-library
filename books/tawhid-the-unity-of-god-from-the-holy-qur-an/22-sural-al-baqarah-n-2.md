Sural Al-Baqarah, n.2
=====================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ ۚ لَا تَأْخُذُهُ
سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ ۚ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ
مَنْ ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ ۚ يَعْلَمُ مَا
بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ ۖ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِنْ
عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ ۚ وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ
وَالْأَرْضَ ۖ وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ
الْعَظِيمُ

***Allah is He besides Whom there is no god, the Everliving***[^1]***,
the Self-subsisting by Whom all subsist***[^2]***; slumber does not
overtake Him nor sleep; whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in***
***the earth is His; who is he that can intercede with Him but by His
permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and
they cannot comprehend anything out of His knowledge except what***[^3]
***He pleases, His knowledge***[^4] ***extends over the heavens and the
earth, and the preservation of them both tires Him not, and He is the
Most***[^5] ***High, the Great.(2:255)***[^6]
