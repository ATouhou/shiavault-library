heard Abu Ja‘far (al-Baqir), peace be on him, say:] “Abu Khalid
al-Kabuli served Mohammed b. al-Hanafiya for a time. He thought that
Mohammed was an Imam. However, one day, he asked Mohammed: ‘May I be
your ransom. If I have holiness, love, and devotion (to you), I ask you
by Allah’s Apostle, may Allah bless him and his family, and by the
Commander of the Faithful, peace be on him. Tell me- are you the Imam
whose obedience Allah has imposed on His creatures?’ Mohammed replied:
‘You adjured me before the Great (Allah). The Imam over me, you, and
every Moslem is ‘Ali b. al-Husayn, peace be on him.’ When Abu Khalid
heard what Mohammed

had said, he came to ‘Ali b. al-Husayn. He asked permission. The Imam,
peace be on him, permitted him. When Abu Khalid entered, the Imam, peace
be on him, said to him: ‘Welcome, Kankar. Why do you not visit us?’ Abu
Khalid prostrated himself for Allah, the Exalted. When he raised his
head, he said: ‘Praise belongs to Allah Who has not made me die till I
have known my Imam.’ ‘Abu Khalid, how have you known your Imam?’ asked
‘Ali b. al-Husayn. Abu Khalid replied: ‘You called me with the name with
which my mother called me. I served Mohammed b. al-Hanafiya for a time.
I thought that he was an Imam. Then I asked him by Allah, His Apostle,
and the Commander of the Faithful. So, he guided me to you. Thus, I have
known that you are the Imam whose obedience Allah has imposed on every
Moslem.’”[^103]

al-Muradi, Mohammed b. Moslem, and Zarara. Were it not for them, no one
would conclude (religious precepts). They are the preservers of the
religion. They are the trustees of my father over the lawful and
unlawful of Allah. They are close to us in the world. They will be close
