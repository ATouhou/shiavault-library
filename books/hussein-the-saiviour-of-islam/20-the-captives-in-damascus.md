The Captives in Damascus
========================

EVEN DURING THE most miserable journey, the severed head of the Holy
Imam manifested several miracles which guided several good hearted
Christians and Jews to embrace Islam, most of whom after embracing the
Truth attacked the brutes and were ultimately martyred by the Devil's
forces.

When the looted Caravan entered Damascus, at the ordcrs of the Devil
Yazid, the whole town was ordered to he fulL dcccratcd and the people to
be engaged in rejoicing and making mcrry at the success of their
Ruler.To please the Brute the people dressed in festive robes were
extremely jubilant amusing themselves in fanciful plays and merrymaking.
When the looted Caravan of the Holy House of the Prophet passed through
the public streets and the busy bazaars, people in huge numbers thronged
to have a view of the captives whereas the godly ladies of the family of
the Holy Imam who were captives, felt mortally ashamed and insulted and
covered their holy faces under the hair of their heads. While the
sorrow-stricken ladies were seated on the bare hacks of the camels with
the hair of their heads covering their faces, the heads of the martyrs
raised on the point of the lances were marching before them. The poor
ladies sometimes looked at the heads of their martyred husbands,
brothers and children with tears flowing from their eyes. The children
seeing the severed heads of their loved ones cried aloud innocently
callina them to return to them and to relieve them of their miseries.

After paradina through the crowded streets and the busy bazaars
thronged with the rejoicing public the Iadics and the children tied in
ropes and the sick Ali in chains with the severed heads of the martyrs
were presented openly in the fully attended court of Yazid surrounded by
hundreds of his courtiers. Yazid sat on the throne and kept the severed
head of the Holy Imam down in front of him, drank wine, and ridiculed
the Holy Iniam and his family standing before him utterly helpless tied
in ropes as captives. What all befell the Holy Family in the Devil s
court is also a long history of unbearable sorrow and the worst
degradation of the godly ones, which will surely move the coldest heart
to tears.

The captives were imprisoned in a very narrow, dark and roof- less
cell. The members of the Holy Family suffered the hardships and the
tortures of imprisonment in the cell for a long time until in the prison
expired Sakina the three year old dearly loved daughter of Husain. She
died of wounds caused by the whips and slaps of the tyrants,particularly
of the wounds she received from the stone-hearted Shimar. After a long
imprisonment, the sick Imam Ali, with the other captives, was released.
They returned to Karbala, and after burying the bodies of Husain and the
other martyrs which were lying unburied till then, they returned to
Madina. Thus the Holy Imam Husain offered the Greatest Sacrifice to re
establish the Truth firmly never again to be shaken by any one until the
Day of Judgment.

**The Old Testament Prophesies The Martyrdom**

THIS IS THE Sacrifice which has been prophesied also in the Old
Testament in which God promises to avenge the blood of the Holy Imam
Husain:-

"for this is the day of the Lord God of Hosts, a day of Vengeance, that
he may avenge him of his adversaries and the sword shall devour, and it
shall be satiated and made drunk with their blood for the Lord God of
Hosts hath a Sacrifice in the morth country by the river Euphrates."
Jer. 46:10

This is the 'Zibhe-Azeem' or the Greatest Sacrifice, the Lord has
foretold to take place instead of Abrham's sacrifice:- " Most surely
this is a manifrst trial, And We ransomed with a Great Sacrjfice And We
have shifted it among the later generation." This happened on 61 A.H. on
the Bank of the Euphrates at Karbala in (Iraq).

**Who was Victorious-Yazid or Husain?**

ALTHouGH THE HosTs of the Devils numbered in thousands and the
supporters of the cause of Truth for which the Holy Imam stood, could be
counted on fingers, and the Holy Imam, with his numbered devotees, was
mercilessly massacred and the ladies, the queens of virtue and chastity
along with the innocent children were taken captives and put to every
disrespect, indignity and the bitterest tortures, but soon after the
massacre, the world understood who was the Arch-Devil and who was the
Divinely Chosen Guide for Humanity. Many people embraced Islam at the
guidance they received from the severed head of Husain wilen they saw it
glorifying the Lord even from the point of the lance during the
torturous journey to Kufa and from Kufa to Damascus. The realization of
the Truth, the World exhibited after the martyr dom ofthe Holy Imam,
made even the Devil acknowledge the virtual, spiritual Victory of the
Holy Imam. Identifying oneself as the admirer of Yazid is far beyond any
possibility when there is none today who would even like the idea of
taking the Devil's name in connection with any goodness save those who
would like to associate themselves with the Brute in the lincentious
performances enacted.

Whereas ever since the martyrdom of Husain, the act of admiring and
appreciating the Holy Imam and his devotees is enjoined as a duty of
every true believer in God and the sincere lover of Truth, deeming it
with a conviction that admiration of the Great Sacrifice and feeling for
the sorrowful plight of the Holy Imam and his godly devotees carries
special blessings in this world, and with high spiritual honours and
great rewards in the life hereafter.

**What is 'Shahadat' or Martyrdom**

WHOEVER IS TAKEN unawares or shot dead or suddenly killed be that even
for any matter of goodness on the part of the murdered one, other than
God's cause, cannot be ailed a martyr. It can no doubt be said that the
assassin had been cruel and the good man had been unjustly killed, but
he cannot be a martyr in the proper or the right sense of the term, for,
perhaps, if the murdered one had an oppor- tunity or the chance to
escape death, he might have successfully avoided it, or if he had been
warned of the fate, he would have changed his views or conduct to avoid
the cause for the murder.

A martyr in the true and the proper sense of the term ts the one who
stands for Truth and Righteousness even at the cost of his life and
property not excluding his near and dear ones.

**Jesus and Husain**

THE HOLY QUR'AN asserts in unequivocal terms that Jesus was neither
killed nor crucified by the people:- 4:157 and 158. Even taking for
granted the statement of our Christian brethren the crucifixion of Jesus
under the evidence of the Holy Bible of the Christian Church itself, can
never be a martyrdom at all as the Bible says that Jesus avoided the end
by hiding himself, which suggests his unwillingness to meet death in the
cause of Truth. Besides, when caught by the enemies, he began imploring
God to see that the cup was passed over and he be saved, and while he
was put on the cross as alleged by the Christian belief, he began crying
aloud to God in agony saying that he had been forsaken by Him. Could
this he becoming even of any ordinary believer in God with the
conviction of his faith in Him? How could such a weak-hearted one
totally void of faith in the All-Merciful Lord, be a religious leader,
even that the son of God? How could the one forsaken by Cod be the
saviour of Humanity? The Bible itself declares:-

" And he went it little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed
sayinrg O' my Father if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;
nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt." Math. 26:39 "

And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "ELi,
ELi Lama Sabachthani," to say, My Cod, my God, why hast thou
forsakenme." Math. 27:46

The above statement of the Bible of the Christian Church establishes
the following points against Jesus:-

1. Jesus was frightened of death.
2. Jesus was unwilling to drink the cup of death in the way of the
Lord.
3. Jesus wanted God to avoid his drinking the cup of death.
4. Jesus wanted God to avoid His Will to take place.
5. In the agony against the fear of death Jesus lost all faith in God
and believed to have been forsaken by Him. Thus according to his own
words, the for- saken son can do nothing for others for he himself has
been forsaken.

Let us take the ease of Husain.

1. Husain travelled all the distance from Madina to Karbala to drink
the cup of death accompanied by untold miseries and tortures.
2. Husain offered not only himself but the dearest ones of his nearest
kith and kin, and the sincerest of friends with matchless faith in God
and devotion to Him.
3. At every step, Husain suffered the worst tortures and the greatest
loss with perfect patience, fortitude, submission and surrender to the
Divine Will, every time praying for his offerings to be accepted by the
Lord.
4. While under the swords of the heartless assassins, he only prayed to
God for the salvation of the Faithful, far from being a complainant, he
prayed for his sacrifices to be accepted.
5. He proved his being the Greatest Martyr, the King of Martyrs, who
offered not only himself but his dearest ones counted to about
seventy-two, by glorifying God in God's own Words when his head was
severed and raised on the point of the lance. In short, Husaan's
martyrdom has no parallel in the history of Mankind.

**The Martyrs of Karbala-the Kind of Men they were**

As ALREADY SAID in the foregoing pages, those who surrendered their
souls in the way of the Lord at Karbala were the divinely selected ones
of the human family. They were ideal personalities with unique qualities
which humanity could justly be proud to own in their kind as the
matchless gems which the world had ever seen. Each one of the great
martyrs was a model of the integration of the unique personality traits
some of which each one of them possessed as peculiar to himself. They
were the noblest models divinely set up for the members of the human
family to follow. The faith in God, the sincere devotion, the dauntless
courage, the unconquerable fidelity, the unfailing patience, the
charitable dis- position, the ideal consideration for the life after
death and the ever mindfulness of the Day of Judgment which the great
martyrs mani- fested the hour of their trial at Karbala were obviously
the qualities they were divinely conditioned with for the fulfilment of
the Divine Plan of the enactment of the glorious 'Zibhe-Azeem.' Every
one of the martyrs was a glorious human metal with the polish necessary
to get reflected through it the divine attributes of the Creator Lord of
the Universe. In short, Karbala was a historic, a unique and the
greatest exhibition of the best specimens of the vari- ous noble
qualities endowed in the children of Adam, particularly those of the
seed of Abraham through Muhammad, Ali and Fatema Any one desirous of
having a view of the glorious manifestation of divinity in man, and the
ideal integration of the Divine attri- butes in a human personality may
look into the wonderful sacrifice which Husain, the King of Martyrs,
offered in Karbala, in the way of the Lord.

It is a historic fact that a large crowd followed Husain from Mecca but
before the great offering he had to make, Husain started shifting the
human stuff there with him through his repeated sermons prophesying the
torturous sufferings and the gruesome massacre in store for those who
remain with him. Thus the Holy Imam made the questionable stuff leave
his camp after which remained only the sincere ones who were wholly
devoted to the Lord and who were really anxious of surrendering
themselves in His way. While he wanted those who were then with him to
leave him and go away, Husain wrote letters and sent messages to the
chosen few worthy of inclusion into his fold informing them of the
arrival of the awaited hour. Thus were collected the gems worthy of
present- ing to the Lord, shunting out all the unworthy stuff.

**The Companions of Husain and thosc of the Holy Prophet**

IT IS THE historic truth that the kind of faithful companions the Holy
Imam Husain had gathered around him was not given to any of the Apostles
of God including Jesus and even the Holy Prophet Muhammad to claim such
a band of men of spotless character and godly conduct in such a large
number among their companions. While one of the disciples of Jesus
betrayed him and connived to get him in the hands of his enemies, none
of the other disciples offer- ed to get killed with their Master.

In the case of the companions of the Holy Prophet, most of those who
claim prominence in their devotion to him, deserted him leaving him in
the Jaws of death, not once or twice but on every occasion when they
felt any danger to their life. But in the case of Husain, the
faithfulness and the devotion of his comrades in the worst and the most
torturous miseries which culminated in the gruesome massacre of one and
all of them, is nothing but a matchless marvel which has thrown the
human world into wonder and has moved every human heart to sorrow and
grief for them, with tears irresistibly rushing into the eyes of men,
women and even children in sympathy for the great sufferers in the way
of the Lord.
