  </p>
</blockquote>

***“They say: ‘Our hearts are uncircumcised.’ Rather God has cursed them
for their unfaith, so few of them have faith. And when there came to
them a Book from God, confirming that which is with them —and earlier
they would pray for victory over the*** ***pagans—so when there came to
them what they recognized, they defied it. So may the curse of God be
upon the faithless!”***[^11]

  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Then, because of their breaking their covenant We cursed them and
made their hearts hard: they pervert words from their meanings, and have
forgotten a part of what they were reminded. You will not cease to learn
about some of their treachery, excepting a few of them. Yet excuse them
and forbear. Indeed God loves the virtuous.”***[^12]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْ هَلْ أُنَبِّئُکُم بِشَرٍّ مِّن ذٰلِكَ مَثُوبَةً عِنْدَ اللهِ مَن

***“Say, ‘Shall I inform you concerning something worse than that as a

of the Rebel! Such are in a worse situation, and more astray from the
right way.’”***[^13]

  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Among the Jews are those who pervert words from their meanings and
say, ‘We hear and disobey’ and ‘Hear without listening!’ and ‘Ra‘ina,’
twisting their tongues and reviling the faith. But had they said, ‘We
hear and obey’ and ‘Listen’ and ‘Unẓurna,’ it would have been better for
them, and more upright. But God has cursed them for their lack of faith,
so they will not believe except a few. O you who were given the Book!
Believe in what We have sent down confirming what is with you, before We
blot out the faces and turn them backwards, or curse them as We cursed
the People of the Sabbath, and God’s command is bound to be
fulfilled.”***[^18]

</blockquote>

***“The Jews say, ‘God’s hand is tied up.’ Tied up be their hands, and
cursed be they for what they say! Rather, His hands are wide open: He
bestows as He wishes. Surely many of them will be increased by what has
been sent to you from your Lord in rebellion and unfaith, and We have
cast enmity and hatred amongst them until the Day of Resurrection. Every
time they ignite the flames of war, God puts them out. They seek to
cause corruption on the earth, and God does not like the agents of
corruption.”***[^19]

3. Malediction against the Polytheists

</blockquote>

***“That He may punish the hypocrites, men and women, and the
polytheists, men and women, who entertain a bad opinion of God. For them

destination.”***[^20]

be seized wherever they are confronted and slain violently.”***[^25]

### 5.2 The “cursed tree”

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لَكَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ أَحَاطَ بِالنَّاسِ وَمَا جَعَلْنَا
الرُّؤیَا الَّتِي أَرَیْنَاكَ إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَالشَّجَرَةَ
الْمَلْعُونَةَ فِی القُرْآنِ وَنُخَوِّفُهُمْ فَمَا یَزِیدُهُمْ إِلاَّ
طُغْیَانًا كَبِیرًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“When We said to you, ‘Indeed your Lord comprehends all mankind,’ We
did not appoint the vision that We showed you except as a test for the
people and the cursed tree in the Quran. We deter them, but it only
increases them in great rebellion.”***[^26]

As has been affirmed in the authentic Prophetic statements *(ahadith)*
narrated by all Muslims (Sunni and Shiʿa) the meaning of the ‘cursed
tree’ as spoken about in the Noble Qurʾan is the Umayyad dynasty.

To better appreciate this understanding, please reflect upon the follow
traditions narrated by the Sunni and Shiʿa.

In his exegesis under the verse mentioned above, Ibn Jarir al-Tabari
narrates the following statement from Sahl b. Saʿd: “The Messenger of
God saw the clan of so-and-so (the Umayyad dynasty) in a dream depicted
as monkeys climbing up and down on his pulpit *(mimbar)*. This brought
immense grief to the Prophet such that from that point up until his
death, he was never seen smiling and it was the following verse which
God revealed to him in regards to what he saw in his dream:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الرُّؤیَا الَّتِی أَرَیْنَاكَ إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً
لِّلنَّاسِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

In his exegesis of the Noble Qur*’*an in regards to the verse mentioned
above, Al-Qurtubi relates from Sahl b. Saʿd that: “This vision (dream)
which the Messenger of God saw in which he witnessed monkeys ascending
and descending from his pulpit *(mimbar)* is in regards to the Umayyad
dynasty after which he became extremely depressed and from that day
forward until his death, he was never seen to laugh and the verse [under
review] was revealed to confirm to the Prophet that after him, they
would take over the reins of governance of the Islamic community and
that God, the Most High would refer to this as a test and tribulation
which would be imposed upon the people.”

It has been narrated from Yunis b. ʿAbd al-Rahman b. al-Ashal that he
asked one of the Imams in regards to the statement of God: وَمَا
جَعَلْنَا الرُّؤیَا الَّتِی أَرَیْنَاكَ إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ and
the Imam replied: “The Messenger of God saw a dream in which certain
members of the Umayyad dynasty were ascending and descending from his
pulpit and anytime one ascended, they would prevent people from
traversing the path of God.

The Messenger of God saw the humiliation [of Islam and his community] in
his dream and with a feeling of great anguish and distress, he woke up
from his sleep. It has been narrated that the number of individuals
which the Prophet saw in his dream were twelve – all belonging to the
Umayyad family and their dynasty.

It was at this point that the Angel Gabriel descended and conveyed this
verse of the Qur*’*an to the Prophet.

It has been narrated by Imam Muhammad b. ʿAli al-Baqir (as), the 5th
Imam, that he said: “The verse of the Qur’an: وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الرُّؤیَا
الَّتِی أَرَیْنَاكَ إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ was in reference to the
masses who would be confused (in that particular era) and that the
“cursed tree” mentioned in the Qur’an was a reference to the Umayyad
dynasty.”

6. Malediction against People – Muslims and non-Muslims
-------------------------------------------------------

### 6.1 Those who cause grief and harm to God and his Messenger

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ الَّذِینَ یُؤْذُونَ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ لَعَنَهُمُ اللهُ فِی
الدُّنْیَا وَالْآخِرَةِ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ عَذَابًا مُّهِینًا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Indeed those who torment God and His Apostle are cursed by God in
this world and in the Hereafter, and He has prepared for them a
humiliating punishment.”***[^27]

#### 6.1.1 Hurting the Commander of the Faithful ʿAli Ibn Abi Talib is like hurting the Prophet

In a tradition from Abi Yaʿli from Saʿd it has been narrated that: “I
was sitting with two people in the *masjid* and we were complaining
about ʿAli, and [in the vicinity] was the Messenger of God who, upon
hearing what we were saying, became enraged and this was evident from
the change in his face.

We sought refuge in God from the anger of the Prophet and at that point
the Prophet said to us: ‘What problem do you have with me? [Know that]
whoever has hurt or offended ʿAli has actually insulted me.’”

In his *Mustadrak*, al-Hakim narrates from ʿUmru b. Sas Aslami (one of
the companions present in *Hudaybiyyah*) that he said: “I had gone with
ʿAli to Yemen (on an expedition). While on the trip, he did something to
me that upset me. When we returned [to Medina], I openly raised my
objections against what he had done to me in the *masjid*, and my
statements made their way to the ears of the Messenger of God.

The next morning, I went to the Masjid and saw the Messenger of God
sitting among a group of his companions and when he laid his eyes on me,
I saw anger in him. I sat down and he continued to look at me with anger
in his eyes and then he said to me: ‘O ʿUmru! I swear by God that you
have indeed insulted me.’ I said to him, ‘I seek refuge in God that I
should ever do something to offend you O’ Messenger of God!’ He replied,
‘Indeed whoever offends ʿAli has indeed offended and insulted me.’”

After mentioning this, Hakim goes on to say: “This hadith has a sound
chain of transmission, however those two (al-Bukhari and al-Muslim) have
not mentioned this in their books. In addition, al-Dhahabi has said that
this tradition is sound.”

Ibn Habban, in his *Sahih* has narrated this in his book of collections.

Al-Haythami, in his book, *Majmaʿ al-Zawaid*, has narrated [the same]
traditions as quoted above and then states, “[Imam] Ahmad and
al-Tabarani have also narrated the same traditions in a shortened format
and al-Bazzar has narrated the same in an even shorter format and
according to [Imam] Ahmad, the chain of narrators are trustworthy.”

It has been narrated from ʿUmru b. Sha’n that: “The Prophet said,
‘Indeed you have upset me.’ I said to him, ‘O Messenger of God! I do not
like to hurt you.’ To this he replied, ‘Whoever hurts ʿAli has hurt
me.’”

حَقًّا قَالُواْ نَعَمْ فَأَذَّنَ مُؤَذِّنٌ بَیْنَهُمْ أَن لَّعْنَةُ

  </p>
</blockquote>

***“The inhabitants of paradise will call out to the inmates of the
Fire, ‘We found what our Lord promised us to be true; did you find what
your Lord promised you to be true?’ ‘Yes,’ they will say. Then a caller
will announce in their midst, ‘May God’s curse be upon the
wrongdoers!’”***[^31]

  <p>

كَذَبُواْ عَلىٰ رَبِّهِمْ أَلاَ لَعْنَةُ اللهِ عَلىٰ الظَّالِمِینَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And who is a greater wrongdoer than him who fabricates a lie against

God is upon the wrongdoers.”***[^32]

كَفَرُواْ هٰؤُلآءِ أَهْدَى مِنَ الَّذِینَ آمَنُواْ سَبِیلاً 
أُوْلٓئِكَ الَّذِینَ لَعَنَهُمُ اللهُ وَمَن یَلْعَنِ اللهُ فَلَن

***“Have you not regarded those who were given a share of the Book

has cursed, and whom God curses, you will never find any helper for
him.”***[^38]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
