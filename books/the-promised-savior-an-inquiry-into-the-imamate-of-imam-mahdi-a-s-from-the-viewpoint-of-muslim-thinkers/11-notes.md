[^31] - Al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, vol. 4, pp. 185 and [^186]: According to
this book Abdullah bin Umar says that only worldly thing over which is
regretful is that he did not fight against Qasiteen. He further says
that in this world he has lost three things over which he is regretful:
fasting during the hot days of the year, keeping vigilant at night
(offering night prayer) and fighting against Qasiteen who rose to fight
Imam Ali (a.s).

[^32] - Al-Mustadrak 'ala al-Sahihayn, vol. 3, p. [^558]: According to
this source, Abullah bin Umar says that he did not regret for anything….
(blank space, something is omitted) except because of not fighting
against Qasiteen.

[^33] -The full text of this tradition is as under:

If sensible trustees of knowledge and wisdom totally disappear from
human society then both knowledge and wisdom will suffer severely, may
bring harm to humanity and may even die out. But this earth will never
be without those persons who will prove the universality of truth as
disclosed by Allah, they may be well-known persons, openly and
fearlessly declaring the things revealed to them or they may, under fear
of harm, injury or deaths hide themselves from the public gaze and may
carry on their mission privately so that the reasons proving the reality
of truth as preached by religion and as demonstrated by His Prophet may
not totally disappear. How many are they and where could they be found?
I swear by Allah that they are very few in number but their worth and
their ranks before Allah are very high. Through them Allah preserves His
Guidance so that they, while departing, may hand over these truths to
persons like themselves. The knowledge which they have acquired has made
them see the realities and visualize the truth and has instilled

into them the spirit of faith and trust. The duties which were decreed
as hard and unbearable by them. They feel happy in the company and
association of things which frighten the ignorant and uneducated. They
live in this world like everybody else but their souls soar to the
heights of Divine Eminence. They are media of Allah on this earth and
they invitepeople towards Him. How I love to meet them O Kumayl ! I have
told you all that I have to say, you can go back to your place whenever
you like". Nahj al-Balagha, saying 147.

[^76] - Technically speaking, tadlis is on a general categorization of
two kinds. a) Talis in Isnad. It means that the narrator narrates a
tradition from someone whom he has not seen or from whom he has heard
it. Or else, he omits the names of some reporters in order to make his
tradition look acceptable or authentic. It is said that tadlish is
similar to lie. b) Tadlis in reporter's attributes. It means that
narrators describe a narrator with attributes that are not real.
