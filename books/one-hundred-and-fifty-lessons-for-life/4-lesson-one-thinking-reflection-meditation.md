Lesson one: Thinking, reflection, meditation
============================================

Imam Ali (a.s) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"أَلا لا خَيْرَ فى عِلم لَيْسَ فيهِ تَفَهُّمٌ، ألا لا خَيْرَ فى قرائة
لَيْسَ فيها تَدَبُّرٌ، ألا لاَ خَيْرَ فى عِبادَة لَيْسَ فيها
تَفَكُّرٌ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Be aware! Knowledge without thinking has no profit![^1]

Be aware! Recitation of the Qur’an without reflection is of little use!

Be aware! Worship lacking reflection has no effect!

Brief Description
-----------------

Filling the brain with scientific formulas, logical rules and
philosophical principles and other knowledge has little effect if it is
not based on proper reflection, a clear world-view and familiarity with
fundamentals of man’s life.

Reciting holy verses of the Holy Qur’an has little effect when it is not
accompanied by reflection and thinking about them. Similarly, other
forms of worship devoid of the light of thinking and wisdom are like a
spiritless body and unable to impart their high educational value.
