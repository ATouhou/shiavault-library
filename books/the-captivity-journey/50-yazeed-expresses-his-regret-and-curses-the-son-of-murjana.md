Yazeed Expresses his Regret and Curses the Son of Murjana
=========================================================

Yazeed was compelled to express his regret towards the killing of Imam
Hussain (Q) and his companions. He instigated the cursing of Obayd Allah
Bin Ziad, and that is for many reasons:

1- The general public condemnation: as he was informed of the people’s
hatred towards him along with their cursing and badmouthing him. Thus he
had declared this himself when he said: "May Allah curse the son of
Murjana! As he had caused Muslims to despise me and inculcated the
hatred for me in their hearts".

2- The private condemnation:

a.The dignitaries of Sham: as the people of Sham had condemned his act
and their faces had changed after they had seen what he had done to the
head of Imam Hussain (Q).

b. Yazeed’s soldiers: After he had recited some of the verses of
Al-Zubary, no one of his soldiers was left without feeling mad at him
and blaming him for what he did.

c. The condemnation of Yazeed’s household.

It is clear here that this remorse was instigated by the hatred and
enmity of Muslims towards him, otherwise, why all this happiness,
delightfulness and the celebrations for the killing of the Imam (Q)
before the people of Sham knew the reality of what had happened.

In addition, blaming the responsibility on Bin Ziad and cursing him was
nothing but a false stand that it was soon compromised by the big reward
that Yazeed had given to Bin Ziad for his killing of Imam Hussain (Q),
and by him spending nights with Bin Ziad in the castle while drinking
wine and celebrating.
