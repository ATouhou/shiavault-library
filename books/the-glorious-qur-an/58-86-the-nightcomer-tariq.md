86: the Nightcomer (tariq)
==========================

This chapter of 17 early Meccan verses was revealed after This
Countryside 90 and before The Moon 54. The title Tariq is a popular
man's name today, as it was with the conquerer of Spain in 711 A. D.

The translation should evoke some mystery, yet not confuse us; here the
name clearly means the morning star that announces dawn. This shows the
dramatic symbolism found in many Arabic names.
