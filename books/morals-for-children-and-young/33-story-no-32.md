**Youngsters and avoiding from the inadmissible eye.Youngsters and
avoiding from the inadmissible eye.**

Nadir was a youngster of 14 years.  
 He was passing the street with one of his friends, when one girl with
Islamic covering came from the opposite way. Nadir raised his eyes to
her face and stared at her.  
 His friend asked him “don’t you have a sister?”  
 Nadir replied “Why? I’ve got two sisters”.  
 His friend asked him “Do you look at them this way?”  
 Nadir replied “No”.  
 His friend said “If there is something that you don’t like, then
shouldn’t like it for others”.  
 And other than that, we Muslims are different from others and Islam
does not allow men to look down upon women and girls so that there may
not be a fight or opposition.  
 There are many verses in Quran verifying this.
