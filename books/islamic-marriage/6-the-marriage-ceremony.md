The Marriage Ceremony
=====================

Some relevant points to be noted are:
-------------------------------------

Engagement
----------

or *Mangni* does not qualify the future spouses to go out together, even
if the parents consent. Man and woman become permissible for each other
only after the performance of *Nikah*.

Dowry
-----

The unislamic system of demanding and accepting dowry must be avoided at
all costs. Shariah does not make any expense incumbent on the
bride/brideâ€™s parents. Even the marriage expenses, it is recommended are
to be borne by the bridegroom.  
 However, the bride can bring whatever she wants of her free will, and
it will always belong to her.

Other Unislamic Customs
-----------------------

Many other unislamic customs have crept into the marriage ceremony of
some Muslims. These customs are either borrowed from non-Muslim cultures
or continue because they are established in past generations. One must
avoid them if they are against the Shariah, even if some people are
displeased. Other customs like the breaking of coconut etc. also do not
feature among the Islamic rituals. All actions, customs etc. which show
disrespect to Islam or weaken the importance of Islam have to be
avoided.

Haraam Acts
-----------

Some of the rituals in marriage ceremonies are absolutely *haraam* like
the playing of music. It is also *haraam* for ladies to go for mixed
gatherings without proper *hijab*. Such things invite divine wrath and
take away the blessings of this auspicious occasion.
