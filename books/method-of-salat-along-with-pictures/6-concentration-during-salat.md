Concentration during Salat
==========================

During the battle of Siffin, an arrow went into the leg of Amir
al-Mo'minin 'Ali ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him). The Imam was in
great pain because of this injury, and blood was flowing out of his
wound. However much the Muslims tried, they were not able to remove the
arrow.

The Muslims went to Imam Hasan al-Mujtaba (peace be upon him) and asked
him what would be the best way to remove the arrow from his father's
leg? Imam Hasan replicd, "Be patient and wait until my father stands for
Salat, then at that time, pull the arrow out of his leg because at the
time of Saldt, my father is so deeply engrossed in communicating with
his Lord, asking and begging Him for his needs, that he will not feel
the pain."

The people acted according to what Imam Hasan (peace be upon him) told
them, and while The Commander of the Faithful 'Ali (peace be upon him)
was praying to his Lord, they managed to pull the arrow out. After Imam
'Ali finished his Salat, he noticed that blood was coming out of his leg
and asked those around him as to what had happened. The people replied
that while he was praying, they removed the arrow from his leg!
