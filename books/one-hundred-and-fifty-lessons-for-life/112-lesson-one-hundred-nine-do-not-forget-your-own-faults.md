Lesson One Hundred Nine: Do Not Forget Your Own Faults
======================================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إذا رَأيْتُمُ الْعَبْدَ يَتَفَقَّدُ الذُّنُوبَ مِنَ النّاسِ ناسِياً
لِذَنْبِهِ فَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّهُ قَدْ مُكِرَبِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

When you see someone searching for people’s sins and censuring them, but
ignoring his own sins, you shall know that he is involved in divine
punishment.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

There are a lot of people who are very insolent, vocal and ingenious in
criticizing others while they forget and ignore their own state. As the
popular proverb says: they see a thorn in the foot of others, but do not
see a branch in their own eyes!

Curtains of conceit and unawareness have covered the eyes of such people
because they are drowned in sin, self-conceit and selfishness, and are
wandering among deviated paths. Those on the right path take care of
their own faults before censuring others.
