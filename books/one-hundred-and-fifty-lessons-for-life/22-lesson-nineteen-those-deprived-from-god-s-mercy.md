Lesson Nineteen: Those deprived from God’s mercy
================================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَنْ وَجَدَ ماءً وَ تُراباً فَافْتَقَرَ فَأَبْعَدَهُ اللّهُ!”
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Whoever has available water and land, and still he is poor and needy,
should expect to be deprived from God’s mercy![^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

It is clear from Islamic traditions that Muslims throughout the world
should use all the available resources such as animal husbandry,
agriculture, underground resources and mines, professions, industry and
commerce for alleviating poverty.

With hard work and good governance, a nation that has even one of these
resources should be able to fulfill its economic requirements. Those who
remain needy despite access to many resources will be deprived of God’s
mercy. Becoming needy and dependent on others is against the teachings
and spirit of Islam.
