Responsibility 8: Taking Part in Religious Gatherings
=====================================================

The next responsibility is to take part in gatherings in which the
merits of Imam al-Mahdi (ajtf) are mentioned or in which his noble
ancestors are remembered. We must be present in such gatherings and
through our presence, offer a spiritual gift to these great
personalities and make such programs dynamic as this is one of the signs
of true love for our Imam.

A companion narrated that Imam Muhammad b. ‘Ali al-Baqir (as) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَتَخْلُونَ وَ تَتَحَدَّثُونَ وَ تَقُولُونَ مَا شِئْـتُمْ؟ فَقُلْتُ:
أَيِّ وَ اللٌّهِ... فَقَالَ : أَمَا وَ اللٌّهِ لَوَدِدْتُ أَنِّي
مَعَكُمْ فِي بَعْضِ تِلْكَ الْمَوَاطِنِ أَمَا وَ اللٌّهِ إِنِّي
لَأُحِبُّ رِيْحَكُمْ وَ أَرْوَاحَكُمْ وَ أَنَّكُمْ عَلى دِينِ اللٌّهِ
وَ دِينِ مَلاَئِكَتِهِ فَأَعِينُوا بِوَرَعٍ وَ اجْتِهَادٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Do you seclude yourselves and speak to one another about whatever
pleases you (in regards to the teachings of Allah)?” I replied: “Yes, by
Allah.” The Imam replied: “I swear by Allah that surely I would love to
be with you in some of these gatherings.

Surely, by Allah I love the pleasant aroma that emanates from you (by
holding such gatherings) and I love your souls! Surely you are all on
the religion of Allah and the religion of His Angels so help (one
another) to observe piety and struggle (in these regards).”[^1]
