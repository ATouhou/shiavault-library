3: the House of `imr'an (aale Imran)
====================================

This chapter consists of 200 verses arranged in twenty sections; like
the previous one and Chapters 29 through 32, it begins with the initials
A.L.M., It was revealed during the third or fourth year which the
Prophet spent in Madina (approximately 625 A. D.), after the chapter on
Booty 7 and before The Coalition 33.

Imran was a common ancestor of Moses and Jesus. The first section
teaches us how to read the Qur'an; the second explains the principle of
God's Oneness.

Persecution and the concept of God as the Sovereign are discussed in
section iii.

The stories of Zachariah (IV) and Jesus (V-VI) follow. Abraham appears
in VII.

Exploitation and arrogation are explained in VIII, and how to treat
turncoats in IX. The parable of "The Bitter Wind" comes in XII while the
pious or heedful are described in XIV. We learn about the Prophet's
trials with the battle of Uhud in the year 3 / 625 (XIII ùóó XVI). The
Town Crier gives us another figure; with him the chapter ends (XX).
