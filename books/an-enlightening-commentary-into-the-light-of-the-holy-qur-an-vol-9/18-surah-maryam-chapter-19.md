***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

Surah Maryam, as arranged in the Book, is the nineteenth Surah of the
holy Quran. It contains 98 verses which have been revealed in Mecca.

Similar to other Meccan Suras, the content of this Surah is mostly about
matters concerning the Hereafter, the end of the evil-doers, the rewards
of the good-doers, and part of the account of the lives of Zakariyya
(Zachariah), Mary, Jesus, Yahya (John), Abraham, Ishmael and Idris
(Enoch).

It is recorded in Tafsir-i-Al-Mizan that, in the last few verses of
Surah Maryam, Allah says that the purpose of revealing this Surah is to
give ‘glad tidings and warnings’, and this aim has been followed in the
beautiful form of the story of the prophets’ lives.

Allah has mentioned no woman in the Qur’an directly by her proper name
except Mary, and the name ‘Mary’ occurs 34 times in the Qur’an. The only
Surah, which has been entitled by the name of a woman in the Qur’an, is
this very Surah, Surah Mary.

For the virtue of studying this Surah, it has been cited that whoever
continues reciting this Surah (whenever he can), he will not die save
that Allah will suffice him in life, wealth and children.[^1]

There is no doubt, of course, that the one will make himself free from
want from others by means of practicing the contents of this Surah.
