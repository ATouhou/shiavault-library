Imam of Light and Guidance
==========================

Ameerul Momineen Ali (a.s.) outlines the characteristics of the just
and rightly guided Imam, 'You should know that among the creatures of
Allah, the most distinguished person before Allah is the just Imam who
has been guided (by Allah) and guides others. So, he stands by the
recognized ways of the Prophet's (s.a.w.a.) behavior (Sunnah) and
destroys the innovations. The (Prophet's (s.a.w.a.)) ways are clear and
they have signs, while innovations are also clear and they too have
signs.' (Nahjul Balagha, Sermon 164, vol. 1, pg. 608, Ansariyan
Publications)

In another sermon, Hazrat Ali (a.s.) declares,
'Certainly the Imams are the vicegerents of Allah over His creatures
and they introduce Allah to His creatures. None will enter Paradise
except he who recognizes them (Imams) and knows Allah, and no one will
enter Hell except he who rejects them and denies Him. (Nahjul Balagha,
Sermon 152, vol. 1, pg. 554, Ansariyan Publications)

He elaborates on this further, 'O my Allah! You know that it was
neither our (Ahle Bait) objective to seek power, nor to acquire anything
from the treasures of the world. Rather we wanted to restore the signs
of Your religion and to spread prosperity into Your cities so that the
oppressed among Your creatures may be safe and Your forsaken commands
could be established. O my Allah! I am the first who was inclined
(towards Thee) and who heard and responded (to the call of Islam). No
one preceded me in prayer except the Prophet (s.a.w.a.).'

'You certainly know that he who is in charge of honor, life, booty,
(enforcement of) legal commands and the leadership of the Muslims should
not be a miser as his greed would aim at their wealth. Similarly he
should not be ignorant as he would then mislead them with his ignorance,
nor should he be rude as he would estrange them with his rudeness. He
should not be unjust in distributing wealth by preferring one group to
another, nor should he accept bribes while taking decisions, as he would
forfeit the rights of some and decree without decisiveness, nor should
he ignore the Sunnah as he would ruin the people.

(Nahjul Balagha, Sermon 131, vol. 1, pg. 496, Ansariyan Publications)

By referring to these brilliant sermons, it becomes abundantly clear
that the leader and Imam who possesses the following characteristics can
alone guide the people towards the truth.

1. He is guided.
2. He guides others towards the true path.
3. He enlivens the Sunnah.
4. He destroys innovations.
5. His recognition is the cause of deliverance for the people.
6. His rejection is the cause of eternal chastisement.
7. He does not desire worldly power and authority.
8. He does not crave for the treasures of the world.
9. He makes manifest the signs of religion.
10. He establishes peace and tranquility in Allah's cities.
11. He provides shelter to His oppressed servants.
12. He revives the forgotten commands.
13. He is not a miser.
14. He is not ignorant.
15. His traits and mannerisms are not evil and wicked.
16. He is not a coward.
17. He is not a corrupt.
18. He does not destroy the Sunnah.

Imam Ali (a.s.) highlights the above points in another sermon,
'Certainly, there is no obligation on the Imam except what has been
devolved on him from Allah, namely to convey warnings, to exhort and
advice, to revive the Sunnah, enforce penalties on those liable and
issue shares to the deserving.'

(Nahjul Balagha, Sermon 105, vol. 1, pg. 400, Ansariyan Publications)
The Ahle Bait (a.s.) If we search for the cha

racteristics of the rightly guided Imam, we find that these traits are
present only in the pure and infallible members of the Ahle Bait (a.s.).
Hazrat Ali (a.s.) exhorts, 'Look at the people of the Prophet's
(s.a.w.a.) family - Ahle Bait (a.s.). Adhere to their direction. Follow
their footsteps because they will never misguide you, and never throw
you into destruction. If they sit down, you too must sit down, and if
they rise, you also rise. Do not go ahead of them, as you will go astray
and do not lag behind them, as you will be ruined.

(Nahjul Balagha, Sermon 97, vol. 1, pg. 378, Ansariyan Publications)

'Where are those people who have lied and have tormented us and have
deceitfully claimed that they are 'the ones firmly rooted in knowledge'
and not us? (They lie against us and covet over position) because Allah,
the All-Merciful has exalted our status and has made them inferior to
us. He has conferred upon us an eminence from which He prevented them
from surpassing us. He allowed us entry to the transcendental sphere of
divine revelation, which He denied them. Remember that guidance could be
acquired and ignorance could be dispelled through us only. Undoubtedly
the Imams shall be from the Quraish, from the Bani Hashim. This divine
appointment has been made for this august progeny, and none else
deserves this sublime and sacred rank.'

(Nahjul Balagha, Sermon 144, vol. 1, pg. 528, Ansariyan Publications)

These assertive and decisive statements make it abundantly clear that
the rightful possessors of Imamat and Caliphate are the Ahle Bait
(a.s.). No one else is deserving of this honor and station. Only the
Ahle Bait (a.s.) can direct the people to the path of guidance and lead
them to paradise. If somebody considers a person other than them as his
leader, guide and Imam, he has deviated and is far from guidance.

When Imam Ali (a.s.) appointed Janab Mohammad Ibne Abi Bakr as governor
of Egypt, he (a.s.) wrote a letter to him in which he said:

'The leader towards guidance, and the leader towards destruction, the
friend and the enemy of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.), can never be
alike.'

(Nahjul Balagha, Letter No. 27, vol. 2, pg. 314, Ansariyan
Publications) Imam Ali (a.s.) has tried to awaken the consciousness of
man with this powerful statement. The statement appeals to the people to
open their eyes and refer to their intellects and then decide with deep
reflection - Are the leaders of guidance and the path bearers to
paradise equal to the guides towards the hell fire and darkness? Never!
Awaken and decide for yourselves.
