Lesson One Hundred Twenty One: Do Productive Works
==================================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إزْرَعُوا وَ أَغْرِسُوا وَ اللّهِ ما عَمِلَ النّاسُ عَمَلاً أَحَلَّ وَ
لا أَطْيَبَ مِنْهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Cultivate and plant trees. By God, people have not done any action more
lawful and purer than this.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Man’s life is based on productive works, including agriculture and
various forms of business and industry. Most industries would not be
meaningful without agriculture because they gain their raw materials
from it. In addition, agriculture is less prone to frauds and trickery
because its results are governed mainly by natural factors and sincere
efforts of men. On this account, cultivation and tree planting is called
the most pure and pleasant work in the above tradition.
