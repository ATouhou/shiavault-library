Chapter 19: Weaning from Mothers Milk
=====================================

There are certain times when a child is deprived of the mother’s milk.

1. The time when the mother is affected with some infectious disease.

2. When the mother is suffering from a serious health condition like a
heart attack and the doctors advised not to breast-feed the baby.

3. When the mother is mentally ill or suffers from epilepsy.

4. When the mother is suffering from anemia and feeding the baby on her
own milk may be harmful to both.

5. When the mother is addicted to drugs and alcoholic beverages because
her milk poisoned by these materials will harm the baby.

In such conditions when there is the danger of infecting the baby or
transferring poisonous matter through the milk, it is better to avoid
feeding on the mother’s milk. When the breast-feeding mother becomes
pregnant, she should wean the child in stages and simultaneously
introduce other foods in the diet.
