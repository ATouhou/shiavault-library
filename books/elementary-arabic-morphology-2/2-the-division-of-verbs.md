7. A verb is a word that indicates a state or event that occurred in the
past, occurs in the present, or will occur in the future. For
example**:** **حَسُنَ**(he was good) - in the past and **یأخُذُ**(he
takes) - in the present or future.

8. There are two kinds of verbs in relation to root letters:

• Triliteral: a verb made up of three root letters, for example
**نَصَرَ** (he helped)

• Quadriliteral: a verb made up of four root letters, for example
**دَحرَجَ** (he rolled)

9. There are two types of triliteral verbs in relation to root letters:
sound and unsound.

10. A sound verb is a verb that does not have any weak letters in its
root. There are three kinds of sound verbs: a verb with a glottal stop
in its root and a double-letter verb. For example: **فَرَّ** (he ran
away).

11. A perfect verb is a sound verb that does not have a glottal stop or
double-letter in its root. For example: **شَکَرَ** (he thanked).

12. An unsound verb is a verb that has a weak letter in its root. For
example: **رَمَیَ** (he threw).

13. There are three weak letters: *alif*, *wāw* and *yā'*.

14. A double-letter verb is a verb that has two identical letters in its
root. For example: **زَلزَلَ** (it quaked).
