Question 98: Is Man Superior To Angels?
=======================================

**Question:** When we say man is the most superior creature (Ashraf
al-Makhluqaat) does it mean that from all the things. Created by Allah,
man is the best, even greater than the angels?

**Answer:** Like the other creations. Man and angels are also the
creatures of Allah. The only difference is that Man has some
extraordinary capabilities, which the angels do not have. In addition to
this the angels are created in such a way that they are free from
selfish desires. Apart from this the animals do not have reasoning
capacity, they only possess animal desires but both these abilities are
present in Man.

Because Man has these two opposite qualities his responsibility is also
serious and dangerous. Therefore if Man follows the intellect and if he
recognizes Allah and becomes faithful and suppresses his wrongful
desires he can become better than angels. If he follows his base desires
and becomes aloof of the guidance of intellect and also dissociates from
truth, goodness and faith he becomes worse than animals.

This is the reason that we read in the Qur’an that when the Almighty
Allah created Adam (a.s.). He commanded all the angels to prostrate
before him and ordered Adam (a.s.) to tell the angels what he knew and
in other words Allah made Adam (a.s.) the teacher of the angels.
