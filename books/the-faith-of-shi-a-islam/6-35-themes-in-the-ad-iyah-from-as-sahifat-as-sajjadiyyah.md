35. Themes in the Ad'iyah From As-sahifat As-sajjadiyyah
========================================================

After the deplorable tragedy (of Karbala'), and after the Ummayids had
taken over the leadership of the Islamic community, they committed
excesses in oppression, revelled in bloodshed and made a mockery of
Islamic teachings. There was no alternative for Imam Zayn al-'Abidin,
Sayyid as-Sajidin (A.S.) but to remain in the seclusion of his own home,
dejected and full of sorrow. No-one dared to approach him in his house,
and he was forbidden to guide the people as they should have been.

He was forced to adopt the method ofdu'a' (as we have mentioned, this
is one of the methods of nurturing purity of character) as a means of
propagating the teachings of the Qur'an, the principles of Islam, and
the message of the Household of the Prophet, of instilling in the minds
of the people a sense of spirituality and piety, and as a means to the
necessary purification of the soul and morality. This was a method of
dissemination that he adopted to teach people without arousing the
suspicions of the tyrannical rulers, and without giving them any
evidence with which to condemn him. That is why we see that most of
these eloquentad'iyah, some of which have been collected together in
as-Sahifat as-Sajjadiyyah, also known as Zabur Ali Muhammad (The Psalms
of the Household of the Prophet), consist of various topics in Islamic
learning. Their style and meaning count them among the greatest examples
of authorship in Arabic literature; they are the embodiment of the
teachings of the true religion; they contain the innermost subtleties
oftawhid andnubuwwat; and they constitute the best way to propagate the
ethics of Muhammad and Islamic morality. Thus they are spiritual and
ethical teachings in the style ofad'iyah, orad'iyah in accordance with
spiritual teachings and ethics. Without doubt, after the Qur'an and Nahj
al-Balaghah these are the greatest examples of literary style in Arabic,
and the best philosophical discussions of theological matters and
ethics.

From then, we understand how to praise Allah and how to sing his
glories and how to thank Him and turn to Him in repentance; and it is in
this way that we can understand how to establish communion with Allah
and to express our secrets to Him in private, and how to become solely
dependent on Him. It is by this method that we are made to understand
the meaning behind invoking benedictions on the Prophet of Allah, on His
Messengers and Chosen Ones from His creation, and the manner of doing
this. It is thus that we can understand how we should do good towards
our parents - the obligations of the father towards the son, and of the
son towards the father, as well as the obligations towards one's
relatives and neighbours, and the obligations of all Muslims in general
obligations of the poor towards the rich, and vice versa.

We are warned about repaying our debts towards others, about how we
should act in commerce and business, and about how we should cooperate
with our relatives, friends and all people with their interests at
heart. In this way, all the good qualities in man are brought out. These
ad'iyah comprise a comprehensive system of instructions in the science
of ethics.

By reciting them we can come to know how to show patience in the midst
of hardships and difficulties, and how to face both sickness and health.
They explain the duties of Islamic armies and their soldiers, and the
duties of the people towards these soldiers, and many other things which
are in accordance with the essence of Islam and the revealedshari'ah,
and all this has been done only in the form of thedu'a'.

The following themes are recurrent in the Sahifah, and are frequent.
a) A description of Allah and His Grandeur and Power and a description
of His Oneness and Transcendence, couched in the most exact and
scholarly terms. This theme occurs in almost all of thead'iyah in
various styles and ways of expression. For instance, in the firstdu'a'
we come across the following passage:

All praise is due to Allah, the First before Whom no being preceded,
and the Last after Whom will be no other.

Whom the eyes of those who see cannot perceive, and Whom our
descriptive imagination cannot envisage.
With His Power He brought Creation into being out of nothingness, and
made His creatures totally subservient to His Will.

In this passage, he has explained the exact nature of the eternity of
Allah, and has set Him above the level at which sight and mind may
encompass His Being and has referred to the true nature of the Creation
of Allah.

In the sixthdu'a' the Power of Allah and His regulation of the universe
are referred to in a different manner.

All praise is due to Allah Who created day and night by His Might, and
made them different from one another by His Power, confined them both to
specific limits, each following on the heels of the other, so that
people might obtain their sustenance and might grow;

He created night for them so that they might relax from the stress of
life, and from excessive fatigue, and made it a garment of comfort and
rest for people so that it might be for them a gathering of new
strength, and an enjoyment of leisure and sensual delights.

He continues mentioning the wisdom of the days and the nights, and how
it is a duty for man to be thankful and grateful to Allah for them.

In the seventhdu'a' the fact that everything is in the hand of Allah is
described in the following way:

O Allah! through Whose Will the knots of problems are unravelled.
O Allah! with Whom we take refuge in times of hardship.
O Allah! to Whom we look for relief in times of misfortune.
It is Thy Might before which even the most brazen are humiliated, and
it is through Thy Grace that the ways to make better our situation are
provided.
Destiny is determined by Thy Power, and things follow the dictates of
Thy Will.
That which Thou dost order hastens to the bidding of Thy Will without
waiting for Thy Command, and according to Thy Wish is withheld without
Your Forbidding.

b) The second recurring theme of as-Sahifat as-Sajjadiyyah concerns the
Bounties and Grace of Allah towards man, and the inability of man to pay
back what is due through worship and obedience to his Lord, and through
sole reliance on Him. Thus we read in the thirty-eighthdu'a':

O Allah! No-one is able to complete his thanksgiving to Thee without
new bounties being bestowed upon him which require further gratitude;
and no-one reaches the level of complete obedience, try he ever so
hard, without being short by that which Thy Grace bestows on him;
thus Thy most thankful servant offers his thanks to Thee, but not as he
ought to, and Thy most devoted servant obeys Thee, but always short of
perfect obedience.

Due to the magnitude and multitude of the bounties of Allah, which
never stop, even for one moment, it is impossible for man to thank Allah
as he should (even if he is grateful and obedient to Him), so how could
one who has committed one act of ingratitude make up for it, even if he
were to do all that was in his power to make amends. This is what is
suggested in the following quotation from the sixteenthdu'a':

O Allah! Were I to weep until I became blind, were I to moan until I
lost my voice, were I to stand in prayer until my feet could no longer
support me, were I to bow inruku' until my back was paralysed, were I to
prostrate before Thee until I became a skeleton, were I to eat clay all
my life or to drink the most filthy water until the end of my days, were
I to sing Thy Glory until my tongue dried up,
even then I could not raise up my eyes to the heavens because of my
shame, undeserving to request the erasing of even a single one of the
sins which I have committed in my life.

c) The third most common theme of thead'iyah concerns Divine reward and
punishment, Hell and Paradise; and it is pointed out again and again
that Allah rewards his servants solely on the basis of His Grace and
Mercy; for man deserves nothing but punishment even for the minutest of
his sins. All thead'iyah of as-Sahifat as-Sajjadiyyah make mention of
this theme, in order to produce in man a sense of fear of the punishment
of Allah and hope for His reward and Mercy. All this is conveyed to such
an effective manner and style that it generates in the heart an intense
fear and awe, and saves man from falling into the abyss of sin. For
instance, we read in the forty -sixthdu'a':

The signs are clear, and Thy Supremacy is eternal and will not
diminish,
therefore eternally beset with misfortune is he who disobeys Thee, and
ignominiously lost is he who turns away from Thee, and the worst
calamity befalls he who strays from Thee.
How fiercely he will be overtaken by Thy punishment, and how long he
will linger in that terrible state, how far he will be from any
remission, and how hopeless a state he will be in.
The sentence passed by Thee will be the just sentence, and the Justice
of Thy decision cannot be challenged. Thou hast made all things
exceedingly clear, and no room for excuse has been left. . . .

Or as we read in the thirty-firstdu'a':

O Allah! Have Mercy on the one standing alone in front of Thee, my
heart beating through fear of Thee, my limbs trembling in awe of Thee.

O Lord! My sins cause me to stand ashamed before Thee; if I keep
silence, no-one will speak on my behalf. even if someone would intercede
for me, I have no right to intercession.

We also read in the thirty-thirddu'a':

If Thou shouldst punish me justly, I should perish, but if Thou
shouldst pour on me Thy Mercy, I should retain my existence. . . .
And lift from me the burden of my sins whose weight has bent my back,
and I beg help from Thee for the heaviness which brings my knees to the
ground.
May peace be upon Muhammad and his Family. Have Mercy on my soul for
the wrong I have done to myself, and let Thy Mercy take up the load of
my sins. . . .

d) The fourth merit of thosead'iyah is to lift the one who recites them
towards perfection, away from evil deeds and badness of character, to
cleanse his conscience and purify his heart, as we read in the
twentiethdu'a':

O Allah! Increase the sincerity of my intentions by Thy Kindness, and
strengthen my certainty of Thee, and by Thy Power correct my faults. . .
.
O Lord! Bring peace to Muhammad and his Family, grant me correct
guidance that I may not change, and a true path from which I may not
deviate, and integrity of intention that I may not doubt. . . .
O Allah! Do not leave me any characteristic which may be a blemish on
me without correcting it, or any defect which is a misfortune for me
without improving it, or any imperfect quality without perfecting it.

e) The fifth theme is to inspire the one who recites thead'iyah to
realise the necessity for independence from others, not to demean
himself in front of them, and not to rely for his needs on any but
Allah. For greediness for things which belong to others is one of the
worst characteristics a man can have. We read in the twentiethdu'a':

Do not tempt me to beg from anyone but Thee, or to demean myself by
asking from anyone but Thee when I am in need, or to implore anyone but
Thee when I am afraid,
so that from these things I merit being abandoned by Thee, being
deprived of Thy blessings, or being ignored by Thee.

And in the twenty-eighthdu'a':

O Allah! Verily I have sincerely devoted myself to Thee, and I have
turned away from (relying on) those who (in fact) need Thy help, and I
no longer beg from those who are in need of Thy Favour, for I have
realised that for someone in need to beg from someone else in need shows
the foolishness of one's views and the delusions of one's mind.

And again in the thirteenthdu'a':

For someone who seeks gratification of his needs from Thee and relies
for the relieving of his poverty on Thee, surely he has taken his need
to the proper place, and has approached his w ants from the right
direction.
And someone who comes for his needs to one of Thy creatures and has
considered that someone other than Thee will be the cause of his
succeeding, surely he will deserve an end to Thy Beneficence.

f) Sixthly, thesead'iyah teach people the necessity of considering the
rights of others, of helping them, of being compassionate and kind
towards each other, of making sacrifices for somebody else's sake, so as
to make a reality of Islamic brotherhood. For example, we read in the
thirty -eighthdu'a':

O Allah I beg forgiveness from Thee for ill-treatment meted out to
someone in my presence without my coming to his aid, and for kindness
shown to me without my giving thanks,
and for something unpleasant for which the doer asked forgiveness from
me but I refused, and for any hungry person who asked from me but I
ignored,
and for the rights of a deserving believer which it was my duty to see
to but to which I did not attend,
and for the defect in a believer which I noticed but did not conceal.

This asking for forgiveness is a most effective way of admonishing the
soul to do those things which are necessary for exalted, divine
morality.
In the thirty-ninthdu'a' there is something more important that this.
It teaches how it is your duty to forgive someone who has wronged you,
and stops you from taking revenge on him, and can elevate you to the
ranks of the saints.

O Allah! Anyone who has taken from me when Thou hast for bidden,
and has slandered me when Thou hast prohibited,
and has died with my shadow on him, or did this to me and is still
alive, forgive him for that through which he harmed me, and do not
rebuke him for that which he has done to me, and do not humiliate him
for what he has taken from me.
Make the forgiveness with which I forgive them, and the gift which I
have offered to them, the purest offering that anyone can offer, and the
highest liberality of those near to Thee, and reward me for my
forgiveness by forgiving me, and for mydu'a' for them by Thy Mercy, so
that everyone of us may rejoice through Thy Grace.

How amazing are these last phrases! and how beautifully they enter the
souls of the good to warn them of the necessity for pure intentions
towards all people, to make them ask for happiness for everyone even for
those who have been unjust or iniquitous to them.

There are many examples of this in thead'iyah of as-Sahifat as
Sajjadiyyah, and if people would only listen to their guidance, they are
full of all kinds of teachings in Divine morality.


**36 Our Belief in Pilgrimage (ziyarah)
to the Holy Shrines
**
One of the practices which distinguish the Shi'a from all other Islamic
sects is the attention paid to pilgrimage to the Holy Shrines, such as
those of the Prophet (S.A.) and the Imams (A.S.), and the building of
magnificent domes and buildings over their tombs by good will and
faith.

All of these things are done through the recommendations of the Imams,
for they were continually persuading and encouraging their followers to
make pilgrimages, so as to derive great reward from Allah. It is one of
the best forms of worship after the obligatory ones, and the shrines are
the best places for supplicating and approaching Allah.
Furthermore, according to the sayings of the Imams, this, is a form of
fidelity to them. Imam Rid . a (A.S.) said:

For every one of the Shi'a and their followers has an understanding
with them (the Imams), and pilgrimage is a way of fulfilling and being
faithful to that understanding. Whosoever undertakes a pilgrimage of his
own free will, believing in it, for him the Imams will intercede with
Allah on the Day of Resurrection.

There are social and religious advantages in makingziyarah. Thus our
Imams have stressed its performance, for it fortifies the bond between
them and their followers and reminds us of their virtues and their
struggle for the truth. Moreover, it gathers Muslims together in one
place so that they can get to know and establish friendships with one
another, in order that the condition of obedience to Allah and devotion
to his commandments becomes firmly imprinted in their hearts. And it
confirms in them the true meaning of pilgrimage: the truth oftawhid, the
sanctity of Islam, the prophethood of Muhammad, the various Islamic
duties such as the striving for an elevated. morality, bowing down and
prostrating before the Commander of all creatures, and how to thank
Allah for His gifts by means of those prayers which are recited during
pilgrimage. And these prayers are among those with the most exalted
meanings. For example, thedu'a' "Amin Allah" composed by Imam Zayn
al-'Abidin (A.S.) when he made a pilgrimage to the grave of his
grandfather 'Ali, Amir al-Mu'minin (A.S.).

Also the recitations during the pilgrimage point out the magnificent
characters of the Imams, their sacrifices in defending the truth and
elevating the religion, and their perseverance in obedience to Allah.
They are written in the most excellent Arabic, full of great eloquence
and easily understandable phrases, and they contain the best exposition
oftawhid, and supplication and prayer to Allah. Truly, among them is the
greatest religious literature after the Qur'an, Nahj al-Balaghah and the
other prayers of the Imams, because they have included in them summaries
of their teachings on Islamic matters and morality. There are also
teachings and guidance in certain pilgrimage ceremonies mentioned below
for the spiritual progress of the Muslim, the cultivation of sympathy
for the poor, and encouragement for fostering brotherhood, good
behaviour and understanding between people.

These rites must be performed before entering the shrine and reciting
the special prayer of pilgrimage, and some others must be said during or
after. Here we shall indicate some of them in order to make clear what
we have already said.

Firstly the pilgrim must wash himself (ghusl) as commanded in the books
of Islam, and clean his body before beginning. This is so that he may
rid himself of dirt, prevent disease and suffering, so that his odour
does not offend others,[^6] and at the same time to cleanse his spirit
from moral impurities. Traditions have been narrated instructing that
after completing this washing, and in order to fix his attention on
these high aims, the pilgrim should say.

O Allah! Give me light and purity, and preserve me from all disease,
sickness, calamity or corruption, and also through this washing purify
my heart, my body, my bones, flesh and blood, my hair and skin, my brain
and nerves and every place 1 touch the earth, and provide me with a
witness on the Day of my poverty, necessity and requirement.

Secondly, the pilgrim should wear the best and cleanest clothes that he
has, because in such days of gathering it causes people to love and be
kind to one another, increases their dignity and thus enables them to
understand the importance of pilgrimage. It should be noted that the
pilgrim should put on the best clothes that he can afford, not the
finest that are obtainable. For not everyone can wear the best, and such
a command would cause despair among the poor, and thus it would go
against the favour of Allah. So it is said that there is a two-fold
meaning, i.e. that people should be well-dressed and that they should
pay due regard to the condition of the poor.

Thirdly, the pilgrim should wear perfume where possible, for its
benefit is like that of being well-dressed.

Fourthly, he should give alms to the poor, according as he is able. The
purpose Of this is, firstly, to help the poor, and then to instill in
the pilgrim a sense of generosity .

Fifthly, the pilgrim should proceed towards the shrine slowly and
Quietly without gazing around. This is clearly in respect for the sacred
place (haram), the pilgrimage and those who are buried there, but also
that the pilgrim may give his undivided attention to Allah, and avoid
inconveniencing others along his way.

Sixthly, he must say"Allahu akbar" (Allah, the Supreme) and repeat it
as much as he can. Some traditions instruct the pilgrim to repeat it one
hundred times. By this he becomes aware of Allah's Greatness and
Magnificence, and realises that nothing is greater than He. This is for
the sake of Allah and His Dignity and to revive the sacred rites of
Islam and to strengthen the religion.

Seventhly, after visiting the tomb of the Prophet or an Imam, the
pilgrim should pray at least tworak'ah. This is in order to worship
Allah and give thanks to Him, and to ask for success in one's
pilgrimage', then he should ask that the spiritual reward for the prayer
should go to the soul of he who is buried in that place.

The specialdu'a' that follows, which the pilgrim must recite after his
prayer, serves to show him that prayer and worship during pilgrimage are
only for Allah, that no-one deserves to be worshipped save Him. It is a
means of winning Allah's favour, for the pilgrim says:

O Allah! To Thee alone do I pray, to Thee alone do I bow down and
prostrate myself.
Thou art One,
Thou bast no partner,
and it is a sin to pray, bow down or prostrate oneself before anyone
else but Thee.
O Allah! Praise be to Muhammad and his Family.
Accept my pilgrimage, and grant my request for the sake of Muhammad and
his Immaculate Descendents.

Thisdu'a' explains to those who want to know, the purpose of pilgrimage
to the shrines as it was performed by the Imams and their followers, and
it answers those who suppose that pilgrimage is a kind of idolatry and
polytheism.

No doubt, the purpose of such detractors is to discourage the Shi'a
from the benefits of meeting one another, and the solidarity which
increases in the times of pilgrimage, because such brotherhood is like
the shafts of arrows in the eyes of the enemies of Muhammad, for they
cannot be unaware of the Imams' intention. It is not possible to believe
that those whose every saying and doing were for the sake of Allah, and
who gave their blood in the cause of the religion of Allah, should call
the people to polytheism and idolatry.

Finally, one of the necessities of the pilgrimage is that "the pilgrim
should behave towards and treat his fellow pilgrim with politeness, that
he should say few words but ones of benefit and purpose, that he should
remember Allah,[^7] be humble, worship often, ask for the Mercy of Allah
on Muhammad and his Descendents, lower his eyes and not stare around,.
assist his brothers when they have nothing and console them, remain far
from what is unlawful, avoid quarrelling and arguing about one's
beliefs."

The reality behind the pilgrimage is the salutation of Muhammad or the
Imam, because, in accordance with the Qur'an:

They are alive and are provided with sustenance from their Lord.
(3;168)

And they hear the words of the pilgrim and answer his salutations. It
is enough to say, for example, before the tomb of the Prophet:"As-salamu
'alayka ya rasul allah" (Peace be upon thee, O Messenger of Allah), but
it is much better to say the words prescribed by the Household of the
Prophet, for they express the highest intentions and the greatest
religious significance by their eloquence, and they are the most
excellent prayers through which the pilgrim may contemplate Allah.
