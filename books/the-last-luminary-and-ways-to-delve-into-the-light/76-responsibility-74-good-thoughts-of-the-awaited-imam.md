Responsibility 74: Good Thoughts of the Awaited Imam
====================================================

Another responsibility of the people is to have good thoughts about the
twelfth Imam (ajtf).  
 A true believer must always perform good deeds which will earn the
pleasure of the Imam and this cannot be achieved except through
obedience to the commandments he has given us and through possessing
taqwa of Allah.

In reality, the followers of each of the A\`immah (as) wanted the best
for their Imam and obeyed them in all matters and tried to always follow
their orders. Therefore, the true beauty of a person is that he does
those things which are the best for his Imam and refrains from anything
which would hurt or annoy him.

Imam Muhammad b. ‘Ali al-Baqir (as) has stated that the Messenger of
Allah said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا نَظَرَ اللٌّهُ عَزَّ وجَلَّ إِلـى وَلِيٍّ لَهُ يُجْهِدُ نَفْسَهُ
بِالطَّاعَةِ لِإِمَامِهِ وَ النَّصِيحَةِ إِلاَّ كَانَ مَعَنَا فِي
الرَّفِيقِ الأَعْلى
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Almighty Allah never looks at a servant and finds him working hard in
obedience and compliance with his Imam, but that He includes him with us
in the most exalted rank. “[^1]

Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad as-Sadiq (as) has stated that:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كُونُوا لَنَا زَيْناً وَ لاَ تَكُونُوا عَلَيْنَا شَيْناً
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Be a beauty for us (the Ahlul Bayt) and do not be a source of
embarrassment for us.”[^2]
