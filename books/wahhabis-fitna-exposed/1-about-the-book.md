About The Book
==============

The first edition of this book proved very popular and all copies were
out in record time. Ayatullah Lutfullah Safi Gulpaygani and other
scholars highly appreciated the book. The Muslim Foundation (NJ)
reprinted its First USA edition in 1994 from New Jersey, USA, and
Ansarian Publications published it in 1996 from Qum, Iran.

It has been also translated in Kiswahili and published by the Mission.

This work is fortunately written by one of the most learned, experienced
and authentic authors of our time, Allamah Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi. It
has been written not to hurt the feelings of anyone; but to
differentiate fact from fiction, and to clear the air against Shiaism.
We are reprinting it without prejudice or hatred and without any
apologies.
