ibn Mahbub from Ali ibn Ri'ab from abu Basir From Imam abu Ja' far
(a.s.) who has said the following. "Speak about the creation of Allah
and do not speak about Allah His-self. Speaking about the Allah's self

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from ibn abu 'Umayr from
abu Ayyub from Muhammad ibn Muslim from Imam abu 'Abdallah (a.s.) who

them 'There is no god but Allah, the One and no one is similar to
Him.'"

A group of our people has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid
from his father from ibn abu 'Umayr from Muhammad ibn Humran from abu
'Ubaydah (Ziyad ibn 'Isa) al- Hadhdha' from Imam abu Ja'far (a.s.) who
has said the following.

"O Ziyad, beware of debates because they create doubts, invalidate
one's good deeds and turn one into a complete wreck. One may say a
thing, perhaps, he will not be forgiven.

In the past there lived a people who ignored acquiring the necessary
knowledge and instead they sought a knowledge that was not required of
them. They came to speak of Allah's self and they became confused. Their
extreme perplexity was such that if called from the front they would
reply to the back and to the front if called from the back.'"

In another Hadith it reads, "They totally banished on earth."

creations."

Muhammad ibn abu 'Abdallah in a marfu' manner has narrated from Imam
abu 'Abdallah (a. s.) who has said the following.

"O son of Adam, if a bird were to feed upon your heart, it would not
satisfy its hunger. Only the eye of a needle, if placed over your eye,
would be totally cover your vision. With such (insignificant) means of
perception how would you comprehend (Allah's) vast dominion over the
earth and the heavens? And if you think you can do so, there is the sun,
one of creatures of Allah. If your eyes can see the sun fully you then
may think that you are right."

of Allah, I have come to ask about your Lord. If you will answer my
question it will be fine, otherwise, I will go back."

He asked, "Where is your Lord?"

The Prophet replied, "He is everywhere, but He is not confined in any
limited space." He asked, "How is He?"

The Prophet replied, "How can I describe my Lord by means of conditions
that are created. Allah cannot be describe by His creation."

Allah?"

the stones and all other things, but that they spoke in clear Arabic
language, 'O Sabhut he (Muhammad) is the Messenger of Allah.'

then he declared, "I testify that there is no god but Allah and you are
the Messenger of Allah."
