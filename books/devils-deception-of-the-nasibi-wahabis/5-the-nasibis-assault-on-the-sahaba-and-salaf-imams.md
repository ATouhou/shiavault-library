The Nasibis Assault On the Sahaba and Salaf Imams
=================================================

**Nasibi kufr Fatwa on the Sahaba**

We read the following traditions in Sahih al-Bukhari:

Hadith: 8.578
Narrated 'Abdullah:

The Prophet said, "I am your predecessor at the Lake-Fount". 'Abdullah
added: The Prophet said, "I am your predecessor at the Lake-Fount, and
some of you will be brought in front of me till I will see them and then
they will be taken away from me and I will say, 'O Lord, my companions!'
It will be said, 'You do not know what they did after you had left.'
Hadith: 8.584

Narrated Anas:

The Prophet said, "Some of my companions will come to me at my Lake
Fount, and after I recognise them, they will then be taken away from me,
whereupon I will say, 'My companions!' Then it will be said, 'You do not
know what they innovated (new things) in the religion after you."
(also Sahih Muslim, part 15, pp 53-54)

Hadith: 8.585

Narrated Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa'd:

The Prophet said, "I am your predecessor (forerunner) at the
Lake-Fount, and whoever will pass by there, he will drink from it and
whoever will drink from it, he will never be thirsty. There will come to
me some people whom I will recognise, and they will recognise me, but a
barrier will be placed between me and them.

" Abu Hazim added: Nu'man bin Abi 'Aiyash, on hearing me, said. "Did
you hear this from Sahl?" I said, "Yes." He said, " I bear witness that
I heard Abu Said al-Khudri saying the same, adding that the Prophet
said: 'I will say: They are my companions. Then it will be said to me,
'You do not know what they innovated (new things) in the religion after
you left'.

I will say, 'Far removed, far removed (from mercy), those who changed
after me." Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said, "On the Day of
Resurrection a group of companions will come to me, but will be driven
away from the Lake-Fount, and I will say, 'O Lord (those are) my
companions!' It will be said, 'You have no knowledge as to what they
innovated after you left; they turned apostate as renegades (reverted
from the true Islam)"

Hadith: 8.587

**Narrated Abu Huraira:
**
The Prophet said, "While I was sleeping, a group (of my followers were
brought close to me), and when I recognised them, a man (an angel) came
out from amongst (us) me and them, he said (to them), 'Come along.' I
asked, 'Where?' He said, 'To the (Hell) Fire, by Allah' I asked, 'what
is wrong with them?' He said, 'They turned APOSTATE as renegades after
you left.

' Then behold! (Another) group (of my followers) were brought close to
me, and when I recognised them, a man (an angel) came out from (me and
them) he said (to them); Come along.'I asked, "Where?' He said, 'To the
(Hell) Fire, by Allah.' I asked, 'What is wrong with them?' He said,
'They turned APOSTATE as renegades after you left. So I did not see
anyone of them escaping except a few who were like camels without a
shepherd."
Faced with such explicit traditions the Nasibis often try to re-define
Sahaba here, namely that the words dont refer to the Sahaba per se but
in fact refer to the Ummah as a whole throughout history (ie. that the
vast bulk of the Ummah will be in the fire). To counter this we suggest
Nasibis check the Arabic it says the words Sahaba. We are yet to find
any Arabic dictionary that states the word Sahaba has the connotation of
Ummah.

Further proofs come from the wording of the traditions. In addition 8:
587 'They turned APOSTATE as renegades after you left.' When you LEAVE
somebody, you do so having already BEEN WITH THEM, (i.e. he had been
amongst them). The words "after you left" clearly indicate that the
group being referred to are those who survived the Prophet (S) ie. the
Sahaba. This is absolutely logical, when a parent dies, they leave
behind them their children - they have survived their parents-they dont
leave behind all their descendents until the day of resurrection.

Moreover in tradition 8: 585 Rasulullah (s) says There will come to me
some people whom I will RECOGNIZE and in 8: 587 "While I was sleeping, a
group (of my followers were brought close to me), and when I RECOGNIZED
them. Now in both of these hadith our infallible Prophet (S) refers to a
group "whom I will recognise" - I can only recognise someone if I have
SEEN that person - common sense Rasulullah (s)s surprise is because he
is seeing those who he sat with (companions) being lead into the fire.

**These authentic traditions make it clear that the vast bulk of
Sahaba**

(1) Innovated
(2) Became Kaafir
(3) Only a few will be saved from the fire!

These are the Sahaba who are kafirs and yet the Shias are called kafirs
for repeating the words of the Prophet (s). If calling the Sahaba kafir
makes you one then this is the view espoused by your beloved Shaykh
Bukhari.

**Further Nasibi lies against the Shi'as**

Salafi Nasibi and master of false propoganda Dr Ahmad al Afghaanee in
his book Miraaj in Iran pages 49-50 makes this false allegation against
the Shia:

al Bashar al Ibraheemee whilst visiting Iraq, this Professor who is the
leading religious scholar in Algeria saw with his own eyes the book of
the Shiite Az Zahra in which Umar bin Khattab (may Allah be pleased with
him) is accused of homosexuality.

It is amazing to see how this Nasibi simply expects us to acceot this
as fact without elaborating on the book. We are not told of the author
of the book Az Zahra (that is a very common title), rather we are just
supposed to accept that the Shia ascribe homosexuality to the second
khalifa. This is the word of this Nasibi that the world is supposed to
accept as it has come out of his mouth.

It would have been better for him to have steered clear of this matter
for his own Nasibi books are replete with references demonstrating that
this curse has not come from the Shias, rather in their texts they
attribute the condition to the very Sahaba that advocate for!

**The Nasibi Fatwa that Khalid bin Waleed's father was homosexual**

In the esteemed Tafseer Ruh-al Maani, the following is recorded:

Imam Ahlul Sunnah al Wusi states that Shaykh ul Hadith Mufassir Quran
Ibn Abi Hathim Zennam is that person who takes it in the anus, and in
this verse three individuals are referred, Hadhrath Khalids father
Waleed bin Mughira, Khulafa Banu Marwans grandfather Hakim bin Aas,
Hadhrath Umars maternal uncle Abu Jahal".

Tafseer Ruh-al Maani, Chapter 29, Section "Nun wal Kalam"

We suggest that the Nasibis look at their texts, the history of their
ancestors and the private lives of their fathers.

**Nasibis Fatwa that the Ulema of Islam are homosexual**

In the authentic Tarikh Ibn Khalkaan we read that the Imam of Ahl ul
Sunna Abu Ubaydah al Timmeemee al Basri wrote these prose: "May Allah
bless the tribe of Lut, Oh Ubaydah tell the truth In Tarikh Hulka we
read:

Abu Ubaydah al Basri was homosexual, at the mosque where he would study
someone wrote Abu Ubaydah is the pride of the tribe of Lut. When Abu
Ubaydah saw this in the morning he asked someone to climb up on his
shoulders and rub it out. Abu Ubaydah who was old and got tired and
asked how much has been erased and what is left, the remover said just
the words Lut, he said remove this for this word has destroyed me.

Someone once wrote the above prose on a mosque as we have already
mentioned the case of Abu Ubaydah. The Nasibis are trying to expunge
their texts so that the homosexual digest filth cannot be published.

**The Nasibis Fatwa that the companions were homosexual**

In the recognised Sunni text "Ahlajj ul Amraas" by Hakeem Ajmul Khan
Dehlavi, who quotes his father Hakeem Shareef Khan stating:

The medicine that is needed to treat anal diseases was used extensively
by the second khalifa, this medicine is prepared by grinding certain
chemicals and then preparing a solution in either vinegar or wine and is
then inserted into the anus of the patient Ahlajj ul Amraas page 309 by
Hakeem Ajmul Khan Dehlavi Part 8, Dialogue 14

We present this medicine to al Bashar al Ibraheemee and his fellow
Nasibis; they falsely attribute this lie to the Shia and yet attribute
this slander to their own second khalifa! Is this respect for the
Sahaba?

**Muhammad Ma' Aalim Chisti states:**

In the Book Hashiya Aaksirai, published by Shahi Lucknawi, it is
recorded by Hakeem Maseehee and Abu Ali Sinna that some companions
suffered from anal diseases and it was a well publicised fact, their
physicians told them that there was no harm in practising anal sex
because a Muslim Judge has permitted insertion of cartridge from a roll
of thread or pipes in the anus, and Aflahs penis is akin the insertion
of a cartridge. Although the book describes the act of Aflahs sodomy,
the name of the other party has not been disclosed keeping in mind his
status.

Thanzeeya al Ansab by Muhammad Ma' Aalim Chisti page 64 Chapter 1

**The Nasibis Fatwa Imam Abu Hanifa's student Abdullah bin Mubarak was
homosexual**

In the recognised Sunni work Muhadarat al-udaba, the Imam of Ahlul
Sunnah Raghin Isfahani writes:

"Hakim Tabaristan made Abdullah bin Mubarak a Judge, who was addicted
to the anus (Homosexual) he asked the Hakim 'Sir I need some men who can
help you" Hakim said I was aware of your need before this".

Muhadarat, page 199 by Raghib Isfahani Chapter 1 Al hada al Saani

In Aqad Munzoom fi Dhike Faazil Rhum, Mu'allif Ali bin Baali writes:

Yahya bin Nurudin Faazil Rumi had an addiction to the anus.

By quoting these texts we are showing that Numani and his cronies dont
spare anyone from their Fatwas. In the same way they call Shia kafirs
they record that their beloved ancestors were homosexual.

The Nasibis have declared Imam of Ahlul Sunnah
Shaykh ul Islam Qadi Yahya bin Aksam a homosexual
In the authentic Sunni work Ta'rikh Baghdad, we read the following
poem:

"Our Leader takes bribes,
Our Judge is homosexual
And as long as the Abbasides reign
I have no confidence that tyranny will subside"
This was written by Ahmad bin Abki Naeem for Qadi Yahya.
Tarikh by al Baghdad, page 198, Chapter 14 "Dhikr Yahya bin Aksam"

**Qadi Yahya was an Imam of Ahl'ul Sunnah**

In Tarikh Baghdad on the above-mentioned page Hafidh Abu Bakr states,
"Qadi Yahya bin Aksam was a great Ahlul Sunnah scholar and in him there
was no bad deed".

So Hafidh Abu Bakr feels that there is no sin in sodomy, rather this is
the Sunnah of the Salafees. Manzoor Numani claims that he has read Shia
books we doubt that had he has even read his own texts had he done so he
would have never sought to trouble us!

Fatwa by the Nasibis on Shaykh ul Islam Qadi Yahya
bin Aqsam - that he was active in Sodomy
ie. As a recipient and distributor
The great Ahl'ul Sunnah scholar, Allamah Isfahani narrates that:

Once a pious youth was sitting next to Mamun Abbasi, Mamun asked Qadi
Yahya to determine his knowledge by asking him any question, the Qadi
asked whats the news? The boy replied that on earth it is known that you
are a paedophile whereas in the skies it is known that you have an
addiction to the anus The Qadi asked which news is correct? the boy
replied the news in the skies can never be wrong Muhadarat by Allamah
Isfahani page 351 Volume 3 Al Hadad Sadhus Asur In Tarikh Baghdad, under
the same chapter we read that:

Once in his desire to be praised, the Qadi asked what do people say
about me? The reply was some people say youre homosexual he laughed and
said, Thats well known - although I am the one that practices
homosexuality others are blamed for it.

The great Ahl'ul Sunnah work "Rowza thul Munazir ibn Shahna" records
that someone said in praise of the Qadi the following couplets: Oh
people of this world, How shall you be corrected when your Chief Justice
is a paedophile? Thus we see that no one has been spared from the Fatwas
of the likes of Numani?

**The Nasibis Fatwa that Uthman's father was homosexual**

In "Kitab al Musalab" under the Chapter "Dhikr Afan bin Aas" we read:
"Uthman's father was a sodomite"

What can we say, who can evade their verdicts? With so many Fatwas
flying around its tough task to determine what is what, who is straight
and who is a fagot.

Nasibi Fatwa Hadhrath Umar's maternal uncle was a homosexual
The Imam of Ahl' ul Sunnah
Allama Madani records that:

"There were six homosexuals in Madina,

1. Tawees
2. Dilahl
3. Naseer al Sahar
4. Numathul Zaha
5. Burdhal Quwaat
6. Zul al Shajar

And in Madina Umars uncle and Ikrima the companions father - Abu Jahl
had had an addiction to the anus. His anus had white spots and he used
to paint it with saffron so that customers would not be repulsed.

Majma al Amthaal page 250 Chapter 7 fi ma aula al kha by Allamah
Madani

Nasibis Fatwa on Hakim bin Aas declaring
Hadhrath Uthmans uncle a homosexual
the Imam of Ahl'ul Sunnah Allamah Damiri writes:

The Banu Umaya Khalifas grandfather who was Hadhrath Uthmans uncle and
Marwan the Nasibis father was also a homosexual. In Sawaiq al Muhriqa
page 108 Ibn Hajar Makki in his defence of Hadhrath Hakim the companion
states that It is shameful for any Sahabi to engage in homosexuality,
Hadhrath Hakim was a homosexual before he became Muslim.

"Al Hiyathul Haywaan" Chapter 1

In presenting these texts we are showing you the filthy Fatwas these
Nasibis have, their Fatwas of kufr on the Prophet, that Allah is the
cause of evil, that the Sahaba were homosexuals, takfir on the Shi'as
and their Fatwas of sodomy against the Sunni Ulema!

**Nasibis Fatwa of homosexuality on Yazid bin Mu'awiya**

The Nasibi Ibn Kathir records in his classic Ahl'ul Sunnah text:

Abdul Malik bin Marwan said in a khutbah that I like Uthman am not weak
and like Muawiya I am not cunning / dishonest and like Yazid I am not a
homosexual.

al Bidayah wa al Nihayah by Ibn Kathir page 64 Volume 9 "Dhikr Abdul
Mulk"

The Nasibis are so stupid on the one side they call him an Imam at the
same time they call him a homosexual.

Hakeem Mahmood Ahmad Zafar Sialkoti on page 261 of his book (Urdu)
Sayyidina Muawiya (ra), Shukhsiat aur kirdaar, writes in his discussion
on the hadith in which Rasulullah (s) said that Islam would continue
until the passing of the 12 khalifa: These 12 khalifas are men of good
nature and piety. Islam shall be protected and respectable during their
reigns. They shall rule in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah, during
their reigns the rule of justice shall be apparent.

Mulla Ali Qari puts forward these 12 as Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali,
Muawiya, Yazid, Abdul Malik bin Marwan, Walid bin Abdul Malik bin
Marwan, Sulayman bin Abdul Malik bin Marwan, Umar bin Abdul Aziz, Yazid
bin Abdul Malik bin Marwan, Hasham bin Abdul Malik bin Marwan taken from
Sharh Fiqh Akbar page 184; Fathul Bari Volume 3 page 182) According to
Mulla Ali Qaris above statements its quite evident that Muawiya is a
khalifa ai Rashid. By the same token Yazid is also a rightly guided
khalifa since he describes the twelve as rightly guided ruling by the
Quran and Sunnah. He cites as his evidence Sharh Fiqh Akbar the Hanafi
Book of Aqaid.
