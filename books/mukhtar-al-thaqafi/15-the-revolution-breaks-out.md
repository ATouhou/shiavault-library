The Revolution breaks out
=========================

On Tuesday night, 12th Rabi al-Awwal, namely two days before the
revolution, on the way to Mukhtar's house, Ibraheem al-Ashtar and some
of his friends came across a patrol. The commander of the patrol said:

*Who are you?*

Ibraheem replied:

*I'm Ibraheem al-Ashtar*

The commander of the patrol said:

*Who are those with you? Have you permission to go out at night?*

*No.*

*We must arrest you!*

Ibraheem al-Ashtar was forced to attack the Commander. He killed him.
The rest of the patrol ran away.

Ibraheem al-Ashtar and his friends hurried to Mukhtar . They told him
about the incident. Ibraheem al-Ashtar said to Mukhtar :

*You must announce the revolution at once!*

Mukhtar said:

*What has happened?*

*I have killed the Commander of the patrol. It's important to announce
the revolution at once.*

Mukhtar became cheerful and said:

*May Allah make you happy! This is the beginning of the conquest!*
