Lesson Sixty One: Help Your Brothers
====================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ كَانَ فِى حاجَةِ أَخِيْهِ الْمُسْلِم كَانَ اللّهُ فى حاجَتِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Whosoever engages in fulfilling the requirements and needs of his Muslim
brothers, God will fulfill his requests.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

People often think that if they get involved in solving the problems of
others, this would retard progress in their own life. Islam has a
different viewpoint. The Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny)
says that if you engage in solving people’s problems and fulfilling
their requirements, God, whose power is beyond your power and all
powers, helps you and solves your problems. We have been witnessed how
the problems of those who help others get solved in wonderful ways and
this is a divine bounty.
