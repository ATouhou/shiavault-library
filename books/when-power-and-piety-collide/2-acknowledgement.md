Acknowledgement
===============

This publication of this book would not have been possible without the
effort, sacrifice, and sincere dedication of a few people that the
Almighty has graced me with.

First, my gratitude must be expressed to Sister Fatma Saleh, her imprint
on this book is unspoken. Second, much appreciation goes to Shaykh
Saleem Bhimji for the typesetting and cover design; and his wife, Sister
Arifa Hudda for the editing of this work. Publication of this book was
made possible by the Ahlul Bayt Society
([www.12imams.com](http://www.12imams.com)).
