The Feature of the Surah

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

This is one of Meccan Suras, and it is called Luqman because of the
existence of Luqman’s name in this Surah. It is among the sixth Suras
which begin with abbreviated letters: A.L.M.

The content of Surah Luqman can be summarized briefly in the following
instances:

1- The statement of the greatness and importance of the Holy Qur’an
concerning the guidance of humankind.

2- The division of human beings into the benevolent and the tyrant, and
the statement of their fate.

3- The advice and wise teachings of Luqman to his son.

4- The reasons for the Faith in Origin and Resurrection.

5- The statement of Allah’s particular knowledge, such as: the time of
every one’s death and the time of the occurrence of Resurrection.

The Virtue of the Surah
-----------------------

We recite in a tradition narrated from Imam Muhammad Baqir (as) that he
said:

*“Whoever recites Surah Luqman at night Allah ordains thirty angels to
protect him during the night until morning from Satan and his army, and
if he recites it in daytime these angels protect him from Satan and his
army until evening.”*

We have repeatedly said, and now we emphatically say again, that the
recitation of a Surah as the cause of these many virtues, divine
rewards, and honour is for the sake that recitation is a preliminary for
contemplation, and a thinking which in turn is a preliminary for action.
Therefore, we must not expect those abundant virtues for a mere
recitation.
