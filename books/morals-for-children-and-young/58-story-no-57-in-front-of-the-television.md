Story no. 57:In front of the television.
========================================

Raihana was a girl of 7 years.  
 She was introduced to all children once she stepped in school.  
 But one thing that surprised her most was that why small children
walked about with glasses!  
 When she asked one of the children, he answered “I could not read or
write from close. My father took me to an eye specialist. He first
diagnosed my problem and then said that my eyes were weak due to
watching television from a close distance. He gave me glasses and then
requested me not to watch television too closely.”  
 When Raihana heard this, she went home and requested the other children
to watch T.V from a safe distance.  
 Yes, man should value the unique things given by God specially eyesight
so that he can take advantage of it by reading and writing.
