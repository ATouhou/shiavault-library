Lesson 14: The Branches of Religion (I)
=======================================

Furu’ al-Deen
-------------

Furu’ al-Deen means the branches of religion. These branches are very
many: but usually six to ten are taught to the children. They are
explained below.

I. Salat (Prayer)
-----------------

'The daily five prayers and other eleven prayers which are detailed
elsewhere are all obligatory and should be performed on their occasions
in fulfillment of prescribed conditions.

The prayers are obligatory on adults (*baligh*). For purpose of
fulfilling religious obligations a boy is deemed to be adult on
completion of his fifteenth year, and a girl on completion of her ninth
year.

The Qur’an has repeatedly enjoined upon every Muslim the offering of
prayers (*Iqam as-Salat*):

***“Verily! I am Allah; there is no god but I, therefore submit to Me
and maintain the prayer for My remembrance”. (20:14)***

***“Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book, and maintain the
prayer! Indeed the prayer prevents indecencies and wrongs… and Allah
knows what you do”. (29:45)***

***“O my son! Maintain the prayer and enjoin the good and forbid the
evil, and be patient in whatever befalls thee: for this is firmness in
the conduct of affairs”. (31 17)***

II. Sawm (Fasting)
------------------

Fasting is obligatory for every Muslim adult, male or female, for the
entire lunar month of Ramadhan every year. The fast lasts from the true
dawn till the commencement of night. During the fast one has to abstain
from eating, drinking, smoking and some other actions.  
 In this regard the Qur’an says:

***“O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you, as it was prescribed
to those before you, that ye may exercise self-restraint”. (2:183)***

***“So every one of you who witnesses this month should fast in it”.
(2:185)***
