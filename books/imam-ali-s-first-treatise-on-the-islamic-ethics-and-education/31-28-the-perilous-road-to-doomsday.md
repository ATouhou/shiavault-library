واِذا وَجَدْتَ مِن اَهلِ الفَاقَةِ مَن يَحمِلُ لَكَ زادَكَ اِلى يَومِ

*“Know that there is, ahead of you, a road of great distance and severe
hardship, and that in it you will need to make a proper search, collect
provisions as much as you can, and have a light load (of sins). Do not
burden your back beyond your strength such that the weight of that has
evil consequences for you*

*And if you find a needy person to carry your provisions for you to the
Day of Judgment, and deliver it to you tomorrow when you will be in need
of it, then avail yourself of him and make him carry it. Continue to
supply him with provisions (for yourself) as far as you are able, for
you may seek him later and not find him. Avail yourself of one who asks
you for a loan while you are in a state of affluence, so that his
repayment of it to you will be on the day of your hardship.*

*Know that before you is a mountain road, difficult to ascend. The
light-burdened one on it will be in a better condition that the
heavy-burdened one, and the slow-moving one on it will be in a worse
state than the fast-moving one. Its place of descent with you will
undoubtedly be in Paradise or in the Fire. Thus, search (for provisions)
for yourself before your descent, and prepare the station before your
arrival, for after death there is no seeking of (God’s) favour or any
return to this world.”*

Commentary
----------

In this section of the letter, Imam ‘Ali (as) talks about the perilous
road to Doomsday, and the hardships which exist there. He says no
excuses are accepted and a return to the world is impossible. Whatever
we are able to do, we should do here. Imam ‘Ali (as) has invited his son
and all of his other spiritual sons to prepare provisions for
Doomsday.
The following points in Imam ‘Ali’s letter are worth considering:

### A. Sufficient Provisions And Light-Load Of Possessions

In this difficult and long road two things are essential: First, enough
provisions which can help us there and which includes piety and good
deeds. Imam ‘‘Ali (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
خَيرُ الزَّادِ التَّقوَى
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"The best kind of provision is God-wariness."*

And secondly, the light load of possessions in this world. We would
suffer a lot in that long, tedious journey of ours. We will be destroyed
if the load is too heavy.

### B. Be Aware Of The Significance Of Those Who Carry Your Provisions On The Way Or Pay You Back What They Owe You On Difficult Days

In emphasizing our struggles to prepare the provisions, Imam ‘Ali (as)
uses two beautiful similes and metaphors:

Firstly: In this long and tiring way if you can find somebody to be able
to carry some of your provisions to your destination, you are lucky. Be
aware that when you help the needy today, in fact you have put your
provisions for the next world over their shoulders to deliver them to
you in the next world. You might not be lucky enough to have a chance
like this tomorrow:

Secondly: There are people who are ready to borrow from you when you are
rich, to give it back to you when you are poor. Make the best of this
situation. Be aware that to give away your wealth to the needy for God's
sake is to lend to God.[^1] This is easy for you today to perform such a
good act.

However, on Doomsday, when it is the time of hardship, despair and
misery, the result is of significant consequences:

### C. In Hard To Cross Roads, The Light – Loaded Travelers Are More At Ease

Imam ‘Ali (as) talks about hard–to–cross roads in the direction of
Resurrection Day. These are mentioned in the books on traditions.[^2]
Naturally, those who are light–loaded in sins pass both speedily and
easily but the heavy–loaded sinners either fall or stumble on the way.

### D. The End Point For Everyone Is Either Paradise Or Hell

Imam ‘Ali (as) points out that the end point for all is either Paradise
or Hell. We should make every thing ready before departure. After death
there is no return.

[^1]: . “If you set apart for Allah a goodly portion, He will double it
for you and forgive you; and Allah is the Multiplier of rewards,
Forbearing”.[Qur’an 64:17]

[^2]: . Refer to Bihar, vol.5, pp.7- 8.
