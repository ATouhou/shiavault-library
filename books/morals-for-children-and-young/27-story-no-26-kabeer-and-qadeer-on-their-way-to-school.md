Story no. 26: Kabeer and Qadeer on their way to school
======================================================

Kabeer and Qadeer went to school together everyday.  
 One day Qadeer said to Kabeer “I forgot to take money from my father
and now want to buy a pencil. Could you lend me some money?”  
 So Kabeer put his hand in his pocket and lent him 5 tomans.  
 Next day, first thing in the morning, Qadeer came and gave him the 5
tomans back.  
 Kabeer said in amazement “How soon!”  
 Qadeer replied “It is one of the lessons of Islam that I have learnt
from my father and mother”.
