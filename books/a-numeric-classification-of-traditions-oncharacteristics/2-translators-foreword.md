Translators’ Foreword
=====================

We thank God the Almighty for the opportunity granted to us to undertake
the preparation of Al-Khisal (A Numeric Classification of Traditions on
Characteristics) in two volumes after the successful completion of Uyun
Akhbar al-Reza (MGB) in two volumes, An Anthology of Islamic Poetry in
two volumes, Imam Reza’s (MGB) Pilgrimage Procedures and Prayers, A
Divine Perspective on Rights, The Treatise on Rights, Mishkat ul-Anwar
Fi Ghurar il-Akhbar and The Islamic Family Structure.

We have exactly cited the references to Holy Quranic verses for
coherency using an available translation of the Quran into English by
Mr. Abdullah Yusuf Ali (May God Reward Him).

We take this opportunity to thank Ms. Maryam Fajr Peiravi for her
valuable assistance during the research and translation of this work. We
warmly welcome any suggestions made by the readers that might help us
learn about our mistakes and shortcomings, and help us improve our
future works.
