Religious Leaders
=================

Argue only in the best way with the People of the Book, except with
those of them who act unjustly. Say, "We believe in what was revealed to
us and in what was revealed to you: our God and your God are one (and
the same); we are devoted to Him." (31)

Syria´s Grand Mufti Ahmad Badr Al-Din Hassoun opening his address to
Members of the European Parliament, on Tuesday 15th of January 2008,
saying: "Religion gives civilization its moral values but culture is
something that we built", he stressed adding that religion "is the work
of God" whereas civilization is created by mankind.

"We do not believe, in our region, in the multiplicity of religions.
Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Mohamed (Pbuh) came with one single religion".
Therefore, "there is no holy war, because a war can never be holy; it is
peace that is holy".

Then they came up and laid hands upon Jesus and seized him. And Behold,
one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his
sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off this ear.
Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place; for all who
take the sword will perish buy the sword." (32)

Interreligious dialogue recognizes the plurality of the world´s
religious systems as a valuable resource for discovering and working
together toward a common goals.

Dialogue begins with the willingness to question and to be questioned.
Dialogue requires an effort to comprehend the inherent value of
difference in this complex global society. Dialogue is the only
instrument to achieve a real peaceful world based on mutual respect and
understanding.

"All states shall take effective measures to prevent and eliminate
discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief ….(…..) All states
shall make all efforts to enact or rescind legislation where necessary
to prohibit any such discrimination." (33)

**Civil Society**

We live in a society that we call developed, a society that produces
great masses of scorned, exploited, hungry human beings; a society whose
supreme value is money. A society that has achieved an unparalleled
technological development during the last few decades and that possesses
the sufficient economic, cultural and spiritual capacity to achieve a
more just and supportive universal social order for all, without
excluding anybody.

"No one of you is a believer until he loves for his brother what he
loves for himself." (34)

The pillars of society are those people who provide its spiritual and
moral vision to the society . They are righteous people with courage who
realize the truth within themselves and are willing to take
responsibility for their community.

We are all conscious today that our world has become a virtual
communicational unity, that its nations and regions are increasingly
economically interdependent, and that war is insanely destructive. The
survival of the human family requires urgently the articulation of
ethical principles. "Treat people in such a way and live amongst them in
such a manner that if you die the will weep over you; alive they crave
for your company."(35)


**V.- Guiding Principles from the Book of Ben Sira**

Duties toward the Poor and the Oppressed (36)

My child, do not cheat the poor of their living, and do not keep needy
eyes waiting. Do not grieve the hungry, or anger one in need.

Do not add to the troubles of the desperate, or delay giving to the
needy.

Do not reject a suppliant in distress, o turn your face away from the
poor.

Prudence and Common Sense (37)

"Do not contend with the powerful, or you may fall into their hands.

Do not quarrel with the rich, in case their resources outweigh yours;
for gold has ruined many, and has perverted the minds of kings.

**Concerning rulers (38)**

A wise magistrate educates his people, and the rule of an intelligent
person is well ordered.

As the people´s judge is, so are his officials; as the ruler of the
city is, so are all its inhabitants.

The government of the earth is in the hand of the Lord, and over it He
will raise up the right leader for the time.

Human success is in the hand of the Lord, and it is he who confers
honor upon the lawgiver.

**Concerning humility (39)**

The poor are honored for their knowledge, while the rich are honored
for their wealth.

One who is honored in poverty, how much more in wealth!

An one dishonored in wealth, how much more in poverty!

**Responsible use of wealth (40)**

If one is mean to himself, to whom he will be generous? He will not
enjoy his own riches.

No one is worse than one who is grudging to himself; this is the
punishment for his meanness.

The miser is an evil person; he turns away and disregards people.

Do good to friends before you die, and reach out and give to them as
much as you can.

**The temptations of Commerce (41)**

A merchant can hardly keep from wrongdoing, nor is a tradesman innocent
of sin. As a stake is driven firmly into a fissure between stones, so
sin is wedged in between selling and buying.

If a person is not steadfast in the fear of the Lord, his house will be
quickly overthrown.


**VI.-Final Comments**

By faith we believe and understand that the worlds were created by the
Word of God.

By faith Enoch was taken so that he did no experience death.

By faith Noah, warned by God about events yet not seen he built the ark
to save his household.

By faith, Abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that
he was to receive as an inheritance and he set out not knowing where he
was going.

By faith Moses left Egypt without fear of Pharao´s anger and he lead
the people through the dessert to the promised land. Without faith is no
possible to please God.

It is hard to believe that science, technology, politics and economics
can effectively offer a unifying vision of the complexity of our world
today and find the solutions to our everyday increasing problems.

Our world is in a state of imbalance created by man´s misuse. The
appearance of the Mahdi (Pbuh) or Saviour will restore and balance the
earth.

We have to be prepared to change our present modes of living to ensure
the future of mankind in this world. Adequate our needs according to the
needs of all people of the world and enter in a new and truthful
understanding of the meaning of sharing.

The Mahdi (Pbuh) or Saviour, knows that deep in the hearts of men is
the aspiration for justice and love, but we need to end with the fear
that stop us from living according to the light of God.

Today, from all corners of our planet we hear the cry of despair of
displace people, stateless people, emigrants; no matter how we call
them, they suffer from the same disease: poverty , hunger, isolation and
scorn.

Among His most important concerns is the welfare of the poor and
dispossessed. Half the world´s populations enter this category and
present an enormous challenge to the goodwill of men. The Mahdi (Pbuh)
or Saviour of the world will inspire the goodwill that will put an end
to injustice and corruption.

Slowly, people will become aware that to share the resources of the
world is in their own best interests and will willingly accept the need.
This will end the suffering of the poor.

"Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?" He said to
him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all
your soul, and with all your mind." This is the greatest and first
commandment. And a second is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as
yourself." On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."
(42)

Are we moving forward towards the Mahdi (Pbuh) or Saviour of the World
most important concern?
