A Word from the Translator
==========================

I dedicate my efforts to those tiny tots who can’t sleep without a story
from their parents

This book also provides good ideas to parents on upbringing of their
children, with family values and morals.

Special thanks to my father, without whose encouragement, I wouldn’t
have succeeded, and to whom I owe more than just this book.
