The present book is a series of lectures delivered at the Makerere

respected Chief Missionary of Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania, Sayyid
Saâ€™eed Akhtar Rizvi.

This edition has been revised by the author and is distributed to

The first edition of this book was published in 1967 by the Federation
of Khoja Shia Ithna-Asheri Jamaats of Africa, Mombasa (Kenya). Prior to
that, it was published as a pamphlet in Dar-es-Salaam (Tanzania), and as
a booklet in Manchester (U.K.).

The unique aspect of this book is its intensive subject matter presented
in a very lucid way that includes such important subject on Principles
of Religion as tawhid or belief in Divine Unity; \`adl or Divine
Justice; nubuwwah or Prophecy; imamah or the Imamate, belief in the
Imams as successors of the Prophet; ma'ad or Resurrection.

In view of this, World Organization for Islamic Services has translated
this book into French, Italian, Indonesian, Burmese and Hawsa languages;
and has distributed them to more than eighty countries of the world.

Scholars and intellectuals striving for truth can greatly increase their
knowledge by studying this book.

We feel it necessary to extend our thanks and a deep sense of
appreciation to the author for his efforts, and to Bilal Muslim Mission,
the first publishers of this book.

Lastly, we pray to the Almighty Allah, for the success and achievement
of all people who search for the truth and strive for reality.
