Introduction
============

In the name of the Almighty the Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Praise
be to God, the Lord of the Worlds.

The Muslims were never at any time more in need of mutual understanding
and unity than they are today. The conspiracies against Islam never were
more serious than they are at the present time.

Unfortunately, many Muslim governments have taken a very unholy
direction, spreading hatred among Muslims. Unsound and erroneous books
and pamphlets were, and still are, distributed among the Muslims,
telling lies and hurling numerous accusations against the Shiite Muslims
while the latter were seemingly unaware of those accusations.
During the centuries following the birth of Islam, many accusations
were made to disgrace the followers of the members of the House of the
Prophet. However, they never took the shape of the serious and malicious
campaign that has taken place during the last six years.

This false and malicious campaign started after the birth of the
Islamic Republic in Iran. It seems that some of the Arab governments
found the birth of this Republic a threatening danger. This Republic
reminds Muslims of the period of the righteous caliphate and makes a
clear distinction between the words and the deeds of the Arab
governments who claim to be committed to Islam, yet spend the public
wealth to satisfy the low desires of the rulers.
These governments tried to extinguish the light of the Islamic Republic
by war, but they did not succeed. Therefore, they are trying to deceive
the Muslim population and turn them against the Iranian Muslims by
fapicating accusations in a sectarian campaign, aiming to convince the
innocent Muslims that the Shiites have deviated from the path of Islam.
Should such a campaign succeed, unsuspecting and unsophisticated Muslims
may find it religiously legal to combat the Shiites and shed the blood
of the Iranians, who have sacrificed for Islam more than any other
people.

The Shi'ites have tried for many years to meet this campaign with
silence, closing their eyes and hoping that it would come to an end, and
that there would be no need to refute the malicious accusations.

It was also hoped that some of the Sunni scholars would try to refute
these accusations. There is no doubt that many Sunni scholars are aware
of the Islamic doctrines to which the Shi'ites subscribe. Should they be
unaware of the Shi'ite doctrines, it would be very easy to become
acquainted with them. There are numerous books written by Shi'ite
scholars about those doctrines, and those books are available.

It is possible for the Sunni scholars to call for an Islamic conference
in which religious differences may be discussed and an appreciation for
each other's viewpoint developed. This is what the Qur'an calls for:

"O you who believe, if a transgressor pings to you news, verify it,
lest you inflict damage on people unwittingly; you may consequently
regret your hasty action." (ch. 49, v.6)

It is regrettable that the Sunni scholars did not move in this
direction and did not try, as far as is known, to refute the untrue
accusations which were publicized by the hypocrite campaigners.

Our silence did not stop this campaign. It made it more vehement. Many
people thought that our silence is evidence of the truthfulness of the
accusations, and that we are unable to answer them.
Thus, it has become necessary to clarify the truth and inform all the
Muslims who like to know the truth. In this effort, we shall not accuse
the Sunni pothers of disbelief, deviation, or transgression, as some of
them have accused the Shiites. We shall not place ourselves in such a
position, which is improper for any Muslim to take. We obey the Almighty
in His prohibition:

"O you who believe, let not a folk ridicule another folk who may be
better than they are; nor should women ridicule other women who may be
better than them. Neither defame one another nor insult one another by
calling names. That is the name of lewdness after faith and whoso turns
not in repentance, such are evildoers." (ch. 49, v.11)

It should be pointed out to the reader that those who make these
prohibited accusations use a very strange method to indict millions of
Muslims whom they do not know, did not see, and with whom they did not
speak. They tried and convicted millions of Muslims who lived centuries
ago, along with the numerous future Shi'ite generations yet to be born.
They have also convicted millions of contemporary Muslims without
questioning them and without searching for the truth, which is within
easy access to any interested person.
