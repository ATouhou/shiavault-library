Her Manner of Objection:
========================

She is in a special situation in which she cannot take up arms;
therefore, she has to demonstrate her wrath and objection through tongue
and negative campaign. Besides, she knew that swearing does not heal
sorrows, and even it does not deserve her esteem. Therefore, she must
speak, criticize, shout, and rebel.

She spoke against Abubakr in the Mosque, gathered the women of Mohajerin
(the Emigrants) and Ansar (the Helpers) and revealed all the secrets.
She went to the doors of the Prophet’s companions, described and
embodied the future status of Omma, tried to make them move, and asked
them to administer justice, etc.

But in regard to the negative campaign, she made the most of the
opportunities, because she knew that the star of fortune may appear one
time in life and afterwards, may never appear. Therefore, she benefited
the different methods for this campaign.

Although she could speak, sometimes, she expressed her wrath through
silence. She even was about to make use of her death against oppression.
She recommended that her corpse be buried at night, lest Caliphs
participate in her funeral ceremony and say prayer for her.

By means of her historic will, she showed her dissatisfaction towards
the Caliphs transgression. And it must be stated that everybody both
friends and foes knew that Fatima’s dissatisfaction is the
dissatisfaction of Allah and His Prophet (peace be upon him and his
descendants).
