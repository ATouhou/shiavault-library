19. Worship in Looking
======================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ رَسُولُ اللٌّهِ (ص): نَظَرُ الْوَلَدِ إِلَى وَالِدَيْهِ حُبّاً
لَهُمَا عِبَادَةٌ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his family) has said: “The
look of a child towards his parents out of love for them is an act of
worship.”
