The Arrival of Bin Ziad’s Messenger to Medina:
==============================================

Bin Ziad had dispatched his messenger, Abdu Al-Malik Bin Abi Al-Hareth
Al-Selmy, to Amro Bin Saeid Bin Al-Ass who was the governor of Medina to
deliver the good news about the demise of Imam Hussain (Q).

So he entered the house of Amro Bin Saeid, and Amro said: "what’s behind
you?"

Abdu Al-Malek said: "May the prince be pleased, indeed Al-Hussain Bin
Ali was killed.

Amro, may Allah curse him, said: "This is a catastrophe just like the
catastrophe of Uthman Bin Affan!"

Then Amro Bin Saeid climbed up the rostrum and spoke to the people and
informed them of what happened. Thus the calamity of Bani Hashim was
greater, and then they performed the customs for such catastrophes and
funerals.
