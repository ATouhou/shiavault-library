Faith supports and strengthens reason
=====================================

With disbelief, reason loses its power and sharpness and may fail to
discover or acknowledge even trivial facts. Disbelievers are like those
who walk in darkness and do not know which path they have taken:

“***God is the guardian of those who believe. He brings them out of the
darkness into the light; and (as to) those who disbelieve, their
guardians are Satans who take them out of light into the darkness…”***
26

That is to say, they do not know about their world and their purpose of
life. They have no insight about reality. In Islamic thinking, two kinds
of guidance must be distinguished: primary or inclusive guidance and
secondary or exclusive guidance. The former is for all humans, with
which mankind potentially might acquire and obtain some initial
knowledge about the world and its creator and the need for prophecy and
religion. The latter is only for believers. The Qur'an says:

***“Surely (as for) those who believe and do well, their Lord will guide
them by their faith.” (10:9)***

***“Those who guided, We will add their guidance.” (47:17)*** 27

Reason after faith is different from reason before faith. Faith helps
reason to have complete function. Faith without reason is blind and
reason without faith is crippled and barren. Faith opens for reason
realms other than worldly life and reason makes grounds for true belief
and faith.
