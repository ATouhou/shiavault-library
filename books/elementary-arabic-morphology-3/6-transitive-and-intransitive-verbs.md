29. How can a transitive verb be made intransitive?

26. A transitive verb is a verb who, in addition to its agent, occurs on
an objective compliment, for example: **بَرَیتُ القَلَمَ.** An
intransitive verb only occurs with an agent, for example: **أثمَرَتِ
الشَّجَرَةُ.** The transitive verb is connected to its objective
compliment with preposition or without a preposition but an intransitive
verb suffices itself with its agent.

27. A verb intransitive if it denotes a natural characteristic as in
**شَجُعَ,** a form as in **طالَ,** a color as in **زَرِقَ,** a defect as
in **عَوِرَ,** a decoration as in **غَیِدَ,** being clean as in
**طَهُرَ,** Being unclean as in **قَذُرَ,** being secluded as in
**فَرَغَ,** being full as in **شَبِعَ,** and different natural states
such as **مَرِضَ.**

28. An intransitive verb is made transitive by adding a *hamza* to the
beginning of the word, for example: **أکرَمَ,** or doubling the second
root letter, for example: **کَرَّمَ,** or by a *jār* preposition, for
example: **رَغِبتُ في العلمِ.**

29. A transitive verb is made intransitive if it is put in the forms of
mutawa'ah, for example: **جمَّعتُهُ** **فَتَجَمَّعَ.**
