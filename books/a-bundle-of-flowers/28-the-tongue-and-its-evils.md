The Tongue and Its Evils
========================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Affliction caused by the tongue is worse
than (that caused by) the strike of the blade of a sword."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 71, p. 286

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Among all things, the tongue deserves to be
prisoned longer than anything else." (Because most of our sins are
committed by it, such as backbiting, telling lies, defaming, mocking,
insulting, etc.)

Bihar-ul-Anwar vol. 71, p. 277

Imam Amir-ul-Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) said: "Do contemplate before speaking
so that you may guard yourself from (committing) errs."

Ghurar-ul-Hikam, p. 228

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "The destruction of man lies in three
(things): his stomach, his lusts, and his tongue."

Waqayi'-ul-'Ayyam, p. 297

Imam al-Baqir, the fifth Imam, (‘a) said: "No one is safe from sins
unless the one controls his/her tongue."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 78, p. 178
