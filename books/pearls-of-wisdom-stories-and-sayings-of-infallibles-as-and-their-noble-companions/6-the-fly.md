The Fly
=======

It was an Abbasid court, with all the splendor. Mansoor was the King.
Just as Mansoor was attending the business to state, a small fly sat on
his nose. With a wave of his hand, he whisked it off. But the fly sat on
his nose again. This continued till at last Mansoor felt greatly
disturbed.

Turning to Imam Ja’far as Sadiq (as), who was present that day, he said:
O Son of the Prophet, peace be upon him, can you tell me why Allah
created these lousy flies?

“Yes”, the Imam, said: “So that the mighty and the proud are rendered
humble and helpless.”

From *Unto Thee I Grant...*
