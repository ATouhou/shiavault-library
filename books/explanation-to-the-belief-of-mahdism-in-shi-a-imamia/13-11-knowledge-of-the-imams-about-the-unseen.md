11. Knowledge of the Imams about the unseen
===========================================

Sometimes even among Shia people misunderstanding the Imams have
emerged. Their ignorance acquits them of their mischief but cannot
prevent its effects that remain. They knew nothing about the status of
an Imam. Since they knew nothing, to have them comment on the status of
the Imams would be an absurdity. Therefore the Sixth Imam, Jaâ€™far Sadiq,
distanced himself from such people. Mohammad Bin Abi Zainab known as
Abul Khattab is one of them.

He has written what mostly disturbed Imam Sadiq. When one quotes such
people, or their writings, as the writer has, it would have been wiser
for him to check things out more thoroughly. The Imam of his time has
cursed such narrators and they lose their authenticity.

When they are void of any credibility then the problem that points to
them for solution holds no water. The knowledge of the unseen is Divine.
The Prophet (S) and the Imams were Divine figures holding the Divine
office. Knowledge of God is this quality.

Knowledge to the quality, of the quality, as ancient as the entity of
God is to be immediate or direct without the need of a media, to be
infinite and stintless, and to be the absolute is a subject which cannot
be dealt here; but the Prophet (S), Ali Bin Abi Talib and his sons the
Imams wore all gifted with such knowledge which others were not
acquainted with. A rotating chain of the sayings of the Prophet (S)
support this.
