For the Sake of Fulfilling the Intellectual Originality
=======================================================

It is not easy for one who wishes to learn and read or anyone who
tries, intensively, to obtain ideas and knowledge to achieve, for
himself, the ideological originality of Islam through throngs of
civilizational and intellectual accumulations and theses that books
overflow with, as well as, being broadcasted by non-Muslim propaganda
and the publishing media, and other schools, parties and movements.

Many of these people face a danger of intellectual confusion and
disorder; particularly a person who obtains knowledge by means of
self-education and not from the efficient hands of abiding Muslim
teachers or from pure original sources; but, he can obtain all thoughts
and concepts from any source as correct, knowledgeable and scientific
axioms.

Surely, this style of acquiring knowledge has many dangers to cultural
and intellectual originality, as well as, purity. Therefore, it is
imposed as a duty upon everyone who undertakes research and strives to
obtain thought, knowledge and culture to be more vigilant against
falling into the traps of schemes and intellectual poison which are
broadcasted by non-Muslim ideological foundations and sources.

The following fundamental principles can fulfill the intellectual
originality and protect the comprehension, as well as, thought from
danger of deviation and disorder:

1. To start believing in the existence of Islamic ideological schools
and, the independent, Muslim, cultural personality. This principle lets
Muslim Thought and view progress, which is distinguised from other
opinions, when he reads and studies or researches in any field of
thought and culture.

2. A Muslim must start, when he wants to form an Islamic culture and
knowledge with the original Muslim Thought and culture in order to make,
for himself, the rules and starting points; equally the intellectual and
fundamental criteria that can enable him to keep its ideological and
cultural originality.

3. To be critical and careful of what he reads and learns in order to
be more rational in his learning of thought and knowledge, besides being
established on rules and intellectual original criteria to be able, in
the light of the rules, Islamic fundamentals and criteria, to put to
trial all thoughts and views; via refusing anything except those that
harmonize, perfectly, with his Islamic belief and principles.

By this, the researcher can accomplish, for himself, the ideological
originality and purity.

6. Ability of Growth and Fertility:

The history of Islamic Thought and civilization, besides the history of
human thought have admitted this excellent fact: We will be able to
realize this fertile attribute and ability of development and
contribution through Islamic Thought if we understand that the endless
source of this thought is Allah's Book and revelation; which was
revealed to a teacher of human beings and a guide to humanity; that is,
Allah's Apostle Muhammad (a.s.)

It is a fact that all sciences and knowledge which are produced by
Islamic Thought are attributed to the Holy Qur'an, because it is the
origin, spring and the standard of their adjustment and commitment.

If we study and analyze this scientific structure of Islamic Thought
with its all-inclusive sciences of interpretation, religious
jurisprudence and fundamentals, as well as, psychology, ethics, history,
sociology and theories of politics, economics and other knowledge, we
will see an objective and intellectual phenomenon of multiplication, as
well as, the continuous fertility and growth attribute; similarly, the
power on contributing, confronting and protecting the heritage and
covering a person's need through their intellectual extensions and
social (objective) expanse.

Of course, the secret behind that growth of Islamic Thought is hidden
in several reasons; the most important are as follows:

1. Generality of rules and intellectual principles, besides their
scientific enrichment.

2. Islam gives free permission to the diligence process and is
satisfied with any average which results from it to the benefit of Islam
and regards it as an Islamic doctrine, and trend, as well as, it can
form the intellectual extension for fundamentals and Islamic rules as
long as it is in keeping with the commitment and acts, in accordance
with the right method of understanding, styles and education.

3. Islam gives its full attention to making life more developed and
flourished, besides its vocation to useful movements and to stir the
mind through its flat refusal of immobilization and stoppage.

So, all these elements, together, have granted Islamic Thought that
power and movable contribution, for there is no longer any problem that
Islamic Thought may still suffer from; the one that other positive
theories and principles have endured; those that deal with their
sterility and incapable power of contributing and growing due to their
narrow horizons and limited view.

Meanwhile, the contrary is true, about the deep-rooted fertility and
ability in Islamic Thought to occupy the intellectual and social
movement widely and deeply. In fact, the enrichment of Islamic rules and
fundamentals that the Qur'an and Sunnah include, besides their capacity
of having an endless storage of ideas and concepts, is the essential
material of that growth and contribution in Islamic Thought and its
power of being able to cover great areas of a person's activity and his
life's growth.

If the Islamic mission does not admit that the mind has a role and that
it urges one to think, speculate and deduce, as well as, its given
authority to diligence and the education process taken from rules,
fundamentals and principal sources (i.e., Qur'an and Sunnah), the
Islamic Thought and Muslim thinker will have no chance to go further in
his activity of trying to cover every aspect, matter and problem that
may face a person in the fields of belief, thinking, legislation or
system of life. So, the thinker and Muslim researcher has found,
beforehand, a prime intellectual material and legal authorization in
researching and deducing outcomes which are added to Islam at the time
when the thinker faces problems of the mind or civilizational and social
matters.

7. Unity and Association:

The Islamic Thought is distinguished by its set of principles which
form an integral and constructional union that effects and completes
each other; as an instance, the philosophy of morals with their values
included which connects, firmly, with the belief of Oneness and Allah's
attributes; moreover, it is affected by them. These morals and their
values have an influence on the systematic lawful field; over and above
the economic side and is connected and affected by the thought of
worship.

The concept of worship is a spirit that runs through every activity or
thinking that is performed by human beings, due to Islamic rules. So, it
is impossible to dissociate between various aspects of thought and the
ranges of its areas with regard to the theoretical and practical side.

For instance, a talent for moral justice that Islam has called for with
regard to a rule in human behaviour, as well as, a talent has an active
influence on a person's social and political conduct; furthermore, to
his relation with his family members and society. The association and
interaction between worship and the morality of generosity, mercy and
economic planning that appears clearly in the duty of paying alms
(zakat) which is obligatory in Islam to be given by Muslims.

And so, this characteristic of unity and association in Islamic Thought
has taken part in the field of preparation in applying and making a
suitable climate for commitment. Each side will provide the space and
make human beings ready to accept the next one, as well as, help it to
be more progressive.

Morals and piety, for instance, can make the economic and political
system, as well as, social relations, more successful. Moreover, the
belief in Allah and the next world will prepare human beings to hold law
in high esteem and stay aloof from crimes and disobedience.

As a result of this, we can see the association and integration;
equally, mutual affection among all different fields of thought. Praise
be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
