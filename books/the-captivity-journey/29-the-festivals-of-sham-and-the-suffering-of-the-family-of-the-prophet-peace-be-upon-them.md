The Festivals of Sham and the Suffering of the Family of the Prophet (peace be upon them)
=========================================================================================

The Sham Regions:

The Sham is a name that includes most of the regions that are nowadays
part of Lebanon, Syria and Palestine. As the Sham was the first region
that the Prophet (P) had thought of to spread the word of monotheism and
to invite the people to Islam. The Prophet had prepared many troops and
battles for that purpose. During his last days, he prepared an army and
appointed Osama Bin Zayd as the army commander and said: "Allah shall
curse whoever does not join Osama’s army…" The objective of the Prophet
was not to widen his geographical governing area, but that was something
that needed to be done to spread monotheism, have people revolve around
the banner of Islam, and to guide the people to Allah the Almighty. But
things had changed after the death of the Prophet (P), and the
measurements were turned upside down. Life had seduced lots of people,
where profits, temporal positions, gaining authority and influence
became the main objectives to conquer new countries.

Thus, after the Muslims had conquered it (the Sham), Omar appointed
Yazeed Bin Abi Soufian as its ruler, after him came his brother Muawiya
Bin Abi Soufian. In the year 41 the people of Sham pledged allegiance to
him as the new Calif.

He was the founder of the Umayyad Regime that made Damascus the center
for the Islamic civilization. It stayed that way till year 132 A.H., and
Muawiya appointed Yazeed as his successor by inheritance.
