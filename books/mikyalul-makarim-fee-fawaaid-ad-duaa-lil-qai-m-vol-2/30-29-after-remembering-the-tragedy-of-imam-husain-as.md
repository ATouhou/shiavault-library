29. After Remembering The Tragedy Of Imam Husain (As)
=====================================================

Surely this is a way of helping him, as will be discussed in its proper
place. This is supported by the narration of some of the righteous
people who saw Imam az-Zaman (aj) in dream while he was saying, ‘Surely
I will pray for the believer who remembers the difficulties of my
ancestor, Imam Husain (as), and follows it with supplicating for my
reappearance and assisting me (in my task).’
