How Martyrdom healed divisions
==============================

When we invite strangers or guests and make them free of our family
circle, that means the greatest outflowing of our hearts to them. The
events that I am going to describe refer to some of the most touching
incidents of our domestic history in their spiritual aspect. We ask our
brethren of other faiths to come, and share with us some of the thoughts
which are called forth by this event. As a matter of fact all students
of history are aware that the horrors that are connected with the great
event of Karbala’ did more than anything else to unite together the
various contending factions which had unfortunately appeared at that
early stage of Muslim history. You know the old Persian saying applied
to the Prophet:

*Tu barae wasl kardan amadi;*

*Ni barae fasl kardan amadi.*

“Thou camest to the world to unite, not to divide.”

That was wonderfully exemplified by the sorrows and sufferings and
finally the martyrdom of Imam Husayn.
