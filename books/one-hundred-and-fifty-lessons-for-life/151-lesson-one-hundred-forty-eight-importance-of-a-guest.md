Lesson One Hundred Forty Eight: Importance of A Guest
=====================================================

The Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اِذا اَرادَ اللّهُ بِقَوْم خَيْراً أَهْدَى اِلَيْهِمْ هَدِيَّةً.
قالُوا وَ ما تِلْكَ الْهَدِيَّة؟ قالَ: اَلضَّيْفُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

When God wills happiness and prosperity for a nation, he will bestow on
them a gift. They asked: ‘what is that gift’. He replied: a ‘guest’.
[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

That is true. Guest is a gift from God, a valuable and honorable gift.
However, material world in which all affections are lost, has no value
for a guest. It treats him as troublesome and strange and unwelcome. So
it rarely happens that someone invites another or gets invited unless
there is a selfish reason relating to business or wealth or politics.

In Islamic countries and families in which religious customs are still
alive, a guest is honored and respected as a divine gift notwithstanding
the absence of family relationship or any ulterior motives.
