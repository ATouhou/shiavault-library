Question 85: What is The Ruling about Sports like Boxing?
=========================================================

**Question:** Are sports like boxing etc. are haraam in Islam or not?
And also those who take it up as a profession and work for it, what is
the position of this action of theirs? Is it permitted?

**Answer:** Basically all those games and physical exercises are
permitted that are beneficial to the health and do not cause any danger
provided they are not connected to the illegal acts.

Because every dangerous act by which there is a danger to himself or
some other person is prohibited from the Islamic point of view and the
game of boxing is not without any risk.

Therefore we must refrain from these games. And we all know many young
people have lost their lives in boxing and many lives have been lost. On
the basis there is no harm if one participates or works for the games
which are beneficial to the people and society in general. Other than
this all games are illegal.Therefore we must refrain from these games.
