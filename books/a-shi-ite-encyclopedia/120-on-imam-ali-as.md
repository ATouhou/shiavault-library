On Imam ‘Ali (as)
=================

Kufa was now the seat of the Islamic rule. The entire Muslim world with
the exception of Damascus looked towards Kufa for guidance. They
travelled to Kufa often.

Two men were in each other’s company on the road to Kufa. One was a
muslim and the other was a non muslim. As they progressed, the non
muslim traveller asked his companion:

I am going further than Kufa, to a small village where I live. Where are
You going?

His muslim companion said:

I live in Kufa

They proclaimed happily, discussing various things, helping each other,
all in a spirit of cordiality. When they drew near to Kufa, the non
muslim took a side road towards his village. Just as he was about to bid
farewell, he observed that his muslim companion was coming with him.

Didn't you tell me that You are going to Kufa where You lived?

The muslim replied:

Yes of course

On this the non muslim inquired

Then why were you coming this way? That is the only road leading to
Kufa?

I know, said the muslim, But we have long been companions. Our Prophet
(S) said that when two are companions to each other on a journey they
have obligations and duties towards each other. You gave me company and
now it is my duty to follow You a few steps and then make a gentle
departure.

No wonder that Your Prophet (S) managed to spread his faith so quickly.
His (S) teachings were indeed great.

And then it so happened that once the same non muslim entered Kufa.
There he found that his muslim companion had been none other but the
Khalifa of his time, ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (as). He soon became a muslim
and remained the most faithful of companion of the Imam.

To judge Your own souls before the time of judging of your action
arrives. Make an assessment of Yourself before You are called upon to
account for Your conduct in this existence.

Imam ‘Ali (as)
