Foreword
========

It is not strange to raise the question of how can one make simpler a
complex subject such as the science of*kalaam* or (scholastic theology)?
This is what we have set out to do. In this booklet we have attempted to
make the subject accessible as well as seeking to be as concise as
possible.

This booklet is not only introduces the science of*kalaam* to the reader
but attempts to answer the questions on the subject as well. As such,
questions like what is exactly the science of*kalaam* ? What is it
trying to achieve? What does it deal with? Why is it called by this
name? And how did it come into existence? are questions that the booklet
will attempt to examine.

However, the final say is that of the reader.
