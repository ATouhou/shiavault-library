The Slaughter of a Baby Most Revered Ali Asghar (â€˜a)
====================================================

("Banu ke sheerquar ko haftum se pyaas hai")

Banu's son has had no water for days

His pulse is weak and his mother prays

No hope in sight of getting water or milk

Helpless, she lingers by his cradle in a daze

"Pray tell me, what shall I do now Ya Husain?

The baby's eyes now roll back in pain"

"Oh Ya Ali, Ya Ali where can I go?

I cannot watch my baby suffer so

How do I find a way to make him lives

Ya Ali he needs water, that I cannot give"

" Last night I saw him open his eyes

But today he lays still, doesn't move, doesn't cry"

Then everyone said, "Lets call the Imam

For God's sake somebody, go get the Imam

The baby is dying, go tell the Imam

His face is blue, his body calm"

"Taking Alder's body to lay it to rest

The Imam is on his way, with grief beset"

His face stained with the blood of His 18 year old

The Imam entered, His head bowed

And everyone led Him to the baby's crib

And showed Him the baby's still fingers and toes

"He barely breathes Oh Noble Prince" they cried

"Sometimes you would think he had already died"

At the head of the crib, the Prince knelt down

in the baby's ear He whispered, head bowed

Hearing the Prince's voice, the baby smiled

Toward Husain he extended his arms and glowed

"It's a miracle my father," Sakina cried

"Oh mother, my brother has opened his eyes"

The baby in His arms, the Prince left the camp

And Death followed, eyeing them askance

To shelter her baby from the midday sun

The mother draped a sheet over the Imam's arms

Holding Asghar close, Husain walked, head bowed

in the arms of the heavens, a snow white cloud

As He neared the lowly enemy, Husain paused

Couldn't ask for water, couldn't utter the words

with embarrassment He paled and His body tensed

So He removed the sheet from the baby's face

Head bowed, he said, "I've brought my son to you

Seeking water Asghar now has come to you"

Then He kissed His baby's parched lips and looked

And whispered "My son I've said what I could

There is nothing else to say now Oh my son

maybe you can show them your dry, parched tongue"

And the baby obeyed, licked his lips dry

And Husain shuddered and looked up to the skies

And as Husain looked to the heavens so

The cursed Hurmula strung an arrow in his bow

And aimed the arrow at Asghar's throat

Pulling taut the bow, let the arrow go

As the tiny neck the arrow gashed

Asghar lurched and clung to his dad

A six month baby and an arrows force

Blood poured from the tiny, thirsty throat

Once more he lurched and then went still

His cap fell to the ground and he breathed his last

The tiny fists curled over his chest, body numb

A minute ago he was sucking his thumbs

And the desolate Father, watched His son

saw the devastation the enemy's arrow had done

And watched the baby in the throes of death

The tiny hands groping at the injured neck

The lifeless eyes rolling back in the head

Blood gushing forth from the battered neck

Gently pulling out the arrow from the neck

Husain lifted His son toward the heaven and said

"My God please accept my last sacrifice

For your cause, in your path, my son is now dead"

"Little in age but magnanimous in deeds

Thus are the children of Allah's creed"
