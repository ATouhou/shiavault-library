مَنْ ساءَ خُلْقُهُ عَذَّبَ نَفْسَهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

One who is ill-humored torments himself.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

It is usually said that ill-humored individuals who are peevish with
everybody, torment and annoy their friends and relatives, while they
themselves suffer the greatest torments because they embitter life’s
honey and make pure water unpleasant for themselves.

Ill-humored people have a short life and an uneasy spirit, their body is
in pain, and are prone to more sufferings than others.

Good temper is one of the qualities which Islam has emphatically
recommended to its followers . It has been referred to as an important
factor for attainment of the eternal paradise.
