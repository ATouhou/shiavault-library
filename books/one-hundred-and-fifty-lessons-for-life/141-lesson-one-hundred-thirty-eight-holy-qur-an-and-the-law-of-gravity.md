Lesson One Hundred Thirty Eight: Holy Qur’an And The Law Of Gravity
===================================================================

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) said to one of his companions:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلَيْسَ اللّهُ يَقُولُ بِغَيْرِ عَمَد تَرَوْنَها فَقُلْتُ: بَلى قالَ:
ثُمَّ عَمَدٌ، لكِنْ، لاتَرَوْنَها!
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Does God not say that heaven is erected upon an invisible pillar? I
said: yes. He said: so there is an invisible pillar that you do not see
. [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Nowadays, it has been proved that celestial bodies are fixed in their
circuits thanks to the balance of gravity and repulsive forces. Gravity
attracts them towards each other like a great chain, and repulsive force
separates them from each other and their complete balance enables them
to revolve in their circuit without any change and deviation, suspended
in the immense space on this invisible pillar. Was there any
interpretation more eloquent than the above for expressing this reality
in that time when these mysteries were not yet solved? And isn’t this
one of the scientific miracles of our great leaders.
