Responsibility 44: Making Others Cry for the Imam
=================================================

The believers should make others cry due to the separation with the Imam
or because of the difficulties which the Imam and his pure fore-fathers
had to endure of course, this should be done in accordance with ones’
ability.

It must be noted that this responsibility must only be carried out
through the means permitted by the faith. By this we mean that one must
enact this responsibility through recalling the authentic traditions
which recount the trials and tribulations which the Ahlul Bayt (as) went
through.

Thus, a believer must not make others cry by lying or changing the
history of what the Infallibles went through as it is not permitted to
make up historical narrations simply to make people cry as this is not
what Allah  and the pure and infallible family of the Prophet want from
us.

Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad as-Sadiq (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ مَنْ بَكـى أَوْ أَبْكَـى وَاحِداً فَلَهُ الْجَنَّةُ وَ مَنْ
تَبَاكَـى فَلَهُ الْجَنَّةُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“A person who cries or makes one other person cry will be granted
Paradise and even a person who pretends to cry (if he cannot cry) will
also be granted Paradise.”[^1]
