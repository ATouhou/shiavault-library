Marriage
========

Issue 451: If someone fears that he/she will fall into sin because of
not being married; for example he/she will look at a Non-Mahram, then it
is Wajib for them to get married.

Issue 452: In marriage, a specific formula must be recited, and it is
not sufficient that the boy and girl are content with each other or even
love each other. Due to this, until the formula (for marriage) has been
recited, both of them are not Mahram to each other, and as for the other
women (in her family), there are no relations for them to be considered
as Mahram.

Issue 453: If even one letter is pronounced incorrectly in the marriage
formula such that it changes the meaning, then the marriage formula (and
marriage) are void.
