Lowering the Gaze and Guarding the Modesty
==========================================

Allah (s.w.t.) said:

***"Tell the believing men to cast down their looks and guard their
private parts, that is purer for them, surely Allah is well acquainted
with what they do."*** ***Sura An-Nur, No. 24, verse 30***

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "An unlawful look (at na-mahram) is an arrow
from the arrows of Satan which is poisonous. He who abandons it for the
sake of Allah, Almighty and Glorious, and not for something else,
consequently, Allah will give him a Faith that he finds its pleasure (in
his self)."

Man La Yahduruhul Faqih, vol. 4, p. 18

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "The fornication of the eyes is the intercourse
of unlawful (lustful) looks, the fornication of the lips is a forbidden
kiss (of na-mahram), and the fornication of the hands is touching (hands
or other limbs of a na-mahram), whether the response of the genital
affirm it or disaffirms it ."

Al-Kafi, vol. 5, p. 559

Imam al-Baqir (‘a) said: "The Holy Prophet (S) cursed the man who looks
at the private part of a woman who is not lawful to him, and also the
man proves treacherous to his religious brother's wife, and also the man
that people need his help (because of his position) but he asks for a
bribe from them."

Al-Kafi, vol. 5, p. 559
