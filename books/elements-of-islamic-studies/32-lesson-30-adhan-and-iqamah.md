Lesson 30: Adhan and Iqamah
===========================

The saying of *Adhan* and *Iqamah* before starting daily prayers is
greatly rewardable. These are given below.

Adhan
-----

*Allahu Akbar* (4 times) (Allah is the Greatest).  
*Ash-hadu an la ilaaha illal Laah* (twice) (I bear witness that there is
no God but Allah).  
*Ash-hadu anna Muham-madan Rasoolul-Laah* (twice) (I bear witness that
Muhammad is  
 the Apostle of Allah) .  
*\*Ash-hadu anna Ameeral Mu’mineen Ali-yan hujjatul-Lah* (twice) (I bear
witness that the  
 Commander of the Faithful, Ali is the hujjat of Allah).  
 \* These words should be said not as a part of adhan but for barakat
only.  
*Hayya ‘alas-Salaah* (twice) (Hasten to prayer).  
*Hayya ‘alal falaah* (twice) (Hasten to success).  
*Hayya ‘ala khayril ‘amal* (twice) (Hasten to the best deed).  
*Al-lahu Akbar* (twice) (Allah is the Greatest}.  
*Laa ilaaha illal-Lah* (twice)  
 (There is no god but Allah).

Iqamah
------

There is a little difference between *Adhaan* and *Iqamah*. While saying
*Iqamah*, the words  
 "*Allahu Akbar*" at the beginning are to be repeated twice. The words
"*Qad Qamatis salah'*  
 (Indeed the prayer has begun) are to be added after the words "*hayya
‘ala khayril ‘amal*"  
 and repeated twice and "*laa ilaaha illal Laah*" at the end is to be
said only once.
