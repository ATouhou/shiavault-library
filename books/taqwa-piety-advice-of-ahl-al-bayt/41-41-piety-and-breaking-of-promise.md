41) Piety and Breaking of Promise
=================================

One of the issues in which man should observe Taqwa is promise,
agreement, and covenant.

God says: ***“Surely the vilest of animals in Allah’s sight are those
who disbelieve, then they would not believe. Those with whom you make an
agreement, then they break their*** ***agreement every time and they do
not guard (against punishment).”***[^1]

[^1]: Qur'an, 8;55-56.
