Divorce
=======

1201. A man who divorces his wife must be adult sane, and should
divorce of his own free will, therefore, if someone compels him to
divorce his wife, that divorce will be void. It is also necessary that a
man seriously intends to divorce; therefore, if he pronounces the
formule of divorce jokingly, the divorce will not be valid.

1202. It is necessary that at the time of divorce, wife is pure
(Naqiyyah) from Hayd and Nifas, and that the husband should not have had
sexual intercourse with her during that per iod of purity.

1203. It is valid to divorce a woman even if she is in Haydh or Nifas
in the following circumstances:

(i) If the husband has not had sexual intercourse with her after
marriage.

(ii) If it is known that she is pregnant. And if this fact is not known
and the husband divorces her during Haydh, and he comes to know later
that she was pregnant, that divorce will be void.

(iii) If due to the husband's absence or imprisonment, he is not able
to ascertain whether or not she is pure from Haydh or Nifas. But in this
case, as an olbigatory precaution, man must wait for at least one month
after separation from his wife and then divorce.

1204. If a man wishes to divorce his wife who does not menstruate at
all by habit, or because of some disease or suckling a child or taking
drug etc., while other women of her age habitually see Haydh, he should
refrain from having sexual intercourse with her for three months from
the time has had the intercourse, and then divorce her.

1205. It is necessary that the formule of divorce is pronounced in
correct Arabic, using the word I\`àliq; and two just (Adil) persons
should hear it. If the husband wishes to pronounce the formula of
divorce hinself and his wife's name is, for example, Fatimah, he should
say, Zawjati Fatimah I\`àliq (i.e. my wife Fatimah is divorced) and if
he appoints another person as his Wakil to pronounce the formula of
divorce, the Wakil should say, Zawjatu woman is identified, it is not
necessary to mention her name; and if she is present it is enough to
point to her and say, Hadhiht I\`àliq or say facing her, Anti I\`àliq.
And if the husband cannot pronounce divorce in Arabic, or cannot find a
Wakil to do so, he can divorce in any language using the words of the
same meaning as in Arabic formula.

1206. There is no divorce in the case of a woman with whom temporary
marriage is contracted, for example, for one month or one year. She
becomes free when the period of her marriage expires or when the mam
forgoes the perid of her marriage by saying, I hereby exempt you from
the remaining time of marriage, and it is not necessary to have a
witness nor that the woman should be pure from her Haydh.

**Iddah of Divorce (The Waiting Period after Divorce)**

1207. A wife who is under nine and who is in her menopause will not be
required to observe any waiting period. It means that, even if the
husband has had sexual intercourse with her, she can remarry immediately
after being divorced.

1208. If a wife who has complated nine years of her age and is not in
menopause, is divorced by her husband after sexual intercourse, it is
necessary for her to observe the waiting period of divorce. the waiting
period of a free woman is that after her husband divorces her during her
purity period she should wait till she sees H “ayd “twice and be comes
pure if the time between two menses is less than three months.
Thereafter, as soon as she sees Hayd for the third will be over and she
can marry again. If, however, a husband divorces his wife before having
sexual intercourse with her, there is no waiting period for her and she
can marry another man immediately after being divorced, except if some
semen of her husband in any way has entered into her vagina, in which
case she should observe Iddah.

1209. If a woman does not see Haydh or menstruates but the period
between two menses is three months or more who normally see Hayd, and
her husband divorces her after sexual intercourse, she should observe
Iddah for three lunar months after divorce.

1210. If a woman whose Iddah is of three months, is divorced on the
first of a lunar month, she should observe Iddah for three lunar months,
that is, for three months from the time the new moon is sighted. And if
she is divorced during the month, she should observe Iddah for the
remaining days in the month added to two months thereafter, and again
for the balance from the fourth month so as to complete three months.
For example, if she is divorced on the 20th of the month at the time of
sunset and that month is of 30 days, she should observe Iddah till the
sunset of 20th of the fourth month, and if that month is of 29 days she
should, as an obligatory precaution, observe Iddah for nine days of that
month and the two months following it, and for twenty one days of the
fourth month so that the total number of the days of the first month and
the fourth month comes to thirty.

1211. If a pregnant woman is divorced, her Iddah lasts till the bieth
or miscarriage of the child. Hence, if, for example, she gives birth to
a child one hour after being divorced, her Iddah is over. But this is in
the case of a legitimate child of the husband who is divorcing. If the
pregnancy is illegitimate, and her husband divorces her, the Iddah will
not be over.

1212. If a woman who has completed nine years of age, and is not in
menopause, contracts a temporary marriage, for example, if she marries a
man for a period of one month or a year, and the period of her marriage
comes to an end, or her husband exempts her from the remaining period,
she should observe Iddah, providing that the husband has had sexual
intercourse with her. If she sees Haydh, she should, as a precaution,
observe Iddah for two periods of Haydh and not marry again during that
period. But if she does not see Haydh, then she should refrain from
marrying another man for forty five days. And if she is pregnant, she
should observe Iddah till the birth or miscarriage of the child, and as
a recommended precaution, she should wait for forty five days or till
the birth of the child whichever is longer.

1213. The time of the Iddah of divorce commences when the formula of
divorce is pronounced, irrespective of whether the wife known about it
or not. Hence, if she comes to know after the end of the Iddah that she
had been divorced, it is not necessary for her to observe Iddah again.

**Iddah (Waiting Period) of a Widow**

1214. If a woman is free and is not pregnant and her husband dies, she
should observe Iddah (the waiting period) for four lunar months and ten
days, that is, she should not marry during that period even if she under
nine or has entered into menopause or his husband had contracted
temporary marriage with her, or she is Kafir or is in Iddah for
revocable divorce or he may not have sexual intercourse with her and
even if her husbandhas been insane or a child. If, however, she is
pregnant, she should observe the waiting period till the birth of the
child. But if the child is born before the end of four months and ten
days from the death of her husband, she should wait till the expiry of
that period. This Iddah is called the waiting period after death
(Iddah-ul-wafat).

1215. It is Halal (allowed) for a woman who is observing the Iddah of
death to wear pightly coloured dresses, or to use collyrium and to do
any such act which is considered to be an adornment, but going out of
the house is not Halal (allowed).

1216. The Iddah of death begins, in situation when the husband has
disappeared or is absent, when the wife learns of his death, and not
from the time when he actually died. But this rule does not, as a
precaution, apply to a wife who has not attained the age of Bulugh, or
if she is insane.

1217. If a woman says that her Iddah is over, her word can be accepted
unless she is known to be unreliable, in which case, her word, as a
precaution, will not be accepted. For example, if she claims to have
menstruted three times in one month, her claim will not be trusted,
except when her woman relatives confirm that it is her menstrual
period.

**Irrevocable and Revocable Divorce**

1218. Irrevocable (Ba'in) divorce means that after the divorce, the
husband is not entitled to take back his wife, that is, he is not
entitled to take her as his wife without Nikàa\*. This divorce is of six
kinds, namely:

(i) The divorce of a woman who has not completed nine years of age.
(ii) The divorce of a woman who is in menopause.
(iii) The divorce of a woman whose husband has not had sexual
intercourse with her after their marriage.
(iv) The third divorce of a woman who has been divorced three times.
(v) The divorce called Khul and Mubàràt.
(vi) The divorce by intervention of Mujtahid, in the case of a wife
whose husband neither agrees to maintain her nor to divorce her.

Rules pertaining to these kinds of divorces will be detailed later.
Divorces other than these are revocable (Raji), in the sense that as
long as wife is observing Iddah her husband can take her back.

1219. When a person has given revocable divorce to his wife, if is
Halal (allowed) for him to expel her out of the house in which she was
residing at the time of divorce. However, in certain cases, like, when
she has committed fornication or adultery there is no harm in expelling
her. Also, it is Halal (allowed) for the wife to go out of the house
unnecessarily, without her husband's permission. And it is obligatory
for the man to give her maintenance during the Iddah.

**Orders Regarding Return (Ruju)**

1220. In the case of a revocable divorce a man can take back his wife
in two ways:

(i) By telling her words which would mean that he wants her again as
his wife.

(ii) By acting in a manner which would convey his intention to take her
back.

And taking her back will be established by sexual intercourse although
the husband may not have intended to return, and some jurisprudents
believe that even touching or kissing, with or without intention of
taking her back establishes the return, though this is not free from
Ishkal, and as an obligatory precaution, he should divorce her again, if
he does not wish to return.

1221. It is not necessary for taking her back that the husband should
call any person to witness, or sholud inform his wife. In other words if
he takes her back without any one else realising this, the Ruju is in
order. However, if the husband claims after the completion of Iddah that
he took his wife back during Iddah but the woman does not confirms it,
he must prove it.

1222. If a man divorces a woman twice and takes her back, or divorces
her twice and takes her back by Nikàa\*, or takes her back after one
divorce and returns her by Nikah after the second divrce, she becomes
Haram for him after the third divorce. But if she marries another man
after the third divorce, she becomesHalal (allowed) for the first
husband on fulfilment of five conditions, that is, only then he can
remarry her.

(i) The marriage with the second person should have been of permanent
nature. If he contracts with the her a temporary marriage for one month
or a year, and then separates from her, the first husband cannot marry
her.

(ii) The second husband should have had sexual intercourse with her,
and the obligatory precaution is that the sexual intercourse should have
taken place in vagina.
(iii) The second husband divorces her, or dies.
(iv) The waiting period (Iddah) of divorce or Iddah of death of the
second husband should have come to an end.
(v) On the basis of obligaotry precaution the second husband should
have been Bàligh at the time of intercourse.

**Khul Divorce or Talaq-ul-Khul**

1223. The divorce of a wife who develops an aversion from husband and
hates him, and surrenders to him her Mahr or some of her property so
that he may divorce her, is called Khul divorce. The hatred must have
reached a proportion where she would not allow him conjugal rights.

1224. If the husband himself wishes to pronounce the formule of the
divorce and his wife's name is, say, Fatimah, he should say afetr
receiving the property, Zawjati Fatimatu Khala tuha ala ma badhalat, and
should also say as a recommended precaution, Hiya I\`àlaq; i.e. I have
given Khul divorce to my wife Fatimah in lieu of what she has given me,
and she is free. And if the wife is identified, it is not necessary to
mention her name in I\`àliq-ul-Khul and also in Mubàràt divorce.

1225. If a woman appoints a person as her representative to surrender
her Mahr to her husband, and the husband, too, appoints the same person
as his representative to divorce his wife, and if, for instance, the
name of the husband is Mua\*ammad and the name of the wife is Fatimah,
the representative will pronounce the formula of divorce thus: An
muwakkilati Fatimah badhaltu mahraha li-muwaakkili nuh ammad, li-yakhla
‘aha ‘alayh. Then he says immediately: Zawjatu muwakkili khala tuha ala
ma badhalat, fa hiya I\`àliq. And if a woman appoints a person as her
representative to give something other than Mahr to her husband, so that
he may divorce her, the representative should utter the name of that
thing instead of the word Mahraha’ (her Mahr). For example, if the woman
gives $100 he should say, bedhaltu mi'ata dular.

**Mubàràt Divorce**

1226. If the husband and the wife develop mutual aversion and hatred
and the woman gives some property to the man so that he may divorce her,
this divorce is called Mubàràt.

1227. If the husband wishes to pronounce the formula of Mubàràt, and
for example, his wife's name is Fatimah he hsould say, Bara'tu zawjati
Fatimata ala ma badhalat. And as an obligatory precaution, he must add,
Fa-hiya I\`àliq; that is, my wife Fatimah and I separate from each other
in consideration of what she has given me, hence, she is free. And if he
appoints someone as his representative, the representative should say,
An qibali muwakkili bara'tu zawjatahu Fatimata ala ma badhalat, fa-hiya
I\`àliq. And in either case, if he says, bima badhalat, instead of the
words ala ma badhalat, there is no harm in it.

1228. It is necessary that the formula of Khul or Mubàràt divorce is
pronounced in correct Arabic, if possible. And if that is not possible,
then the rule explained in 1215 will apply. However, if for the sake of
giving her property, the wife says in English or any language that, I
give you such and such property in lieu of divorce, it will be
sufficient.

1229. If during the waiting period of khul or Mubàràt divorce the wife
changes her mind and does not give her property to the husband, he can
take her back as a wife without Nikàa\*.

1230. The property which the husband takes in Mubàràt divorce should
not exceed the Mahr of the wife, and even as an obligatory precaution it
should be less than the Mahr. But in the case of Khul divorce, there is
no harm if it exceeds her Mahr.

**Various Rules Regarding Divorce**

1231. If a man had sexual intercourse with a non-Mahram woman under the
impression that she was his wife, the woman should observe Iddah
irrespective of whether she knew that the man was not her husband or
thought that perhapse he was her husband.

1232. If a man commits fornication with a woman knowing that she is not
his wife, it is not necessary for the woman to observe ‘Iddah. But if
she thou ght that the man was probably her hus band, as an obligatory
precaution, she should obsrve ‘Iddah.

1233. If a man seduces a woman so that her husband decides to divorce
her and then she can marry him, the divorce and marriage are in order,
but both of them have committed a major sin.

1234. If a woman lays a condition at the time of Nikàa\* that if her
husband goes on a long journey or in prison or, for example, does not
give her maintenance for six months, she will have the right of divorce,
the condition is void. However, if she lays a condition that in some
conditions or in any case, she will be his Wakil for her own divorce,
the condition is in order, and thereafter the husband cannot stop her
Wikalah, and if she divorces her, the divorce will be in order.

1235. A woman who is divorced revocably, is his husband’s lawful wife
before completion of her ‘Iddah. Hennce, she should not refrain any
sexuel treating by her Husband, and it is permissible and even
recommended to adorn herse if for him, and it is not permissible for her
to go out of the house without his permission, and if she is not
disobedient, giving her maintenance is obligatory on her husband.

Kafan and Zakat-ul-fitrah of the woman should also be given by the
husband, and after death of either of them, they inherit from each
other. Also the man cannot marry her sister during the ‘Iddah.
