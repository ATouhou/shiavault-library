Lesson Twenty Three: The Most Severe Punishment
===============================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam ((peace be upon him and his progeny)) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"أَشَدُّ النّاسِ عَذَاباً فِى الْقِيامَةِ عَالِمٌ لَمْ يَعْمَلْ
بِعِلْمِهِ وَ لَمْ يَنْفَعْهُ عِلْمُهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

One who knows something and does not observe it, and does not use his
knowledge, his punishment in the hereafter would be the most severe
.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

In Islam, knowledge is always regarded as a tool for practical
application and for improving the life of an individual and the society.
Otherwise it has no value.

Those who commit a sin unknowingly carry a lesser responsibility than
those who do so with knowledge. The responsibility to enlighten others
in the society is also proportionate to the degree of one’s knowledge.
