Service to Humanity
===================

It is one of the basic commandments of Islam that we should help and
serve others. This is what we have been ordered by Allah and His Prophet
to do, and this is what we have been taught by our Imams. It is our duty
to help a person who is in difficulty, whether he be a Muslim or a
non-Muslim.

One day, a friend of Imam al-Sadiq (a) came from some other place to see
him in Madina, where the Imam was then staying. In the course of
conversation, he said to the Imam, “O' Holy Imam! Some nomads are
staying in our town. They come around every now and then and seek help.
Unfortunately, they are not Muslims. Should we help them?”

The Imam replied, “It is our duty to help every needy person. It makes
no difference whether he is a Muslim or a non-Muslim

Islam considers those rich persons to be virtuous who meet all financial
obligations consisting of zakat and rights of the relatives, beggars and
the needy.

As and when Imam Ali (a) appointed anyone to the governorship of a
province, he used to give the man a number of instructions. One of those
instructions was this:

“Always give people their rights, whether they be Muslims or
unbelievers. If they are Muslims, they are your brethren in-faith and
even if they are not Muslims, they are your fellow beings”.

It is our duty to help every needy person.

**Questions**

1. Is it the duty of Muslims to help the needy even if they are
non-Muslims?

2. What instructions did Imam Ali (a) give to the governors regarding
human rights?
