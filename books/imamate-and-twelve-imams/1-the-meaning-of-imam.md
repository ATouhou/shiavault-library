The Meaning of Imam
===================

Imam or leader is the title given to a person who takes the lead in a
community in a particular social movement or political ideology or
scientific or religious form of thought. Naturally, because of his
relation to the people he leads, he must conform his actions to their
capabilities in both important and secondary matters.

As is clear from the preceding chapters, the sacred religion of Islam
takes into consideration and gives directives concerning all aspects of
the life of all men. It investigates human life from the spiritual point
of view and guides man accordingly, and it intervenes on the plane of
formal and material existence from the point of view of the life of the
individual. In the same way it intervenes on the plane of social life
and its regulation (i.e., on the plane of government).

Thus the imamate and religious leadership in Islam may be studied from
three different perspectives: from the perspective of Islamic
government, of Islamic sciences and injunctions, and of leadership and
innovative guidance in the spiritual life. Shi'ism believes that since
Islamic society is in dire need of guidance in each of these three
aspects, the person who occupies the function of giving that guidance
and is the leader of the community in these areas of religious concern
must be appointed by God and the Prophet. Naturally, the Prophet himself
was also appointed by Divine Command.
