When Will the Qaem of Your Progeny Arise ?
==========================================

He (S.A.W.S.) had replied,"His likeness is to the Hour (Quiyamat),
'.....none but He shall manifest it at its time; it will be momentous in
the heavens and the earth; it will not come on you but of a sudden'."
(Sura Araf 7 : 187)(Kamaaluddin vol.2 Pg.372-373, Faraidus Simtain
vol.2. Pg.337-338. Al Fusool al Mohimma Pg. 250-251)

Universal Government Of Imam Mahdi (A.S.)Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said,
"My Caliphs are my legatees and the proofs of Allah upon the creatures,
after me they are twelve. The first of them is my brother and the last
of them is my (grand) son"He was asked, "0 Prophet of Allah, which
brother of yours"He replied, "Ali Ibn Abu Talib"Again he was asked, "And
which Son?"He said,"Al Mahdi is the one who will fill the earth with
justice and equity just like it had been filled with injustice and
tyranny. I swear by the one who has sent me as the giver of good
tidings, even is a single day remains for the world (to end), Allah
shall prolong that day till he sends (to it) my son Mahdi. Then Ruhullah
(spirit) Isa ibne Maryam will descend and perform prayers behind him.
The earth shall be illuminated by his radiance and his authority shall
stretch from the east to the west."(Faraidus Simtam vol.2 Pg.312)

**Merits Of The Rule Of Imam Mahdi (A.S.)**

Amirul Momineen Ali (A.S.) said,"He will direct desires towards (the
path of) guidance while people will have turned guidance towards
desires, and he will turn their views to the direction of the Quran
while the people will have turned the Quran to their views."(Nahjut
Balagha, sermon no, 138) According to the submission of Ibne Abil Hadid,
this saying refers to Hazrat Mahdi (A.S.) (Sharhe Nafyul Balagha vol.9.
Pg.40) Imam Jafar as-Sadiq (A.S.) said,"When the Qaem shall arise, he
will rule with justice, the tyrants of his time shall fear him, the
righteous will be safe, the earth shall reveal its treasures, all the
truth-seekers will seek his company and no follower of any religion
would remain except that they see Islam and declare their faith in
it."(Kashful Ghumma vol.3. Pg.255)

Imam Raza (A.S.) said,

"The fourth of my descendants is the son of the chaste maid. Allah
shall purify the earth from every atrocity through him and rid it of
every injustice. He is the one whose birth shall be doubted. He will
have an occupation before his reappearance. When he reappears, the earth
will light up with his brilliance. And he will establish the scales of
justice among the people. Then, (among men), one will not oppress the
other."(Faraidus Simtain vol.2. Pg.336)
