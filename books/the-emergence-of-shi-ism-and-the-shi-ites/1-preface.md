**In The Name of Allah the All Merciful**

*Imam Ali Foundation* has published books and book translations of high
quality concerning many subjects, especially regarding a wider
understanding of Islam both in its dogmatic and legal aspects.

*Dear Reader,* the book which you have in your hands treats a most
important topic regarding the relation between the ideological and the
theological realms in Islam. It concerns theories of the Caliphate and
the Imamate in Islam and especially the historical development of
Shi'ism, which insists upon a strict observance of Koranic and prophetic
texts in everyday life.

The first text represents the inspired thought of the martyr Sayyed
Mohammad Baqir As-Sadr, who was highly reputed for the intellectual
quality, scientific value and objectivity of his works. Dr. Abdul Jabbar
Chararah has been given the great distinction, and privilege, to
annotate this work and to present it here, in order to facilitate its
access to the public.
