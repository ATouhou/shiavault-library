Supplement 1
============

Abu Shakir replied: "I am not yet convinced. I am in a quandary. I am
full of doubts and misgivings about my faith and my convictions."

Imam Ja'far Sadiq (p.b.u.h.) remarked: "The doubt about idol worship is
the beginning of the worship of Allah."

**Another conversation**

An atheist professor of philosophy speaks to his class on the problem
science has with God, The Almighty.

He asks one of his new students to stand and...

Prof: So you believe in God?
Student: Absolutely, sir.
Prof: Is God good?
Student: Sure.
Prof: Is God all-powerful?
Student: Yes.

Prof: My brother died of cancer even though he prayed to God to heal
him. Most of us would attempt to help others who are ill. But God
didn't. How is this God good then? Hmm?

Student: Silent.

Prof: You can't answer, can you? Let's start again, young fellow. Is
God good?

Student: Yes.
Prof: Is Satan good?
Student: No.
Prof: Where does Satan come from?
Student: Silent.
Prof: Tell me son, is there evil in this world?

Student: Yes.
Prof: Evil is everywhere, isn't it?

Student: Yes.
Prof: So who created evil?
Student: Silent.
Prof: Is there sickness, Immorality, Hatred, Ugliness? All these
terrible things exist in the world, don't they?
Student: Yes, sir.
Prof: So, who created them?
Student: Silent.

Prof: Science says you have 5 senses you use to identify and observe
the world around you. Tell me, son...have you ever seen God?

Student: No, sir.
Prof: Tell us if you have ever heard your God?

Student: No, sir.
Prof: Have you ever felt your God, tasted your God, smelt your God?
Have you ever had any sensory perception of God for that matter?

Student: No, sir. I'm afraid I haven't.
Prof: Yet you still believe in Him?

Student: Yes!

Prof: According to empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science
says your GOD doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son? Student:
Nothing. I only have my faith.

Prof: Yes. Faith. And that is the problem science has.

Student: Professor, is there such a thing as heat?

Prof: Yes.

Student: And is there such a thing as cold?

Prof: Yes.

Student: No sir. There isn't. (The lecture theatre becomes very quiet
with this turn of events.)

Student: Sir, you can have lots of heat, even more heat, superheat,
mega heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat.

But we don't have anything called cold. We can hit 458 degrees below
zero which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is
no such thing as cold. Cold is only a word we use to describe the
absence of heat. We can not measure cold. Heat is energy. Cold is not
the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it. (There is pin-drop
silence in the lecture theatre.)

Student: What about darkness, Professor? Is there such a thing as
darkness? Prof: Yes. What is night if there isn't darkness?

Student: You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is the absence of something.
You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light...
But if you have no light constantly, you have nothing and its called
darkness, isn't it? In reality, darkness isn't. If it were you would be
able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you? Prof: So what is the point
you are making, young man?

Student: Sir, my point is your philosophical premise is flawed. Prof:
Flawed? Can you explain how? Student: Sir, you are working on the
premise of duality. You argue there is life and then there is death, a
good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something
finite, something we can measure. Sir, science can't even explain a
thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much
less fully understood, either one. To view death as the opposite of life
is to be ignorant of the fact that death can not exist as a substantive
thing. Death is not the opposite of life: just the absence of it.

Now tell me, Professor. Do you teach your students that they evolved
from a monkey? Prof: If you are referring to the natural evolutionary
process, yes, of course, I do.

Student: Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir? (The
Professor shakes his head with a smile, beginning to realize where the
argument is going.) Student: Since no one has ever observed the process
of evolution at work and can not even prove that this process is an
on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you not a
scientist but a preacher? (The class is in uproar.)

Student: Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the Professor's
brain? (The class breaks out into laughter!)

Student: Is there anyone here who has ever heard the Professor's brain,
felt it, touched or smelt it? No one appears to have done so. So,
according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable
protocol, science says that you have no brain, sir. With all due
respect, sir, how do we then trust your lectures, sir? (The room is
silent. The professor stares at the student, his face unfathomable.)

Prof: I guess you'll have to take them on faith, son.

Student: That is it sir... The link between man and God is FAITH. That
is all that keeps things moving and alive.


**God Is Everywhere**

A father has three sons. One day he brought candy for his sons. His
sons became happy and thank him for bringing the candy for them.

The father gave each of his three sons some candy. Actually father
wanted to test the boys. So he put one condition before handing the
candy. I want you to eat the candy in a place where you can't be seen.

That seems easy for boys, because they knew great places to hide. The
eldest brother ran to his room. He hid under his bed. And said: No one
can see me eat under here.

The next brother dashed to the secret tree house. He shut the door and
windows. And said: I can't be seen now.

The youngest brother hid in his best hiding place; behind the couch.
And said: No one ever sees me when I hide here. But something is not
quite right this time. So he went and hid in his closet to make sure the
dark. Again here also something is not quite right.

He sat in the dark garage for twenty two minutes. But this time he is
definitely sure that something is not quite right and it is not working.
Later the family sat for the dinner. Father asked the boys: so tell me,
did you all find a place to eat the candy without being seen. Eldest
brother replied: Yes dad, under my bed. Next brother said: I ate in the
secret tree house.

Father turned to the youngest child and asked: What about you?

Youngest child replied: Well dad, I tried so many places, but in the
end I didn't eat the candy. Why not asked the father. Because you told
us to eat the candy where we couldn't be seen, but I keep thinking God
can see me wherever I am.

The boy has passed the test. God is everywhere. Well done my son, you
are right. There was nowhere to eat the candy without being seen by
Almighty God.
