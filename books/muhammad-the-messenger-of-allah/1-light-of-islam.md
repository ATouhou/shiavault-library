Light of Islam
==============

In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful.

"...and giving good tidings of a Messenger who will come after me,
whose name shall be Ahmad;..."

Holy Qur'an (61:6)

"And from among you there should be a group inviting to good and
bidding what is right and forbidding what is wrong,..."

Holy Qur'an (3:104)

**PUBLISHER'S WORD**

Praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds, and peace and blessings of
Allah on Muhammad, his infallible household and on the pious ones among
his companions.

Al-Balagh Foundation has, since its establishment, tried to shoulder
the heavy responsibility of disseminating Islamic knowledge among the
world people irrespective of race, religion, language or colour, by
relying on Allah, the Most High and Great. In order to convey Islam's
ideas to as many people as possible, our foundation has chosen to put
before them Islamic concepts in an easy-to-read and simplified way
through various series of books.

The study of the life of Muhammad (s.a.w.) and the Imams of his
Household is an advanced means of Islam to introduce its objectives and
great concepts.

How truthful are the words of Allah:

"Certainly you have in the Messenger of Allah an excellent
exmplar..."

Holy Qur'an (33:21)

"...Allah only wishes to keep away uncleanness from you, O people of
the House and purify you (with) a thorough purification."

Holy Qur'an (33:33)

In view of this, Al-Balagh Foundation has decided to publish a new
series of book on the life and teachings of Prophet Muhammad, his
daughter Fatimah, and twelve Imams who succeeded him beginning from Imam
Ali to the last luminary Imam Al-Mahdi (a.s.) -may Allah hasten his
reappearance. The lives of these 14 infallibles and the lofty principles
they uphold, provide model par excellence for all time. They were
torchbearers of guidance, the spring of flowing wisdom, the paragons of
perfection and the live paradigms of the divine message.

May Allah guide mankind on the right path, and help the ummah to
sincerely tread the footsteps of His last Messenger (s.a.w.) and his
blessed progeny.

He is the All-hearing and All-answering.

Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds.

**INTRODUCTION**

Abridging the life of the Messenger of Allah Muhammad bin Abdullah
(s.a.w.) in a small book is by no means an easy task, for his life is,
actually spread over thick volumes than can never be condensed to a few
pages. The life of the chosen Prophet of Allah (s.a.w.) is great,
dazzling and matchless. In it converges the manifestations of victory
and strength, submission and piety, ups and downs, heroism and pains.

Concisely, in part one of this book, the reader will be acquainted with
the life of the great Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.) at Mecca, both before
being chosen to prophethood and after. In part two we will shed light on
the Prophet's life at Medinah where he managed the Muslims' political
and social affairs and laid the foundations of the first Islamic state.
There his life took a new turn as he and his followers had to engage in
military struggle with the idolators. In part three we will study the
glorious personality of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.), his social
life, his traditions, his life among the members of his family and the
ummah as well as the legacy of his dynamic thought.

In addition, we will also throw light on the principles of Islamic
state as established by the Prophet (s.a.w.), the outlining of its
dimensions in the Holy Qur'an, the community its characteristics and its
objectives. How did the Prophet of Allah treat the foes of the divine
Message? How did he wage his wars? When did he make truce with his
enemies? All the answers will be presented in this book. We have
attempted only to review the main points in his blessed life in plain
words.

Our goal is to show the life of the Prophet (s.a.w.) especially to the
youth, so as to acquaint them with the character of the Prophet
(s.a.w.), his activities and attitudes before the call to prophethood
and afterwards. The reader will get insight into his life, his call
towards Allah and the state which he set up.

Al-Balagh Foundation by presenting this study on the life of Holy
Prophet hopes to serve the interests of our dear readers.

To Allah we look for success and help.
