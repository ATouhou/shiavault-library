About the Book
==============

Relation of this Book to Seyed Ibn Tâwûs Seyed Ibn Tâwûs has considered
this book as his work in Iqbâl; and Kashful Muhajjah. He says in Kashful
Muhajjah: The book Al- Malhoof ala qatlat Tufoof which has been written
about the martyrdom of Hussain (a.s.) contains wonderful things in its
arrangement and composition, and it was the Grace of Allâh that enabled
me to write it.

In his book Ijazat, as mentioned in Bihar 42/107, he says: I have
compiled the book Al-Malhoof ala qatlat Tufoof in such a manner which,
as far as I know, nobody has adopted and whoever has knowledge about
this book can understand these words. Among the proofs of the relation
of this book with the Seyed, is that the name of the writer of the book
is mentioned in the Preface of the same book. Moreover, everyone who is
acquainted with the type of writing of Seyed can understand that this
book is his work.

The author, at the end of this book, says: Anyone who is aware of the
brevity and concisenes of this book knows that it is distinct from
similar ones. Shaykh Tehrâni, in Zariah 18/389, No: 576, 22/223 and
Brockleman, under 1/912 Sh 15, have said that this book is a work of the
Seyed.

Eton Kulburk, in his writing, says that this book is of Seyed Ibne
Tâwûs. "Al-Malhoof is the best of Seyed Tâwûs? works." He says: This
book has been printed several times and also translated into Persian. He
says: The book Lohoof contains quotations of the original events related
to the tragedy of Karbala and subsequent happenings. He has brought many
narrations from unknown narrators, which began to be read in ?shura.
Kulburk describes: One of the books of Seyed is Al-Masra Sheen fee
qatlal Husain and this has not been mentioned at any place and the only
proof thereof is that its handwritten manuscript is available in the
Leiden library under registration No: 792.

He enumerates doubts and compares Al-Masra sheen and Maqtal, which has
been attributed to Abi Makhnaf and says that it is possible that both
might have existed at a time. Eton Kulburk believes that it is probable
that Seyed Ibne Tâwûs had relied on Maqtal of Abi Makhnaf and has made
additions to it, arranged it and gave it the title of Al-Masra Sheen.

On this ground, the printed Maqtal, which has been attributed to Abi
Makhnaf, is the same book, which the Seyed compiled and expanded.

It is said: Al-Masra Sheen and Lohoof are two books. Though there are
instances to show that there is similarity between the two. According to
writing, Eton has referred to Seyed Ibn Tâwûs 76-78. Shaykh Muhammad bin
?le Yasin, in his writing from Ibne Tâwûs, attributes this book to Seyed
Tâwûs saying that it has been published several times in Iran and Najaf.
Anyhow, undoubtedly, Malhoof is written by Seyed, and that it is other
than Al-Masra'Sheen, which he took from Maqtal of Abi Makhnaf. Though
there is similarity between them.

**Name of the book**

This book is known by several names and all of them with the difference
in prints return to the compiler because the compiler has chosen various
names or one name with variances. The names of such books, which are
mentioned in scripts and in sources, are like this:

1. Al-Lohoof ala qatlat tafoof
2. Al-Malhoof ala qatli Tafoof
3. Al-Malhoof ala qatlat tafoof
4. Al-Lohoof fee qatli at-tafoof
5. Al-Malhoof ala ahlit tafoof

6. Al-Masâlik fi Maqtalul Hussain (a.s.), as it is mentioned on the
title page of the copy "R", on the ground that, Ibne Tâwûs says in the
preface: and I have prepared it in three styles.

Shaykh Tehrâni, in Zariah, 22/223, considers Al- Malhoof ala qatlat
tafoof as "the most famous." We have chosen the name Al-Malhoof ala
qatlal tafoof on the basis of the reliable copy "R" as the same title is
seen in Kashful Mahajja: 194 and Ijâzate Bihâr and in other books.

**Our Style in this book**

Our aim behind the research on this book is to present the original
text without any errors and for attaining this aim our reliance has been
on the below mentioned copies:

A: The copy in Razaviya library in Mashhad, No: 15317 along with the
book Ad-durrus Sameen and the copy inscribed by Abul Hasan Isfahâni in
the year 1117 which we have indicated this by the 'R' sign. B: Whatever
Majlisi has mentioned in Bihar from Malhoof and he has brought most of
the content of the book in Bihar, we have marked it "B?. C: The printed
copy printed at Haideria Press, Najaf in 1369 A.H. indicated by sign
"A?. We have used it sparingly.

We have followed the original wordings and texts but most of the
differences have appeared in the explanatory notes in the margin. The
second stage of our research has been the quoting of the statements
found in this book. While verituing these statements with the
authoritive and historical sources, we have come across this difficulty
that the statements in the said reliable copies also have been altered
and changed. Thus, we have verified them with the true authoritive books
and corrected them a brief note of which we have brought in the margin
so that the reader by studying it, may get the maximum awareness of the
event of Kerbala. In case of some of the translations we have relied on
Kitâbul Elâm by Khairuddin Zarkali and Hâshiya Alâm an Nubla and some
other books also.

We have also quoted brief translations from other books in our text.

Short notes of information about cities and areas have been furnished
so that the reader can also be fully aware, from the beginning to the
end of the event of Kerbala, from geographic viewpoint too. And Praise
is for Allâh the Lord of the Worlds. The holy city of Qum 3rd Shabân-141
A.H.
