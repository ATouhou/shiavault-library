97: Power (qadr)
================

These 5 Meccan verses were revealed after He Frowned! 80 and before The
Sun 91. This chapter is thus one of the first to be revealed.

The Night of Power \` refers to one of the last ten days during the
month of Ramadan, when the Qur'an was first sent down to Muhammad. This
passage might be compared with 24:v for a similar hymn to God's power or
glory, as this is manifested in His light.
