Lesson Seventy One: Hastiness And Precipitance
==============================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلْحِدَّهُ نَوْعٌ مِنَ الْجُنُونِ لاِنَّ صاحِبَها يَنْدَمُ فَإنّ لَمْ
يَنْدَمْ فَجُنُونُها مُسْتَحْكَمٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Hastiness and precipitance is a kind of insanity and those having this
attribute repent of their actions very soon, or (if they continue on
this path) it shows that their insanity is perpetual and firmly
ingrained in them.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Intellect and wisdom dictate that one avoids undue haste and
precipitance because in this condition one often fails to adequately
study all the relevant aspects to make a correct decision. And soon one
has to repent for the consequences of his naive and impulsive actions.

Sometimes, man dissipates the worth of all of his good speeches by one
hasty inappropriate remark, and loses his old intimate friends and that
jolts him into sincere repentance .

As for those who do not desist even after observing the bad consequences
of their hasty actions, they can be said to suffer from insanity that is
ongoing and well entrenched.
