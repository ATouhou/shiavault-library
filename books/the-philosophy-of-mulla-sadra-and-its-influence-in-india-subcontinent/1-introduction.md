[Introduction]
==============

Sadruddin al-Shirazi, or Mulla Sadra (1571-1640), is perhaps the
singlemost important philosopher in the Muslim world in the last 400
years. The author of over 40 works, he was the central figure of the
major revival of philosophy in Iran in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. Devoting himself almost exclusively to metaphysics he
constructed a critical philosophy which brought together Peripatetic
(*mashsha'i* ), Illuminationist (*ishraqi* ) and Gnostic (*'irfan* )
philosophy along with Shi'ite theology (*kalam* ) within the compass of
what he termed a 'metaphilosophy' or Transcendental Wisdom (*alhikma*
*al-muta'aliya* ), the source of which lay in the Islamic revelation and
the mystical experience of reality as existence. It was as a result of
this philosophy that Mulla Sadra came to be popularly known as*Sadr
al-muta allihin* (the foremost of the transcendental philosophers).

In this paper an attempt is made to analyse the philosophy of this
notable Shi'ite philosopher and the response which it received in India,
where he came to be regarded both as a votary of reason and as a
logician within the realm of Muslim theology.
