Lesson 12 : Anger and Its Control
=================================

Have you ever seen someone in a state of total rage? Did you notice
that the colour of his face changed, his whole body trembled and he most
probably lost control of himself, shouting things that made no sense. He
might have reminded you of a mad man.

A person in this state cannot listen to reason, he is unable to
distinguish between truth and falsehood. He acts without thinking and is
fuelled by an urge to destroy and hurt all around him which explains why
he may insult the people who try to help him or even throw and break
anything he can get his hands on.

When he has vented his anger, he will feel tired and as he gradually
comes back to his senses, shame for his beastly actions will wash over
him. Such is the destructive force of anger.

Anger is an inherent quality in all human beings. It is a weapon
provided by nature to be used in danger when guarding oneself from the
enemy. It can be a useful tool to make sure that others do not think us
weak and easily taken advantage of.

However, misused, anger can turn into uncontrollable rage, and provoke
an individual to acts that he would never consider under normal
circumstances.

One might argue that anger is not in our power to control and an
involuntary reaction. This would be wrong. Anger is within a person's
control. It only requires effort and practice to learn how to rein it.By
cultivating and strengthening one's will power, one can learn to control
one's anger and to deal with issues rationally and constructively.

The aim is to keep calm when we face any personal attacks and to save
our anger only for the defense of Islam. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) was
never seen to lose his temper for worldly or personal reasons but when
the truth was hidden or violated, he would show his anger in such a
manner that nobody would be able to oppose him.

We mostly tend to become angry over worldly issues. We get upset over
the smallest things. We should make every effort to control our anger or
swallow our temper. It may be difficult at first to distance ourselves
in the middle of a crisis and contemplate the issues at hand but it gets
easier with practice and the positive results we derives from such
action will definitely be worth the effort.

The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) has said, " Whoever can swallow his anger,
most surely Allah (S.W.T.) will fill his heart with peace and faith."
The Muslims at the time of the Prophet (s.a.w.w.) and Aimmah (a.s.) knew
the great emphasis placed on control of ones anger by Islam and they
strived to achieve this state. We can see their admirable will
throughout history. Let us look at just one story and try to learn from
it.

**A MAN OF STRENGTH**

A tall and masculine man was passing through the market. He was wearing
a long robe of modest cloth and had a piece of the same material as his
turban. One of his eyes was injured, probably in a battle.

As he walked past the stalls, a group of men noticed him. One of them,
having nothing better to do, decided to provide amusement for his
friends. He picked up some grass and threw it at the man, calling out in
a mocking tone. His friends laughed at this scene.

The man however, did not react. He brushed the grass off his clothes
and walked away calmly. When he was out of hearing, an old man who had
witnessed the entire incident walked up the group and asked them, "Do
you know who that was?"

The youth who had thrown the grass replied: "No, but what does it
matter who he was? He couldn't even stand up for himself! What a
coward!"

The old man looked at him in surprise, "The man you have insulted is
Malike- Ashtar! He is the Commander-in-Chief of the army of Imam Ali
(a.s.) and the most powerful man in these times. Haven't you heard about
his courage in battles? Even the most powerful enemies of Islam shake in
awe and fear him."

The ignorant man's face turned pale and he began to tremble. "O God!"
he exclaimed. "Malike-Ashtar! What a fool I was to behave that way! I
have destroyed my reputation and my self. I had better go and apologize
before I have to face the consequences!"

He ran in the direction Malike-Ashtar had taken and finally found him
praying in the mosque. He stood in the corner, hanging his head in shame
and waited for him to finish his prayers.

As soon as Malike-Ashtar completed his salaat, the man went near him
and greeted him. He then apologized profusely and asked him to forgive
his rudeness.

Malike-Ashtar looked at the man said him, "It is true that your actions
made me angry but as soon as I took a glance at your face when you threw
the grass on my face, I realized that you acted out of ignorance. For
that reason, I controlled my anger and remained calm. I forgave you with
all my heart immediately. After that, I came straight to the mosque to
pray to Allah (S.W.T.) to guide and forgive you. Be assured that I have
already forgiven you, and I seek no revenge from you. My advice to you
is that from now on, do not do such a thing to anyone."

Malike-Ashtar continued, "What is the difference between an old dress
and a new one, good quality of fabric or a low one, a black person or a
white one, ugly or beautiful?

"All are equal in the eyes of the Lord, except in regards to their
taqwa and good deeds. We are all servants of the Almighty. Allah
(S.W.T.) has told us to refrain from insulting one another. We may not
always be able to fully control our anger but it is possible to succeed
more often than not."

This story about Malike-Ashtar teaches us many lessons. It shows us
that when we are faced with ignorance, we must not let anger affect the
manner in which we deal with it. Malik also shows us that the
controlling of anger is only the first step. It is our duty to also pray
for the person who angered us and seek Allah (S.W.T.)'s forgiveness for
him. Finally, if the person who wronged us comes to us with an apology,
we must accept it unhesitatingly and never make him feel more ashamed
than he already is.

According to the traditions of Prophet Isa (a.s.) he was once asked,
"What is the most fierce punishment on the Day of Judgment?"

He replied, " The anger of Allah (S.W.T.)" His disciples then asked
him, "What can one do to be safe from this?"

Prophet Isa (a.s.) told them, "Control his anger, so that he be saved
from the wrath of God on that Day."

A Holy Verse Allah (S.W.T.) reminds all Believers in Qur'an, " Those
who spend (benevolently) in ease as well as in difficulty and those who
restrain (their) anger and pardon men; and Allah loves the doers of good
(to others)." Sura Ale-Imraan, Verse 134

**SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUTâ€¦**

1. Allah (S.W.T.) has made anger part of the human spirit so that he
may be able to protect himself against the attacks of his enemies. When
he turns this weapon on his friends and family, it is misused and can
bring no good results. Instead he should try to overlook their mistakes
and act with kindness and compassion towards them.

2. Anger should be within one's control. It is necessary to have a
strong will power in order to control its flames.

3. Victory against anger is the greatest achievements of a Believer and
allows him to be good and virtuous. A true Believer is one who has
control over his desires and emotions (including anger).

**Lesson 13 : Family Life in Islam**

The family is one of the most important and sacred institutions in
Islam. According to Allah (S.W.T.) there is no other structure as dear
as that of a family, which is why He tells us that whoever avoids a life
of loneliness and puts an effort to acquire a spouse will have secured
half of his faith.

The establishment of a family is the best way to protect oneself from
sins. It helps to provide an Islamic environment for the people in it
and thus, enhances moral values.

In order to ensure that this blessed environment remains strong and
firm from the beginning, Allah (S.W.T.) has assigned all members who
fall under its umbrella with rights and duties. Every individual has an
important role to play in his family. Just as no one can claim to have
rights without duties, similarly, each member of a family has both when
dealing with his relatives.

**The Rights Of Children Upon Their Parents**

It is the duty of parents to do the following for their children:

1. To give them good names.
2. To educate and nurture the children spiritually, morally,
intellectually and physically. Especially in Qur'anic training and
Islamic values.
3. To show them love, compassion, kindness and respect.
4. To allocate them a good place in the home as part of the family.
Parents must guide their children towards Good with an attitude of
kindness. They should also encourage them in their ambitions and share
their feelings and ideas.

**The Rights Of Parents Upon Their Children**

The duties of children towards their parents are:

1. They should not to do anything that would against their will or
order. This applies only as long as the order is not against that of
Allah (S.W.T.)

2. Children should show their parents great compassion and utmost
respect at all times.

3. When their parents become old, they should serve them happily with a
willing heart i.e. not only out of a sense of duty but also with love.
Parents raise their children with love when they are helpless babies and
thus, it is only fitting that children should reciprocate in the same
manner when they are frail and weak in old age.

Family life in Islam is based on principles like sacrifice, kindness,
sincerity, and devotion. That is why, although a member is required to
fulfill his duties, he is expected to understand if his rights are not
upheld to his standards. He should also try and help the other members
to fulfill their rights.

**The Role of Hejab (Modesty) in the Family**

In order to safeguard the sanctity of families and protect the Islamic
society, Islam has ordered men, women, boys and girls to live within
Hejab in order to avoid moral corruption.

Islam warns daughters, not to cross the limits of the Sheriat in
regards to Hejab. They should refrain from socializing with Na-Mahram
(men who are strangers). This is so that they may live in self-respect
and chastity, away from the dangers of lust and greed. They should also
avoid adorning themselves in front of such men as this too would invite
advances.

Allah (S.W.T.) says in the Holy Quran:

"Say to the believing men that they cast down their looks and guard
their private parts; that is purer for them; surely Allah is aware of
what they do." Sura Noor, Verse 30

In another ayat, Allah (S.W.T.) ordered His Prophet saying: "O Prophet!
Say to the believing women to lower their gaze..." Sura Noor, Verse 31

According to the laws of Islam, a woman should cover her body, hair and
head from strange men. She should refrain from wearing clothes that
would attract/seduce men because clothes are regarded not only as a
covering for the body, but also as a shield of protection. This kind of
modest dressing raises the status and value of women and prevents their
being abused or dishonored.

**The Ideal Family**

When studying family life in Islam, we find a perfect example of what
this institution should be like in the form of Imam Ali (a.s.) and
Hadhrat Zahra (a.s.). Theirs was a marriage that was founded on faith,
respect and honor.

The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) had allocated each their duties when they
were married. Hadhrat Fatema (a.s.) would deal with the indoor work i.e.
grinding flour, baking bread, cooking, cleaning and looking after the
children, while Imam Ali (a.s) handled all the outdoor work. However,
when he came home, if he saw that she was tired and over burdened, he
would help her out with the chores. He also took an equal part in
looking after the children so that they spent quality time with both
their mother and father. This system worked wonderfully and they lived a
hard but happy life.

Despite the fact that they had to struggle to make ends meet, their
love and faith never wavered and Islam always came first in their
priorities. It was this devotion to Allah (S.W.T.) that allowed them to
find solace and comfort in even the most trying times.

One day Imam Ali (a.s.) found Hadhrat Fatema (a.s.)'s working at the
chores with blistered and bleeding hands. He felt sad that she was
suffering so much and yet never uttered a word of complaint to him.

"How I wish I could help you more in your work," he said to his wife.
"Forgive me that I cannot assist much. My responsibilities towards my
beloved Prophet take up my time so that I cannot do more for you."

He then suggested, "Why not ask your kind father to get you a househelp
to share the duties with."

Hadhrat Fatema (a.s.) agreed with this and left for her father's house.
When she arrived to there, she found that the Prophet (s.a.w.w.) was in
the company of a few of his companions. Seeing this, she felt too shy to
present her request and after a little while, she bid him farewell and
left.

The next morning, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) came to his daughter's
house and at the door he stopped and greeted those inside three times,
saying "Assalamu Alaikum Yaa Ahlul-Bayt" (Peace be upon you, O People of
My house).

Imam Ali (a.s.) immediately replied inviting the Prophet (s.a.w.w.) to
come inside. The Prophet (s.a.w.w.) sat and talked with them a little.
Then, he turned to his daughter and said, "My dear daughter, yesterday
you came to my house and wanted to say something to me but left without
sharing what you had in your heart."

He waited for her to reply but seeing that she was to shy to bring up
the issue, he asked her "O my beloved Fatema, tell me what it is that
you want with your father."

Again Hadhrat Fatema (a.s.) could not state her wish. Instead she
looked away and seeing her reluctance, Imam Ali (a.s.) spoke instead, "O
Messenger of God, I sent Zahra to you, because the work of the house is
too much for her to handle alone. Looking after the children, baking
bread, grinding flour, and the innumerable other chores tire her out.
Because I am busy traveling on missions, in the battle field or carrying
out the other work required outside, I cannot offer her more help and
support in fulfilling her enormous tasks. Sometimes, when I am tired,
she even has to bring firewood and fetch water."

He told the Prophet (s.a.w.w.), "For this reason, I suggested that she
come to you for guidance and assistance in acquiring a house help".

The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) pondered on this request. He greatly loved
his daughter and would have liked nothing better than to relieve her
from all the problems she was facing but he knew that the majority of
people in Medina lived in similar conditions.

After Hijrat, the Ansaars (the citizens of Medina) shared what they had
with the Muhajirin (the Immigrants). Many did not live a comfortable
life and could not afford house help. The Messenger of Allah (S.W.T.)
knew that as leader of the Ummah, he could not live a more comfortable
or luxurious life than other Muslims. Looking at his daughter and
son-in-law gently, he asked them, "Would you like me to teach you
something that is much better than a house help?" "Of course, O
Messenger of God," they both replied.

Pleased with their answer, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) told them, "When
you prepare for bed, say Subhaan Allah 33 times, Alhamdulilah 33 times,
and Allaho Akbar 34 times. Repeat this often and it will provide you
with strength, patience and firmness. No doubt, repeating this Dhikr is
far better than a house help. He then glanced at his daughter and asked
her, "Are you happy with your father?"

Hadhrat Fatema (a.s.) smiled and nodded saying, "Whatever Allah
(S.W.T.) and his Messenger wills, I gladly accept too." Ref:
Bihaarul-Anwaar Vol 43 page 82

A Holy Verse Regarding parents, Allah (S.W.T.) has said in the Qur'an
"And We have enjoined on man doing of good to his parents." Sura Ahqaf,
Verse 15

**SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUTâ€¦**

1. The family is the most sacred and loved social structure in Islam
and Allah (S.W.T.) has identified duties and rights for every member so
that it be strong may face all problems that come its way with unity.

2. The duties of parents to their children are to give them a good
name, show them love and consistently persevere in raising their
children up with the highest standard of morals.

3. The duties of children to their parents are to do good to them,
respect them, follow their order - as long as it is not against Allah
(S.W.T.). During their old age, when they turn weak and frail, it is
obligatory upon the children to take care and nurse them with patience,
gentleness and love.

**Think and Answer**

1. What is the most beloved social structure in Islam?
2. Mention the rights of children upon their parents.
3. Mention the duties of children upon their parents.
4. What do you think is the philosophy behind Hejab and chastity? What
are the effects of maintaining Hejaab?
5. What was the Dhikr the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) gave to Imam Ali
(a.s.) and Hadhrat Fatema Zahra (a.s.)?

**Introduction To Chapter Six**

In The Name Of Allah (S.W.T.), the Beneficent, the Merciful

**IMAMAT AND THE SOCIAL SYSTEM**

We have seen in our previous studies that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.)
gave very special attention to the issue of Imamat (Leadership) of the
Muslim society after his death. We know that he appointed Ali Ibn Abi
Taalib (a.s.) as his own successor, at the command of Allah (S.W.T.).
Imam Ali (a.s.) was to take over the leadership of the Ummah and
implement the ahkam of Islam. He was to be guardian of the religion sent
by Allah (S.W.T.).

In furthering our study of this most basic root of religion (Imamat),
we will now look at the position of Aimmah (a.s.) and their attitude
against unjust Caliphs.
