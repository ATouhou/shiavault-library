Preface
=======

In the name of Allah, the beneficent,the Merciful

This is the 5th Volume of this series and contains the important
questions asked between 1986 and September 1990.

The questions came from Tanzania, Kenya, U.K. Germany and Poland, as
well as from Canada, U.S.A., Guyana, Tobago and Trinidad; also there
were questions from India, Pakistan, Dubai, Thailand and Singapore.
Overwhelming majority of the correspondents was Shi'a; but there were
also Sunnis and Hindus.

I personally am very grateful to all of them for the trust and
confidence shown in me. May Allah bless them all. Amen. I pray to Allah
to reward this humble effort with His acceptance, and to make this book
useful for the seekers of guidance and truth.
