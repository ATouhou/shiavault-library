Introduction
============

The sermons that are delivered concerning Imam Husayn (as) attract the
largest audience from all classes of people. The respect they have for
these speeches is very significant, a feature rarely found in other
gatherings. Speakers for such occasions are required to reciprocate this
respect and earnest attendance by doing justice to the feelings of the
people and the gatherings for Husayn (as).

The people who come from far and wide to listen to the lectures that are
delivered about Imam Husayn (as), expect the speakers to enrich their
talks with a greater knowledge of Islam and Qur'anic concepts; new
horizons of thought, understanding and analysis of Husayn (as)'s words,
speeches and stances, as he moved from Hijaz to Iraq; the speeches of
his kinsmen and companions; the positions they took and the sacrifices
they offered, that are unique in history.

The uprising of Husayn (as) is replete with ideas, concepts, values and
beautiful scenes, the like of which are rarely witnessed in the words
and deeds of others, which speakers are expected to analyse as they
trace his route from Hijaz to Iraq. They should be able to present these
lessons to their listeners during the month of Muharram and also on
other occasions.

The present book is an effort in that direction but I cannot be sure
that it has achieved its goal. All the same, I have tried, knowing
success is from God alone.
