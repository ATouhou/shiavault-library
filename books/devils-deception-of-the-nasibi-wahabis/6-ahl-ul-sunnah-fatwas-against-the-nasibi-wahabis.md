Ahl'ul Sunnah Fatwas Against the Nasibi Wahabis
===============================================

**Ijma of Ahl'ul Sunnah that Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab was an enemy of
Islam**

The Nasibi Ehsan Ellahi in his book "Al Bareylviaath" did a remarkable
job collecting together Sunni fatwas made against his beloved Nasibi
brethren. The intention was to create some type of sympathy towards the
ignorant masses that the Nasibis have been unjustly persecuted. It is
amusing to see how he appeals against this injustice when in fact the
Masters of issuing takfir are the Nasibis themselves. What he pieces
together are the views that the Sunni Ulema have held about his Nasibi
cronies!

Ellahi records the following fatwa:

The Ahlul Sunnah have an ijma that Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab was a
Khwaarijee and baghi (rebel) whoever holds this Najdee belief is an
enemy of Islam"

Al Bareylviyaath, by Ehsan Ellahi page 182

The above has also been recorded by Ahmad Sayyid Kazmi Sunni in his
book "Al Haq al Mobeen page 10-11 and Amjad Ali Sunni in "Bahar Shariath
Volume 1 page 46".

**Wahabies are more impure than the most impure religion Ellahi then
records the following fatwas:**

The Wahabis are worse than Jews, Christians, Magians, Hindus, and more
damaging to Islam they are worse than Murthads".

Al Bareylviyaath, by Ehsan Ellahi page 181

Whoever is a Wahabi and follows Rashid Ahmad Gangohi is a kaffir".

Al Bareylviyaath, by Ehsan Ellahi page 187

From the Shaytan Wahabis is Ashraf Ali Thanvi"

Al Bareylviyaath, by Ehsan Ellahi page 189

Whoever doubts the kufr of Ashraf Ali Thanvi is also a kafir, his
followers are all kafirs and it is a sin to read his book Behishti
Zewar".

Al Bareylviyaath, by Ehsan Ellahi page 190

Those Mullahs that call Shi'as kaffir should first of all prove their
faith.


**The Fatwa of kufr by the Sunni Ulema against the Wahabis**

The Sunni scholar Naasir Sunniyath Abu Tahir Muhammad Thabib Siddiqui
Dhana Purri, writes as follows:

the Ulema of Deen, and scholars of the Law are faced by the problem of
Wahabis, Deobandis.Najdhis kufr beliefs, and this book addresses how
Muslims should deal with them. "Tajhahib Ahl ul Sunnah" by Naasir
Sunniyath Abu Tahir Muhammad Thabib Siddiqui Dhana Purri, published
Markazi Anjuman Huzbul Aynaf Lahore, Bareylvi Electorate Press 1361
Hijri We will now quote extensively from this work:

"A reply to question one The followers of Muhammad bin Najdi are called
Wahabis. Shah Ismail Dehlavi under Al Iman in which there lots of kufr
translated his book Tauhid in India. Whoever follows the Wahabis is a
kaffir.

The Fatwa by Sunni Ulema of Kufr against the Deobandis In the same book
we read:

Deobadiyaat is a form of Wahabiyath their ideology is to disrespect the
Saints, every Deobandi is a Wahabi, and not every Wahabi is a Deobandi.
Deobandis become Hanafi and those that are not Deobandis call themselves
Ahl-e-Hadith. They possess a great deal of kufr beliefs. The Wahabis and
Ahl e Hadith tend to adhere to the work Taqwiyat ul Iman and call it the
truth. The Deoband apostates acknowledging their kufr beliefs still call
them Muslims, under Islamic Law they are therefore both kaffir and
should be punished accordingly "Tajhahib Ahl ul Sunnah" by Naasir
Sunniyath Abu Tahir Muhammad Thabib Siddiqui Dhana Purri, published
Markazi Anjuman Huzbul Aynaf Lahore, Bareylvi Electorate Press 1361
Hijri The Wahabis claim to represent Islam inciting hatred against the
Shia, lead by Nasibis such as Muhammad Manzoor Numani, Bilal Philips.
The real kaffirs as we have shown from their fatwa and Ahlul Sunnah
texts are the Nasibis whether they are Ahl-e-Hadith or Deobandi.

The Ahl'ul Sunna Fatwa of kufr against Abdul Wahab Najdhi In another
Ahl'ul Sunnahs text Tahjanib Ahlul Sunnah un Ahlul Fitna we read:

Oh God send your curse who refuted your beloved, disrespected him and
identified faults in him and send your curse on those who loved and
supported Abdul Wahab because such people are apostates".

"Tahjanib Ahl'ul Sunnah un Ahl'ul Fitna (published Bombay by Anjumaun
Tablighi Sadaqat): page 657 Abdul Wahab Najdi is a kaffir as are his
followers so the onus is on them to prove their Iman.

**The Ahlul Sunna kufr fatwa on Najdi Wahabis In the same work (above)
page 263 we read:**

Verily there is no doubt that the Wahabi Najdis are kaffir and
according to SharU\`S(a they are apostates if they die without
repenting, they will be the first to perish in the fire. "Tahjanib
Ahl'ul Sunnah un Ahl'ul Fitna (published Bombay by Anjumaun Tablighi
Sadaqat): page 263

In the same above book the scholar names the guilty party with the
following titles:

Ibne Saud, Kahazala Malik al Mabuud (page 257)
Ibne Saud, Kujha al Malik al Wuddod (page 259)
Murdood Ibne Saud (page 268)
Khubsa Najad (page 258)
Mullah Una'y Najad (page 259)
Kafara Najad (page 259)
Murdha Najad (page 260)
Kuffar Najad (page 263)
Murthadeen ay Najad (page 264)
Maloon e Najad (page 268)
Shayaatheen au Deoband (page 268)

"Tahjanib Ahl'ul Sunnah un Ahl'ul Fitna (published Bombay by Anjumaun
Tablighi Sadaqat)

Sunni brothers! The filthy Nasibis are themselves kaffir whether Najdi
or Deoband they are one and the same. The Nasibis love quoting kufr
Fatwas by those they deemed scholars against the Shia, they should also
look at Sunni Fatwas declaring Nasibis, Deobandis, as Kafir, apostates,
cursed and Satanic.

**The Ahl'ul Sunnah Kufr Fatwa against the Father of the Nasibis Ibn
Saud Ahl ul Sunnah work "fitna Najdiyaat" by Haji Nawabdeen Golarvi
writes:**

Mufti Azam Maulvi Zafar Ali Khan says who is Ibne Saud but a sales man
of Haram Shareef that invests his profits on illicit luxuries, appeaser
of the British, fired bullets on Muslims"

"fitna Najdiyaat" by Haji Nawabdeen Golarvi", publishers Makathaba
Ghosia, Thala, Ganag Road, Chakwaal, page 252 The Ahl'ul Sunnah Fatwa
that Ibne Saud is an appeaser of the BritishIn the same book Haji
Nawabdeen Golarvi writes:

If at any time Ameer Faysal turns against the British they have an
alternative Crown Prince Ibne Saud on the pay roll taken from the
speeches of Mufti Azam Muhammad Ali, published Delhi, Ghunni Muthaba,
Delhi Volume 2 page 68"

"fitna Najdiyaat" by Haji Nawabdeen Golarvi", publishers Makathaba
Ghosia, Thala, Ganag Road, Chakwaal, page 76

**The Ahlul Sunnah Fatwa that Wahabis kufr is greater than Christians
and Jews Haji Nawabdeen Golarvi makes further comments:**

Wahabis are greater kaffirs than Jews and Christians we have heard from
our ancestors that even the Jews and Christians didnt deny their
Prophets but these filthy individuals are against their own Prophet
(taken from Munkuul As Azad ki Kahani page 351)" "fitna Najdiyaat" by
Haji Nawabdeen Golarvi", publishers Makathaba Ghosia, Thala, Ganag Road,
Chakwaal, page 98

The Ahlul Sunnah Fatwa declaring it haram to marry a Wahabi (male or
female)In the same book Nawabadeeb writes about his father's belief as
follows: As far as I recall he said that marriage with a Wahabi is not
permissible Azaz ki kahani" "fitna Najdiyaat" by Haji Nawabdeen
Golarvi", publishers Makathaba Ghosia, Thala, Ganag Road, Chakwaal, page
173

The Ahlul Sunnah Fatwa declaring that Wahabis are more devious than
ShaytanIn "Al Barelviyaath" page 196 by Ehsan Ellahi records the
following views about his beloved Nasibi brothers:

Wahabis are more war mongers than the Shaythan and they are more
devious than Iblis".

"Al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi page 196

Wahabis are kafir, Apostates and hypocrites"

"Al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi page 194

May Allah curse be upon the Wahabis they will be in the deepest part of
Hell, kufr is in their destiny".

"Al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi page 195

It is not permissible to pray behind a Wahabi"

"Al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi page 195

The Adhaan of the Wahabis is not the Adhaan permitted in Shariah"

"Al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi page 145

If a Wahabi leads Funeral Prayers then this will not be valid"

"Al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi page 196

These are quotes by Elahi, who seeks to condemn the Bareylvis for these
Fatwas it is a must for a Mufti to be a Muslim hence kufr fatwas by the
Wahabis are of no value.

**The Sunni scholar Allamah Shamiis Fatwa that Najdhi Wahabis are also
Khwaarij**

Allamah Ibne Abdideen (d 1254 Hijri) writing on the Khwaarij in Radd al
Mukhthar, Maaruf Fatawa Shaami Volume 3 page 427, states: In modern
times Ibn Wahab came from Najd and took control of the holy cities. They
said that they were Hanbali but in reality they deemed only those that
followed their way to be Muslim, whoever opposed them were mushriks,
accordingly they deemed it permissible to kill the Ahlul Sunnah and
their Ulema.

The Khwaarij are that group about whom in Hadith they will have shave
heads, thick beards, recital of the Quran will only go as far as their
throats and they will leave the religion like an arrow from a bow. Abu
Said al Khudri narrates that he heard Rasulullah (s) state: "There will
appear some people among you whose prayer will make you look down upon
yours, and whose fasting will make you look down upon yours, but they
will recite the Qur'an which will not exceed their throats (they will
not act on it) and they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes out
through the game whereupon the archer would examine the arrowhead but
see nothing, and look at the unfeathered arrow but see nothing, and look
at the arrow feathers but see nothing, and finally he suspects to find
something in the lower part of the arrow." (Sahih al Bukhari, English
translation - Volume 6 hadith number 378)

**The Sunni Fatwa by Muhammad Thanvi that The Nasibis are
Khwaarijees**

Golarvi quotes further verdicts against the Wahabis. In this book we
read:

Those that follow Abdul Wahab are called Wahabi in our country and
consider themselves la madhabi. They claim that it is shirk to follow
any of the four Imams, those that do are polytheists and consider Ahlul
Sunnah women as captives, and deem it halal to murder Sunnis. These are
Wahabis a group of Khwaarjis as deemed Allamah Shaafi". "fitna
Najdiyaat" by Haji Nawabdeen Golarvi", publishers Makathaba Ghosia,
Thala, Ganag Road, Chakwaal, page 108 Nawabadeen quoting Tabarani page
118 Volume 4 and Hayathul Dhuniyaa page 20 writes: Khwaarijee people are
the dogs of hell, the net result is that the Wahabis are also dogs of
hell which is why they love Muawiya so much.

The Wahabis focus their target on Shias for not believing in the Sahaba
we would suggest that they look at Ahlul Sunnah who adhere to the
teachings of Hadhrath Abu Bakr and Umar and have issued takfir against
them from solid arguments. This means that these two individuals are
such personalities if you believe in them you are kaffir, if you dont
you are kafir!

Imam of Ahlul Sunnahs Ahmad Razas Fatwa that Wahabi,Deobandi and La
Madhabi Groups are Kaffir

In Ahl'ul Sunnahs' authority work "Hanafittath aur Muzzahiyaatk"
Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Asari, writes:

Wahabi Deobandi and la madhabi are impure and no matter how pious they
act they are apostates taken from Ahkam e- Shariath part 1 page 122)
"Hanafittath aur Muzzahiyaatk" by Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Asari, page 35
publishers Jama Ibraheemiya Sial Koht These are from the words of Imam
of Ahlul Sunnah Barelvi he managed to speak the truth. The Imam of the
Sunnis has as a responsible Aalim issued takfir against Numanis group
and his followers.

**Ahlul Sunnahs Fatwa that to marry a Wahabi / Deobandi is batil In the
above mentioned Asari writes:**

Wahabi and Deobandis are apostates, to marry them anywhere whether you
are a Muslim, True Kafir (by birth) or an apostate, human or animal, is
not permissible such a marriage is void, it would be deemed fornication
and offspring will be illegitimate. (taken from Mulfuuzath Part 2 page
111-112)" "Hanafittath aur Muzzahiyaatk" by Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Asari,
page 35 publishers Jama Ibraheemiya Sial Koht This is the state of the
Wahabis who the Sunnis dont even want in their homes because they are
the products of fornication.

Numani and his likes look at the Fatwas of the Sunni Ulema against your
party

**The Ahlul Sunna Fatwa that to eat animal slaughtered by a Wahabi
(whether Deobandi or la Madhabi) is impure and haram On the same page
Asari records this Fatwa of Ahmad Raza Barelvi:**

Meat slaughtered by a Jew is Halal if he takes Gods name at the time of
slaughter, but to eat meat slaughtered by Wahabis is haraam even if they
say Gods name 100s of time, no matter how pious they are, they are
kaffir in Islamic Law Ahkam-e-Shariath Part 1 page 122)"

"Hanafittath aur Muzzahiyaatk" by Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Asari, page 35
publishers Jama Ibraheemiya Sial Koht The Imam of Ahlul Sunnah considers
the Wahabis as worse than Jews! Numani collects the Wahabi Fatwas
against Shia, Imams considered by the Sunnis as kafir. Those that Ahlul
Sunnah consider Kafir / worse than Jews have Fatwas that serve no
value!

**The Sunni Fatwa to have sex (after Nikah)with a Wahabi is deemed
fornication Ellahi in "Al Barelviyaath" records these fatwas:**

It is not permissible to marry a Wahabi (male or female) if someone
does so, and has sex it is deemed fornication If the Nikah ceremony is
recited by a Wahabi the marriage is void the same is the case if a
Wahabi stands witness to a marriage". "al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi
page 198

The Ulema of Ahlul Sunnah scholars have declared takfir against these
self-declared defenders of the faith!

The Ahlul Sunna Fatwa declaring that you
cannot participate in a Wahabis Funeral
and that whoever attends is a Kafir
Ellahi also quotes this Fatwa:

Wahabis are Kafirs, those who attend their funeral will also become
kafirs".

"al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi page 196

The Ahlul Sunna Fatwa declaring whoever
considers Wahabi a Muslim is a Kaafir
In the same book Ellahi records this verdict:

"Whoever considers Wahabis Muslim is a Kaafir, it is not permissible to
pray behind such a person".

"al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi page 197

The Ahlul Sunna Fatwa that a dead
Wahabi is like a dead donkey
Ellahi records the following edict against his fellow Nasibis:

To meet with Wahabis is a sin to ask of them when there is a sin, to
participate in the deceased Ghusl is a sin, to lift the dead body is a
sin to participate in the Funeral is Kufr".

"al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi page 197

The Ahlul Sunnah Ulema have equated Wahabis with Kafirs.

The Ahlul Sunna Fatwa declaring that Hanafis should
not drink from water provided by a Wahabi
On the same page Ellahi records the following:

Hanafi Muslims should not drink from water given by a Wahabi"

"al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi page 197

The Ahlul Sunnah Fatwa declaring it a sin to
say Salaam or reply to a Wahabis Salaam
Reading further Ellahi records:

To shake hands, exchange salaams with a Wahabi is haram, to listen to
them, join them in meetings and sermons is a sin.

"al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi page 197

Elahi the Nasibi quoted these verdicts in an effort label Bareylvis /
Ahl ul Sunnah kafirs! We are just pleased to see that he has shot
himself in the foot in the process!

**The Ahlul Sunnah Fatwa declaring that you cannot send your children
to a Wahabi Madrassa Ellahi then quotes further Fatwas in Al
Barelviyaath, on page 198**

To get kids to learn from a Wahabi teacher is a sin and anyone who does
so is an enemy"

"al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi page 198

On the same page he quotes that it is a sin to give Zakat to a
Wahabi".

"al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi page 198

Quoting the text "Al Wahabeen Haraam" Ellahi copies the following
Fatwa:

It is haraam to read the works of Wahabis especially Ibn Taymeeya and
Ibn Kaleem these two are the most impure and misguided of the Wahabis"

"al Barelviyaath" by Ehsan Ellahi page 200

The Ahlul Sunnah Fatwa declaring that you cannot allow Wahabis to pray
in Mosques Interestingly, in the same book Elahi verifies the above and
states that he has seen such an order on the gates of 2 Mosques in
Lahore This Mosque prohibits Wahabis from entering" "al Barelviyaath" by
Ehsan Ellahi page 196

The Ahl ul Sunnah Fatwa declaring Wahabis Deobandi, Najdis, La
Madhhabis and Qadianis as Kaafirs In "Tajhjanib Ahl ul Sunnah", Naasir
Sunniyath Abu Tahir Muhammad Thabib Siddiqui Dhana Purri, answers
"question 15" as follows:

Wahabiyya, Deobandi, Chukurwaliiyaa and Khaksarriyas etc are definitely
kafir according to the Sharia, whoever doubts this is a kafir and hell
bound"

"Tajhahib Ahl ul Sunnah" by Naasir Sunniyath Abu Tahir Muhammad Thabib
Siddiqui Dhana Purri, page 435 Shias have done nothing to trouble the
Wahabis and yet we are the targets of their aggression.
