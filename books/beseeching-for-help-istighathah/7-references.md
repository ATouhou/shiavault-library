[16]. Haythamī transmitted it in Majma‘-uz-zawā’id (9:24) and said that
that tradition had been reported by Bazzār (in his Musnad) and its
sub-narrators are all of*sahīh* (sound)*hadīth* . ‘Irāqī has confirmed
the soundness of its chain of transmission in his book*Tarh-ut-tathrīb
fī sharh-it-taqrīb* (3:297). Ibn Sa‘d has recorded it
in*at-Tabaqāt-ul-kubrā* (2:194). Qādī ‘Iyād has inscribed this tradition
in*ash-Shifā* (1:19); and Suyūtī, recording it in*al-Khasā’is-ul-kubrā*
(2:281) and*Manāhil-us-sifā fī takhrīj ahādīth ash-Shifā* (p.3), has
commented that Ibn Abī Usāmah in his*Musnad* has reproduced it through
Bakr bin ‘Abdullāh al-Muzanī and Bazzār in his*Musnad* who have relied
on its narration by ‘Abdullāh bin Mas‘ūd with a sound chain of
transmission. It has been endorsed by Khafājī and Mullā ‘Alī Qārī in
their commentaries on*ash-Shifā,* i.e.*Nasīm-ur-riyād* (1:102) and*Sharh
ash-Shifā* (1:36) respectively.*Hadīth* -scholar Ibn-ul-Jawzī has
reproduced it in*al-Wafā bi-ahwāl-il-mustafā* (2:809-10) from Bakr bin
‘Abdullāh and Anas bin Mālik. Subkī has copied this tradition
in*Shifā’-us-siqām fī ziyārat khayr-il-anām* (p.34) from Bakr bin
‘Abdullāh al-Muzanī, and Ibn ‘Abd-ul-Hādī in*as-Sārim-ul-munkī*
(p.266-7) has authenticated its veracity. Bazzār’s tradition has also
been recorded by Ibn Kathīr in*al-Bidāyah wan-nihāyah* (4:257).
‘Asqalānī narrated it through Bakr bin ‘Abdullāh al-Muzanī
in*al-Matālib-ul-‘āliyah* (4:22-3\#3853). ‘Alī al-Hindī copied Ibn
Sa‘d’s tradition in*Kanz-ul-‘ummāl* (11:407\#31903) and from Hārith
(\#31904). Nabhānī related it in*Hujjatullāh ‘alal-‘ālamīn fī mu‘jazāt
sayyid-il-mursalīn* (p.713).
