Jihad (Holy Struggle) is an Obligatory Duty
===========================================

***“O Prophet! Strive hard agaunt the infidels and the hypocrites, and
be firm against them, and their abode is hell, and evil is their
resort.” Holy Qur'an (66:9)***

***“Go forth (equipped) lightly or heavily, and strive hard in Allah's
cause with your property and own selves; this is better for you, if you
know.” Holy Qur'an (9:41)***

Jihad is a holy duty made obligatory upon all Muslims by Allah, the
Almighty. The Muslims should defend themselves if being attacked in
order to preserve their faith, spread Islam, and stand against tyrants
and oppressors. Allah made *jihad* obligatory, in all its forms, whether
it is the jihad of society or self, speaking a word for the sake of
preserving Islamic call *Da'wah*, or defending the sanctuaries of the
Muslim nation. Jihad is considered among the best forms of worship with
Allah, the Most High.

He who spends even a small amount of money in Allah's way will find his
reward increased many times by the Beneficent Creator. Whoever is harmed
or suffers inflictions in the cause of Allah will have his reward with
Allah on the Resurrection Day.

The martyr who sacrifices himself and dies for the sake of his faith
finds his place in Paradise. He receives blessings from the prophets and
the righteous. He is alive and provided for by Allah, The Exalted.
