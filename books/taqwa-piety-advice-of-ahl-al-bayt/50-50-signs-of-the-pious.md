50) Signs Of The Pious
======================

There is a sign for everything for people to know it. If you want to
know whether a liquid is verjuice, vinegar, water, rose-water,
Egyptianâ€“willow water or sallow-water, you can know about it buy
smelling or tasting it. If you want to know the name of a metal, you
have to assay it with touchstone to see whether it is cooper, gold,
brass, platinum, or silver. If you want to know whether fallen body is
alive or dead, a mirror or stethoscope will help you.

If you want to know whether a nation is alive or dead, you can know
about it through their active presence in the different scenes, and
through their intelligence. If you want to know whether a person is a
clergyman or businessman, a government employee or a worker, a patient
or physician, pious or wrongdoer, a man of this world or a man of the
hereafter, there are signs with them which denote their jobs.

Now, if we want to know men of piety, we should get to know them through
the features mentioned in the Holy Quran and traditions. When we know
them, we can set them as models to be followed, make friend and
associate with them.
