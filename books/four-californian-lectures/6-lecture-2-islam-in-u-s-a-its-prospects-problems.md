====================================================

 

*A lecture delivered at* *University* *of California, Santa Cruz, Oakes
College on October 28, 1987*

   
 I am a student of religion; and therefore shall confine my talk to
describing the religious problems and prospects of Muslims in the U.S.A.
This country is a land of emigrants, People from different countries
have been landing on its shores since Columbus set foot on what he
thought was India. They spoke different languages, belonged to diverse
ethnic groups and followed various religions and beliefs. You will now
find here followers of all major world religions; but the majority has
been of white Protestant Christians.
