Faith in Allah and Attaining his Pleasure
=========================================

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "My father said to me about his father (‘a)
that a man from Kufah wrote to his father viz. to al-Husayn-ibn-’Ali
(‘a) asking him (‘a) to imform him of the good of this world and that of
the next. Then, he (‘a) wrote (in his reply): 'In the Name Allah the
Beneficent, the Merciful'. After that: 'Verily, he who seeks the
pleasure of Allah even while displeasing people, He suffices him in his
affairs with people. But, he who seeks the pleasure of people while
Allah is displeased, he leaves him to people (and he will be far from
His Grace), Wassalam'."

Imam ‘Ali ibn Husayn (‘a) said: "He who acts according to what Allah has
enjoined for him, is of the best people."

Al-Kafi, vol. 2, p. 81

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "The one who loves for Allah, hates for Allah,
and donates (things) for Allah, thus he is one of those whose Faith is
complete."

Al-Kafi, vol. 2, p. 124

Imam Hasan al-’Askari, the eleventh Imam, (‘a) said: "There are no
qualities above these two: Faith in Allah and being beneficial to
Muslims."
