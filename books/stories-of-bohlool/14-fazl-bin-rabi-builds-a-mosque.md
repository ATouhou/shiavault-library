Fazl bin Rabi' Builds a Mosque
==============================

Fazl bin Rabi' had a mosque constructed in Baghdad. It was decided to
place a plaque on its door. The people asked Fazl what should be written
on it. Bahlool also happened to be present. He asked Fazl, “Who did you
make the mosque for?”

Fazl replied, “For Allah.”

Bahlool said, “If you made it for Allah, then don't inscribe your name
on the plaque.”

Fazl angrily said, “Why shouldn't I have my name inscribed on the
tablet? People have to know who the maker of the mosque is!”

“Then have it inscribed that the maker of this mosque is Bahlool.”

“I certainly will not have that written!”

“If you made this mosque for fame and self-show then you have lost your
reward.”

Fazl became speechless at Bahlool's words. He said, “Whatever Bahlool
says, have that inscribed.”

This time Bahlool said, “Have a verse from the Sacred Qur'an inscribed
on the door of the mosque.”
