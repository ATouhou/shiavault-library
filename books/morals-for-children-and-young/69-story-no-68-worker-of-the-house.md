Story no. 68: Worker of the house.
==================================

The wife had lost her husband.  
 To avoid poverty, she had to work at people’s houses and provide food
for her children.  
 Sometimes she took her two year old child with her so that while taking
care of other children, she may take care of him too.  
 But most of the children said abusive words to the woman and sometimes
hurt the two year orphan.  
 Till one day, Tal’at, the ten year old girl of the owner of the house,
gathered the children and advised them.One of her words were “Children,
it is against the morals of Islam that we pester to the woman who has no
guardian and comes to serve us .  
 How nice of us if we be kind to her and that orphan child so that God
may keep our fathers safe”.  
 Have you not heard that Imam Ali (as) was always kind to orphans and
widows.
