Translator’s Note
=================

In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful.

All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. May the peace and
blessings of Allah be upon Muhammad and his pure progeny!

This book which discusses Imam ‘Ali’s merits and virtues was given to me
for translation into English by the honorable manager of Ansarian
publication, Mr. Hajj Muhammad Taqi Ansarian, a devotee of Ahl al-Bayt.
For this reason, I should really thank him for his good choice.

The translation of this book is dedicated to my dear wife, Maryam
Kazemi, for her piety, patience, and her love for Imam ‘Ali (a.s).

I would like to thank my dear son, Arya, for proofreading this book.

Above all, my special thanks will go to my knowledgeable friend, Mr.
Badr Shahin, for editing this book. I am much obliged to him as usual.

‘Ali Akbar Aghili Ashtiani
