Part 2: The Emergence of the Shi'ites
=====================================

Preliminary Remarks
-------------------

So far we have learned how “Shi'ism” emerged. But whence did the
“Shiites” themselves and the attendant division within-the Islamic
*Ummah* originate? This is what we shall now try to answer.

If we observe closely the first stage of the *Ummah's* existence, the
Prophet's lifetime, we shall find from the very outset of the Islamic
experience two distinct currents. They coexisted within the same
community newly brought to life by the Prophet. Their disaccord led to a
doctrinal division immediately following the Prophet's death, one which
sundered the *Ummah* into two sections.

One section was fated to rule, and thus to encompass the majority of
Muslims; while the other was shunned from rule, destined to become a
minority opposition within the general fold of Islam. Shi'ism was this
minority. Herein lie three areas of discussion.
