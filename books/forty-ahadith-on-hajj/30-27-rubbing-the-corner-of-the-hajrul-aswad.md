  <p>
قَالَ رَسُولُ اللٌّهِ (ص): طُوفُوا بِالْبَيْتِ وَ اسْتَلْمُوا
الرُّكْنَ فَإِنَّهُ يَمِينُ اللٌّهِ عَلـى أَرْضِهِ يُصَافِحُ بِهَا
خَلْقَهُ.

 The Messenger of Allah (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family)
has said, “Perform the tawaaf of the House and rub your hand over the
Corner which has the Hajr al-Aswad because this is the right hand of
Allah on His Earth which He shakes with His creations.”
