16. Philosophy Behind the Name “Al-Ka’bah”
==========================================

  <p>
عَنْ أَبِي جَعْفَرٍ (ع) قَالَ: قُلْتُ لَهُ: لِمَ سُمِّىَ الْبَيْتُ،
بَيْتُ الْعَتِيقِ؟ قَالَ: لأََنَّهُ حُرٌّ عَتِيقٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَ
لَمْ يَمْلِكُهُ أَحَدٌ.

 It has been narrated that Abi Ja’far [Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Ali al-Baqir]
(peace be upon him) was asked, “Why is it (the Ka’bah) named Baitul
‘Atiq (the Emancipated House)?”  The Imam replied: “Because this house
is free and emancipated from people and was never under the ownership of
anyone.”
