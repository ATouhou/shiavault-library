Lesson Thirty Four: The Best People
===================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
خَيْرُ النّاسِ قُضاةُ الْحَقِّ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The best people are those who judge fairly.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Fair judgment in legal, social and moral matters is only possible for
one who gives equal treatment to his own and others’ interests and his
personal affection and hatred do not prevent him from justice and
righteousness.

This is possible only for those whose existence is radiated with the
light of belief, human virtues and love and affection for humanity . The
powerful waves of selfishness, profit motivation and lust cannot
overcome their mind and conscience. Such people deserve to be called
“the best people.”
