64: Haggling (taghabun)
=======================

This chapter of 18 verses dates from the transition between the late
period in Mecca and the first year in Madina. It was revealed after
Prohibition 66 and before Battle Array 61. The haggling will occur on
the day when God gathers everyone in and we all shall have to account
for our actions. The chapter is full of suggestion when it is read
attentively.
