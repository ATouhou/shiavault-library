Dutifulness to Parents
======================

Dutifulness to one's parents comes from the bondsman's correct
knowledge of Allah, since there is no act of worship which will bring
the person performing it more quickly to the pleasure of Allah than
being dutiful to believing parents for the sake of Allah.

This is because the right of the parents is derived from the right of
Allah, as long as they are both on the path of the faith and the sunnah,
and do not prevent a child from obeying Allah for the sake of obedience
to them, or move him from certainty to doubt, or from abstinence to the
desires of this world, or call him to anything which is in opposition to
faith and the sunnah. If the situation is like that, then it is an act
of obedience to rebel against them, and an act of rebellion to obey
them.

Allah said,


<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَإِن جَاهَدَاكَ عَلى أَن تُشْرِكَ بِي مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ
فَلَا تُطِعْهُمَا وَصَاحِبْهُمَا فِي الدُّنْيَا مَعْرُوفًا وَاتَّبِعْ
سَبِيلَ مَنْ أَنَابَ إِلَيَّ ثُمَّ إِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأُنَبِّئُكُم
بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***If they contend with you that you should associate with Me what you
have no knowledge of, do not obey them. Keep company with them kindly in
this world, but follow the way of him who turns to Me, then to Me is
your return!*** (31:15)


As far as companionship is concerned, keep their company and be gentle
with them. Endure their hardship just as they endured yours when you
were young, and do not withhold from them that which Allah has made
plentiful for you in the way of food and clothes. Do not turn your face
away from them nor raise your voice above theirs. To respect them is
part of Allah's command; speak to them in the best possible way and be
kind to them. Allah will not let the reward of those who do good go to
waste.
