36: Monetary Assistance To The Pious Shias And Friends Of Imam (aj)
===================================================================

This is mentioned separately in traditions and thus we have also given
it as a separate duty. For example, in Man La Yahzarul Faqih, Imam Sadiq
(as) is reported to have said, “One who could not do good to us, he
should do good towards our righteous Shias and friends, he shall get the
reward of helping us. And those who could not visit us should visit our
righteous friends, they shall get the reward of our Ziarat
(visitation).”

In *Kamiluz Ziarat* through the author’s own chain of narrators it is
narrated from His Eminence, Abul Hasan Musa bin Ja’far (as) that he
said: One who is unable to visit us should pay a visit to a righteous
follower of ours, as a reward for our Ziarat will be written for him;
and one who is unable to do a favor on us should do favor to our
righteous follower, and the reward of doing a favor to us will be noted
in his account.[^1]

In *Tahdhib* through the author’s own chain of narrators it is narrated
from His Eminence that he said: One who is unable to visit us should pay
a visit to his righteous brothers, as reward for our Ziarat will be
written for him; and one who is unable to do a favor on us should do
favor to his righteous brothers, and the reward of doing a favor to us
will be noted in his account.[^2]
