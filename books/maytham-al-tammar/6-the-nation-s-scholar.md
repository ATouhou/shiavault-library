The Nation's Scholar
====================

Maytham was brilliant. He got his knowledge from Imam Ali [a]. One day
he said to Abdullah bin Abbas, the nation's scholar:

*Ask me whatever you want about the Qur'an explanation. I've learnt
everything from Imam Ali [a].*

So, bin Abbas sat before Maytham to learn lessons about the Qur'an
explanation.
