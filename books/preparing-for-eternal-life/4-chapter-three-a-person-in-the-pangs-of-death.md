Chapter Three : a Person in the Pangs of Death
==============================================

And Allah says in the Quoran:

"O you who believe! Be careful of (your duty to) Allah with the care
which is due to Him, and do not die unless you are Muslims."
[3;101/2]

It is related that the Holy Prophet visited an Ansar at the time of his
death when it was narrated to him from the dying man that he was
pleading with Allah [S.W.T] for kindness as he was afraid of his sins.
The Holy Prophet [S.A.W] said that in feeling this way Allah [S.W.T.]
would definitely reward his hopes and save him from those things which
he was afraid of. [Qummi, Shaikh Abbas (1999), pg 114]

The Holy Prophet [S.A.W.], in another tradition, stated that visiting a
dying person and asking them to recite the following:

"Allaahuumagh-firlil katheera min ma-a's'iyatika wa iqbal minnil
yaseera min t'aa-a'tika."

[ Allah! Pardon my sins which are many and accept my deeds which are
very little.] [Qummi, Shaikh Abbas (1999), pg 114] If you are present
with someone who is passing away and experiencing the pangs of death' it
is recommended, by a reliable source from Imam Muhammad al-Baqir [A.S.],
that you make him recite this "Kalemate Farj":

"Laa ilaaha illallaahul h'aleemul kareem laa ilaaha illallaahul
a'liyyul a'z'eem subh'aanallahi rabbis samaawaatis sab-i'wa maa
baynahunna wa rabbil a'rshil a'z'eem. Wal-h'amdu lillaahi rabbil
a'alameen."

[There is no God except Allah the Generous and Patient. There is no God
except Allah the Almighty and All-Wise. Pure is that Allah Who is the
Creator of seven heavens and the seven earths and all that is in them
and between them; He is the Lord of all these things and Arsh. And all
praise is due to Allah Who is the Lord of all the worlds.] [Qummi,
Shaikh Abbas (1999), pg 115]

According to another source, it is recommended that Quor'an should be
recited with the person who has become sick, 24hrs around the clock,
before they pass away, then as the body is being washed, then through to
when the body is buried and the grave is covered in sand.

It is recommended that a person who is passing away or experiencing the
pangs of death', [if possible], lay him/her flat with the feet and face
facing Holy Ka'aba, insh'Allah.


**Chapter Four : When a Person Becomes Deceased**

And Allah says in the Quoran:

"Every soul must taste of Death" [21;35, 29;57]

When the person has become deceased, the following 8 steps must be
done: Shut the mouth and the eyes of the corpse and cover the face of
the corpse. Fasten the two jaws with a strip so tightly so that the
mouth does not open. Straighten both legs.

Cover the corpse with a sheet or cloth.

Provide light where the corpse is kept if the person has died at
night.

Announce the death with the view to enable the faithful to attend the
funeral.

Avoid undue delay in bathing and shrouding the corpse with the Kafan.
If death takes place at night, the funeral ceremonies should not be
postponed for the day and vice versa. If there is any doubt about the
death taking place, they should wait till they are certain about it.
[Qummi, Shaikh Abbas (1999), pg 119]

**Washing the Body of the Deceased**

It is wajib (obligatory) on every believing Muslim, (male or female
depending on the sex of the deceased), to administer the bathing of the
deceased Muslim , to provide Kafan if not already provided, shroud the
deceased and offer prayers at the burial of the deceased. If one, or
several people, perform these tasks, all others are exempt from doing
so. [Sayyid, Hadi Husayn (1988), pg.111]

It is more than likely that if you are required to perform the very
blessed task of bathing the body of a deceased person, it will be a
person that is a relative or friend, unless this duty is part of your
profession or you are in a crisis situation.

It is very important that the bathing is done with a very gentle touch
and recommended dua'as are recited.

It is wajib that the person who is going to administer the baths gets
permission from the Heir of the deceased person before administering the
baths if the administrator is not the Heir themselves. If it is
impossible to get permission, the bath may be performed without the
permission.

According to Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (A.S.), a Momin who bathes the body
of another deceased Momin, recites the following dua'a:

"Allaahumma inna haad'aa ba'danu a'bdikal moo'mini wa qad akhrajta
rooh'ahoo minhoo wa farraqta baynahumma fa-a'fwaka a'fwaka." [O Allah
this is the body of Your Momin whose spirit You have taken from it and
have thus separated the two So Your forgiveness is sought, Your
forgiveness is sought.] [Qummi, Shaikh Abbas (1999), pg 123]

The person administering the bath should remain busy in prayers to
Allah and in imploring (requesting) for His forgiveness and repeatedly
reciting; "A'fwaka A'fwaka"

[Thy Pardon, Thy Pardon] [Sayyid, Hadi Husayn, (1988), pg 128]
