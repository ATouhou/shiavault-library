Neighbours First
================

From ***Unto Thee We Grant...***

The child had made it a habit to rise regularly in the small hours of
the night and join his mother in her nightly prayers called Tahajjud. He
observed that his mother prayed for all Muslim men and women. She
remembered them by name and prayer for their prosperity and well being.

O Allah, pardon them their sins and let Your grace embrace them in all
their dealings.

On this particular morning, he decided to ask. When the prayers were
over, he asked:

Mother, you pray for all every day. Not a word for yourself or any one
in the family?

Bibi Fatima, blessings and salutations to her, said: 'O Hasan, remember
one thing. Neighbors first and then the house.'
