Introduction
============

In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful

Immeasurable thanks are due to God, Whose reality no intellect can
fathom and the knowledge of whose Being no thought or science can
apprehend. Any expression describing Him, if affirmative, does not enter
the conceiving mind without the traces of anthropomorphism, and if
negative, is not conceived by it in a manner secure from the scandalous
negation of attributes (ta'til). Therefore, the leader of the elect, the
exemplar of the saints (awliya') and the Seal of the Prophets, Muhammad
Mustafa, may God bless him and his Household, said:

I cannot reckon Thy praise. Thou art only as Thou hast praised Thyself,
and Thou art above what the describers say (in describing Thee). 1

May a myriad fold greetings, kudos, and blessings be upon his sacred
soul and on the spirits of the pure ones of his Household, especially
the Infallible Imams, as well as the elect of his Companions, by Thy
right, O God!

After writing the book entitled Nasirian Ethics (akhlaq-e Nasiri),
which discusses the noble dispositions and the sound policies of moral
conduct according to the way of the philosophers (hukama'), the writer
of this treatise and the author of this discourse, Muhammad al-Tusi, had
it in his mind to write a concise treatise describing the ways of the
awliya' and the methods of the seers according to the principles of the
wayfarers of the Path (tariqah) and the seekers of the Truth (haqiqah)
and one based on the principles of reason and tradition, containing the
subtle theoretical and practical points that constitute the kernel and
essence of that discipline.

However, countless preoccupations and vain obstacles did not permit him
to carry that out, and what he had in mind could not emerge from
potentiality to actuality, until this moment, when this idea
materialized at the compelling behest of his honour ... , the master of
the sword and the pen, the elect of the eminent from among the Arabs and
the non-Arabs, the sun of the truth and the faith (shams al-haqq wa
al-din), the glory of Islam and Muslims,

the chief of the viziers, the holder of the high office of the
dominions, the pride of the elite and the nobility, the embodiment of
justice and benefaction, the world's most meritorious and perfect, the
refuge and shelter of Iran, the lover of the awliya', Muhammad ibn Sahib
al-Said Baha' al-Din Muhammad al-Juwayni, may God strengthen his helpers
and increase his power twofold.

As opportunity became available and time and circumstance became
conducive, the plan at last materialized, to the extent that the mind
would assist and was feasible in view of the various obstacles and
numerous preoccupations, of compiling, in compliance with his order and
in obedience to his command, this brief treatise in several chapters,
expositing those truths and describing those subtleties. In every
chapter, he has for witness' sake cited a verse of the glorious
revelation, which is such that:

Falsehood cannot find way into it from before it or behind it.
(41:42)

And where he could not find something that was expository of the
purpose at hand he has confined himself to that which was more
accessible. He has named it Awsaf al-ashraf and were it to be viewed
with favour by his noble eye, its purpose would be achieved; otherwise,
in view of what has been already stated in way of excuse,

it is hoped that his noble self, with his noble disposition and sublime
virtue, will overlook its lapses and cover them with the mantle of his
forgiving grace, so that God, the Glorious and the Exalted, may bestow
upon him of divine grace and everlasting sovereignty in the real world
in the same way as He has chosen him for mastery and leadership in this
realm of appearance. Indeed He is Gracious, and answers prayer.


**Prelude**

It would be proper at the outset to mention the contents of this brief
treatise. There is no doubt that when one contemplates over one's state
(reading ahwal, instead of af'al), one would find oneself to be in need
of something besides oneself, and that which is in need of something
else is deficient.

And when one becomes aware of his deficiency, there arises in his inner
being a yearning to seek perfection. This prompts him to undertake a
journey in the quest of perfection, which is called wayfaring' (suluk)
by the people of the Tariqah (the mystic path). And one who desires to
undertake this journey stands in need of six things.

First, the guidance for this journey and that which is necessary for
the journey to be made, and this is similar to the provisions that one
needs for a physical journey.

Second, overcoming the hindrances and obstacles in the way of the
journey.

Third, making the movement which takes one from the starting point to
the destination; it consists of wayfaring and the states of the wayfarer
during its' course.

Fourth, the states which occur to the wayfarer in the course of his
wayfaring from the start of the journey to the point of destination.

Fifth, the states that befall those who have completed the journey (ahl
al-wusul) after wayfaring.

Sixth, the end of the journey and the culmination of the way faring
which is called fana' (annihilation) in tawhid (Divine Unity).

Each of these consists of several matters, excepting the end of the
journey wherein there is no multiplicity. We shall discuss these six
matters in six chapters, each having six sections, with the exception of
the last chapter which does not allow of any multiplicity.

It should be known that in the same way as in a physical journey the
traversing of every part of the road depends on traversing of a
preceding part and is succeeded by another part-excepting the last
part-each of these states is an intermediate stage between the end of
the preceding stage and the beginning of the next,


so that every stage is the sought after goal as its previous stage
nears its end and is left behind and abandoned as one approaches its
succeeding stage. Hence every stage is a perfection in relation to its
previous stage and remaining in it is a defect when one ought to turn to
the next desirable stage. Hence the Prophet, may God bless him and his
Household, has said:

One whose two days are equal is a loser. 2
And that is why it has been said:

Merits of the virtuous are vices for the saints. 3


**Chapter 1 : Concerning the Starting Point of the Journey and its
Requisites**

This chapter consists of six topics, each of which is discussed in the
following sections:

Section one: on faith (iman)
Section two: on steadfastness (thubat)
Section three: on intention (niyyah)
Section four: on truthfulness (sidq)
Section five: on penitence (inabah)
Section six: on sincerity (ikhlas)


**Section One: On Faith**

God, the Exalted, has said:

Those who believe and obscure not their faith with wrongdoing, theirs
is safety; and they are rightly guided. (6:82)

Iman literally means 'affirmation,' that is, believing, and in the
terminology of the seers means a particular kind of affirmation, an
affirmation of that which is known for certain and has been declared by
the Messenger, may peace be upon him. The knowledge (ma'rifah) of the
Prophet is inseparable from the knowledge of the Sustainer, the
Powerful, the Knowing, the Living, the Perceiving, the Hearing, and the
Seeing One, Who wills and speaks and has sent the Messengers and
revealed the Qur'an to Muhammad Mustafa, may God bless him and his
Household, and set forth the laws, the duties, and the sunan, the lawful
and the unlawful, as affirmed by the consensus of the entire Ummah.

Hence faith consists of these matters, neither more nor less. For if
lesser, it would not be faith at all, and if more, the increase will be
a higher degree of faith, contiguous to faith. And the sign of belief is
to know, to say, and to do that which should be known, said, and done
and to refrain from that which has been forbidden. These pertain to
righteous conduct and are subject to increase and decrease and are an
essential part of the aforesaid affirmation. That is why in all the
places the mention of faith is accompanied with that of righteous
action, as in the following [Qur'anic] statement Those who believe and
perform righteous deeds ... . (2:25)

And it should be known that faith has various degrees, the lowest of
which is verbal confession. The verses:

O you who believe, believe in God and His Messenger and the Book that
He has sent down on His Messenger. (4:136)

The Bedouins say: 'We believe: Say (unto them O Muhammad): 'Ye believe
not; but say, "We submit;" for faith has not yet entered into your
hearts. (Yet, if you obey Cod and His Messenger, He will not with-hold
from you aught of your deeds. Cod is indeed Forgiving, Merciful.')
(49:74)

Above that is faith by imitation, which is a convinced affirmation of
that which must be affirmed, but it is subject to decline. When
convinced affirmation is achieved it is necessarily accompanied by
righteous action:

The (true) believers are those only who believe in God and His
Messenger and afterward doubt not, but strive (with their wealth and
their lives for the cause o f God. Such are the sincere.) (49:15)

Superior to this faith in the Unseen, in accordance with [the words of
the Qura'an] who believe in the Unseen' (2:3), which represents inward
faith in transcendence, as if one were affirming something on the other
side of a curtain. Superior to it is the faith of those concerning whom
He says:

They only are the (true) believers whose hearts tremor when God is
mentioned, and when the revelations of God are recited to them they
increase their faith, and in their Lord put their trust, who perform the
prayer, and expend of what We have provided them, those in truth are the
believers; (they have degrees with their Lord, and forgiveness and
generous provision.) (8:2-3)

This is the rank of perfect faith. Next to it is convinced faith, to be
explained later on, and that is the ultimate degree of faith.

The minimum degree of faith lesser than which is not appropriate in
wayfaring, is faith by imitation and faith in the Unseen, for mere
verbal faith is not actually faith. To this refers the following
statement of the Qur'an:

And the most part of them believe not in God, but they associate other
gods with Him. (12:106)

Wayfaring with a tranquility of the soul is possible when there is
convinced belief in the existence of the absolutely perfect Being, the
Creator. The acquisition of such a belief is extremely simple and can be
obtained with a little effort.

**Section Two: On Steadfastness**

God, the Glorious and the Exalted, has said:

God confirms by a stable belief those who have faith in the life of the
world and in the Hereafter ... . (14:27)

Unless faith is not characterized by steadfastness, the tranquility of
the soul, which is essential for the quest of perfection, is not
obtained, because one who is shaky in his belief cannot be a seeker of
perfection. The steadfastness of faith depends on achieving the
certitude that there is perfection and the Perfect Being. Without this
certitude the quest of perfection does not materialize, and until the
resolve to seek perfection and the steadiness of this resolve is not
achieved, wayfaring is not possible.

One who makes the resolve without being steadfast in it is like one
bewildered whom the devils have kidnapped in the earth' (6:71, The
bewildered man has no resolve, and until he is resolute enough to
advance in a direction, no movement, journey, or wayfaring will take
place, and if there is any movement at all, it is accompanied with
anxiety and hesitation and is fruitless and futile.

The cause of steadfastness is an insight into the truth believed in,
the delight of having found it, and a perseverance in this state as a
habitual condition of the inner self. That is why the performance of
righteous works by those who have this steadfastness is perpetual as
well as necessary.

**Section Three: On Intention**

God, the Exalted, has said:

Say (O Muhammad), 'Indeed, my prayer and my worship, my living and my
dying, are for God, the Lord of the Worlds.' (6:162)

Niyyah means intention, and intention is a link between knowledge and
action. For unless one knows at first that he has to do something, one
cannot intend to do it and unless there is intention one cannot carry
out an act. The starting point in wayfaring is intention, the intention
to reach a certain destination, and since the goal is to acquire
perfection from the Absolutely Perfect, the intention should be one of
acquiring nearness to the Almighty, Who is Absolute Perfection.

Such being the case, intention by itself is better than action when
taken alone, for The believer's intention is better than his works. 4

For intention is like the soul and action like the body, and (The
intrinsic worth of) works only depends on the intentions (that lie
behind theme) 5 that is, the life of the body is through the soul. And
[as the Messenger of God has declared] Every man receives what he has
intended: one who has migrated towards God and His Messenger migrates
towards God and His Messenger, and one whose migration is to achieve a
mundane purpose or to marry a woman, his migration will take him to the
intended goal of his migration. 6

A good work accomplished with the intention to seek nearness to God
will certainly achieve its due perfection, in accordance with the
statement of God, the Exalted, There is no good in much of their secret
conferences save him who enjoins charity and propriety and peace-making
among the people. Whoso does that, seeking the good pleasure of God, We
shall bestow on him a mighty reward. (4:114)

**Section Four: On Truthfulness**

God, above all descriptions is He, has said:

O you who believe, observe your duty to God and be with the truthful
(al­ sadiqin). (9:119)

Sidq literally means speaking the truth and being true in one's
promises. Here by truthfulness is meant the truthfulness of speech as
well as that of intention and resolution (azm) and fulfillment under all
circumstances of the promises made by one.

Siddiq is one who is truthful in all these matters as a matter of
habit, and that which is contrary to fact in whatsoever manner, neither
itself nor its trace is found in him. The ulama' have said that if one
is such his dreams too would be true and come true. The verse:

(Among the believers are) men who truly fulfill the promise they have
made with God, (33:23)

has been revealed concerning them. The truthful have been described as
standing in the same rank as the Apostles and the martyrs:

(Whoso obeys God and the Messenger), they are with those unto whom God
has shown favour, of the prophets, the truthful, and the martyrs and the
righteous, (the best company are they). (4:69)

And such great prophets as Ibrahim and I'dris have been described as
truthful ones,' with the words:

Indeed, he was a truthful one, a prophet. (19:41, 19:56)

And concerning others it has been said:

(And We bestowed upon them of Our mercy), and assigned to them true and
sublime speech. (19:50)

And since the straight path is the shortest path to the goal, one who
walks straight is the most likely to reach his intended destination, God
willing.

**Section Five: On Penitence (Inabah)**

God, the Exalted and the Glorious, has said:

Turn unto Him penitent, and surrender unto Him, (before there come to
you the chastisement, where after you wilt not be helped). (39:54)
Inabah means turning to God and attending to Him. It consists of three
things. First, turning with one's inner self, so that it is always
turned towards God, the Exalted, and to seek nearness to Him in all
one's thoughts and intentions, and to this refer the words:

... And comes with a penitent heart. (50:33)

Second, to attend with one's speech, which means remembering Him and
His favours and to remember those who are nearer to Him, as referred to
in this verse: None pays heed save him who turns penitent (unto Him).
(40:13)

Third, (to turn to Him) in one's outward actions, which means being
always watchful of one's acts of obedience and worship. These must be
performed with the intention of seeking nearness, such as the obligatory
and the supererogatory prayers, abstaining from things avoided by the
leading figures of the faith, giving of charities, showing kindness to
God's creatures, procuring the means of their benefit and preventing the
causes of their harm, observing of rectitude in dealings, being just in
regard to oneself and one's kin, and, in summary, observing the laws of
the Shari'ah with the intent of acquiring nearness to God and seeking
His good pleasure. Indeed, He, the Exalted, has said:

(On the day when ... ) the paradise is brought nigh for the God f
eating, no longer distant. (And it is said): This is that which you were
promised. (It is) for every penitent and watchful one, who feareth the
Beneficent in secret and comes with a penitent heart. Enter it in peace.
This is the day of eternity. There they have all that they desire, and
there is more with Us. (50: 30-35)

**Section Six: On Sincerity (Ikhlas)**

God, the Glorious and the Exalted, has said:

And they were not commanded except to worship God, keeping religion
pure for Him ... . (98:5)

Ikhlas in Persian means vizheh kardan' (to make exclusive'), that is,
to purge a thing of everything else that has mingled with it. That which
is meant here is that all of one's speech and action should be for the
sake of seeking nearness to God, the Exalted, and exclusively for His
sake, without being adulterated with any worldly or otherworldly
purpose.

Indeed, to God belongs sincere religion. (39:3)

The opposite of sincerity is that there be some other purpose mingled
with it, such as the love of honour and property, good name, or the hope
of otherworldly reward, or salvation and deliverance from the
chastisement of hell, all of which are signs of shirk. Shirk is of two
kinds: open and concealed. Open shirk is idolatry, and all its other
forms consist of concealed shirk. The Messenger of God, may God bless
him and his Household, has said:

Amongst the people of my Ummah intentions contaminated with shirk are
more invisible than the creeping of a black ant on a black rock in a
dark night. 7

Shirk is the most destructive obstacle for the seeker of perfection in
wayfaring.

So let him who hopes for the encounter with his Lord, work
righteousness, and not include in his Lord's service anyone. (18:110)

And when the obstacle of concealed shirk is removed, wayfaring (suluk)
and attainment (wusul) become easy:

If one is sincere to God for forty days, springs of wisdom, emanating
from his heart, become manifest in his speech . 8

And safety from sin comes from God.
