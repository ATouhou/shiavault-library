Mukhtar comes back to Kufa
==========================

Al-Husain bin Numair withdrew his forces. He headed for Damascus. So,
the siege was over.

After four years' stay in Madina, Mukhtar decided to come back to Kufa.

After Yazeed's death, Ubaidullah bin Ziyad escaped to Damascus. The
people of Kufa took advantage of the situation and supported Abdullah
bin Zubair.

Abdullah bin Zubair appointed Abdullah bin Mutea, ruler over Kufa. Some
rulers who took part in the Karbala massacre supported the new ruler.

One day, one of them said:

*Your highness, the Prince, Mukhtar is more dangerous than Sulaiman.
Sulaiman went out to Kufa to fight the Shamian people, but Mukhtar wants
to get revenge on* *Imam Husayn's killers.*

Another said:

*I think you have to imprison him.*

The Prince accepted their ideas. Thus, he imprisoned Mukhtar.
