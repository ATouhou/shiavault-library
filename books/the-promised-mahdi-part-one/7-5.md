Chapter Five: Verses about the Rise of the Qaim
===============================================

**1-**

<p dir="rtl">
وَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابَ إِلَى أُمَّةٍ مَّعْدُودَةٍ
</p>

***“And if We hold back from them the punishment until a stated period
of time (reappearance of Imam Zamana (a.s.))…”(Surah Hud 11:8)***

<p dir="rtl">
لَّيَقُولُنَّ مَا يَحْبِسُهُ
</p>

*“…* they will certainly say: What prevents it (reappearance of Imam
Zamana)?”

<p dir="rtl">
أَلاَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمْ لَيْسَ مَصْرُوفًا عَنْهُمْ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا
كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِؤُونَ
</p>

***“Now surely on the day when it will come to them, it shall not be
averted from them and that which they scoffed at shall beset
them.”(Surah Hud 11:8)***

It is narrated from Amirul Momineen (a.s.) that he said in explanation
of this verse: “Ummatun Madooda” implies companions of Qaim of Aale
Muhammad (a.s.), who will be 313 in number.

And in*Tafsir Ayyashi* it is narrated from Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) that
he said: The Almighty Allah in a moment will gather the companions of
our Qaim like the dispersed clouds of autumn.

And in*Ghaibat Nomani* it is narrated from Ishaq bin Abdul Aziz from the
Imam (a.s.) that he said:

<p dir="rtl">
وَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابَ إِلَى أُمَّةٍ مَّعْدُودَةٍ
</p>

***“And if We hold back from them the punishment until a stated period
of time…”(Surah Hud 11:8)***

*This punishment is* reappearance of Imam Zamana (a.s.) and ‘Ummate
Madooda’ are his companions, who will be equal to the number of soldiers
of Battle of Badr (313 persons).

<p dir="rtl">
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَى بِآيَاتِنَا أَنْ أَخْرِجْ قَوْمَكَ مِنَ
الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ وَذَكِّرْهُمْ بِأَيَّامِ اللّهِ إِنَّ فِي
ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ
</p>

***“And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications, saying: Bring
forth your people from utter darkness into light and remind them of the
days of Allah; most surely there are signs in this for every patient,
grateful one.” (Surah Ibrahim 14:5)***

“The Days of Allah are three: The Day of the reappearance of the Qaim,
the Day of death and Judgment Day.”

In*Khisaal Saduq* it is narrated from Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) that he
said: “The Days of Allah are three: The Day of the reappearance of the
Qaim, the day of Rajat and Judgment Day. And also Saduq has narrated
this traditional report in*Maniul Akhbar* .

**3-**

<p dir="rtl">
وَقَضَيْنَا إِلَى بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ فِي الْكِتَابِ
</p>

***“And We had made known to the children of Israel in the Book…” (Surah
Bani Israel 17:4)***

That is*: And We made declaration to the Children of Israel in the Book,
that is, We gave them knowledge.* Then the address shifts from the
Children of Israel to the Ummah of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s.)
saying:

<p dir="rtl">
لَتُفْسِدُنَّ فِي الأَرْضِ مَرَّتَيْنِ
</p>

***“Most certainly you will make mischief in the land twice…” (Surah
Bani Israel 17:4)***

*That is (O Ummah of Muhammad), you will raise mischief on earth twice,*
alluding to the two certain individuals and their followers and their
breach of the covenant.

<p dir="rtl">
وَلَتَعْلُنَّ عُلُوًّا كَبِيرًا
</p>

***“…and most certainly you will behave insolently with great
insolence.”… (Surah Bani Israel 17:4)***

…that is, their claim of the caliphate. When the promise of the first of
the two came to pass, that is, the Battle of Jamal, We sent against you
Our servants, men of great prowess, meaning Amirul Momineen (a.s.) and
his companions. They went to and fro in the lands, that is, they
searched for you and killed you. Then We gave you back the turn to
prevail over them, meaning, We gave the Umayyads back the turn to
prevail over Aale Muhammad (a.s.) and We succored you through wealth and
progeny and We made your band of greater number compared to Husain Ibne
Ali (a.s.) and his companions, when the womenfolk of Aale Muhammad
(a.s.) were taken hostage. If you should do good, you do good for your
own selves and if you should do evil, you do it against yourselves. So
when the second promise comes to pass, meaning the Qaim (a.s.) and his
companions, so they may make discountenance you, meaning rendering their
countenances dark, and so they may enter the Mosque as they entered the
first time, meaning, the Messenger of Allah and his companions, and to
destroy utterly that which they ascended to, that is, they will prevail
over you and will kill you. Then the verse shifts to Aale Muhammad
(a.s.) and says: Perchance your Lord will have mercy on you, that is, He
will grant you victory over your enemy. Then it addresses the Umayyads,
If you again return, We will return, that is, If you return with
Sufyani, We will return with the Qaim from Aale Muhammad (a.s.).

<p dir="rtl">
أَوْ يُحْدِثُ لَهُمْ ذِكْرًا
</p>

***“…or that it may produce a reminder for them.” (Surah Taha
20:113)”***

*…* that is, remembrance of the reappearance of the Qaim and advent of
the Sufyani.

**5-**

<p dir="rtl">
فَلَمَّا أَحَسُّوا بَأْسَنَا إِذَا هُم مِّنْهَا يَرْكُضُونَ
</p>

***“So when they felt Our punishment, lo! they began to fly from it.”
(Surah Anbiya 21:12)***

That is: When they perceived Our might, behold they ran headlong out of
it.

<p dir="rtl">
لَا تَرْكُضُوا وَارْجِعُوا إِلَى مَا أُتْرِفْتُمْ فِيهِ وَمَسَاكِنِكُمْ
لَعَلَّكُمْ تُسْأَلُونَ
</p>

***“Do not fly (now) and come back to what you were made to lead easy
lives in and to your dwellings, haply you will be questioned.” (Surah
Anbiya 21:13)***

When they, meaning the Umayyads, sensed Our wrath, that is, the Qaim
from Aale Muhammad (a.s.), behold, they ran headlong out of it. Do not
run away and return to what you were made to lead easy lives in and to
your dwellings, haply you will be questioned, that is, return to the
treasures you have treasured.

It is mentioned in tradition that when Imam Zamana (a.s.) will reappear,
Bani Umayyah will cry in terror and enter Rome and the Qaim (a.s.) will
search for them. Then he will take them out of Rome and will demand from
them the treasures, which they have garnered. So they will say, as Allah
has quoted them:

<p dir="rtl">
قَالُوا يَا وَيْلَنَا إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَالِمِينَ فَمَا زَالَت تِّلْكَ
دَعْوَاهُمْ حَتَّى جَعَلْنَاهُمْ حَصِيدًا خَامِدِينَ
</p>

***“They said: O woe to us! surely we were unjust. And this ceased not
to be their cry till We made them cut off, extinct.” (Surah Anbiya
21:14-15)***

Imam (a.s.) said: That will be through the sword and under the shade of
the sword of the Qaim of Aale Muhammad (a.s.).

All of this is in the past tense but it refers to the future. It is of
the verses we mentioned that their realization is after their
revelation.

<p dir="rtl">
وَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِي الزَّبُورِ مِن بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ أَنَّ الْأَرْضَ
يَرِثُهَا عِبَادِيَ الصَّالِحُونَ
</p>

***“And certainly We wrote in the Book after the reminder that (as for)
the land, My righteous servants shall inherit it.” (Surah Anbiya
21:105)***

And We inscribed in the Psalms following the Reminder. He said: “All
Divine Books are Reminders.” My honorable servants shall inherit the
earth. He said: “That is the Qaim (a.s.) and his companions.”

*The author says: According to Ali bin Ibrahim,* “All Divine Books are
Reminders” means that the verse means, “After We wrote in the other
revealed Books.” Other interpreters have said that the Torah is intended
by the Zabur, which we translated above as Psalms. Some have said that
Zabur means all of the Divine Books and “remembrance” is the Protected
Tablet (*Lawh Mahfuz* ).

<p dir="rtl">
أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَاتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُوا وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ
عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ
</p>

***“Permission (to fight) is given to those upon whom war is made
because they are oppressed, and most surely Allah is well able to assist
them;” (Surah Hajj 22:39)***

Ibne Abi Umair narrates on the authority of Abdullah Ibne Miskan from
Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) in the context of the holy verse: “The Ahle
Sunnat says that this verse was revealed about the Messenger of Allah
(s.a.w.s.) when the Quraish expelled him from Mecca. However, it is the
Qaim (a.s.) when he rises to avenge the blood of Husain (a.s.), saying,
‘We are the heirs of the blood and the seekers of vengeance.’”

And in*Ghaibat Nomani* it is narrated from*Asbatul Wasiyya* of Masudi
from the Imam (a.s.) that he said: the verse of:

<p dir="rtl">
أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَاتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُوا وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ
عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ
</p>

***“Permission (to fight) is given to those upon whom war is made
because they are oppressed, and most surely Allah is well able to assist
them;” (Surah Hajj 22:39)***

…was revealed about our Qaim and his companions.

**8-**

<p dir="rtl">
وَمَنْ عَاقَبَ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبَ بِهِ ثُمَّ بُغِيَ عَلَيْهِ
لَيَنصُرَنَّهُ اللَّهُ
</p>

***“That (shall be so); and he who retaliates with the like of that with
which he has been afflicted and he has been oppressed, Allah will most
certainly aid him…” (Surah Hajj 22:60)***

And whosoever chastises, that is, the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s.) to
the extent that he was chastised, that is, when they desired to murder
him, and then again is oppressed. Surely Allah will help him through
Qaim (a.s.) from his progeny.

**9- Abul Jarud narrates from Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) about the
verse:**

<p dir="rtl">
الَّذِينَ إِن مَّكَّنَّاهُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَقَامُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتَوُا
الزَّكَاةَ
</p>

***“Those who, should We establish them in the land, will keep up prayer
and pay the poor-rate…” (Surah Hajj 22:41)***

“These are the qualities of Aale Muhammad (a.s.) to the last of the
Imams, the Mahdi and his companions. Allah will give them the kingdom of
the earth, its easts and its wests. Through him, He will manifest the
religion and through him and his companions, He will eradicate heresy
and falsity, as the foolish have tried to eradicate righteousness, until
it will not be visible where is oppression.*And they will be encouraging
the right and discouraging the wrong.”*

**10-**

<p dir="rtl">
إِن نَّشَأْ نُنَزِّلْ عَلَيْهِم مِّن السَّمَاء آيَةً فَظَلَّتْ
أَعْنَاقُهُمْ لَهَا خَاضِعِينَ
</p>

***“If We please, We should send down upon them a sign from the heaven
so that their necks should stoop to it.” (Surah Shoara 26:4)***

It is narrated from Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) that he said: “Their necks
(that is, the Umayyads) will bow. The sign will be the call from the
heavens on the name of the Qaim of Aale Muhammad (a.s.).”

**11-**

<p dir="rtl">
أَمَّن يُجِيبُ الْمُضْطَرَّ إِذَا دَعَاهُ وَيَكْشِفُ السُّوءَ
وَيَجْعَلُكُمْ خُلَفَاء الْأَرْضِ
</p>

***“Or, Who answers the distressed one when he calls upon Him and
removes the evil, and He will make you successors in the earth.” (Surah
Naml 27:62)***

It is narrated from Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) that he said: “This verse
has been revealed about the Qaim (a.s.). He is, by Allah,*the
constrained.* When he prays two*rakats at* Maqam and supplicates to
Allah, He will answer him and will remove the evil and will appoint him
the heir on the earth.”

**12-**

<p dir="rtl">
وَلَئِن جَاء نَصْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ
</p>

***“…and if there come assistance from your Lord…” (Surah Ankabut
29:10)***

That is the assistance of Qaim of Aale Muhammad (a.s.).

<p dir="rtl">
لَيَقُولُنَّ إِنَّا كُنَّا مَعَكُمْ أَوَلَيْسَ اللَّهُ بِأَعْلَمَ بِمَا
فِي صُدُورِ الْعَالَمِينَ
</p>

***“…they would most certainly say: Surely we were with you. What! is
not Allah the best knower of what is in the breasts of mankind.” (Surah
Ankabut 29:10)***

**13-**

<p dir="rtl">
وَلَمَنِ انتَصَرَ بَعْدَ ظُلْمِهِ
</p>

***“And whoever defends himself after his being oppressed…” (Surah Shura
42:41)***

It is narrated from Abu Hamza Thumali from Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.)
that he said: “That is, the Qaim and his companions.”

<p dir="rtl">
فَأُوْلَئِكَ مَا عَلَيْهِم مِّن سَبِيلٍ
</p>

***“…these it is against whom there is no way (to blame).” (Surah Shura
42:41)***

*“…against them there is no way.* When he rises, the Qaim and his
companions will seek Divine help against the Umayyads, the falsifiers
and the*Nasibis.”*

<p dir="rtl">
إِنَّمَا السَّبِيلُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ يَظْلِمُونَ النَّاسَ وَيَبْغُونَ فِي
الْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ أُوْلَئِكَ لَهُم عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ
</p>

***“The way (to blame) is only against those who oppress men and revolt
in the earth unjustly; these shall have a painful punishment.” (Surah
Shura 42:42)***

“This has been denoted in the above verse.”

This traditional report is also narrated from Jabir Jofi from Imam
Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) in*Tafsir Ibrahim* .

**14-**

<p dir="rtl">
اقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ
</p>

***“The hour drew nigh…” (Surah Qamar 54:1)***

It is narrated that it refers to the uprising of the Qaim (a.s.).

**15-**

<p dir="rtl">
مُدْهَامَّتَانِ
</p>

***“Both inclining to blackness.” (Surah Rahman 55:64)***

It is narrated from Ahmad bin Idris from Ashari from Ibne Yazid from Ali
bin Hammad Khazaz from Husain bin Ahmad Minqari from Yunus bin Dhibyan
from Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) about this verse that:

“During the rule of Imam Zamana (a.s.), Mecca and Medina will be
connected with palm trees.”

**16-**

<p dir="rtl">
يُرِيدُونَ لِيُطْفِؤُوا نُورَ اللَّهِ بِأَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَاللَّهُ مُتِمُّ
نُورِهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَافِرُونَ
</p>

***“They desire to put out the light of Allah with their mouths but
Allah will perfect His light, though the unbelievers may be averse.”
(Surah Saff 61:8)***

Imam (a.s.) said: This will be through the Qaim from Aale Muhammad
(a.s.) when he rises up to manifest Islam over all other religions, so
that no deity other than Allah is worshipped. It is signified by the
narration, “He will fill the earth with equity as it will be replete
with oppression and inequity.”

**17-**

<p dir="rtl">
وَأُخْرَى تُحِبُّونَهَا نَصْرٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَفَتْحٌ قَرِيبٌ
</p>

***“And yet another (blessing) that you love: help from Allah and a
victory near at hand…” (Surah Saff 61:13)***

It will be happen in this life, through the victory of the Qaim (a.s.).

**18-**

<p dir="rtl">
حَتَّى إِذَا رَأَوْا مَا يُوعَدُونَ فَسَيَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَضْعَفُ
نَاصِرًا وَأَقَلُّ عَدَدًا
</p>

***“Until when they see what they are threatened with, then shall they
know who is weaker in helpers and fewer in number.” (Surah Jinn
72:24)***

This is the Qaim and Amirul Momineen (a.s.). Then they will know who is
weaker in helpers and fewer in numbers.

**19-**

إِنَّهُمْ يَكِيدُونَ كَيْدًا {15} وَأَكِيدُ كَيْدًا

***“Surely they will make a scheme, and I (too) will make a scheme.”
(Surah Tariq 86:15-16)***

<p dir="rtl">
فَمَهِّلِ الْكَافِرِينَ أَمْهِلْهُمْ رُوَيْدًا
</p>

***“So grant the unbelievers a respite: let them alone for a while.”
(Surah Tariq 86:17)***

That is,*O,* Muhammad, respite them. Let them alone for a while until
the Qaim (a.s.) rises and avenges for Me from the despots and the
tyrants of Quraish and Umayyads and the rest of the people.

**20-**

<p dir="rtl">
وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى
</p>

***“I swear by the night when it draws a veil…” (Surah Lail 92:1)***

It is narrated from Ahmad bin Idris from Muhammad bin Jabbar from Ibne
Abi Umair from Hammad bin Uthman from Muhammad Ibne Muslim, saying, I
asked Abu Ja’far (a.s.) about the holy verse:

<p dir="rtl">
وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى
</p>

***“I swear by the night when it draws a veil.” (Surah Lail 92:1)***

The Imam said: “The night here is the second person. He drew veil over
Amirul Momineen (a.s.) during his reign, which he enjoyed over Amirul
Momineen (a.s.). Amirul Momineen (a.s.) was ordered to forebear during
their rule.”

Muhammad Ibne Muslim said:

<p dir="rtl">
وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّى
</p>

***“And the day when it shines in brightness…
(Surah Lail 92:1)***

The Imam said: “The day is the Qaim from us, the Ahle Bayt. When he
rises, he will defeat the rule of falsity. The Quran has used many
parables about it for the people, however, the Divine words are
addressed to His Messenger (a.s.) and us and no one other than us knows
their meaning.”

**21-**

<p dir="rtl">
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَصْبَحَ مَاؤُكُمْ غَوْرًا فَمَن يَأْتِيكُم
بِمَاء مَّعِينٍ
</p>

***“Say: Have you considered if your water should go down, who is it
then that will bring you flowing water?” (Surah Mulk 67:30)***

That is: O Prophet, Say to the people, ‘Have you thought if your Imam
should go absent, who will bring you an Imam like him?” In this verse,
Imam Zamana (a.s.) is compared to water, which is the cause of life of
all the things and the interpretation of this verse is that if the Imam
disappears from your sight, who will make him appear again?

Narrated to us Muhammad bin Ja’far from Muhammad bin Ahmad from Qasim
bin Alaa from Ismail bin Ali Fazari from Muhammad Ibne Jamhur from
Faddala bin Ayyub that he said:

I asked Imam Reza (a.s.) about this verse and he said: “Your water is
your gateways, the Imams. The Imams are the gateways to Allah.*‘Who*
will*bring you running* water’ means, ‘Who will bring the knowledge of
the Imam?’” (And who will open those gateways for you?).

This traditional report is also mentioned in*Kafi, Ghaibat Nomani*
and*Ikmaaluddin* of Saduq on the authority of Imam Musa Kazim (a.s.).

Then the Imam said: By Allah, these verses have not been realized so
far, but will be realized in the future.

**22-**

<p dir="rtl">
هُوَ الَّذِي أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُ بِالْهُدَى وَدِينِ الْحَقِّ لِيُظْهِرَهُ
عَلَى الدِّينِ كُلِّهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْمُشْرِكُونَ
</p>

***“He it is Who sent His Apostle with the guidance and the true
religion, that He may make it overcome the religions, all of them,
though the polytheists may be averse.” (Surah Saff 61:9)***

This verse was revealed about the Qaim of Aale Muhammad (a.s.). He is
the Imam that Allah will uplift and manifest him over all religions and
he will fill the earth with equity and justice, as it is replete with
oppression and inequity. This is of the verses the materialization
thereof is after their revelation.

**23-** It is mentioned in Khisaal from Attar from Saad from Ibne Yazid
from Muhammad bin Hasan Maithami from Muthanna Hannat that he said: I
heard Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) say:

“The Days of Allah are three: The Day Qaim will arise, the Day of the
Return and the Day of Judgment.”

**24-** Shaykh Saduq has mentioned in Thawabul Amaal from Ibne Walid
from Saffar from Ibad bin Sulaiman from his father that he said:

I recited to Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.):

<p dir="rtl">
هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ الْغَاشِيَةِ
</p>

***“Has not there come to you the news of the overwhelming calamity?”
(Surah Ghashiya 88:1)***

The Imam said: “Qaim will overwhelm them with the sword.”

I recited:

<p dir="rtl">
وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَاشِعَةٌ
</p>

***“(Some) faces on that day shall be downcast…” (Surah Ghashiya
88:2)***

The Imam said: “It means that they will be humble and will not be able
to defy.”

I said:

<p dir="rtl">
عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ
</p>

***“Entering into burning fire…” (Surah Ghashiya 88:3)***

The Imam said: “They labored not according to what Allah, the Exalted,
revealed. They appointed other than the Guardians of the Order.”

<p dir="rtl">
تَصْلَى نَارًا حَامِيَةً
</p>

***“Entering into burning fire…” (Surah Ghashiya 88:4)***

He said: “They will enter the fire of wars in this life in the time of
the Qaim and the fire of Hell in the hereafter.”

**25-**

<p dir="rtl">
يَوْمَ يَأْتِي بَعْضُ آيَاتِ رَبِّكَ لاَ يَنفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا
لَمْ تَكُنْ آمَنَتْ مِن قَبْلُ
</p>

***“…On the day when some of the signs of your Lord shall come, its
faith shall not profit a soul which did not believe before…” (Surah Anam
6:158)***

Shaykh Saduq has in*Ikmaaluddin* and*Thawabul Amaal* narrated on the
authority of his father from Saad from Ibne Abil Khattab from Ibne
Mahbub from Ibne Raab from Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) that he said: “The
signs are the Imams and the Awaited Sign is the Qaim (a.s.). On that
Day, one’s belief will not benefit him, has he not already believed
before his uprising with the sword, even if he may have believed in his
forefathers.”

**26-**

<p dir="rtl">
فَلَا أُقْسِمُ بِالْخُنَّسِ الْجَوَارِ الْكُنَّسِ
</p>

***“But nay! I swear by the stars. That run their course (and) hide
themselves…” (Surah Takwir 81:15-16)***

Shaykh Saduq has narrated in Ikmaaluddin from his father and Ibne Walid
together from Saad and Himyari from Ahmad bin Husain from Umar bin Yazid
from Husain bin Rabi from Muhammad bin Ishaq from Asad bin Thalaba from
Umme Hani that she said:

I met Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) and asked him about the above verse and
he replied: “An Imam who will go into hiding, when all who know him will
be gone, in the year two hundred and sixty and then he will appear like
a blazing meteor in the darkness of the night. If one should live up to
that time, his heart shall find solace.”

The same report is also mentioned in*Ghaibat Tusi* and*Ghaibat Nomani* .

*The author says:* The reason that the word “stars” has come in plural
form could be to show veneration for the Imam of the Age (a.s.) or for
the purpose of emphasis in his being the last and that his appearance
will encompass the appearance of all the Imams, peace be with them,

considering their Rajat. It can also mean that his appearance is as
great as if all of the Imams were to appear.

**27-**

<p dir="rtl">
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَصْبَحَ مَاؤُكُمْ غَوْرًا فَمَن يَأْتِيكُم
بِمَاء مَّعِينٍ
</p>

***“Say: Have you considered if your water should go down, who is it
then that will bring you flowing water?” (Surah Mulk 67:30)***

It is narrated from Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) that he said: “This verse
is revealed about the Qaim. It implies that if your Imam goes into
hiding from you, while you don’t know where he is, who will bring you an
apparent Imam who can bring you the news of the heavens and the earth
and the orders and prohibitions of Allah, the Exalted.” Then the Imam
said: “This verse has not been actualized as yet and it will be
actualized in the future.”

***“Those who believe in the unseen…” (Surah Baqarah 2:1-3)***

Shaykh Saduq in*Ikmaaluddin has narrated* from Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.)
that he said: “Those who believe in the rise*of* the Qaim (a.s.) that it
is true.”

***“Alif Lam Mim. This Book, there is no doubt in it, is a guide to
those who guard (against evil). Those who believe in the unseen…” (Surah
Baqarah 2:1-3)***

Also in the same book, it is narrated from Yahya Ibne Abul Qasim that he
said: I asked Imam Sadiq (a.s.) about these verses and he said: “The
pious are the Shia*of* Ali (a.s.). As for the unseen: it is the Hujjah
gone into occultation. The evidence of that is the saying of Allah:

<p dir="rtl">
إِنَّمَا الْغَيْبُ لِلّهِ فَانْتَظِرُواْ إِنِّي مَعَكُم مِّنَ

***“Say: Have you considered if your water should go down, who is it
then that will bring you flowing water?” (Surah Mulk 67:30)***

It is mentioned in*Ikmaaluddin* that Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) said about
this verse: “Say have you thought if your Imam should disappear from
you, who will bring you a new Imam?”

***“Know that Allah gives life to the earth after its death; indeed, We

In*Ghaibat* of Shaykh Tusi through the same chain of narration from Ibne
Abbas about the verse it is narrated that he said: “It means that the
earth will be restituted through the Qaim of Aale Muhammad (a.s.) after
its death, that is, after the inequity of its rulers. We explained to
you the signs, through the Qaim*of* Aale Muhammad (a.s.), so perhaps you
may understand.”

Ibne Husain Ibne Ali Ibne Abi Talib (a.s.) said with regard to the

It is narrated in*Ghaibat Tusi* that these verses were also revealed
about the Mahdi and his companions. In*Kanzul Fawaid* also this report
is narrated through another channel.

It is narrated in*Ghaibat Tusi* from Amirul Momineen (a.s.) that he said

In*Tafsir Ayyashi* it is narrated from Zurarah from Imam Ja’far Sadiq
(a.s.) about this verse that, “It has always been the case since Allah
created Adam that there has been a chance for God and a chance for

In*Tafsir Ayyashi* it is narrated from Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) and
Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) that they said: The day of the greater
pilgrimage is the uprising of the Qaim and the announcement of his call
to the people.”

The author says: This is the esoteric interpretation of the verse.

said: “This

religion of the Prophet reaches where the night reaches, so much so that
there will be no polytheism on the face of the earth, as said by Allah:

***“Do they then who plan evil (deeds) feel secure (of this) that Allah

*In Tafsir Ayyashi it is narrated from Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) that
he said:* “The covenant of the Messenger of Allah reached Ali Ibne
Husain and then Muhammad Ibne Ali. Then Allah will do what He desires.
They adhere to it when a man from them rises and with him are three
hundred men and the standard of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s.). He is
heading to Medina until he passes by Baidha and says, ‘This is the place
of the people who will be swallowed.’

***“Do they then who plan evil (deeds) feel secure (of this) that Allah
will not cause the earth to swallow them or that punishment may not
overtake them from whence they do not perceive?” (Surah Nahl 16:45)***

He replied: “They are the enemies of Allah and they will be deformed,
beaten and drawn into the earth.”

**46- It is narrated from Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) regarding the
verse:**

<p dir="rtl">
وَقَضَيْنَا إِلَى بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ فِي الْكِتَابِ لَتُفْسِدُنَّ فِي

***“And We had made known to the children of Israel in the Book: Most

killing of Imam Husain (a.s.)…

<p dir="rtl">
وَلَتَعْلُنَّ عُلُوًّا كَبِيرًا
</p>

***“…and most certainly you will behave insolently with great
insolence.”***

…refers to the killing of Imam Husain (a.s.).

<p dir="rtl">
فَإِذَا جَاء وَعْدُ أُولاهُمَا
</p>

***“…So when the promise for the first of the two came…”***

…refers to the event of avenging the blood of Imam Husain (a.s.)…

<p dir="rtl">

خِلاَلَ الدِّيَارِ
</p>

***“We sent over you Our servants, of mighty prowess, so they went to
and fro among the houses…”***

…it is about a nation Allah sends before the rise of the Qaim, who will
not leave any felon against Aale Muhammad (a.s.) but set him ablaze.

<p dir="rtl">
وَكَانَ وَعْدًا مَّفْعُولاً
</p>

***“…and it was a promise to be accomplished.”***

…before the rise of the Qaim”

</p>

***“Then We gave you back the turn to prevail against them, and aided
you with wealth and children and made you a numerous band.”***

This refers to the coming of Husain (a.s.) in Rajat with seventy of his
companions who were martyred with him. They will be wearing white cloaks
embroidered with gold; each cloak having two sides.

The news that reaches the people will be that Imam Husain (a.s.) has
come with his companions, so the believers will not doubt; and that he
is neither Dajjal nor Satan. The Qaim will be among the people at that
time. When it is established to the believers that he is Imam Husain
(a.s.) and when this news reaches Imam Qaim (a.s.), he will pass away.
So Imam Husain (a.s.) will perform his last rites as only an infallible
can perform the last rites of an infallible.

It is also mentioned that Imam Husain (a.s.) will rule for such a long
time that his eyebrows will droop over his eyes due to old age.

**47- It is narrated from Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) that he recited the
verse:**

<p dir="rtl">
بَعَثْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ عِبَادًا لَّنَا أُوْلِي بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ
</p>

***“We sent over you Our servants, of mighty prowess…” (Surah Isra
17:5)***

and said: “He is the Qaim and his companions are men of mighty prowess.”

**48-** Masada Ibne Sadaqah narrates from Imam Ja’far Ibne Muhammad,
from his father, from his grandfather, saying: Said Amirul Momineen
(a.s.) in his sermon, “People! Ask me before you lose me, for I have
extensive knowledge. So ask me before the eastern mischief tears apart
with its leg, while its wreckage will be treading. Accursed are its
hooter, its ally, its leader, its driver, and the one who seeks
protection from it. How abundant will be the ones who will raise its
cloak and call to its curse, while there is no place to protect it and
there is no one to have mercy on it! When times pass, you would say, ‘He
is dead, or killed, or gone to some valley.’ Then expect relief, which
is the materialization of this verse:

<p dir="rtl">
ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَا لَكُمُ الْكَرَّةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَمْدَدْنَاكُم
بِأَمْوَالٍ وَبَنِينَ وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ أَكْثَرَ نَفِيرًا
</p>

***“Then We gave you back the turn to prevail against them, and aided
you with wealth and children and made you a numerous band.” (Surah Bani
Israel 17:6)***

By the One Who split the seed and created the nations, they will live at
that time like blessed kings. No one of them will go from this world
until he has fathered one thousand sons, secure from every heresy and
mishap and hardship, and practicing according to the Book of God and the
conduct of His Apostle, in a time when all misgivings and doubts have
abandoned them.

It is mentioned in*Ghaibat Nomani* narrating from Imam Ja’far Sadiq
(a.s.) that when he was asked about the interpretation of this verse, he
said: An Imam from among us will disappear. Thus when the Almighty Allah
intends to make him appear, He will make a sign appear in his heart and
in this way he will appear with the command of the Almighty Allah.

In*Kanz Jamiul Fawaid* and*Tawilul Ayatul Dhahira* it is narrated from

verse and he said: “The nearer one is the rise of prices and the greater
one is the Mahdi with the sword.”

56- It is also mentioned in*Kanz Jamiul Fawaid* and*Tawilul Ayatul
Dhahira* that Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) said: “When the Qaim rises, he
will enter the Sacred Mosque (Masjidul Haraam) and face the Kaaba and
put the Maqam behind and pray two rakats. Then he will stand and say, ‘O
people! I am the nearest of all people to Adam. O people! I am the
nearest of all people to Ibrahim. O people! I am the nearest of all
people to Ismail. O people! I am the nearest of all people to Muhammad
(a.s.).’ Then he will raise his hands to the heavens and pray and
beseech so fervently that he falls on his face. This is the saying of
Allah:

***“Or, Who answers the distressed one when he calls upon Him and
removes the evil, and He will make you successors in the earth. Is there
a god with Allah? Little is it that you mind!” (Surah Naml 27:62)***

Also it is narrated from Muhammad Ibne Muslim that Imam Muhammad Baqir
(a.s.) said: “This verse is revealed about our Qaim (a.s.). When he
rises, he will wear a turban and offer prayers at the Maqam and
fervently beseech his Lord. Thus, no standard of his will ever be
defeated.”

***“They desire to put out the light of God with their mouths.” (Surah
Saff 31:8)***

In its interpretation, Muhammad Ibne Abbas narrates through his chains
of narration on the authority of Abul Jarud from Imam Muhammad Baqir
(a.s.) that he said: “If you should abandon this order, Allah will not.”

This is supported by the narration of Shaykh Muhammad Ibne Yaqub on the
authority of Muhammad Ibne Fudhail from the Seventh Imam (a.s.).
Muhammad Ibne Fudhail says, I asked the Imam about the verse: And Allah
will complete His light. He said: “‘They desire to put out the light of
God with their mouths refers to the guardianship of Amirul Momineen
(a.s.) ‘and Allah completes His light’ refers to the position of
Imamate, on the virtue of the Divine saying:

<p dir="rtl">

“The light is the Imam.”

I recited the verse,*He* is*the One Who sent His Apostle with guidance
and the true religion.* He said: “He is the One Who ordered His Apostle
with guardianship for his heir. Guardianship is the true religion.” I
recited,*So He may uplift it over all religions.* He said: “It refers to
all religions at the time of the rise of the Qaim, because of the God’s
statement, And Allah will complete His light through the guardianship of
the Qaim, even if disbelievers may hate the guardianship of ‘Ali.”

I asked, “Is this revelation?”

He said: “Yes, this word is revelation and the rest is interpretation.”

**58-** It is mentioned in*Kanz Jamiul Fawaid* and*Tawilul Ayaatul
Dhahira* : Muhammad Ibne Abbas narrates through his chain of narration
on the authority of Abu Basir: I asked Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) about
the Divine saying in His book:

<p dir="rtl">
هُوَ الَّذِي أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُ بِالْهُدَى وَدِينِ الْحَقِّ لِيُظْهِرَهُ
عَلَى الدِّينِ كُلِّهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْمُشْرِكُونَ
</p>

***“He it is Who sent His Apostle with guidance and the religion of
truth, that He might cause it to prevail over all religions, though the
polytheists may be averse.” (Surah Taubah 9:33)***

He said: “By Allah, its realization has not come yet.” I asked, “May I
be your ransom, when will it be realized?” He said: “When the Qaim
rises, God willing. When the Qaim rises, there will be no disbeliever
and no polytheist, but that he will dislike his rise. Even if there will
be a disbeliever or a polytheist inside a rock, the rock will call out,
‘O believer, there is a disbeliever or a polytheist inside me, so kill
him.’ So Allah brings the disbeliever to him, and he kills him.”

*Tafsir Furat Kufi:* Ja’far Ibne Ahmad narrates from Abu Abdullah (a.s.)
an identical narration, however it has, “The rock says, ‘O believer,
there is a polytheist inside me. So break me and kill him.’”

**59-** It is mentioned in*Kanz Jamiul Fawaid* and*Tawilul Ayaatul
Dhahira* : Muhammad Ibne Abbas narrates through the chain of narration
on the authority of Abaya Ibne Rabi that he heard Amirul Momineen (a.s.)
recite the verse, He is the One Who sent His Messenger, until its end
and then say, “This has happened? Never! By the One my life is in His
hands, there will be no vicinity save there will be calls of
testimonials that a deity other than Allah is not and that Muhammad is
the Messenger of Allah every morning and night.”

He also narrates from Ibne Abbas about the verse:

<p dir="rtl">
لِيُظْهِرَهُ عَلَى الدِّينِ كُلِّهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْمُشْرِكُونَ
</p>

***“…that He might cause it to prevail over all religions, though the
polytheists may be averse.” (Surah Taubah 9:33)***

Ibne Abbas said: “This will not happen until there will be no Jew,
Christian, or follower of any other path but he enters Islam. There will
be a harmony so the sheep and wolf, the cow and the lion, and man and
snake will live in peace; so much so that no mice will break into a food
bin; so much so that Jizya will be cancelled, the cross will be broken
and pigs will be killed. This will happen when the Qaim (a.s.) rises.”

***“When Our communications are recited to him, he says: Stories of
those of yore.” (Surah Qalam 68:15)***

*In Kanz Jamiul Fawaid and Tawilul Ayatul Dhahira it is narrated from*
Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) that he said: “This refers to his falsification
of the Qaim from Aale Muhammad (a.s.) when he will say to him, ‘We do
not know you and you are not from the progeny of Fatima’, as the
polytheists said to Muhammad (a.s.).”

***“Every soul is held in pledge for what it earns,” (Surah Muddaththir
74:38)***

*In Tafsir Furat Kufi it is mentioned that Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.)
said:* “It is us and our Shia. Then the Shia of us Ahle Bayt are in
Gardens, asking the guilty, ‘What has brought you into Hell?’ They will
say, ‘We were not of those who prayed.’ It means they were not from the
Shia of Ali Ibne Abi Talib.

‘And we used not to feed the poor. And we used to enter into vain
discourse with those who entered into vain discourses.’ That is the day
of the Qaim, (a.s.) and that is Judgment Day. ‘We used to belie Judgment
Day, till death overtook us. So the intercession of the intercessors
shall not avail them.’ So the intercession of no person will benefit
them. And the Messenger of Allah will never intercede for them on the
Day of Resurrection.”

***“I do not ask you for any reward for it; nor am I of those who
affect: It is nothing but a reminder to the nations; and most certainly
you will come to know about it after a time.” (Surah Saad 38:86-88)***

In*Al-Kafi* it is narrated from Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) that he said:
“‘Reminder’ implies Amirul Momineen (a.s.) and “And most certainly you
will come to know about it after a time,” is at the rise of the Qaim.

<p dir="rtl">
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَابَ فَاخْتُلِفَ فِيهِ
</p>

***“And certainly We gave the book to Musa, but it was gone against…”
(Surah Hud 11:110)***

Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) said: “They disagreed as did this Ummah
disagree about the Book. And they will disagree in the Book that will be
with the Qaim, who will bring it to them, so much so that a large number
of people will deny him. He will come to them and strike their necks.”
As for the Divine verse: And were it not for the Word of Judgment,
decision would have certainly been given between them, and surely then
the unjust will have a painful punishment, the Imam said: “Were it not
for what Allah, glory to His name, has predestined them to, the Qaim
would have not left even one of them.” And with regard to the verse:

<p dir="rtl">
وَلَوْلاَ كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ لَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَإِنَّهُمْ
لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مُرِيبٍ
</p>

***“…and had not a word gone forth from your Lord, the matter would
surely have been decided between them; and surely they are in a
disquieting doubt about it.” (Surah Hud 11:110)***

Imam (a.s.) said: “If there had been no divine exigency, the Qaim would
not have spared even one of them.”

<p dir="rtl">
وَالَّذِينَ يُصَدِّقُونَ بِيَوْمِ الدِّينِ
</p>

***“And those who accept the truth of Judgment Day…” (Surah Maarij
70:26)***

It is mentioned in*Al-Kafi* from Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) that he
said: “That is one who testifies and believes in our Qaim when he
reappears.”

<p dir="rtl">
قَالُواْ وَاللّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ
</p>

***“…they would say: By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists.”
(Surah Anam 6:23)***

It is mentioned in*Al-Kafi* from Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) that he
said: “That is they will say at the time of the reappearance of Imam
Zamana (a.s.): We were not deniers of the Wilayat of Amirul Momineen
(a.s.).”

<p dir="rtl">
وَقُلْ جَاء الْحَقُّ وَزَهَقَ الْبَاطِلُ إِنَّ الْبَاطِلَ كَانَ زَهُوقًا
</p>

***“And say: The truth has come and the falsehood has vanished; surely
falsehood is a vanishing (thing).” (Surah Bani Israel 17:81)***

It is mentioned in*Al-Kafi* that Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) said: When
our Qaim reappears, the kingdom of falsehood will be destroyed.”

سَنُرِيهِمْ آيَاتِنَا فِي الْآفَاقِ وَفِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَتَّى يَتَبَيَّنَ

</p>

***“We will soon show them Our signs in the Universe and in their own
souls, until it will become quite clear to them that it is the truth…”
(Surah Fussilat 41:53)***

Kulaini in*Al-Kafi* has narrated from Abu Basir that he said: I asked
Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) about this and he said: “He will show them in
their souls deformation (*maskh* ) and will show them the contraction of
horizons. So they will see the might of Allah, the Exalted, in their
souls as well as in the horizons.” I recited to him, until it becomes
clear to them that he is the truth. He said: “The rise of the Qaim is
the truth from Allah, the Exalted, which the creation will see. It is
inevitable.”

<p dir="rtl">
حَتَّى إِذَا رَأَوْا مَا يُوعَدُونَ إِمَّا الْعَذَابَ وَإِمَّا

</p>

***“…until they see what they were threatened with, either the
punishment or the hour; then they shall know who is in more evil plight
and weaker in forces.” (Surah Maryam 19:75)***

Also in*Al-Kafi,* it is narrated from Abu Basir from Imam Ja’far Sadiq
(a.s.) that he said: “‘When they see what they have been promised of
refers to the rise of the Qaim, and that is ‘the Hour.’ They will know
at that day what will befall them at the hands of Qaim. This is denoted
by the Divine word, ‘who is of more evil plight’ - that is, in the eyes
of the Qaim - and weaker in forces.”

<p dir="rtl">
مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ حَرْثَ الدُّنْيَا نُؤتِهِ مِنْهَا وَمَا لَهُ فِي

</p>

***“…and whoever desires the gain of this world, We give him of it, and
in the hereafter he has no portion.” (Surah Shura 42:20)***

In*Al-Kafi* it is narrated from Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) that he said:
“It is the cognition of Amirul Momineen (a.s.) and the Purified Imams.”
Through the blessings of whose love the Almighty Allah will enrich their
followers, but whoever desires the harvest of this world, We will give
him from it and he will not have any share in the hereafter.” He said:
“He will not have any share with the Qaim in the governance of the
Truth.”

**65-** Sayyid Ali Ibne Abdul Hamid narrates in*Al-Anwarul Mudhia*
through his chain of narration that the Amirul Momineen (a.s.) said:
“‘The enfeebled on earth’ mentioned in the Book, whom Allah will make
Imams, are we the Ahle Bayt (a.s.). Allah will send our Mahdi and he
will make us honorable and disgrace our enemies.” He also narrates from
Ibne Abbas about the holy verse:

<p dir="rtl">
فَوَرَبِّ السَّمَاء وَالْأَرْضِ إِنَّهُ لَحَقٌّ مِّثْلَ مَا أَنَّكُمْ
تَنطِقُونَ
</p>

***“And in the heavens is your sustenance and what you are promised…”
(Surah Zariyat 51:23)***

…that he said: “It is the rise of the Mahdi (a.s.).”

He again narrates from Ibne Abbas about the holy verse,*Know that Allah
brings to life the earth after its death,* that he said: “Allah will
restitute the earth through the Qaim from the House of Muhammad after
its death, that is, after the inequity of its dwellers of its kingdoms.
We illustrate to you the

Signs through the Hujja from the House of Muhammad, perchance you may
ratiocinate.”

In the same book, the author narrates through his chain of narration on
the authority of Hibatullah Rawandi from Musa Ibne Ja’far (a.s.) about
the Divine verse:

<p dir="rtl">
وَأَسْبَغَ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعَمَهُ ظَاهِرَةً وَبَاطِنَةً
</p>

***“…and made complete to you His favors outwardly and inwardly…” (Surah
Luqman 31:20)***

The Imam said: “The outward favor is the Manifest Imam and the inward
favor is the Hidden Imam whose person will go into hiding from the eyes
of the people and the treasures of the earth will appear for him and
every far will come near him.”

I found in the handwriting of the Sheikh Muhammad Ibne Ali Jubai: I
found in the handwriting of the First Martyr, may Allah illuminate his
tomb: Safwani narrates in his book from Safwan that when Mansur summoned
Abu Abdullah (a.s.), the Imam made ablution and offered two rakats
prayer and then went into prostration of gratification and said: “O
Allah, you promised on the tongue of Your Apostle Muhammad (a.s.), and
your promise is true, that you will give us in exchange security after
our fear. O Allah, fulfill to us what You promised, for You do not
violate the promise.” I said: “My master, where is God’s promise to
you?” He said: “The word of Allah, the Exalted:

<p dir="rtl">
وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مِنكُمْ وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ
لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُم فِي الْأَرْضِ كَمَا اسْتَخْلَفَ الَّذِينَ مِن
قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَيُمَكِّنَنَّ لَهُمْ دِينَهُمُ الَّذِي ارْتَضَى لَهُمْ
وَلَيُبَدِّلَنَّهُم مِّن بَعْدِ خَوْفِهِمْ أَمْنًا يَعْبُدُونَنِي لَا
يُشْرِكُونَ بِي شَيْئًا
</p>

***“Allah has promised to those of you who believe and do good that He
will most certainly make them rulers in the earth as He made rulers
those before them, and that He will most certainly establish for them
their religion which He has chosen for them, and that He will most
certainly, after their fear, give them security in exchange; they shall
serve Me, not associating aught with Me…” (Surah Nur 24:55)***

It is narrated that the verse:

<p dir="rtl">
وَنُرِيدُ أَن نَّمُنَّ عَلَى الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ
وَنَجْعَلَهُمْ أَئِمَّةً وَنَجْعَلَهُمُ الْوَارِثِينَ
</p>

***“And We desired to bestow a favor upon those who were deemed weak in
the land, and to make them the Imams, and to make them the heirs…”
(Surah Qasas 28:5-6)***

*…* was recited in the presence of the holy Imam (a.s.). His eyes
drowned in tears and he said: “By Allah, we are the Enfeebled.”

**66-** It is mentioned in*Nahjul Balagha that* Amirul Momineen (a.s.)
said in a sermon, “The world will lean favorably to us after its
rejection, the leaning of a caring camel to its calf.” Then the Imam
recited this verse:

<p dir="rtl">
وَنُرِيدُ أَن نَّمُنَّ عَلَى الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ
وَنَجْعَلَهُمْ أَئِمَّةً وَنَجْعَلَهُمُ الْوَارِثِينَ
</p>

***“And We desired to bestow a favor upon those who were deemed weak in
the land, and to make them the Imams, and to make them the heirs…”
(Surah Qasas 28:5-6)***
