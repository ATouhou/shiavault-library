Haroun Rashid's Anger and  Bahlool's Forgiveness
================================================

Haroun hired a spy to ascertain Bahlool's religion and faith. A few days
later the spy informed Haroun, that, according to his inquiry, Bahlool
is among the friends of the Ahlul Bayt and Musa bin Jafar's very
particular and faithful followers.

So Haroun called Bahlool and said, “I have heard that you are amongst
the friends and lovers of Musa bin Jafar and do propaganda about his
right and against me. To save your self from punishment, you have become
insane.”

“If that is so, then how will you treat me?”

At this Haroun could not control his anger, and, while in this mood,
ordered his slave Masroor to, “Take Bahlool's clothes off and put a
donkey's saddle on his back. Put the donkey's rein in his mouth, then
parade him in the palaces and their surroundings. After that, cut his
head off in front of me.”

Masroor took Bahlool's clothes off; put a saddle on him, reins in his
mouth, and marched him in the palaces' surroundings. Then he presented
Bahlool to Haroun in that condition, so as to kill him.

Coincidentally, Jafar Barmaki was present at this time. He saw Bahlool's
state and asked, “ Bahlool! What was your mistake?”

“Since I told the truth, the Khalifa gave me his own garments as a
reward.”

Haroun Rashid, Jafar, and all those present laughed very much at
Bahlool's answer. Then Haroun forgave Bahlool and ordered the donkey's
saddle and rein to be taken off of him, and to bring nice clothes for
him.

But Bahlool did not accept the clothes. He picked up his tattered
clothes and left Haroun's palace.
