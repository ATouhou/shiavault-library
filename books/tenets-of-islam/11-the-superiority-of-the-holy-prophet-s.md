The Superiority of the Holy Prophet [s]
=======================================

Our Prophet is superior to all other Prophets, for his Prophethood has
proved and he himself has informed us of his superiority. The Holy
Prophet said to Fatimah: “Your father is the best of all Prophets; your
husband is the best of all successors; you are the chief of all the
women of the world, and your sons, Hasan and Husayn are the chiefs of
the youth of Paradise, but their father is superior to them.”
