Mukhtar al-Thaqafy
==================

In the month of Rajab, 60 A.H., Mu'awiyah died. He had ruled the Muslim
countries for twenty years. He killed many companions of our Master
Muhammad [s]. Hajar bin Ady al-Kindy, Amr bin al-Hamq al-Khazay and
Rasheed al-Hajry were of them. He poisoned Imam Hasan (the Prophet's
grandson), Malik al-Ashtar, Saad bin Abu Waqas and others.

In spite of the Muslim's dissatisfaction, Mu'awiyah appointed his son
Yazeed caliph. So, the Caliphate became a kingdom.

The Muslims were angry with Yazeed, for he was a corrupt young man.
Besides, he drank alcohol and amused himself with monkeys and dogs.

The Muslims in Kufa hoped that Imam Husayn would be the Caliph, for he
was our Master Muhammad's grandson. Moreover, he was a good, God-fearing
and believing man. And he treated the poor kindly.

So the Muslims sent Imam Husayn hundreds of letters. In their letters,
they asked him to save them from persecution.

Imam Husayn [a] was in al-Madina al-Munawwara. He did not pay homage to
Yazeed, for the latter behaved badly. In the meantime, he sent his
cousin Muslim bin Aqeel as his envoy to Kufa.

Imam Husayn asked his cousin to stay with the most loyal person in Kufa.
