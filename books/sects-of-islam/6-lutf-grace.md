Lutf: Grace
===========

Based upon the above differences, is the difference about their attitude
towards the Grace of Allah. The Shi\`ahs say that the Grace is morally,
incumbent upon Allah. "By grace, it is understood that action on the
part of God which would help to bring His creatures nearer to His
devotion and obedience and facilitate their moral correction, (which is)
morally incumbent on Him.

“Allah has commanded us to be just, while He Himself treats us with
something better, namely grace (tafaddul).”

The Sunnis, on the other hand, say, “God leaded astray whom He wills and
guided aright whom He wills, and it is not incumbent upon God The Most
High to do that which may be best for the creature.” [^1]

[^1]: Creed of an-Nasafi.
