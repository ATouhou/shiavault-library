The Retirement
==============

The old man, a Christian by religion, had worked all his life; but had
not been able to save anything for his old age. Lately he had become
also blind. Old age, poverty and blindness had joined hands and he had
no other way except begging. He used to stand at the corner of a lane
for begging. People had compassion for him and gave him some alms from
which he ate every day, and so he continued his sad life.

One day Ali, the Leader of the Faithful passed through the lane and saw
the beggar in that condition. Ali, out of his concern for others,
enquired about the old man. He wanted to know the factors which led him
to that condition. "Had he no son to support him? Or, is there no other
way for him to live a respectable life in his old age?"

The people who knew the old man came forward and informed Ali that he
was a Christian and, had worked hard so long as he had his eyes, and was
young and strong. Now that he had lost his youth as well as his eyes he
was unable to do any work; also he had no savings, so it was natural
that he was begging. Ali said, "Strange! Till he had strength you
extracted work from him and now you have left him on his own?" His story
shows that he had worked when he had the strength. Therefore, it is the
duty of the Government and the society to support him till he is alive.
Go, and give him a life-pension from the State-treasury.‚Äù
