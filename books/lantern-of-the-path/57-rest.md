Rest
====

   
 The believer only acquires true rest when he meets Allah, although rest
may also be obtained by these four things: silence, by which you
recognize the state of your heart and your self in your relations with
your Creator; retreat, by which you are rescued from the evils of the
age, outwardly and inwardly; hunger, which kills fleshly appetites and
temptation; and wakefulness, which illuminates your heart, purifies your
nature and cleanses your spirit.  
    
 The Holy Prophet said, 'If a man finds himself in the morning tranquil
in his heart, healthy in body and with food for the day, it is as if all
of this world had been chosen for him'; and Wahb ibn Munabbih said: “In
the first and the last Books it is written ‘O contentment, honour and
riches are to be found with you. Whoever wins, wins through you!'  
    
 Abu al-Darda' said, 'What Allah has allotted to me will not pass me by,
even if it were on the wing of a breeze'; and Abu Dharr said, 'The
secret of a man who does not trust his Lord is always exposed, even if
it is imprisoned in solid rock.' No one is in a greater state of loss,
is viler, or lower than the person who does not believe what his Lord
has guaranteed for him and allotted him before He created him. In spite
of that, this person relies on his own strength, management, effort, and
striving, and goes beyond the limits of his Lord by his seeking ways and
means which Allah has caused him to have no need of.
