51. Statement of the Imam conveys the same meaning of another one
quoted from the Apostle of Allah (s.a.w.), which says, .Do not be a
naive imitator, saying 'I am with people. Should people do good works,
so should I. And if they do evil, so do I; but train yourselves; if
people do good works so you should do, but if they do evil, you have to
avoid doing it.

52. All these quotes have been taken from Tuhaf al-Uqool, Chapter of
What has been handed down from Imam Musa bin Ja'far."

53. Historians say that al-Rasheed, after his death, left 100 million
Dinars, and quantities of jewels and possessions which were worth more
than that. He had 2000 slave girls, the price of one of them amounted to
one and a half million Dirhams. Not only was al-Rasheed extravagant, but
his wife, Zubaydah, was too. She misused the state funds and the
people's wealth. She had pearl-studded pairs of sandals. She spent more
than one million gold Dinars on making a pure silk mat, embroidered with
gold thread, and having pictures of birds with ruby eyes...

Madinah. When al-Mahdi died and Musa succeeded him, as the new caliph,
Ishaq rushed to Iraq to see Musa, after putting Umar bin Abdul-Aziz bin
Abdullah bin Abdullah bin Umar bin al-Khattab in his place. But al-Fadhl
bin Ishaq al-Hashimi said that lshaq bin lsa bin Ali asked al-Hadi to
relieve him of his post as the governor of Madinah, and allow him to
travel to Baghdad, and that al-Hadi accepted his offer and appointed
Umar bin Abdul-Aziz in his place..."

96. Historically it is an established fact that it was Yahya who
misinformed al-Rasheed about Imam Musa bin Ja'far (a.s.), and he himself
ordered al-Sindi to add poison to the food of the Imam. In addition,
Imam al-Ridha (a.s.), the son of Imam Musa bin Ja'far (a.s.), blamed the
Barmecides for the death of his tather and he prayed for their
destruction. Then it is incorrect to say that Yahya was a follower. in

99. Historians differed on the period the Imam spent in prison. A
version maintains that al-Rasheed had gone to Makkah, to perform hajj in
179 A.H., and then gave his order to arrest the Imam and transfer him to
Baghdad, where he was throw" in prison. He remained there until he was
martyred on 25 Rajab 183 A.H. According to this narrative, Imam's
imprisonment lasted four years. Another version says that al-Rasheed put
the Imam in prison after six or seven years of his assuming power. And
so accordingly, Imam Musa al-Kadhim (a.s.) served six or seven years in
prison.

100. After Imam Musa al-Kadhim (a.s.) had died, al-Sindi bin Shahik
allowed the fuqaha' and the eminent people of Baghdad, including
al-Haytham bin Uday and others, to see him, they saw no trace of
maltreatment and gave their testimonies. Then the body of the Imam was
taken out and put on the bridge of Baghdad. It was announced.This is
Musa bin Ja'far dead. Look at him.. People began to stare in his face,
and he was dead.. (Al-Majlisi, Bihar al-Anwar, Vol. 48, p. 234.)
