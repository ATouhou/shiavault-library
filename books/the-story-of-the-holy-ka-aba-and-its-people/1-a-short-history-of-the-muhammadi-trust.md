A Short History of the Muhammadi Trust
======================================

It was March 1969 when I phoned The Director of the Islamic Center at
Regents Park in London, the Raja of Mahmudabad for an appointment to
discuss about setting up an organization for the sole purpose of
furthering the education of Muslim youth.

I went to see Raja Saheb with my friend Sayyid Asghar Haider Kazmi.
Unfortunately Raja Saheb was unable to see me that evening because of
Shaikh Mujibur Rahmanâ€™s arrival in London who was with the Raja at that
time. I went there the next evening and put before him a constitution by
the name of Ahlebayt Academy.

Raja Saheb red the paper and commented that if the name is changed to
Muhammadi Trust it would appeal to a wider audience. We agreed and in
this way Muhammadi Trust came into being. Although the name changed the
object of the association remained the same, which is the education of
the Muslim youth on the lines the Ahlul Bayt of the Prophet wanted us to
learn.

The First Trustees were as follows: H.E. The Raja of Mahmudabad Sayyid
Sadiq Husayn Shah Kazmi Dr.Sayyid Sikander Raza, Mirza Baqar Khorasanee
Abbas Jethabhai Gokal Hasan Pirbhai Sayyid Muhammad Raza Shabbar (The
writer of the present book)

After the resignation of Hasan Pirbhai due to business commitments, Mr.
Qasim Husayn who had arrived in London after taking retirement from the
Pakistan Air force as Wing Commander, was appointed as Trustee and also
its secretary. The Work of the Trust began in earnest.
