51: The Scholars Should Make Their Knowledge Evident
====================================================

The Messenger of Allah (S) has said, “When innovations appear in my
nation the scholar must make his knowledge apparent. Allah’s curse be
upon the one who doesn’t follow this.”[^1] In the same book of Al-Kafi
is narrated through a reliable chain of narrators a tradition of Imam
Sadiq (as) that says: The Messenger of Allah (S) said, “If after me you
see innovators you must express your disdain and criticize them and do
not leave any stone unturned in maligning their name so that the desire
to spread mischief and corruption may not take root in their hearts.
That people may be careful of them and do not learn innovative practices
from them. The Almighty Allah writes good deeds (Hasanat) for this
action of yours and due to this raises your grades in the
hereafter.”[^2]

I say: It is only when he is safe from every danger, otherwise he is
supposed to observe Taqayyah as will be seen in the coming discussions.
