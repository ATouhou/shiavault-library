O God, send out for us Your rains,

Your bounty,

Your provision, and your mercy,

and give us water in a measure

that would benefit us, satiates our thirst,

and makes the land green with grass,

wherewith all that has withered may grow,

and come to **life** all that has died,

a rain which brings abundance,

produces plenty of fruits,

watering the plains,

flooding the valleys,

dressing the trees with foliage,

and bringing the prices down.

Surely You are able to do whatever

You will.

(Sermon 143)
