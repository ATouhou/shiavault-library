Preface
=======

As of June, 1999, I will have lived in The United States for five years.
During this time, I have met many intellectual individuals who have
inspired me to introduce the beautiful religion of Islam to the public
through speeches, writings, and articles. I also have had the honor of
spending almost three years with our future generation, the Muslim
youth, in Southern California and other parts of the United States.

The more time I spent discussing and debating aspects of Islam with the
youths, the more I was convinced of the necessity to put the basic ideas
of Islam on paper and introduce Islam to the ever-increasing number of
people who seek to discover God's final revelation to humankind. Through
my work as a scholar and as a preacher of Islam in the West, I realized
that the Islamic centers and institutions have been inadequate and
inefficient in the field of *dawah* (the invitation to Islam).

Although many valuable works have been generated in this area, Islamic
literature is still too sparse and insufficient in addressing the
simplicity of Islamâ€”the belief in one God to non-Muslims. Therefore, I
decided to contribute, according to my ability, to do my share in
spreading the word of God, a duty incumbent upon all Muslims. I hope God
will accept my humble effort.

I would like to thank Sister Amina Inloes for her help with editing this
work.

May God continuously guide me and all the sincere brothers and sisters
to His righteousness and piety.
