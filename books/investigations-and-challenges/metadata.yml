description: |
  The link between the theological seminary and the university is a
  blessed phenomenon which bears significant and numerous wholesome
  fruits. Along this line, for more than a year, a number of concerned and
  committed scholars in the university has set up a center with the aim of
  holding cultural activities. One of its activities is to hold monthly
  sessions in the presence of Ayatullah Misbah Yazdi. In these sessions,
  the distinguished professor tackles issues suggested by the other
  professors. Nine of these lectures are presented in this book.
