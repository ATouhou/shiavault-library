"the Tidings in the Old and New Testaments"
===========================================

"Samples of Tidings in the Torah and New Testament regarding the
mission of the Last Prophet (s.a.w)".

All of the available copies of the old and new Testaments have been
altered, and examples of these alterations have been given in a
discussion translated and published in farsy as "Heavenly Religions and
the Matter of Alteration" by the same author (Adyaan-e-Asamaani wa
Masa'el-e-Tahreef).

Despite all of the alterations, however, sometimes examples of the
tidings given by the prophets concerning the last Prophets mission may
be seen in those copies, like the copies existent in the library of
Majma elmi Islamy including the two books: The Samaritan in the old
Testament and Barnabas in the New Testament.

Because however, these two books are not accepted by all Christians we
will not narrate from these two regarding this topic and will content
ourselves with narrating from the other texts.

A- In the tidings from the prophet Moses(a.s) for Bani Israel in
chapter 18 of "Deuteronomy" the following may be seen:

Translation of the Farsy into English by the Translator:

"And the lord said to me and what he said was good I will appoint a
prophet for them from their own brethren and I will tell him what to say
and he will tell the people everything I command and for anyone who does
not listen to his words which he speaks in my name I will punish.

B- The last words of Moses (a.s) to Bani Israel before his death in
chapter 33 of Deuteronomy:

Translation of the Farsy text into English by the Translator:

**Chapter 33**

1- These are the blessings that Moses, the man of God, pronounced on
the people of Israel before he died.

2- The lord came from Mount Sinai and he rose like the sun over Edom,
and shone from Mount Faran and entered with ten thousand of the esteemed
and a fiery religious cannon came to him from his right hand.

3- Yes he loved the tribes and protects those who belong to him and the
esteemed shall follow him and accept his commands.

4- Moses gave us a law that is the inheritance from the Tribe of
Jacob.

C- In the lord Jesus's last words in chapter 14,15 and 16 of the book
John we read:

'---Arabic text---'

"English Translation of the preceding Arabic and Farsy version of the
Book John chapters 14, 15 and 16".

**"The Book John": chapter 14.**

15- If you love me keep my commandments

16- I will ask the Father and He will give you another Helper who will
stay with you forever.

24- (and) whoever does not love me does not obey my teaching. And the
teaching you have heard is not mine but comes from the father, who sent
me.

25- I have told you this while I am still with you.

26-The Helper, the Holy Spirit whom the father will send in my name,
will teach you everything and make you remember all that I have told
you.

29- I have told you this now before it all happens, so that when it
does happen you will believe.

30- I cannot talk with you much longer, because the ruler of this world
is coming.

**Chapter 15.**

26-The Helper will come - The Spirit, who reveals the truth about God
and who comes from the Father, I will send him to you from the Father,
and he will speak about me.

**Chapter 16.**

7- But I am telling you the truth: it is better for you that I go away,
because if I do not go, the Helper will not come to you. But if I do go
away, then I will send him to you.

6- And when he comes, he will prove to the people of the world that
they are wrong about sin and about what is right and about Gods'
judgement.

9- They are wrong about sin, because they do not believe in me.

10- They are wrong about what is right, because I am going to the
Father and you will not see me any more

11 -And they are wrong about judgement, because the ruler of this world
has already been judged.

12- I have much more to tell you but now it would be too much for you
to bear.

13- When, however, the spirit comes, who reveals the truth about God,
he will lead you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own
authority, but he will speak of what he hears and will tell you of
things to come.

14- He will give me glory, because he will take what I say and tell it
to you.

15- All that my Father has is mine: that is why I said that the spirit
will take what I give him and tell it to you.

**THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO COPES**

A summary Of These Two Prophets Words.
In chapter 18 of "Deuteronomy" Moses gives tidings to bani Israel that
the lord said: I will appoint a prophet like you from among their own
people and I will place my words in his mouth.

And a condensed version of Moses last words in chapter 33 of
Deuteronomy would be:

The lord came from Mount Sinai and became visible from Edom, and shone
from Mount Faran (Paran). (Then) he entered (Mecca) with ten thousand of
the esteemed and a fiery cannon (cannon of war) came to him from his
right hand.

**The Last Words Of The Lord Jesus (a.s).**

A summary of the lord Jesus words in chapter 14, 15 and 16 of the book
"John" in the New Testament is as such: I will ask God to appoint
prophet for you so that his cannon will always remain with you.

He who does not love me will not keep my commandments and the
commandments you hear are not my own but from God who sent me. I have
said this to you while I'm still with you but when send Farqaliyat to
you he will teach you everything and he will remind you of what I have
said. I have told you about it before its advent so that you would
believe. After this I will not say much to you because the ruler of the
world will come.

And when Farqaliyat comes from God he will speak about me. I speak the
truth when I tell you that it is necessary for me to leave you because
if I don't leave Farqaliyat will not come to you and when I go he will
come to fill the world with right instead of wrong, justice and Gods'
judgement. I have many other things to say but you cannot bear to hear
of them now, but when he comes he will guide you to all of the right
things since he does not speak of his own authority but will say what he
has heard (from God) and he will give you news of things to come and he
will give me glory.

"A Comparison Of Quranic Verses With That Which Was Narrated From The
Testaments".

Now we will return to the Quran to see how it certified that which
Jesus (a.s) predicted.

In verse 6 of the Surah Saff it is said:

"And when Isa son of Marium said: O Children of Israel! Surely I am the
apostle of Allah to you, verifying that which is before me of the Tavrat
and giving the good news of an apostle who will come after me, his name
being Ahmad; but when he came to them with clear arguments they said:
This is clear magic".

and about the fact that he (does not speak of his own authority) , in
the surah Najm such is declared:

"It is naught but revelation that is revealed, The Lord of Mighty Power
taught him....."

Also the glorification of Jesus was said for the Jews who said unjust
things about Mary. In the Surah Al-Imran verse 42, the Quran says about
this:

"O' Marium! Surely Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you
above the women of the world (in her own time)".

and in verse 45 says:

"O' Marium, surely Allah gives you good news with a word from him (of)
whose name is Messiah, is a son of Marium, worthy of regard in this
world and the hereafter....."

And in verse 91 of the Surah Anbiya says:

"And she who guarded her chastity, so We breather into her of Our
inspiration and made her and her son a sign for the nations".

and in the Surah Marium verse 34 it is said:

"Such is Isa, son of Marium: (This is) the saying of truth about which
they dispute".

**A Few Questions.**

Now it is appropriate here for us to pose a few question to the
Christians and ask them:

Who was the prophet that Moses (a.s) informed Bani Israel of, whom God
would appoint from their brothers and in whose mouth he would place his
words?

Who was the prophet on whose tongue revelation was placed, not being
descended on tablets like Moses' commandments, the prophet who came
after Moses but was not from Bani Israel like David Solomon and Jesus
were?

and we also ask:

After God came from Mount Sinai and rose over Edom, upon whom did he
shine on Mount Faran (Mecca)? Also, who was the person who entered
(Mecca) with ten-thousand of the elect? And who had a fiery cannon in
his right hand?

Who was the person, who coming to Jesus (a.s) gave news of regardless
of whether his name is Farqaliyat meaning Ahmad or has been altered to
Helper? At any rate, Jesus gave tidings of someone's coming. Who was
this who in these very testaments Jesus (a.s) describes as such?

God will send "Farqaliyat and he will teach you everything and remind
you of what I have said, I will not say much more to you because the
ruler of this world will come.

Farqaliyat will come from God and he will speak about me. I speak the
truth when I tell you that my leaving is beneficial for you because if I
don't go, Farqaliyat (Ahmad) will not come. If I go he will come and
will judge the world. I have many things to say to you but you can't
bear to hear them now.

When he comes he will guide you to universal truth. He does not speak
of his own authority but says that which he has heard from God. He will
give you tidings of things to come and will glorify me.

Who was this person with these qualities?

Who was it that came after Jesus, glorifying him and witnessing to the
truth of his words?

Who was the person who came after Jesus and judged the world,
distinguishing between right and wrong, gave tidings of things to come
and taught everything to the people?

Who was it, this person who spoke not of himself but spoke of what he
heard from God?

Regardless of whether his name is Ahmad, Faqaliyat or Helper, who was
it?

Who was it that Moses and Jesus spoke of when they said: God will place
this words on his tongue, the revelation for him not being as it was for
Moses, on stone tablets.
