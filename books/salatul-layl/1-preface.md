Preface
=======

This book is a republication of our earlier book on Salatul Layl. With
the *Tawfiq* of Allah, we have been able to improve the format and the
content so as to make the book both easier to use and more
comprehensive. We hope the changes will benefit all Mu’mineen.

The book now includes many more du’as for Salatul Layl which have been
taught to us by the Ma’sumeen (a). These du’as are derived from
authentic sources of du’as listed in the Bibliography. It is hoped that
Mu’mineen will recite some of these du’as and relish the beauty of these
supplications.

We pray that the Almighty may give us the chance to be from among those
who recite Salatul Layl regularly.
