Some Impressions
================

Amir al-Mu’minin’s martyrdom was a calamitous event in the annals of the
history of Islam. Al-Kūfah, where this tragedy took place, was a picture
of sadness. In the eyes of the next of kin of the Imam (a.s) the world
had seemed dark and desolate. The enthusiasm of the companions of the
Imam (a.s) was shattered and their peace of mind was disturbed. Even the
enemies acknowledged the personality and character of the Imam (a.s).

A few statements of tribute are mentioned hereinafter:

Imam al-Hasan (a.s), giving a sermon after the burial of the Imam (a.s),
said:

###### “You have assassinated a venerable person in the night on which the Holy Qur’an was revealed, \`Isa (a.s) was taken away to the Firmament and Yūsha\` ibn Nūn was killed! By Allah! The forbears could not surpass him and those after him will not achieve his status!”[1]

\`Abdullah ibn \`Abbas said:

###### “By Allah! The world in his eyes was less valuable that the strap of the footwear! He was a tiger in combat and a river (of eloquence) in gatherings; in the company of scholars he was a paragon of wisdom! It is a pity he is no more. But he has achieved elevated position in the Hereafter!”

Sa\`sa\`ah Ibn Sawhan put his hand on the grave of the Imam (a.s) and
said:

###### “I plead with Allah to bless us that we tread his foot prints, act on his example; be friends of his friends and antagonists of his enemies! O Allah! May our end be in the party of his friends! The status that he had none else could reach. The place he was in was not in the fate of anyone else!”[2]

When Mu\`awiyah heard of the assassination of Amir al-Mu’minin (a.s) he
said:

###### “With the death of Ibn Abū-Talib the Fiqh and knowledge has come to an end.”[1]

When \`A’ishah got the news of the Imam’s demise, she said:

###### “Now the people of Arabia can do anything! There is none now who could stop them!”[2]
