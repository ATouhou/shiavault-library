M - Muhammad Ibn Al-Ash'ath
===========================

Among the companions of ‘Ubayd Allah Ibn Zyad who fought against Imam
Husayn in Karbala. When Muslim Ibn Aqeel came to Kufa and entered
Taw'a's house, Muslim told her about all the events that he had gone
through and that the people of Ibn Ziyad were looking for him. Taw'a's
son heard the conversation and in the morning went and told Muhammad Ibn
Al Ash'ath who then told ‘Ubayd Allah Ibn Zyad. Shortly after the news
of Muslim's whereabouts broke, Taw'a's house was surrounded!
