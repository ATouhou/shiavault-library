The Mandatory Steps of the Ihrram
=================================

154. The mandatory steps of the ihraam are:

1. Wearing the two garments of ihraam
2. The intention, or niyyah.
3. The talbiyah.

**1. Wearing the two garments of the ihraam**

155. After removing the clothing that is not permitted to wear, the two
pieces of garments for ihraam must be worn. One of the garments is worn
round the waist to cover the body from navel level to the knees, and the
other should be used for covering the shoulders at least. As a
precaution, it is required that a woman wears the two pieces of garments
of ihraam on top of her clothing, and performs the talbiyah, even though
it is permissible for her to remove the two garments afterwards.

156. It is conditional, as an obligatory precaution, that the garment
worn around the waist is not thin, revealing the skin, and so too for
the garment covering the shoulders. It is also conditional for the
ihraam garments:

• to be of such material that is valid for the daily obligatory prayers
for men,

• not to be nagis with which one may not be able to perform the daily
prayers,

• not to be made from products of an animal the meat of which is not
permissible for (Muslim) consumption,

• not to be usurped, nor any gold is allowed to be used in it,

• not to be made from silk even for women,

• as a precaution, not to be made from leather, even if taken from
animals whose meat is permissible to eat,

• as a precaution, to be woven or textile such as towels, and not
matted or compressed.

157. If one or both of the ihraam garments were made nagis, then as a
precaution the muhrim – the individual in the state of ihraam must
either replace the nagis garment or wash it to make taahir immediately.
If he does not do that he has sinned but his ihraam is valid. However,
if part of the body became nagis, it is not incumbent on him to make it
taahir immediately, even though may be is as a precaution.

158. If there was a wound on the body of the muhrim and there was blood
on the dressing / plaster, and it was not possible for him to remove the
dressing when time was short, the rulings of Jabirah applies to him.
[you will find the details in this respect in risalah of Islamic laws.]
159. It is not mandatory for the muhrim to continually wear the ihraam
garments; for the muhrim may change them or take them off completely,
like when going to the bathroom or having a shower. This applies to both
genders.

160. It is not mandatory to be taahir, like after going to the toilet,
when declaring ihraam. Thus one who is in the state of Janaabah, or a
Ha’edh [a woman who is experiencing the haydh – the monthly menses], or
one who does not have wudhu may declare and assume ihraam. However, if
one wanted to perform the ihraam prayers, the prayers would not be valid
unless [being taahir and] with wudhu.

161. If due to oversight or ignorance of the ruling, one wore the
ihraam garments without removing his normal clothing, then whenever he
remembered or realised the ruling of the case, must remove his normal
clothing, and his ihraam is valid. The same is also applicable if an
individual, after declaring and assuming ihraam, wears his normal
clothing, either having forgotten or due to ignorance of the case.

162. There is no objection to wearing more than the normal set of
ihraam garment, whether at the time of declaring ihraam or afterwards,
to protect oneself against the weather.

**2. Niyyah**

163. Declaration of niyyah or intention is mandatory for ihraam. It is
the resolution of performing ihraam, seeking nearness to Allah Almighty.
The meaning of ihraam is to abstain from and relinquish a number of
things, details of which will be given later.

164. In an exception to other acts of worship, it is recommended that
the niyyah is verbally uttered in this case. After removing all sewn
clothing, and wearing the two ihraam garments, one should say, “I
declare and assume the ihraam for the Umrah of TAMATTU' for
Hajjat-al-Islam seeking nearness to Allah Almighty”.

**3. Talbiyah**

165. Without talbiyah, ihraam would not be established, (although) in
the case of Qiraan Hajj, the ihraam is established with talbiyah, or
marking the animal with a sign or a collar.

166. The obligatory talbiyah18 takes the following form of reciting
[the four phrases]:

18 Talbiyah literally means compliance, fulfilment, or carrying out the
orders of Allah Almighty.

Labbayk Allahumma Labbayk. I heed to your call O Lord, I heed.

Labbayka Laa Shareeka Laka Labbayk.
I heed that (O You) You have no partner, I heed.

In Nal-Hamda, Wan Ne‘mata, Laka Wal Mulk.

Truly, All the Praise, and the Bliss, are Yours and the Sovereignty is
too.

Laa Shareeka Laka Labbayk. The last word may be added as a recommended
precaution.

There is no partner of Yours, I heed.

167. It is obligatory that the talbiyah is recited at least once, and
with it the ihraam is established. Of course it is mostahab that the
Haajj (pilgrim) repeat it when he wakes up, after each of the daily
obligatory prayers, when getting on a vehicle, or going up or down a
hill, etc. It is also recommended to repeat it during the night (Sahar),
even if the muhrim was in the state of Janaabah or Haydh. In the case of
Umrah it is recommended that he does not stop it until he can see the
houses of the city of Makkah, when he should stop. In the case of the
Hajj, it is recommended that one does not stop it until midday of the
Day of Arafah – the 9th day of Dhil-Hejjah – when should stop.

168. It is obligatory to recite the talbiyah in the correct Arabic
pronunciation. It is not sufficient to pronounce it with a variant
accent or pronunciation if one can recite it correctly. If one cannot
recite it correctly, someone else should help him to recite it by
dictating to him.

If there was no such person, he should recite whatever he can, and as a
mostahab precaution, he should pronounce it with the variant accent
together with reciting the translation (of the talbiyah) as well as
getting an agent to recite the talbiyah on his behalf, after he had done
it himself.

169. A dumb must perform the talbiyah by making gestures with his
fingers, and moving his tongue at the same time.

170. It is not mandatory to perform the talbiyah immediately when the
two ihraam garments are worn and the niyyah stated, even though it is as
a precaution. If one says it after a [short] delay, his ihraam is
valid.

171. If the Haajj (pilgrim) forgot to say the talbiyah at the place of
the ihraam, which is the miqaat, and remembered the oversight after
crossing the miqaat, it is obligatory for him to go back to the miqaat
to perform it.

If it was not possible for him to go back, he should say it where he
is. If, after entering the Haram, the factor preventing him from going
back was eliminated, then he must leave the Haram, if possible, and
perform the talbiyah, otherwise, he should do so where he is. If he had
committed one of the forbidden acts of ihraam before saying the
talbiyah, he is not liable to a kaffaarah – compensation – even if had
crossed the miqaat.

172. If he doubted whether the talbiyah he had done is correct or not,
he should presume that it is correct. If he doubted whether he did
perform the talbiyah or not, and he had not crossed the miqaat, he
should presume that he had not, and it is obligatory for him to perform
the talbiyah then. If he had done one of the forbidden acts of the
ihraam that demands a kaffaarah, and he doubted whether he did that act
after the talbiyah or before it, he is not liable to kaffaarah.

**The haraam things and acts of ihraam**

173. The muhrim, i.e. one who is in the state of ihraam, must refrain
from 25 issues:

1. Hunting land animals,
2. Sexual intercourse (with one’s spouse),
3. Pleasure seeking with one’ spouse,
4. Performing marriage contract or witnessing it,
5. Masturbation,
6. Perfume,
7. Wearing sewn clothing (applicable only to men),
8. Wearing slippers, shoes, or socks,
9. Using Kohl powder on the eyes,
10. Looking in the mirror,
11. Fosuq, which is lying, swearing, and boasting,
12. Jidaal, which is to enter into arguments, disputes, or
Quarrelling,
13. Killing insects found on humans [such as lice],
14. Beautification,
15. Applying oil,
16. Removing hair (from the body),
17. (Using) Henna,
18. Covering the head (in the case of men),
19. For a woman to cover her face,
20. Sheltering in shade, for men,
21. Causing bleeding,
22. Clipping the finger nails,
23. Pulling a tooth,
24. Wearing arms/weapons,
25. Uprooting a tree or any vegetation of the Haram.

**1. Hunting land animals**

174. It is forbidden for a muhrim – one who is in the state of ihraam –
to hunt a land [/air] animal, excluding other animals. It is also
forbidden to catch the animal, or help in its hunt, even by guiding (the
hunter) or pointing (to it) or encaging it, or any other means in the
hunt process. It is also forbidden to slaughter the animal or eat from
its meat.

175. It is permissible to kill savage predatory animals if the muhrim
feared them. It is also permissible for non-muhrim to kill birds of prey
if they hurt the pigeons of the Haram, however, the muhrim, as a
precaution, should abstain from killing them.

176. If he hunted a game or slaughtered it, (it would count as) meetah
– dead animal meat – and thus it is forbidden for him or anyone else to
eat from it, and one may not perform the prayers wearing the leather
made from its skin.

177. It is prohibited to hunt a land animal, but a sea animal is not
prohibited to hunt. By sea animal it is meant those animals that live,
reproduce and grow in water, even in little streams of water. Also it is
not prohibited to slaughter a tame animal, even if had turned wild.

178. The ruling of the young is the same as its parent, and so too is
that of the egg. As for lotus, it is classified as a land animal, and
therefore it may not be hunted, and it is forbidden to eat.

179. If there was a doubt as to whether the animal is of land or sea,
it is not mandatory to avoid it.

180. Just as it is forbidden for a muhrim to hunt even outside the
Haram, it is also forbidden for a non-muhrim to hunt within the
boundaries of the Haram, and he is liable to a kaffaarah just as a
muhrim is, although the kaffaarah may sometimes differ. If a muhrim
killed an animal within the boundaries of the Haram, he is liable to the
cost of the animal as well as the kaffaarah.

**Kaffaarah of hunting**

181. The following kaffaaraat [compensations, penalties] are obligatory
in hunting:

• Hunting an Ostrich is liable to the kaffaarah of a camel.
• Hunting a wild cow is liable to the kaffaarah of a tame cow.
• Hunting a Zebra is liable to the kaffaarah of a camel or a tame
cow.
• Hunting a deer, a rabbit, or a fox is liable to the kaffaarah of a
sheep.

182. If one hunted [an animal] that is liable to a camel, but was
unable to find a camel, he should– with the cost of a camel – buy wheat
and divide it between the poor. However, it would be sufficient to give
food to sixty poor people, each receiving one modd of wheat. Each modd
is equivalent to approximately 750 grams. If he was unable to give that,
he should fast for 18 days instead. The fasting does not need to be
consecutive, and he can fast a few days at a time if he wished.

183. If one hunted [an animal] that is liable to a tame cow, but was
unable to find a cow, he should buy wheat – with the cost of a cow – and
divide it between the poor. However, it would be sufficient to give food
to thirty poor people, each receiving one modd of wheat. If he was
unable to give that, he should fast for 9 days instead.

184. If one hunted [an animal] that is liable to a sheep, but was
unable to find one, he should give food to ten poor people, each
receiving one modd of wheat. If he was unable to give that, he should
fast for 3 days instead.

185. If the muhrim hunted a pigeon or a similar bird, and slaughtered
it, he must compensate for this by [offering] a sheep. If he broke a
pigeon egg and the like, and there was a chick inside that had life, he
is liable to [offering] a sheep, and if the chick was motionless, he is
liable to the cost of the egg, which he should give to charity.

186. If a non-muhrim caught and killed a pigeon or other similar bird
within the boundaries of the Haram, then he is liable to either give one
Dirham19 to the poor, or give him the cost of the bird, although the
second option is preferable as a precaution.

187. If he hunted a sand grouse, partridge, and such like, he is liable
to a sheep.20

188. If he hunted a sparrow, wren, skylark, and the like outside [the
limit of] the Haram, he has the option of giving either the cost of the
kill or a modd of wheat to charity. If he was inside the Haram, his
liability is twice, and so too if he hunted a young. If he broke its
egg, he should give the cost of it to charity.

189. If he killed a lotus, he has the option of giving a handful of
wheat or one date to charity, but if he hunted a lot of lotuses, he is
liable to kaffaarah of a sheep. If there were many lotuses on the road,
it is incumbent on the muhrim to choose an alternative route. If this
was not possible, and some of the lotuses died as a result of him
stepping over them, he is not liable to anything.

190. If he killed a lizard, he is liable to a handful of wheat, and if
he unintentionally killed a wasp he is liable to some21 wheat, but if he
killed it to repel its harm, there is no liability [to a kaffaarah].

191. If a group took part in the hunt, every one of them is liable to a
separate kaffaarah.

19 A Dirham is equivalent to 0.3153 gram of gold, which is almost
one-hundredth of an ounce, i.e. if an ounce of gold is $350, then a
Dirham is equivalent to $3.50.

20 It is prohibited for a non-muhrim to hunt within the boundaries of
the Haram, just as it is so for a muhrim to hunt outside the boundaries
of the Haram. In both cases they are liable to kaffaarah as seen from
the examples given in the cases here. Needless to say it is prohibited
for a muhrim to hunt within the boundaries of the Haram.

21 This could be less than a handful.

192. The kaffaarah of eating the game is the same as the hunt itself.
So if a muhrim hunted a game and ate it, he is liable to two
kaffaarah’s; one for hunting, and another for eating from it.

193. If one was accompanied by a game, it is obligatory for him to
release it when he enters [the limits of] the Haram, and if he did not
release it until it died, he is liable to its kaffaarah. Also if someone
had hunted an animal when he was not in the state of ihraam, and then
declared and assumed ihraam, he must release the game even if he has not
entered the Haram.

194. Liability to killing or eating the game is mandatory regardless of
whether this was deliberate or by negligence, oversight, or ignorance of
the ruling of the case.

2. Sexual intercourse

195. Sexual intercourse is absolutely forbidden for a muhrim, whether
one was in a state of ihraam for Hajj or for Umrah.

196. Women are forbidden for muhrim men, just as men are forbidden for
muhrim women.

**The kaffaarah for sexual intercourse**

197. One who is in the state of ihraam for the Umrah of Tamattu‘, if he
had finished the sa‘y, but had not done the taqseer, and knowingly and
deliberately committed sexual intercourse with his spouse, he is liable
to kaffaarah of a camel. If he could not afford it, he should offer a
cow, and failing that he must offer a sheep, and his Umrah is valid. If,
on the other hand, he committed this before performing the sa‘y he is
liable to the kaffaarah and his Umrah is invalidated, and it is
obligatory for him to repeat the Umrah if possible.

198. If one had declared and assumed the ihraam for the Hajj, and
before the woquf in the Mash‘ar al-Haraam, he knowingly and deliberately
committed sexual intercourse with his spouse, if the woman had willingly
agreed to it too; the Hajj of both is invalidated. However, they are
both obliged to complete the Hajj, and repeat the Hajj in the second
year, regardless of whether their Hajj was obligatory or optional
(mostahab).

If the woman had not willingly agreed to it, her Hajj is not
invalidated, and the man must pay two kaffaarah, and the woman is not
obliged to anything. Furthermore, it is mandatory to part between the
man and woman from where this act was committed during this Hajj, and
during the second Hajj until they arrive in the same stage again.22 199.
If a muhrim for Hajj knowingly and deliberately engages in sexual
intercourse with his spouse after the woquf in Mash‘ar al-Haraam and
before performing Tawaaf an-Nisa’,

he is obliged to offer a kaffaarah but his Hajj is not invalidated. If
he committed this act after three-and-a-half cycles of Tawaaf-an-Nisa’,
his Hajj is valid, but as a recommended precaution, he should give the
kaffaarah. If he did this after the completion of tawaaf-an-Nisa’ and
before the prayers of this tawaaf, his Hajj is valid and he is not
obliged to give kaffaarah.

200. If a muhrim for the Mufradah Umrah knowingly and deliberately
engages in sexual intercourse with his spouse before the sa‘y, he is
obliged to offer a kaffaarah and his Umrah is invalidated. However, he
must complete this Umrah, and then perform a new ihraam for the Mufradah
Umrah, and perform all its rites.

201. If a muhrim for the Mufradah Umrah knowingly and deliberately
engages in sexual intercourse with his spouse after Tawaaf-an-Nisa’ and
before the prayers of the tawaaf, he is not obliged to a kaffaarah and
his Umrah is valid.

If this was at a time when the Tawaaf-an-Nisa’ was 22 During the
current Hajj, this separation must last until the end of the Hajj.
Because he engaged in sexual intercourse with his wife, he must also
observe the mabeet in Mina on the eve of the 13th and also perform the
Ram’y of the three Jamaraat on the 13th day of Dhil-Hejjah.

If he had performed the rites of Makkah – the two tawaafs and the sa‘y
– prior to day 13, then that would be the end of the Hajj, and if not,
the end of Hajj would be when he completes the rites of Makkah. As for
the separation between the couple on the next Hajj, it starts from the
moment of the declaration of the ihraam for the Hajj until they arrive
at the same stage where they committed the act last year.

partially done, his Hajj is not invalidated, but as a recommended
precaution, he should give a kaffaarah.

202. If a muhrim woman willingly consents to sexual intercourse, the
rulings in her case are the same as those of a man in terms of
obligation of the kaffaarah, invalidation of the Hajj, etc.

203. If a muhrim man engages in sexual intercourse with his spouse
while not being conversant with the ruling of the case, or due to
negligence and oversight, regardless of whether this negligence and
oversight was in respect of the rulings of the case or in [him being] in
the state of ihraam, his Hajj and Umrah are not invalidated, and he is
not obliged to give kaffaarah.

**3. Seeking pleasure
**
204. It is forbidden to seek pleasure from one’s spouse by say kissing,
looking, touching, etc. if this was with passion and lust. However, if
the touching and looking was without passion or lust, then it is not
objectionable. Also hugging is not objectionable if it is not with the
intention of pleasure. As for kissing it should be absolutely avoided,
as a precaution.

205. All of this is applicable to woman, just as it is for man, and
therefore it is not permitted for her to seek pleasure by looking at her
husband or touch him with lust or passion, or kiss him.

206. If a muhrim knowingly and deliberately, lustfully kissed his wife,
and as a result ejaculated, he is obliged to give a kaffaarah of a
camel, and the same is applicable even if he did not ejaculate. If he
did not do that out of lust, and he ejaculated, he is obliged to give a
kaffaarah of a sheep, and if he did not ejaculate he should give a
kaffaarah of a sheep as an obligatory precaution.

207. If a muhrim lustfully touched his wife, and as a result, he
ejaculated, he is obliged to give a kaffaarah of camel.

208. If the muhrim lustfully fondled his wife or looked at her, such
that as a result he ejaculated, he is obliged to give a kaffaarah of a
camel.

209. If a muhrim knowingly and deliberately looked at a non-mahram
woman, and as a result ejaculated, regardless of whether it was with or
without lust, and regardless of whether or not he had intended the
ejaculation, he is obliged to give a kaffaarah of a camel, if he was
well off, otherwise he should give a kaffaarah of a cow, or if he was
poor he should give a kaffaarah of a sheep. However, if he did not
ejaculate he is not liable to a kaffaarah, although by this act he had
committed disobedience and sinned.

**4. Performing a marriage contract or witnessing it**

210. It is forbidden for a muhrim to perform a marriage contract,
whether this is for himself or for others, and regardless of it being a
permanent, temporary, or proxy marriage, and whether the persons
involved were muhrim or non-muhrim. It is also forbidden if someone else
performed a marriage contract for him as his agent, even if agency was
given to the agent prior to him assuming the state of ihraam.

211. As a precaution, one should also abstain from seeking permission
of marriage [from the father or guardian of the girl] even if his
intentions are to conclude the marriage contract after the ihraam. As
for the return in the case of a divorce, there is no objection to it if
it is done during the state of ihraam.

212. It is forbidden for a muhrim to attend a marriage contract
ceremony, or witness a marriage contract even for someone else. This is
applicable even if the other party was not in the state of ihraam. Also
it is forbidden for him to act as witness, even if he agreed to do so
when he was not in the state of ihraam.

213. If a muhrim conducted the marriage contract for a couple who were
both muhrim, and the couple had sexual intercourse, if this was done
knowingly and deliberately, for all concerned, every one of them must
give a kaffaarah of a camel, and the marriage contract is invalid, and
the wife is forever forbidden (haraam) for the husband, [i.e. the
husband can never marry that woman again in the future]. This is in
addition to the rulings on sexual intercourse [concerning a muhrim] as
mentioned previously. One is not liable to kaffaarah if this was due to
ignorance of the ruling, negligence, oversight, or compulsion.23

214. If a muhrim married a muhrimah [a female muhrim] by conducting the
marriage contract himself, then the same rulings as above apply, in
terms of knowledge and ignorance, etc.

215. If a muhrim performed the marriage contract for a couple who were
both not in the state of ihraam, the marriage contract is invalid, and
the man who performed the marriage contract must give a kaffaarah of a
camel.

**5. Masturbation**

216. Masturbation, which is seeking to ejaculate by means of hand or
any other means, is forbidden [in general], and it is also one of the
forbidden acts of ihraam.

217. If a muhrim masturbated using his hands, his ruling is that of a
muhrim who had sexual intercourse with his wife; in terms of the
invalidity [of his rituals] and the obligation of completing [the rest
of the rituals]. He must repeat it the same year if he was muhrim for
the Mufradah Umrah, and in the following year if he was muhrim for the
Hajj, etc.

218. If a muhrim did not masturbate by his hands, but only by looking
at a woman [who is not his wife], or by imagination, he is obliged to
give a kaffaarah of a camel if he is well off, a cow if he is considered
average, or a sheep if he is not well off. In this case his Hajj is not
invalidated if he was muhrim for Hajj, nor is his Umrah if he was muhrim
for Umrah.

23 The only difference between these two scenarios is the non-liability
to kaffaarah in the latter category, otherwise under all circumstances
the marriage is invalid and the couple may never marry again.

**6. Perfume**

219. It is forbidden for a muhrim to use perfume, such as Musk, Anber,
Warce, saffron, etc. in all it types and applications, and as precaution
all kinds of perfume and fragrant should be avoided.

220. If a muhrim was compelled to perfume, he must block his nose. He
must also do so if he bought it from the perfume seller, or sat next to
an individual who was wearing perfume, etc.

221. If any perfume fell on his garments, or on his body, he must
remove it immediately by washing etc.

222. There is no objection in eating flowers and herbs, fruits,
medicine, etc. that are not normally considered as perfume, even if they
had pleasant fragrant. The ultimate precaution in this case would be not
to smell them.

223. It is not permissible for a muhrim to block his nose when he comes
across bad smells.

224. The kaffaarah for using saffron, musk, anber, and warce whether
smelling them or using them for eating or wearing, is a sheep. There is
no kaffaarah for other kinds of perfume.

**7. Wearing sewn clothing for men**

225. It is forbidden for male muhrims to wear sewn clothing, such as
shirt, trousers, coat, cloak, or clothing with buttons or sleeves, etc.
even if they were not sewn. It is also forbidden to wear shields,
armour, or the malbad – worn by shepherds. All of these are forbidden
for a muhrim unless compelled to do so, in which case it is permissible
to do so, and as a precaution, should give a kaffaarah of a sheep. The
restrictions mentioned here are not applicable to women.

226. It is not permissible for male muhrim to tie as a knot his ihraam,
but there is no objection to prick the ends together using a pin and
such like.

227. It is permissible for a muhrim to wear the following things, even
though they are sewn:

1. the hemyaan, a wide belt with built in pockets, to keep cash,
valuables, etc.

2. belt,

3. hernia belt if needed, and it is permissible to tie it as a knot, as
well as knotting the belt and hemyaan if he wore one,

4. shoes, if they do not cover the top surface of the feet, although as
a precaution one should refrain [from wearing them].

228. It is permissible for women to wear sewn clothing in general. The
exception is that women are not allowed to wear gloves.

229. If a male muhrim wears sewn clothing knowingly and deliberately,
he is liable to the kaffaarah of a sheep.

**8. Wearing slippers and socks**

230. It is forbidden for the male muhrim to wear boots, slippers,
socks, etc. that cover the feet. If he cannot find the Arabic slippers,
it is permitted for him to wear those footwear that cover the feet
provided, as a precaution, he tears off the front of the shoes such that
feet are not covered.

231. It is permitted for women to wear socks and such like, and as a
mostahab precaution, [part of the] socks should be torn to prevent
covering the feet.

232. Polystyrene flippers that are not sewn and do not cover the feet
are ideal for ihraam, and it is not necessary for them to be white
coloured, any colour is permissible.

233. There is no objection to the feet being covered by the ihraam
garments, etc. when walking, sitting, or during sleep.

234. The kaffaarah for wearing socks or slippers is a sheep if this was
done out of choice. If he wore any of these, by tearing the front to
reveal the feet, then there is no liability to kaffaarah.

**9. Wearing kohl eyeliner**

235. It is forbidden for a muhrim [male or female] to wear black kohl
eyeliner [make up for the eyes], even if one does not intend for
beautification. As a precaution, wearing any kind of black kohl eyeliner
should be avoided even if not intended for beautification. Wearing
nonblack eyeliners is permissible if it is not intended for
beautification. 236. If one wore kohl, there is no kaffaarah to give,
other than istighfaar, seeking forgiveness from Allah Almighty. It is
recommended – mostahab – that he gives kaffaarah of a sheep.

**10. Looking into mirrors**

237. It is forbidden for a muhrim to look in a mirror for the purpose
of beautification / dressing up. If by doing so he does not seek
beautification, like car driver looking in the mirror to watch what is
behind him, then there is no objection to that.

238. There is no objection to looking in clear water, and any other
liquid or glass screen on cars that reflect the [image of the] body.
Also there is no object to wearing spectacles if it is not intended for
beautification or adornment.

239. If a muhrim looked in a mirror for the purpose of dressing up, he
is not liable to a kaffaarah, except istighfaar – seeking forgiveness
from Allah Almighty – although it is recommended that he should then
renew the talbiyah. See case \# 166 for the declaration of talbiyah.

**11. Fosuq**

240. It is forbidden to commit Fosuq, which is attributing lies,
whether to Allah Almighty, the prophet salla-llahu-alayhi-wa-aalih, the
Ma‘soom Imams alayhum-as-salam, or the people in general. So too is
using swearwords, boasting about himself, humiliating and demeaning
others, or using foul language.

241. The kaffaarah of fosuq if istighfaar – seeking forgiveness from
Allah Almighty, and his ihraam is not invalidated.

**12. Arguing**

242. It is forbidden for a muhrim to engage in arguments, which is to
swear by Allah – saying “la wallah” or “bala wallah” meaning “by Allah,
No!” or “by Allah, Yes!” This is the case – i.e. forbidden – even in the
absence of quarrelling, as a precaution. However, it is permissible to
do so if it is [absolutely] necessary to prove the truth, or repel
falsehood, or if it is to glorify [Allah, Rasulollah, and the
Ahl-ul-Bayt] or show loyalty [to them].

243. If, in the course of an argument, one swore twice on an issue and
he was saying the truth, then he has committed a sin, and he is not
obliged to give a kaffaarah except istighfaar, and if he swore three
times or more, he is obliged to give a kaffaarah of a sheep.

244. If, in the course of an argument, one swore once on an issue and
he was lying, he is obliged to a kaffaarah of a sheep, and if he swore
twice on a lie, he is obliged to kaffaarah of a cow, and if he swore
three times on a lie, he is obliged to kaffaarah of a camel.

**13. Killing of insects found on the body**

245. It is forbidden for a muhrim to kill the insects found on [his]
body, such as lice, and as a precaution there is no difference between
the processes in which they are killed, whether directly or indirectly,
by means of [chemical] substance, or throwing it so that it would be
prone to be killed. As a precaution, the same is applicable for moving
the insect from one place to another such that it would be prone to fall
off. If however, the insect does not form on one’s body, such as a flea
or tick, then it is permissible to kill it. The tick may not be moved
from the body of the camel, but it is permissible to move it from the
body of the human or kill it.

246. It is permissible to kill insects such as bug or flea, and such
likes in the process of protecting oneself, although as a mostahab

them off the body, the kaffaarah is a handful of food to give as charity
to the poor.

**14. Beautification**

248. It is forbidden for muhrim to engage in any act that constitutes
beautification or adornment, such as wearing a ring. It is permissible
to wear a khatam if it is intended as a Sunnah.

249. It is forbidden for a woman in the state of ihraam to wear
jewellery for the purpose of beautification, although what she normally
or habitually wears before ihraam is not objectionable provided that it
is not visible.

250. There is no objection to wearing a watch in the state of ihraam if
it is not intended for the purpose of adornment or beautification. 251.
The kaffaarah for beautification is a sheep, as a precaution, and no
kaffaarah is applicable for wearing khatam.

**15. Applying oil**

252. It is forbidden for a muhrim to use oil to apply to the body, or
other body lotions, even if they do not have any scent or perfume.
However, it is permissible if it was for a necessity or treatment. 253.
There is no kaffaarah for applying oil to the body except istighfaar,
however, if this was deliberate, and out of choice and knowledge, it is
recommended that a kaffaarah of a sheep is given.

**16. Hair removal**

254. It is forbidden for a muhrim to remove any hair from his/her body
or from someone else’s, even few strands of hair. The exception here is
if there was a necessity such as [if the head of the person was]
lice-ridden, severe headache [that could be eased by shaving the head],
or if there was an annoying hair strand in the eye. In these cases hair
removal is permissible, and it is obligatory to give a kaffaarah. There
is no liability to a kaffaarah if one removed someone else’s hair,
although it is not permissible for him to do so [to begin with] even if
the other person is not in the state of ihraam.

255. It is permissible for a muhrim to scratch his body, provided he
takes care the hair is not removed because of the scratching.

256. There is no objection if some hair unintentionally falls in the
process of wudhu or Ghusl, when one normally runs his fingers through
the hair, as necessary. However, if this went beyond the norm, then it
would be objectionable, and as a precaution one should give a kaffaarah
of two handfuls of food.

257. If, because of a necessity, a muhrim shaves his head, he is liable
to kaffaarah of a sheep, or three days’ fasting, or feeding six poor
people the amount of two modd of wheat each. Also if he shaved his head
without a necessity, he has the choice between them, although it is
recommended, as a precaution, to give a kaffaarah of a sheep.

258. If a muhrim shaved other than his head, knowingly and
deliberately, whether the shaving is permitted outside ihraam or not –
such as shaving the beard – as a precaution his kaffaarah is a sheep.

**17. Henna**

259. The use of Henna during ihraam is forbidden as a precaution, and
it is preferable to avoid it (Henna) before ihraam, if any traces still
remain at the time of ihraam. It is preferable to avoid anything that
contradicts the muhrim to be dishevelled and dust-covered.

**18. Covering the head – for men**

260. It is forbidden for a male muhrim to cover his head, which is
defined as the hair growing area and the ears. The prohibition applies
whether the head is covered fully or partially, and regardless of the
kind of cover used; if it touches the head, even mud or henna. Also it
is not permitted for him to submerge in water or in any other liquid, or
to carry anything on the head, if it meant that it covers the head, as a
precaution.

261. It is permitted to cover the head with part of the body such as
the hand, and also it is permitted to wipe the hand on the head when
performing wudhu, or when pouring water over the head during Ghusl, etc.
as this is not regarded as covering [the head].

262. It is permitted for a muhrim to sleep even if this constitutes
part of his head being covered due to its contact with the ground [or
pillow]. It is also permitted for him to pour water over his head or
stand below the showerhead for [the purpose of] washing, etc. it is also
permitted for him to scratch his head if he was sure that any hair would
not fall [as a result].

263. If due to lapse and oversight he covered his head, he is not
liable to anything, but must remove the cover as soon as he realises his
oversight. 264. The kaffaarah of covering the head is a sheep, and a
kaffaarah is liable each time the head is covered.

**19. Women face covering**

265. While in the state of ihraam, it is forbidden for a woman to cover
her face with the cover [she normally wears] such that it touches her
face, even when asleep.

266. It is permitted for female muhrim to sleep even if this
constitutes part of her face being covered by coming in contact with the
ground or [the pillow]. It is also permitted for her to cover her face
with a veil such that it is distant from her face. It is permitted for
her to cover her face with hands. It is also permitted for her to wear
her aba, and cover her face provided the face cover is kept away from
her face. It is also permitted if part of her face [i.e. he forehead] is
covered, if this is in aid of covering the head as required for the
daily obligatory prayers.

267. The kaffaarah for a woman covering her face is a sheep.

20. Sheltering

20. Sheltering in shade – for men

268. It is forbidden for a male muhrim to seek shelter in the shade
while on the move, whether on foot or during a ride, like using an
umbrella or riding in a roofed vehicle. As a mostahab precaution, he
should avoid seeking shelter on either side of his body, even though it
is permissible to walk in the shadow of a vehicle or anything provided
that it would not be over his head, and it is permissible to use one’s
bare hands as a protection from the sun.

269. On the basis of what can be derived from the hadith, there is no
distinguishing between day and night in so far as the prohibition of the
seeking shelter is concerned, thus it is not permissible to seek shelter
during the night.

270. It is permissible for a muhrim, while on the move, to pass
underneath a bridge or go through a tunnel, and it is permissible to
declare and assume ihraam under the roof of Masgid al-Shajarah, as
mentioned earlier.

271. It is permissible for a muhrim to seek shelter under a roof, if he
stopped his journey for a rest between the miqaat and Makkah, like going
to the motorway restaurants, or if he needed to go to offices to
organise his travel schedule, etc. and as a recommended precaution, he
should avoid using umbrella.

272. It is permissible to seek shelter from the sun even with an
umbrella once in the holy city of Makkah, and there is no difference in
this respect between old and new Makkah. This is also applicable once in
Arafaat and Mina, and if one who is in Mina, wished to go to the
slaughter place or to the Jamaraat. 66

273. It is permissible for one who declares and assumes ihraam from the
mosque of al-Tan‘eem mosque for the Mufradah Umrah to ride a roofed car,
for these days the mosque in question is considered to be inside the
holy city of Makkah.

274. It is permissible to seek shelter in necessity, like when it is
extremely hot or cold, or when it is raining – if it is likely to harm
him, but he must give kaffaarah.

275. In general sheltering is permissible for women and children, with
no liability to kaffaarah.

276. A male guide for the women pilgrims who needs to be with them, he
is permitted to ride a roofed vehicle with them, so too is the driver
who fears for his car if he left it, and in both of these cases, they
[the guide and car driver] are liable to kaffaarah.

277. If no cars are available for the pilgrim other than the roofed
cars, or if he cannot ride cars but the roofed ones – due to an illness
say – then it is permitted for him to ride the roofed ones, but he is
liable to a kaffaarah.

278. The narrow crossbars of roofless cars do not provide shelter, [and
therefore the shade that they produce does not constitute shelter].

279. Whenever he was compelled to seek shelter, he is liable to a
kaffaarah, and during one ihraam, it is sufficient to give one kaffaarah
for more than one occasion of shelter seeking. However, as a mostahab
precaution, he should give a separate kaffaarah for each day.

280. The kaffaarah for seeking shelter is a sheep, and it is permitted
for him to slaughter it in his home country.

21. Causing bleeding

281. It is forbidden for a muhrim to cause [any part of] his body to
bleed, by any means, whether by venesection, or hijamah (cupping or
bloodletting), or while brushing the teeth, or scratching, etc. unless
it is for a necessity. Some of the circumstances of necessity are itchy
skin disorders that are associated with scratching, cutting open and
squeezing a boil or sore, if leaving them unattended by not scratching
or cutting them would hurt him.

282. The kaffaarah for causing bleeding unnecessarily is a sheep, and
if he were compelled, he would not be liable to a kaffaarah.

**22. Clipping fingernails**

283. Fingernail clipping is forbidden for a muhrim even if it is to
clip one fingernail, or part of, unless [the particular fingernail] is
hurting him, for example if part of the nail was broken, or if the
finger needed to be treated, and this required the nail to be clipped.

284. The kaffaarah for clipping each fingernail is one modd of food,
and that for all of one’s fingers only a sheep, and so too for one’s
toes only. If the clipping of all fingers and toes was done in one
session, then the kaffaarah is one sheep, but if the fingernails were
clipped in one session, and the toenails in another, then the kaffaarah
is two sheep. All of this is applicable if it was done knowingly and
deliberately.

**23. Pulling a tooth**

285. It is forbidden for a muhrim to pull a tooth if it were to bleed,
and the kaffaarah is a sheep, however, if one was compelled to do so, it
is permissible and one is not liable to a kaffaarah.

**24. Wearing of arms**

286. It is forbidden for muhrim to wear arms, such as sword, dagger,
pistol, rifle, and such like that is considered a weapon, and one who is
carrying it is considered armed. However, if one is not considered
armed, such as carrying a small knife that a pilgrim might need for his
personal use, then there is no objection to it. As a precaution, a
weapon must not be carried overtly even if it is not being worn.

287. The kaffaarah for wearing arms out of choice is a sheep as a
mostahab precaution.

**25. Uprooting the plants of the Haram**

288. It is forbidden for a muhrim to cut or uproot anything that grows
in the Haram, whether or not s/he was in the state of ihraam, or s/he
was performing Hajj or Umrah, etc.

289. The exceptions from the above ruling are:

• al-Edhkher (lemon grass), which is a famous herb,
• date palm,
• fruit trees,
• anything that one has planted himself,
• the plant that had grown in his house or property, if it grew after
moving in.

290. The kaffaarah for uprooting a large tree is a cow, and for a small
tree is a sheep, and if it was part of the tree, [then the kaffaarah] is
the price of that [part], and that for grass is istighfaar. All of this
is applicable if it was done knowingly and deliberately. However, if it
was done in ignorance, or due to oversight etc. then one is not liable
to anything.

**Miscellaneous**

291. Whatever kaffaarah becomes obligatory for him during the ihraam of
Umrah, he should slaughter in Makkah, and whatever kaffaarah becomes
obligatory for him during the ihraam of Hajj, he should slaughter in
Mina, and give it to the poor of the faithful, or send it to their
representative(s). If this was not possible, since there were no
destitute, nor their representative, in that case one has the choice of
slaughtering in Makkah / Mina or doing so back in his homeland and
distributing it between the poor and needy.

292. If one committed an act, which is liable to a kaffaarah while
ignorant of the ruling, then he is not liable to a kaffaarah. The same
is applicable if this was due to an oversight, except in hunting. As for
hunting, the kaffaarah is applicable if an act requiring it was
committed, regardless of this being in ignorance, oversight or
deliberate.

293. If one of the forbidden acts of ihraam occurred coercively, then
the muhrim is not liable to anything, such as when someone else
forcefully sheltered him, or covered his head.

294. In every case when he was liable to a sheep, he could if he wished
offer a goat instead.
