37. Object Pronouns.
====================

You remember what was mentioned earlier that possessive pronouns are
suffixed to nouns. Now, I would like to remind you that object pronouns
are suffixed to the verbs. Please, notice the difference of the pronouns
in the following sentences:

a. (Possessive Pronoun)     **کتابُها علی الطاولةِ.**

b. (Object Pronoun)شاهدتُها في السوقِ.
