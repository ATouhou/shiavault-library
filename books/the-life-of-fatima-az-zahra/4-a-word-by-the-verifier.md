A Word By the Verifier
======================

Fatima (a.s.) is the highest woman in knowledge, purity, patience, and
piety that history has ever known. She was brought up in the house of
Revelation and grew in the lap of the greatest Prophet (a.s.), and thus
she was the vessel of Imamate and the continuity of Prophethood.

She got married to Ameerul Mo'minin Ali bin Abi Talib (a.s.) and lived
with him a life of simplicity and asceticism, and so she was an ideal
example for Muslim women or, indeed, for all Muslims.

However, fate willed for her that she would not live after her father’s
death but for a short time because of the oppression and harms she met
from the people; though the Prophet (a.s.) had said about her, ‘Fatima
is a part from me; whoever harms her harms me.’ But, people denied the
truth, deviated from the path of the Mission, and turned him (Imam Ali)
away from the position of Imamate.

The book before you, dear reader, is a study on the life of Infallible
Fatima (a.s.), the daughter of Prophet Muhammad (a.s.). Our role in this
book was the reviewing and verifying of its texts and sources. Praise be
to Allah and Allah’s blessing be on Muhammad and his pure progeny.
