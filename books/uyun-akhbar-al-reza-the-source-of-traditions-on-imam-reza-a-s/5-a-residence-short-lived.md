A Residence Short-lived
=======================

Now you live in a residence short-lived  
In which the deeds of the doers are accepted  
See you not how death encompasses it  
And destroys all aspirations  
There you rush to fulfill your lustful desires  
And procrastinate your repentance  
But death will overcome you by surprise  
But what will the intelligent learn from this?

**Imam Al-Reza (s)**
