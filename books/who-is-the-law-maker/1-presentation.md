***In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
“وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا
تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَنْ سَبِيلِهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ
وَصَّاكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ“
  </p>
</blockquote>

***[6:153] And (know) that this is My path, the right one therefore
follow it, and follow not (other) ways, for they will lead you away from
His way; this He has enjoined you with that you may guard (against
evil).***

Historically and sociologically speaking, the greatest problem faced by
humanity has been that of law, order and discipline, but unfortunately
mankind itself is the cause of these grieve problems.

The solution to these problems is further complicated by man's
arrogance. For he regards himself a godhead, his will a law and his
desires and whims a discipline and order.

How much mankind suffers from these problems while revolving with the
wheel of loss and futile quest is proved by the absurd laws, man coins,
legislates, invents and implements vainly, without being able to reach
the avowed goal or to obtain any good result. In fact with these errors
he increases humanity's already sky-high pile of errors and adds his
failures to the calamity of human sufferings.

Thus it is evident that this straying and confused man will never get
relief from a hard and cruel life, so long as he remains away from the
course of his exalted Creator Allah, and continues to disregard the
Divine’s Call and Message.

Allah, the Almighty has clearly mentioned in the holy Qur'an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
“وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَنْ ذِكْرِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنْكًا
وَنَحْشُرُهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَعْمَىٰ “
  </p>
</blockquote>

***[20:124] And whoever turns away from My reminder, his shall be a
straitened life, and We will raise him on the day of resurrection,
blind.***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
“قَالَ رَبِّ لِمَ حَشَرْتَنِي أَعْمَىٰ وَقَدْ كُنْتُ بَصِيرًا “
  </p>
</blockquote>

***[20:125] He shall say: My Lord! why hast Thou raised me blind and I
was a seeing one indeed?***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
“قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ أَتَتْكَ آيَاتُنَا فَنَسِيتَهَا ۖ وَكَذَٰلِكَ
الْيَوْمَ تُنْسَىٰ “
  </p>
</blockquote>

***[20:126] He will say: Even so, Our communications came to you but you
neglected them; even thus shall you be forsaken this day.***

In this brief study we will try to throw light on certain aspects of
law-making and explain some of its dimensions as follows:

1. A Definition of Law.

2. A Definition of Law-maker.

3. Islam: The universal Legislation for mankind.

4. Stages of the existence of Law.

5. An Evaluation of Islamic Law and Secular Law.
