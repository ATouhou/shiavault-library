Between Makkah and Medina
=========================

As mentioned, the first rite in Mina on the 10th is *ramy* of Jamrat
al‑\`Aqabah, after that the offering of *hady,* and then thirdly, *halq*
or *taqsir.* We have already discussed the third under the head "*Halq*
or *Taqsir*." We have referred to the rule about doing the *halq* or
*taqsir* before the *dhabh* when discussing the order of the rites under
the head "In Mina", where the reader will find its details.

When the pilgrim completes his rites in Mina on the day of \`Id (such as
*ramy* and *dhabh),* he returns to Makkah to perform the *tawaf
al‑ziyarah;* then he offers its related *rak'atayn* and performs the
*sa’y* between Safa and Marwah. According to the four Sunni schools, he
returns to Mina after that *tawaf* and everything becomes permissible to
him thereupon, even sex. According to the Imamiyyah, he has to perform
another *tawaf* the *tawaf al‑nisa',* and offer its related *rak'atayn.*
Sex does not become permissible to the pilgrim, from the Imamiyyah
viewpoint, without this *tawaf* which we have already discussed in
detail above.
