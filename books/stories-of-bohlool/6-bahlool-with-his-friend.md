Bahlool With His Friend
=======================

One day a friend of Bahlool's took some grains to grind at the mill.
After grinding them, he loaded them on his donkey and started home. Near
Bahlool's house, his donkey began limping and fell. He called Bahlool
and said, “ Give me your ass so I can take my bundle home.”

Bahlool had taken an oath that he would not give his donkey to anyone,
so he said, “I don't have a donkey.” But then a donkey's bray was heard.

The man said to Bahlool, “You have a donkey but you said you didn't.”

Bahlool replied, “You are a strange and stupid friend. Even though we
have been friends for fifty years, you don't listen to me, but you
listen to an ass.”
