Hadith No. 39

Iftaar for Mu'min
-----------------

The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said: One who
provides iftaar to a Mu'min in the month of Ramadan, shall be granted
the reward of liberating a slave (in the path of Allah) and shall have
all his previous sins forgiven. And if he did not possess the means to
present anything except milk mixed with water, or a drink of sweet water
and a date, Allah would grant him this reward.*Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 93,
pg. 317*
