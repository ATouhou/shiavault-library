Lesson Forty Three: Reality of unity and divine justice
=======================================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلتَّوْحِيْدُ أَنْ لاتَتَوَهْمَهُ و الْعَدْلُ أَنْ لا تَتَّهِمَهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Reality of unity of God indicates that one shall not define His essence
according to one’s imaginations, and belief in His justice infers that
one shall not accuse Him in any work.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The principle of God’s existence is clear and manifest for us and any
particle from particles of this world points to His dignity, power,
knowledge and ability. On the other hand, the reality of His essence is
hidden from us because He is an infinite existence and beyond our
understanding. So we should consider His essence to be beyond whatsoever
we may imagine and this is the reality of unity.

Events occur in the world whose underlying mystery is not always known
to us. Belief in God’s justice says to us that all of these events are
backed by sound reasons and any suspicion in this regard is not in
conformity with belief in His justice and wisdom.
