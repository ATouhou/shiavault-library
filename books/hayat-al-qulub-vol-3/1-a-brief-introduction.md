A Brief Introduction
====================

The third volume deals with the topic of Imamate, the appointment of the
Imam (a.s.), the inerrancy of the Imams and the obligation of the people
to obey them. After this the Author has collected all the verses of the
Holy Quran whose Exegesis (Tafsir) points towards Ahlul Bayt (a.s.). He
has supported his statements with traditions. This volume can be said to
be a Special Tafsir of the Holy Quran.
