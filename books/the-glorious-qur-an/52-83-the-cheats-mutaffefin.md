83: the Cheats (mutaffefin)
===========================

These 36 late Meccan verses come after The Spider 29, and were the last
to be revealed in Mecca before the Hijra or Transfer to the new Islamic
capital of Yathrib or Madina in 622 A. D., the Zero year A.H.

The chapter gives us a hint as to our future life and its rewards. Again
it is rhymed throughout The beginning is a condemnation of fraudulent
practices.
