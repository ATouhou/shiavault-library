Objections Against the Definition
=================================

It may be objected that the above definition is not logical or
tech­nical, for a technically and logically correct definition should
closely correspond to the thing defined, whereas the said definition is
rather loose. It states that ijtihad is to derive and determine ahkam
from the sources; it does not specify that the person performing
derivation should also possess the capacity, whereas the mujtahid is one
who possesses the capacity of ijtihad. This objection is valid, unless
it is said that ijtihad depends on the capacity and it is not possible
to derive ahkam from reliable sources except through that capacity, and
here possession of the capacity is taken for granted.

**Note**

It is appropriate here to clarify one thing about the capacity of
ijtihad: it is a capacity acquired through the knowledge of ten types of
disciplines on which derivation and understanding of the ahkam of the
Shari'ah depends. In this regard, the requirement of another faculty -
the so-called quwwah qudsiyyah - is not essential, for the-ijtihad which
is acceptable to all means derivation of the Shar'i ahkam from the
sources, and in the same way as a just' (\`adil) mujtahid can perform
this task, it can also be performed by a mujtahid who is not \`just'.

**Two Different Conceptions of Ijtihad**

The term ijtihad as used in the writings of scholars of different
Islamic sects conveys two different meanings, each of which gives rise
to different viewpoints regarding the sources of Shar'i ahkam. In the
first conception ijtihad means derivation of Shar\`i hukm through
personal judgement and ray for an issue for which the mujtahid does not
find any express text in the Quran or the Sunnah. Such a meaning of
ijtihad is found in the writings of \`Abd al-Wahhab al-Khallaf and most
of Sunni fuqaha' also subscribe to this view.

Ijtihad in this sense is. considered by most of Sunni scholars as an
independent source parallel to the Quran, the Sunnah, ijma\` and \`aql,
and is acknowledged as one of the bases for determining the ahkam.

It means that in the same manner as a mujtahid relies on sources like
the Quran, the Sunnah, \`aql and ijma\` for deriving ahkam, he can also
rely on ray and subjective opinion by taking recourse to instruments of
presumption (like qiyas, istihsan, masalih mursalah, istislah, madhhab
al-Sahabi, fath al-dhara'i\`, sadd al-dhara'i\`, etc.) for issues on
which there is no express text in the Quran and the Sunnah.

In the second conception ijtihad means deduction of the fari ahkam from
the reliable sources (the Quran, the Sunnah, ijma\` and \`aql). Ijtihad
in this sense occurs in the writings of Ahmad Mustafa al-Zarqa', the
author of al-Madkhal al-fiqhi al-\`amm, and Shi'i fuqaha' have
sub­scribed to this view long since. According to this conception, the
activity of the mujtahid involves deduction of the laws of the Shari'ah
for emergent issues and new phenomena of life by employing general
principles and rules. Thereby the mujtahid refers new secondary issues
to the general principles and applies the general laws to their
particular instances in external reality, thus obtaining the ahkam
governing them. According to this conception, ijtihad is not counted as
an independent source of law parallel to the Quran and the Sunnah, but
merely as a means for deriving and determining the ahkam from the
sources.

**Ijtihad as an Independent Source in Sunni Fiqh**

Leading Sunni jurists have chosen the first conception of ijtihad, as
an independent source parallel to the Book of God and the Sunnah of the
Prophet (S). They have included ijtihad itself, besides the four sources
of fiqh, as the fifth one. Accordingly, they have specified for it a
separate section in their books of usul such as Usul al-fiqh, al­
Mustaqfa, al-Ahkam and other works - and have undertaken diverse
discussions about it. In accordance with this conception, al-Shafi\`i
considers qiyas to be same as ijtihad in his Risalah. He writes: What is
qiyas? Is qiyas the same as ijtihad, or are they different'? I say,
qiyas and ‘ijtihad are two terms which convey the same meaning like
\`man' and \`human being’. [^41]

In Risalah he rejects the opinions of most of Sunni fuqaha' who believe
istihsan to be one of the sources of ijtihad, [^42]for the majority of
them believe ‘ijtihad to be synonymous with ray, qiyas, istihsan and
istinbat. Mustafa \`Abd al-Razzaq is one of them; he writes: The ray of
which we speak is the mujtahid's reliance on his subjective opinion and
judgement for obtaining a law of the Shari'ah. This is what we mean by
ijtihad and qiyas, which are synonymous with istinbat and istihsan.
[^43]

This statement appears to be strange, for ijtihad, istinbat, ray, qiyas
and istihsan are terms which are different from one another regarding
their meaning. How can they be considered synonymous and equivalent
terms, and how can it be said that these words convey the same meaning
when there is nothing common either between the words or their
meanings?

It may be said in justification of the above-mentioned statement that
the equating of ray with ijtihad is for the reason that the personal
judgement of a mujtahid in the event of absence of any express text of
the Quran and the Sunnah is synonymous with ijtihhd bi al-ray and hence
this sort of istinbat has been named ray as well. But other practices
like qiyas, istihsan, masalih mursalah, istislah, sadd al-dhara'i\`,
fath al-dhara'i\`, madhhab al-Sahabi, Shari\`at al-salaf, \`urf, etc.
(which shall be discussed in detail) each one of them is considered an
instance of ijtihad, but is not equivalent to or synonymous with ijtihad
bi al­-ra'y. The reason for the error in equating ijtihad with ijtihad
bi al-ray is that the meaning of ijtihad has been confused with that of
one of its elements.
