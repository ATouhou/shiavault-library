Backbiting and Faultfinding
===========================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Slander acts quicker against the faith of a
Muslim believer than leprosy does against his body."

Usul al-Kafi, vol. 2, p. 257

Imam Amir-ul-Mu'mineen Mi (‘a) said: "The listener to backbiting is the
same as the backbiter."

Ghurar-ul-Hikam, p. 307

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "The abandoning of backbiting is more
valuable to Allah, Almighty and Glorious, than the performance of ten
thousand rak'at of recommended prayers."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 75, p. 261

'Abd-ul-Mu'min-il-Ansari said that once he himself arrived in the
presence of Imam Abil-Hasan Musa ibn Ja'far (‘a) where
Abdillah-il-Ja'fari had attended and Abdul-Mu'min smiled at him. Then he
(‘a) inquired whether Abdul-Mu'min liked Abdillah Al-Ja'fari when he
replied to the Imam (‘a) that he did not like him ('Abdillah) but on his
account (the seventh Imam). Then Imam (‘a) said: "He is your brother,
and a Muslim believer is the brother of another Muslim believer though
their fathers are not the same. Hence, cursed is he who accuses his
(Muslim) brother, cursed is he who deceives his (Muslim) brother, cursed
is he who does not advise his (Muslim) brother, and cursed is he who
slanders his (Muslim) brother."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 75, p. 262

Imam Amir-ul-Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) said: "The most vicious person is he
who looks for other people's defects while he overlooks his own faults."

Tara'if-ul-Hikam, p. 176

Imam Kazim (‘a) said: "Cursed is the one who backbites against one's
brother (fellow Muslim)."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 74, p. 232
