Guidelines To Rulers
====================

Reporting Imam al-Sadiq (a.s), \`Abd al-Rahman ibn Sulayman says: Amir
al-Mu’minin sent a man to the desert of Kufah to collect alms, saying:

O servant of Allah! Fear Allah and do not prefer the world to the
Hereafter. Be careful about what I have trusted you. Guard Allah’s right
until you reach such and such tribe. Place yourself in their region with
out residing near their houses. Then proceed towards them solemnly so as
to be among them. Greet them and say: O servants of Allah! The friend of
Allah has sent men to you to receive what is due to Allah from you. Is
there anything due to Allah in your property to pay to the friend of
Allah? If anyone them of answers negatively, say no more. If a rich man
answers affirmatively, go with him, without intimidating him. Do not
promise (of anything) but good to him until you reach his camels and
cattle. Do not go among them unless you are given permission, for most
of them belong to him. Say to him: O servant of Allah! Will you permit
me to go among them? If he says yes, do not go among the camels and the
cattle like a rough man who has an upper hand.

Divide them into two halves. Then let him choose the one he likes. Do
not protest him for his choice. Divide the remaining into two. Keep on
this division until what is due to Allah will remain and then collect
it. If he asks you to cancel the division, accept it. Mix them
altogether and so the same as you have done before until you collect of
the camels and cattle what is due to god. Then take for yourself an
agent who is benevolent, Muslim, sympathetic, trustworthy and a safe
keeper who does not treat them roughly. Therefore send to me immediately
whatever you collect of each of the tribes to be put in a place Allah
has commanded.

If your emissary brings them here, advise him not to hide the young
camel from its mother, nor milk it fully so as to harm the young camel,
nor tire it by riding but to ride them equally, to take them to a place
to drink water, not to push them from pasture to the plain road when
they are having rest and at times it is hard for them, to make use of
them softly so that Allah willing, they will come to us fat and fleshy,
not tired out or exhausted so that they will be divided according to the
Book of Allah and the tradition of Allah’s Messenger.

This attitude will make your reward greater and is closer to your
interest. Allah will look at them, you, your endeavor and sympathy with
the one who has sent you and the ones who need the alms.

Allah’s Messenger has said: Allah favors an agent who does his best to
obey his leader with sympathy.[^32]

**Fighting Oppression**

Imam al-Baqir has reported: One Day when Amir al-Mu’minin was returning
home, found a woman waiting. Seeing him, she came near and said, “I am
in trouble. My husband oppresses me. He has turned me out form the house
and has threatened to beat me. If I go to him, he will beat me. I
request you to do justice between us.” Amir al-Mu’minin said, “O Servant
of Allah! It is too hot now. Wait until it cools down in the afternoon.
Then I shall come with you and redress your grievances.” The woman said,
“If I stay out too long, I am afraid it may increase his anger.” For a
moment he bowed his head and then raised it up saying to himself:

By Allah, justice to the oppressed should not be delayed. The right of
the oppressed should certainly be taken from the oppressor; and every
fear should be taken out from her heart so that she may stand boldly
before the oppressor and demand her right.

The Imam further asked where her house was and she told him. He
accompanied her to her house, stood at the door and called loudly, “O
master of the house! Peace be upon you.” A young man came out. He was
her husband. He did not recognize the Imam; he found that an old man of
about sixty years had accompanied her and assumed that she had brought
him for support and mediation, but he kept silent. At this moment \`Ali
said, “This lady has a complaint against you. She says that you have
done injustice to her and turned her out of the house. Besides you have
threatened to beat her. I have come here to tell you to fear Allah and
be kind to your wife.”

The man said, “In what way does it concern you if I have not treated my
wife well? Yes, I had threatened to beat her, but now, since she has
brought you to plead for her, I shall throw her into fire and burn her
alive.”

\`Ali was disturbed by the impudence of the man. Drawing out his sword,
he said, “I am admonishing you from bad deeds but you are replying me in
such manner clearly saying to burn this woman in fire! Do you think
there is no authority in this world?” His loud voice drew the attention
of the passers by and a huge crowd gathered. Whoever came saluted him
respectfully saying, “Peace be on you Amir al-Mu’minin.” When the rude
young man realized as to whom he was talking, he trembled and
supplicated, “O Amir al-Mu’minin! Forgive me. I confess my faults and
promise that henceforth I shall obey my wife.” \`Ali turned to the woman
and told her to go to the house and cautioned her not to behave in such
a manner that her husband had to be angry again.[^33]
