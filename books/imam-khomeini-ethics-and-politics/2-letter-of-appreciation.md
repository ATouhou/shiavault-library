Letter of Appreciation
======================

   
 In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
    
    
 Dear Mr. Sayyid Hasan Islāmī,  
    
 The selection of the research work, *Imām Khomeinī*, *Ethics and
Politics* [*Imām, Akhlāq, Siyāsat*] as the cultural research work of the
year shows the inestimable value of your endeavor, and deserves
acknowledgment and appreciation.

The extensiveness of the scope and diversity of the facets of knowledge
and culture in the ancient and vast land of Iran, on one hand, and dear
Islam’s and the Islamic Republic of Iran’s patronage of research and
investigations in Islamic sciences and humanities for understanding the
problems and difficulties and proposing solutions for them with a view
to inculcating true values and promoting the authentic culture on the
other hand, has opened a wide area for undertaking diverse studies and
presenting their clear-cut achievements to this noble nation. Those who
are devoting their time and talent in this pursuit do indeed merit
profound honor and respect.     
    
 On behalf of the great nation of Iran, I do acknowledge your efforts,
and I implore God to grant you continued success.

 Sayyid Muhammad Khātamī  
*President of the Islamic Republic of Iran*
