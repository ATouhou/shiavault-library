**In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful**

The Noble Prophet (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family) has
said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ حَفِظَ عَـلـى أُمَّتِـي أَرْبَعِينَ حَدِيثًا يَـنْتَفِعُونَ بِهَا
بَعَـثَهُ اللهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَقِيهاً عَالِـماً.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“A person from my nation who memorizes forty traditions pertaining to
those issues of religion which one is in need of, will be resurrected by
Allah on the Day of Judgment as a person with deep insight into the
faith and as a scholar.”*

In following the above hadith, The World Federation of KSIMC has
embarked upon publishing a series of booklets of 40 ahadith (traditions)
on different subjects. The ahadith that have been selected from various
sources are short, simple, easy to understand and to memorize. It is
envisaged that the booklets will not only be useful for scholars,
teachers and students, but will be of benefit to the Ummah at large.

This particular collection of ahadith was compiled and translated into
English by Muhammad Reza Tajri.

The World Federation extends its appreciation to Br. Muhammad for his
efforts in the translation of this work. May Allah (Free from
imperfections and Exalted is He) accept this work as a further attempt
by The World Federation to propagate Islam.
