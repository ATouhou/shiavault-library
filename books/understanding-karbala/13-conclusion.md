Conclusion
==========

This dissertation of mine must have clearly shown that Wahabi people and
those who have similar views not only do not consider the battle of Imam
Husayn (a.s) good, most of them even consider him obligatorily deserving
of being killed due to his opposition to Yazid. They consider Yazid as a
rightful caliph. Apart from this, they do not blame the killers of
Husayn (a.s) for taking part in his murder.

Rather they base their religion on traditions narrated through them.
They praise and glorify them. Inspite of their participation in the
killing there is consensus of the Ummah on their caliphate and it is
said that ‘if such minor things are observed how can the work go on and
the narration of traditions would become impossible’.

Those who were pleased at the slaying of Husayn (a.s) are considered
trustworthy and reliable and one who took the revenge of his innocent
blood is remembered in the worst possible words. After all this, is it
still needed to be told the name of the group that considers the killers
of Imam Husayn (a.s) as their leaders? While a big group of Nasibis and
Kharijis is even today, following the decree of Imam Ghazzali, busy in
stopping the remembrance of Husayn (a.s) and mourning of Husayn (a.s) so
that they may keep the defects of their elders concealed.
