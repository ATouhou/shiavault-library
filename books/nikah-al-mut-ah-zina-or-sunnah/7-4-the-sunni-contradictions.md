4. The Sunni Contradictions
===========================

When *exactly* was *mut’ah* banned permanently? This is a question which
Sunnis will never be able to *firmly* answer till the end of the world.
This is due to the severe conflicts between their “authentic” *ahadith*
on the matter. For instance, Imam Muslim (d. 261 H) reports:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وحدثنا محمد بن عبدالله بن نمير حدثنا أبي حدثنا عبيدالله عن ابن شهاب عن
الحسن وعبدالله ابني محمد بن علي عن أبيهما عن علي أنه سمع ابن عباس يلين
في متعة النساء فقال مهلا يا ابن عباس فإن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم
نهى عنها يوم خيبر وعن لحوم الحمر الإنسية
  </p>
</blockquote>

Muhammad b. ‘Abd Allah b. Numayr – my father – ‘Ubayd Allah – Ibn Shihab
– al-Hasan and ‘Abd Allah, sons of Muhammad b. ‘Ali – their father:

‘Ali heard Ibn ‘Abbas allowing *mut’ah* with women. So, he said, “Don’t
be hasty, O Ibn ‘Abbas, for the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him,
forbade it on the Day of Khaybar as well as the flesh of domestic
asses.”[^1]

The incident, allegedly witnessed by Muhammad b. ‘Ali, apparently took
place *after* the death of the Prophet, *sallallahu ‘alaihi wa alihi*.
Of course, this eye-witness was born only after the Messenger of Allah
had passed away. Here, we see Amir al-Muminin, *‘alaihi al-salam*,
supposedly citing the ban at Khaybar to stop Ibn ‘Abbas from allowing
*mut’ah* after the Prophet had died. This suggests that the ban at
Khaybar was a permanent one. It is the only logical explanation for the
action attributed to ‘Ali. Interestingly, we often see the Ahl al-Sunnah
quote this *hadith* as well as evidence of the permanent prohibition of
*mut’ah*. The Battle of Khaybar occurred in 7 H. So, *mut’ah* supposedly
had been banned *eternally* since then.

But, Imam Muslim has another interesting report:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا إسحاق بن إبراهيم أخبرنا يحيى بن آدم حدثنا إبراهيم بن سعد عن
عبدالملك بن الربيع بن سبرة الجهني عن أبيه عن جده قال أمرنا رسول الله
صلى الله عليه و سلم بالمتعة عام الفتح حين دخلنا مكة ثم لم نخرج منها
حتى نهانا عنها
  </p>
</blockquote>

Ishaq b. Ibrahim – Yahya b. Adam – Ibrahim b. Sa’d – ‘Abd al-Malik b.
al-Rabi’ b. Sabrah al-Juhani – his father (al-Rabi’) – his grandfather
(Sabrah):

The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, **ORDERED us to perform**
***mut’ah*** **in the Year of the Conquest as we entered Makkah**. Then,
we did not come out of it until he forbade us from it.[^2]

What? But, this was in 8 H, a year after Khaybar! What happened to the
permanent ban, which ‘Ali supposedly quoted against Ibn ‘Abbas?

Meanwhile, this must be put in its proper context. Sabrah was one of the
soldiers who conquered Makkah with the Messenger of Allah, as Imam
Muslim reports:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا أبو كامل فضيل بن حسين الجحدري حدثنا بشر ( يعني ابن مفضل ) حدثنا
عمارة بن غزية عن الربيع بن سبرة أن أباه غزا مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه
و سلم فتح مكة قال فأقمنا بها خمس عشرة ( ثلاثين بين ليلة ويوم ) فأذن
لنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم في متعة النساء
  </p>
</blockquote>

Abu Kamil Fuḍayl b. Husayn al-Jahdari – Bishr b. Mufaḍḍal – ‘Amarah b.
Ghaziyyah:

Al-Rabi’ b. Sabrah reported that his father was on an expedition with
the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, during the Conquest of
Makkah. He (Sabrah) said: “So we stayed there for fifteen days
(including thirteen full days), and the Messenger of Allah, peace be
upon him, permitted us to do *mut’ah* with women.”[^3]

As such, when Sabrah “entered Makkah”, he was doing so as part of a
military force that had conquered the holy city. As the soldiers were
entering as conquerors, the Prophet commanded them to do *mut’ah*, and
they camped in there for fifteen days.

The Year of the Conquest of Makkah is also known as the Year of
al-Awṭas, and this is another relevant *riwayah* of Imam Muslim
concerning it:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا أبو بكر بن أبي شيبة حدثنا يونس بن محمد حدثنا عبدالواحد بن زياد
حدثنا أبو عميس عن إياس بن سلمة عن أبيه قال رخص رسول الله صلى الله عليه
و سلم عام أوطاس في المتعة ثلاثا ثم نهى عنها
  </p>
</blockquote>

Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaybah – Yunus b. Muhammad – ‘Abd al-Wahid b. Ziyad –
Abu ‘Umays – Iyas b. Salama – his father (Salama):

The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, **allowed** ***mut’ah***
**for three days during the Year of Awṭas**. Then, he forbade it.[^4]

The annotator, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Baqi, explains:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
( عام أوطاس ) هذا تصريح بأنها أبيحت يوم فتح مكة وهو ويوم أوطاس شيء
واحد
  </p>
</blockquote>

(Year of Awṭas) **this is an explicit statement that it was allowed on
the day of the conquest of Makkah**, which is also the same as the Day
of Awṭas.[^5]

So, *mut’ah* was supposedly made compulsory as the conquering soldiers
entered Makkah, and was banned again three days later.

Interestingly, Imam Muslim has this “*sahih*” report which overturns
everything:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وحدثنا أبو بكر بن أبي شيبة حدثنا ابن علية عن معمر عن الزهري عن الربيع
بن سبرة عن أبيه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم نهى يوم الفتح عن متعة
النساء
  </p>
</blockquote>

Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaybah – Ibn ‘Ulayyah – Ma’mar – al-Zuhri – al-Rabi’ b.
Sabrah – his father (Sabrah):

The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, **forbade** ***mut’ah*** with
women **on the Day of the Conquest**.[^6]

That same day? Not three days after it? What then are we supposed to
believe?

Meanwhile, ‘Umar supposedly considered the ban of *mut’ah* after this
three-day allowance – which alleged occurred only during the conquest of
Makkah - as *permanent*. Imam Ibn Majah (d. 273 H) tells us:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا محمد بن خلف العسقلاني. ثنا الفريابي عن أبان بن أبي حازم، عن أبي
بكر بن حفص، عن ابن عمر، قال: لما ولى عمر بن الخطاب، خطب الناس فقال: إن
رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أذن لنا في المتعة ثلاثا، ثم حرمها. والله
!لا أعلم أحدا يتمتع وهو محصن إلا رجمته بالحجارة إلا أن يأتيني بأربعة
يشهدون أن رسول الله أحلها بعد إذ حرمها.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Muhammad b. Khalaf al-‘Asqalani – al-Faryabi – **‘Aban b. Abi Hazim** –
Abu Bakr b. Hafs – Ibn ‘Umar:

When ‘Umar b. al-Khaṭṭab became the *wali*, he addressed the people and
said, “**Verily, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, permitted us
to practise** ***mut’ah*** **for three days. Then, he made it**
***haram***. I swear by Allah, if I know of any married person doing
*mut’ah*, I will stone him with stones **except if he brings to me four
people who testify that the Messenger of Allah (later) declared it**
***halal*** **after prohibiting it**.”[^7]

Shaykh al-Arnauṭ and two others say:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حديث صحيح وهذاسند حسن
  </p>
</blockquote>

A *sahih hadith*, and this chain is *hasan*.[^8]

NOTE: This *hadith* is actually *ḍa’if*. Concerning one of its
narrators, al-Hafiẓ (d. 852 H) states:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أبان بن عبد الله بن أبي حازم بن صخر بن العيلة بفتح العين المهملة
البجلي الأحمسي الكوفي صدوق في حفظه لين
  </p>
</blockquote>

Aban b. ‘Abd Allah b. Abi Hazim b. Sakhr b. al-‘Aylah al-Bajali
al-Ahmasi al-Kufi: *Saduq* (very truthful), **there is weakness in his
memory**.[^9]

Then, Imam Ibn Hibban (d. 354 H) gives more details:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أبان بن عبد الله البجلي من أهل الكوفة وهو الذي يقال له أبان بن أبي
حازم، يروى عن أبان بن تغلب وأهل الكوفة، روى عنه الثوري ووكيع والناس.
وكان ممن فحش خطؤه وانفرد بالمناكير، أخبرنا الهمداني قال سمعت عمرو بن
علي يقول: ما سمعت يحيى بن سعيد القطان يحدث عنه بشئ قط - يعنى أبان
البجلي.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Aban b. ‘Abd Allah al-Bajali, from the people of Kufa, and he was the
one called Aban b. Abi Hazim. He narrated from Aban b. Taghlib and the
people of Kufah. Al-Thawri, Waki’ and the people narrated from him. **He
was one of those whose mistakes were terrible, and who narrated**
***manakir*** **(repugnant reports) without corroboration**. Al-Hamdani
informed us, and said: I heard ‘Amr b. ‘Ali saying: “I never heard Yahya
b. Sa’id al-Qaṭṭan ever narrating anything from him” – he meant Aban
al-Bajali.[^10]

In normal circumstances, a narrator like this is not just *ḍa’if*, but
also *munkar*. So, his reports are very weak and thrown away. But, here
we are again with our Sunni *‘ulama*!

Yet, even this “backup” provided by Imam al-Bayhaqi (d. 458 H) does no
good either:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وقد حدثنا أبو محمد عبد الله بن يوسف الأصبهاني أنبأ أبو محمد عبد الرحمن
بن يحيى الزهري القاضي بمكة ثنا محمد بن إسماعيل الصائغ ثنا أبو خالد
الأموي ثنا منصور بن دينار ثنا عمر بن محمد عن سالم بن عبد الله عن أبيه
عن عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه قال صعد عمر على المنبر فحمد الله وأثنى
عليه ثم قال ما بال رجال ينكحون هذه المتعة وقد نهى رسول الله صلى الله
عليه و سلم عنها ألا وإني لا أوتي بأحد نكحها إلا رجمته
  </p>
</blockquote>

Abu Muhammad ‘Abd Allah b. Yusuf al-Asbahani – Abu Muhammad ‘Abd
al-Rahman b. Yahya al-Zuhri al-Qaḍi – Muhammad b. Isma’il al-Saigh – Abu
Khalid al-Umawi – **Mansur b. Dinar** – ‘Umar b. Muhammad – Salim b.
‘Abd Allah – his father – ‘Umar b. al-Khaṭṭab, may Allah be pleased with
him:

‘Umar climbed the pulpit, and thanked Allah and extolled Him. Then, he
said, “What is the problem of men who are contracting the *nikah* of
this *mut’ah* despite that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him,
had forbidden it? Take note: if anyone who has contracted its *nikah* is
brought to me, I will stone him.”[^11]

Al-Bayhaqi himself expresses doubt about the authenticity of this
*riwayah* immediately after quoting it:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فهذا إن صح يبين أن عمر رضي الله عنه إنما نهى عن نكاح المتعة لأنه علم
نهي النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم عنه
  </p>
</blockquote>

So, this one, **IF AUTHENTIC**, shows that ‘Umar, may Allah be pleased
with him, only forbade the *nikah* of *mut’ah* because he knew of its
prohibition by the Prophet, peace be upon him.[^12]

This was perhaps due to the presence of Mansur b. Dinar in the *sanad*.
Al-Hafiẓ documents about him:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
منصور بن دينار السهمي :عن الزهري قال النسائي ليس بالقوى وقال البخاري
روى عن نافع وحماد في حديثه نظر \* وقال يحيى بن معين ضعيف قلت … وذكره
العقيلي في الضعفاء … وذكره ابن حبان في الثقات … وقال أبو زرعة صالح
وقال أبو حاتم ليس به بأس وقال العجلي لا بأس به
  </p>
</blockquote>

Mansur b. Dinar al-Sahmi: he narrated from al-Zuhri. **Al-Nasai said:
“He is not strong.” Al-Bukhari said, “He narrated from Nafi’ and Hammad.
THERE IS PROBLEM WITH HIS** ***HADITH*****.” Yahya b. Ma’in said:
“*****Ḍa’if*****.” I say: ... And al-‘Aqili has mentioned him in**
***al-Ḍu’afa*** ... and Ibn Hibban mentioned him in *al-Thiqat* ... Abd
Abu Zur’a said: “Salih” while Abu Hatim said, “There is no problem with
him.” Al-‘Ijli also said, “There is no problem with him.”[^13]

We have capitalized, in particular, the statement of Imam al-Bukhari (d.
256 H), because it is a *jarh mufassar*. Imam al-Dhahabi (d. 748 H) has
narrated that al-Bukhari himself said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إذا قلت فلان في حديثه نظر، فهو متهم واه.
  </p>
</blockquote>

When I say “there is problem with the *hadith* of so-and-so”, **then he
is accused (of fabricating** ***ahadith*****), weak**.[^14]

This changes everything, since a *jarh mufassar* supercedes any praise
for the narrator. That then makes this second report *mawḍu’* or at
least *ḍa’if jiddan*.

Meanwhile, having exposed the weakness of both *riwayahs* above, we will
nonetheless proceed to take them into consideration within our
discourses, in order to leave our opponents with no excuse anywhere.

So, simply put, the second permanent ban of *mut’ah* occurred a year
after the first one. ‘Umar here challenged everyone to bring forward any
evidence that the Prophet ever allowed it after this second ban – and
none, it seems, ever came forward. But, what was he even suggesting? Has
the Qur’an not banned *zina* several years before Khaybar and the
conquest of Makkah? Was ‘Umar implying that the Prophet could have
permitted fornication after the ban by Allah?

Yet, there is a further report of a third *permanent* ban on *mut’ah*
two years after the conquest of Makkah! This is the *hadith* by Imam
al-Darimi (d. 255 H):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أخبرنا جعفر بن عون عن عبد العزيز بن عمر بن عبد العزيز عن الربيع بن
سبرة ان أباه حدثه أنهم ساروا مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم في حجة
الوداع فقال استمتعوا من هذه النساء ... ثم غدوت فإذا رسول الله صلى الله
عليه و سلم قائم بين الركن والباب فقال يا أيها الناس اني قد كنت أذنت
لكم في الاستمتاع من النساء الا وان الله قد حرم ذلك إلى يوم القيامة فمن
كان عنده منهن شيء فليخل سبيلها ولا تأخذوا مما آتيتموهن شيئا
  </p>
</blockquote>

Ja’far b. ‘Awn – ‘Abd al-‘Aziz b. ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Aziz – al-Rabi’ b.
Sabrah – his father:

We journeyed with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, **during
the Farewell** ***Hajj*** **and he said, “Do** ***mut’ah*** **with these
women”**.... Then, in the morning, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon
him, stood between *al-Rukn* and the door and said, “O mankind! Verily,
I have been allowing you to do *mut’ah* with women. **But, surely, Allah
has made that** ***haram*** **till the Day of** ***al-Qiyamah***. So,
whoever has something of them with him, let him free her, and do not
take back anything from what you gave them (as dowries).”[^15]

Shaykh Asad comments:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إسناده صحيح
  </p>
</blockquote>

Its chain is *sahih*[^16]

Imam Ibn Hibban (d. 354 H) has documented it too[^17], and al-Albani (d.
1420 H) says about it:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
صحيح
  </p>
</blockquote>

*Sahih*[^18]

And al-Arnauṭ agrees:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إسناده صحيح
  </p>
</blockquote>

Its chain is *sahih*[^19]

Here, we are back again at the beginning! Our Sunni brothers consider
*mut’ah* to be a form of fornication, and also declare that the *mut’ah*
wife is no “wife”. Rather, she is a fornicator. *Alhamdulillah*,
fornication was made *haram* during the Makkan era, before our Prophet
migrated to Madinah. Therefore, by Sunni logic, *mut’ah* was already
banned before the *Hijrah*. But, their books tell us that the following
occurred after the *Hijrah*:

1. The Messenger re-ban *mut’ah* permanently at Khaybar seven years
after the *Hijrah*. This makes sense since he was only repeating the
Qur’anic ban on fornication and adultery.

2. However, the same Prophet “ordered” his Sahabah to indulge in
*mut’ah* – read: to indulge in fornication – during his conquest of
Makkah in 8 H!

3. Moreover, after three days – or on that same day – he banned *mut’ah*
again *permanently*.

4. Then, during his Farewell *Hajj* in 10 H, he ordered his Sahabah once
more, saying: “Do *mut’ah* with these women”. By Sunni logic, he was
only saying: “Do fornication with these women”! Thereafter, he banned it
*permanently* again, for the last time!

If this is not mockery of Allah and His Messenger by the Ahl al-Sunnah
wa al-Jama’ah, what then is it? Al-Hafiẓ Ibn Kathir (d. 774 H),
meanwhile, thinks he has an explanation:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فقد نص الشافعي على أنه لا يعلم شيئا أبيح ثم حرم ثم أبيح ثم حرم غير
نكاح المتعة وما حداه على هذا رحمه الله إلا اعتماده على هذين الحديثين
كما قدمناه .وقد حكى السهيلي وغيره عن بعضهم: أنه ادعى أنها أبيحت ثلاث
مرات وحرمت ثلاث مرات وقال آخرون أربع مرات وهذا بعيد جدا والله أعلم.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
واختلفوا أي وقت أول ما حرمت فقيل في خيبر وقيل في عمرة القضاء وقيل في
عام الفتح وهذا يظهر وقيل في أوطاس وهو قريب من الذي قبله وقيل في تبوك
وقيل في حجة الوداع.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**Al-Shafi’i had explicitly stated that he did not know of anything that
was made** ***halal*****, then made** ***haram*****, then made**
***halal*** **and then made** ***haram*** **other than the marriage of**
***mut’ah***. Nothing drew him, may Allah be merciful to him, to this
conclusion except his reliance upon these two *hadiths*, as we
previously discussed. Al-Suhayli and others have also narrated from one
of them that he claimed that **it (*****mut’ah*****) was made**
***halal*** **three times and was made** ***haram*** **three times. The
others said: four times**. But, this is very unlikely, and Allah knows
best.

**They disagree on the exact time when it was FIRST made** ***haram***.
It is said that it was at **Khaybar**, and it is said that it was at the
***‘Umrah al-Qaḍa***. It is said that it was during **the Year of the
Conquest**, and this is the most likely; and it is said that it was at
**Awṭas**, and this is nearer to the one before it. It is said that it
was at **Tabuk**, and it is said that it was at **the Farewell**
***Hajj***.[^20]

But, this only worsens things for the Ahl al-Sunnah. On the specific
question of *zina* (fornication and adultery), this is also what this
Makkan *ayah* says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ولا تقربوا الزنا إنه كان فاحشة وساء سبيلا
  </p>
</blockquote>

**And do not approach** ***zina***. Verily, it is an indecency, and an
evil way.[^21]

This verse – by the *ijma’* of the whole *Ummah* – has never *been*
abrogated. It has been in force since *before* the *Hijrah*; and it
continued unimpeded till the death of the Messenger. In other words,
during all those times that the Prophet and his Sahabah were practising
*mut’ah*, this *ayah* was well in authority. It is thus either of two
things (i) *mut’ah* is a form of *zina* too or (ii) *mut’ah* is NOT a
form of *zina*. The Sunnis maintain that temporary is fornication. So,
what they are saying – in essence – is that Prophet Muhammad was
contradicting his Lord *repeatedly*, by “allowing” or “commanding” and
even “practising” what his Lord had long declared *haram*! Apparently,
if they joined the Shi’ah in saying that *mut’ah* is NOT a form of
*zina*, then some of their unintentional mockeries of Allah and His
Messenger would disappear.

But, even then, they would have to show us which verse of the Qur’an
abrogated *mut’ah*? Of course, this *ayah* must be proved to have been
revealed *after* the Verse of *al-Mut’ah* and *Surah al-Maidah*, and it
must be explicit in its ruling against temporary marriage. We say
categorically here: no such verse exists. Meanwhile, since only an
*ayah* can abrogate an *ayah* (as the Qur’an itself declares), then the
Verse of *al-Mut’ah* remains in force till this day, and till the end of
days.

This automatically leads us to another conclusion: all the reports about
how *mut’ah* was banned *permanently* – only to be unbanned sometime
later - are careless fabrications. They were “rushed up” to justify
‘Umar’s ban of that legitimate form of *nikah*. No wonder, they contain
so many serious contradictions among themselves, even in reports by the
same individuals, and all of them altogether also oppose the Qur’an!

Unsurprisingly, all these alleged repeated bans of *mut’ah* were
completely unknown to the generality of the Sahabah, as Imam Muslim
reports:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثني محمد بن رافع حدثنا عبدالرزاق أخبرنا ابن جريج أخبرني أبو الزبير
قال سمعت جابر بن عبدالله يقول كنا نستمتع بالقبضة من التمر والدقيق
الأيام على عهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم وأبي بكر حتى نهى عنه عمر
في شأن عمرو بن حريث
  </p>
</blockquote>

Muhammad b. Rafi’ – ‘Abd al-Razzaq – Ibn Jurayj – Abu al-Zubayr:

I heard Jabir b. ‘Abd Allah saying, “**We** ***used to*** **contract**
***mut’ah*** by giving a handful of dates and flour (as the dowry)
during the eras of the Messenger of Allah and Abu Bakr **UNTIL ‘Umar
forbade it** in the case of ‘Amr b. Hurayth.[^22]

They continued to practise *mut’ah* till the death of the Prophet, and
he did not warn, stop or penalize them. Abu Bakr too allowed them to
freely go ahead with it throughout his rule. There is a usual Sunni
excuse that the information concerning the ban on *mut’ah* did not reach
these Sahabah, and that they continued it due to that! But, does that
make any sense? The ban on *mut’ah* was supposedly announced at least
*three* times in public; and yet, the generality of the *Sahabah* –
including even Abu Bakr - never heard it?! Moreover, did the Sahabah not
know of any of the *ayahs* in the Qur’an which make fornication and
adultery *haram*? If they did, why did they continue to perform *mut’ah*
(considering the Sunni claim that it is fornication), and why did the
Messenger and Abu Bakr allow them?

Even more interesting is the dogged refusal of Ibn ‘Abbas, *raḍiyallahu
‘anhu*, to back down on *mut’ah* till his death. The Ahl al-Sunnah say
that Imam ‘Ali allegedly informed him that *mut’ah* had been banned at
Khaybar:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وحدثنا محمد بن عبدالله بن نمير حدثنا أبي حدثنا عبيدالله عن ابن شهاب عن
الحسن وعبدالله ابني محمد بن علي عن أبيهما عن علي أنه سمع ابن عباس يلين
في متعة النساء فقال مهلا يا ابن عباس فإن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم
نهى عنها يوم خيبر وعن لحوم الحمر الإنسية
  </p>
</blockquote>

Muhammad b. ‘Abd Allah b. Numayr – my father – ‘Ubayd Allah – Ibn Shihab
– al-Hasan and ‘Abd Allah, sons of Muhammad b. ‘Ali – their father:

**‘Ali heard Ibn ‘Abbas allowing** ***mut’ah*** **with women**. So, he
said, “Don’t be hasty, **O Ibn ‘Abbas, for the Messenger of Allah, peace
be upon him, forbade it on the Day of Khaybar** as well as the flesh of
domestic asses.”[^23]

Yet, long *after* ‘Ali’s death, he was still defending *mut’ah*. Imam
Muslim again:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وحدثني حرملة بن يحيى أخبرنا ابن وهب أخبرني يونس قال ابن شهاب أخبرني
عروة بن الزبير أن عبدالله ابن الزبير قام بمكة فقال إن ناسا أعمى الله
قلوبهم كما أعمى أبصارهم يفتون بالمتعة يعرض برجل فناداه فقال إنك لجلف
جاف فلعمري لقد كانت المتعة تفعل على عهد إمام المتقين ( يريد رسول الله
صلى الله عليه و سلم ) فقال له ابن الزبير فجرب بنفسك فوالله لئن فعلتها
لأرجمنك بأحجارك
  </p>
</blockquote>

Harmalah b. Yahya – Ibn Wahb – Yunus – Ibn Shihab – ‘Urwah b. al-Zubayr:

‘Abd Allah b. al-Zubayr stood in Makkah and said, “**Allah has made
blind the hearts of some people as He made blind their eyesight. They
give** ***fatwas*** **allowing** ***mut’ah***.” He was referring to a
certain man. So, he (the man) called him and said, “**You are an uncouth
person, devoid of sense!** I swear by my life, *mut’ah* was practised
during the time of the Imam of the pious” - he meant the Messenger of
Allah. So, Ibn al-Zubayr said to him, “Just do it yourself. By Allah, if
you do it, I will stone you with your stones.”[^24]

We know the identity of that man in this further *hadith* of Imam
Muslim:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
حدثنا حامد بن عمرو البكراوي حدثنا عبدالواحد ( يعني ابن زياد ) عن عاصم
عن أبي نضرة قال كنت عند جابر بن عبدالله فأتاه آت فقال ابن عباس وابن
الزبير اختلفا في المتعتين فقال جابر فعلناهما مع رسول الله صلى الله
عليه و سلم ثم نهانا عنهما عمر فلم نعد لهما
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hamid b. ‘Amr al-Bakrawi – ‘Abd al-Wahid b. Ziyad – ‘Asim – Abu Naḍrah:

I was with Jabir b. ‘Abd Allah, a person came and said, “**Ibn ‘Abbas
and Ibn al-Zubayr disagree concerning the two types of** ***mut’ah***.”
So, Jabir said, “We practised both of them along with the Messenger of
Allah, peace be upon him. Then, ‘Umar forbade us from them both, and we
have not reverted to them.”[^25]

It was Ibn ‘Abbas, and he had become blind at that time – apparently
during the rebel “caliphate” of Ibn al-Zubayr in Makkah. That was
towards the very end of the lifetime of Ibn ‘Abbas. Commenting on these
reports and others, ‘Allamah al-Albani concludes:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وجملة القول: أن ابن عباس رضى الله عنه روى عنه فى المتعة ثلاثة أقوال:
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الأول: الإباحة مطلقا.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الثانى: الإباحة عند الضرورة.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
والآخر: التحريم مطلقا , وهذا مما لم يثبت عنه صراحة , بخلاف القولين
الأولين , فهما ثابتان عنه.
  </p>
</blockquote>

The summary is: three opinions are narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allaah
be pleased with him, about *mut’ah*:

The one: he permitted it unconditionally.

The second: he permitted it in cases of necessity.

The last: he forbade it unconditionally, **but this is from what is NOT
authentically transmitted from him**, unlike the first two opinions
which are authentically transmitted from him.[^26]

So, basically, there is solid evidence that Ibn ‘Abbas continued to
defend *mut’ah* even in his old age, and there is none that he ever
retracted his statements on it. Meanwhile, Sunnis generally excuse the
pro-*mut’ah* positions of the generality of the Sahabah after the
Prophet on an desperate argument that the information of its abrogation
had not reached them. But, will they say the same about Ibn ‘Abbas? In
that case, was he really a stubborn heretic who dared to openly and
knowingly oppose Allah and His Messenger? Was that his character? Well,
with the persistent Sunni claim that Imam ‘Ali informed him about the
ban of *mut’ah*, we are afraid, there is no other possible conclusion
other than that Ibn ‘Abbas was from the *Ahl al-Bid’ah*.

Interestingly, when he defended *mut’ah* by stating that it was
practised during the time of the Messenger, Ibn al-Zubayr – also a
Sahabi – became *silenced*. Ibn al-Zubayr did not mention anything about
its alleged “abrogation” or “ban” as a counter-argument, which is
extremely baffling. No doubt, if he had known of any rejection of
*mut’ah* by the noble Prophet, he would have instantly corrected Ibn
‘Abbas on his submission, and would have saved his face. The fact that
Ibn al-Zubayr was unable to bring down Ibn ‘Abbas’s suggestion that
*mut’ah* was accepted throughout the Messenger’s lifetime raises a lot
of question marks about all Sunni *ahadith* against it.

This hot exchange between the two took place long after the death of
‘Umar and ‘Ali. Yet, neither Ibn ‘Abbas nor (especially) Ibn al-Zubayr
seem to be aware of any claim that *mut’ah* had been banned by the
Prophet of Allah! This tells us that all these anti-*mut’ah* reports
were most probably manufactured only after the period of the
confrontation between those two Sunni heavyweights.
