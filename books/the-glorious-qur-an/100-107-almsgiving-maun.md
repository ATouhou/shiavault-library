107: Almsgiving (maun)
======================

The first three of these 7 verses are early Meccan, while the rest date
from Madina.

The chapter was revealed after Competition 102 and before Disbelievers
(or Atheists) 109. It explains that one should be ready to offer charity
(for which recommendation see also 9:(XIII) Â & 58:(II))
