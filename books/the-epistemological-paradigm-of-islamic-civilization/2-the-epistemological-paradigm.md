The Epistemological Paradigm
============================

Islamic civilization can be represented in a concentric model—with many
circles orbiting around one common center (see the Epistemological
Paradigm that follows the Introduction)(5) .  This model has two
important characteristics: (1) The circles are not only concentric, but
each circle beyond the center may also be regarded as orbiting around
the center, in the manner of a solar system. The core belief (aqīda) is
the center. (2) If we consider the radiuses as representing the pull or
force of gravity toward the central belief (aqīda), then the pull of
gravity will be inversely proportional to the length of the radius; the
shorter the radius the greater the pull of gravity and the longer the
radius, the less the pull of gravity.
