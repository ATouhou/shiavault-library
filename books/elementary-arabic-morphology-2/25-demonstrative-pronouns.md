======================

193. A demonstrative pronoun is a noun that indicates a specific person,
animal, or thing. For example: **هَذا** **الولد** (this child).

194. There are three kinds of demonstrative pronouns: for close objects,
for objects in between close and far, for far objects.

195. The demonstrative pronouns are:

• For things that are close:

    1. **هذا** (this, m.)

    2. **هذانِ** (these two, m.)

    3. **هَوُلاء** (these, m.)

    4. **هذهِ** (this, f.)

    5. **هَاتانِ** (these two, f.)

    6. **هَوُلاء** (these, f.)

• For things that are medium range:

    1. **ذاکَ** (that, m.)

    2. **ذانِکَ** (those two, m.)

    3. **ﺃولئکَ** (those, m.)

    4. **تیکَ** (that, f.)

    5. **تانِکَ** (those two, f.)

    6. **ﺃولِوکَ**(those, f.)

• For things that are far:

    1. **ذلِکَ** (that, m.)

    2. **ذانّکَ** (those two, m.)

    3. **ﺃولالِکَ** (those, m.)

    4. **تِلکَ** (that, f.)

    5. **تانّکَ** (those two, f.)

    6. **ﺃولالِکَ** (those, f.)

• For places:

    1. **هُنا**(here)

    2. **هُناکَ**(there, medium range)

    3. **هُنالِک** **تَمّ**(there, far)

196. The *ha* that is in the front of demonstrative pronouns for close
objects is called the demonstrative *ha* and sometimes is erased.

197. All of the demonstrative pronouns are indeclinable. The dual forms
are made indeclinable on an *alif* if it is in the nominative case, for
example **هذانِ**, and on a *yā'* if it is in the accusative or genitive
cases, for example **هذَینِ**.
