Malediction upon specific companions in the Qur’an
==================================================

Just as was previously explained, the Noble Qur’an has itself imprecated
against someone groups of individuals who possessed certain negative
traits, and by applying the general imprecations mentioned in these
verses into specific historical examples, we see that the words of the
Qur’an fit some of the companions of the Prophet (S); however in other
instances, there are clear verses of specific companions who have been
imprecated against.

One such verse of the Qur’an is the following:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ إِذْ قُلْنَا لَكَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ أَحَاطَ بِالنَّاسِ وَ مَا
جَعَلْنَا الرُّؤْيَا الَّتِي أَرَيْنَاكَ إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً لِلنَّاسِ وَ
الشَّجَرَةَ الْمَلْعُونَةَ فِي الْقُرْآنِ وَ نُخَوِّفُهُمْ فَمَا
يَزِيدُهُمْ إِلاَّ طُغْيَاناً كَبِيراً
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“When We said to you, ‘Indeed your Lord comprehends all humanity,’ We
did not appoint the vision that We showed you except as a test for the
people and the*** ***tree cursed*** ***in the Qurʾan. We deter them, but
it only increases them in great rebellion.”***[^1]

In relation to the exegesis of this verse, the commentators of the Noble
Qur’an have stated that the meaning of the “cursed tree” is the family
tree and lineage of Hakam Ibn Abil ʿAs; and the meaning of the ‘vision’
which was seen is the dream which the Noble Prophet (S) saw in which the
children of Marwan b. Hakam were one by one, ascending his pulpit
*(mimbar)*.[^2]
