Allah - The Unique
==================

The Holy Prophet Muhammad (s) advised the people of Mecca to stop
worshipping idols and instead worship One Allah. One day someone asked
him, “Explain to us Allah you worship”.

Then Allah revealed the following Surah 'al-Tawhid' to the Holy Prophet
so that he could recite it to the people:

Bismilla hir Rahmanir Rahim

Qul huwal lahu Ahad

Allahus Samado

Lam yalid walam yulad

Walam Yakul lahu kufuwan Ahad.

The following is the meaning of the above surah:

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.

Say: Allah is One.

He needs nothing.

Neither has He given birth to anyone;

Nor is He born of anyone.

And He has no equal.

'Tawheed' means that Allah is One, Alone, and there is none like Him.

During our prayers we must recite two surahs from the Holy Qur'an, one
of which is Surah 'al-Hamd' and the other is Surah 'al-Tawheed'. We
should therefore, learn these surahs by heart.

Belief in the Oneness of Allah is the basis of Islam.
