O son of the Messenger of Allah

*Ibnu Rasulillah* is a patronym[^1]. Imam al-Husayn (AS) in this verse
is introduced as the son of the Holy Prophet (S). There has been a
controversy in the past about this bond and relationship. The enemies of
the Ahl al-Bayt (AS) throughout history would try to denounce it and
declare that the Imams of the Ahl al-Bayt (AS) are not from the progeny
of the Holy Prophet (S) but rather only from the progeny of Amir
al-Mu’minin ‘Ali (AS). The Ahl al-Bayt (AS), however, would cogently
prove to them the veracity of their relationship with the Holy Prophet
(S). In fact the most cogent of all proofs is the well-known verse of
*mubahala* (imprecation), where Almighty Allah says to His Apostle (S):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَمَنْ حَاجَّكَ فيهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ ما جاءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ فَقُلْ
تَعالَوْا نَدْعُ أَبْناءَنا وَأَبْناءَكُمْ وَنِساءَنا وَنِساءَكُمْ
وَأَنْفُسَنا وَأَنْفُسَكُمْ ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ فَنَجْعَلْ لَعْنَتَ
اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكاذِبينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Should anyone argue with you concerning him, after the knowledge that
has come to you, say, “Come! Let us call our sons and your sons, our
women and your women, our souls and your souls, then let us pray
earnestly and call down Allah’s curse upon the liars.” (3:61)

This verse speaks of the Holy Prophet (S)’s confrontation with the
Christians of Najran in the well-known incident of *mubahala*
(imprecation), when just beholding the brilliant faces of the *Ahl
al-Kisa* (AS) overwhelmend the Christians and made their bishop say:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنِّيْ لأَرَى وُجُوْهًا لَوْ سَأَلُوا اللّهَ أَنْ يُزِيْلَ جَبَلاً
مِنْ مَكَانِهِ لاَزَالَهُ بِهَا فَلاَ تُبَاهِلُوْا فَتُهْلِكُوْا وَلاَ
يَبْقَى عَلىَ وَجْهِ الأَرْضِ نَصْرَانِيٌّ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Indeed I am seeing faces, who if ask Allah to uproot a mountain from its
place, He would surely do so. Therefore do not imprecate, for if you do
so you will perish, and there would remain no Christian on the face of
the earth until the Judgment Day.[^2]

In the aforementioned verse we clearly find the phrase “*Let us call our
sons (abna’ana) and your sons (abna’akum)...”*. Muslim historians have
unanimously narrated that the Holy Prophet (S) had brought Imam al-Hasan
(AS) and Imam al-Husayn (AS) as his sons for this event[^3].

Hadhrat Fatima al-Zahra’ (AS) narrates from the Holy Prophet (S) that:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كُلُّ بَنِي أُمٍّ يَنْتَمُونَ إِلَى عَصَبَتِهِمْ إِلاَّ وُلْدَ
فَاطمَةَ فَإِنِّي أَنَا أَبُوهُمْ وَعَصَبَتُهُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

The son of every mother is [solely] attributed to his paternal
relations, save the sons of Fatima, for surely I am their father and
paternal relation.[^4]

This tradition, which is found with slight variations in so many works
of traditions, is vocal enough to specify the exceptional relationship
between the Holy Prophet (S) and the sons of Hadhrat Fatima (AS).

Throughout the dark pages of history, however, the illegitimate rulers
of the Muslim world, due to their jealousy and hatred, always debated
this relationship but did not suceed. Following are some examples worthy
of consideration:

1. Al-Arbili in his *Kashf al-Ghumma* narrates:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
عَنْ ذَكْوَان مَوْلَى مُعَاوِيَة قال قَالَ مُعَاوِيَة: لاَ أَعْلَمَنَّ
أَحَداً سَمَّى هَذَيْنِ الْغُلاَمَيْنِ إِبْنَيْ رَسُوْلِ اللهِ.
وَلكِنْ قُوْلُوا: اِبْنَيْ عَلِيِّ. قَالَ ذَكْوَان: فَلَمَّا كَانَ
بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ، أَمَرَنِيْ أَنْ أَكْتُبَ بَنِيْهِ فِي الشَّرَفِ. قَالَ:
فَكَتَبْتُ بَنِيْهِ وَبَنِي بَنِيْهِ، وَتَرَكْتُ بَنِيْ بَنَاتِهِ..
ثُمَّ أَتَيْتُهُ بِالْكِتَابِ، فَنَظَرَ فِيْهِ، فَقَالَ: وَيْحَك،
لَقَدْ أَغْفَلْتَ كُبر بَنِيّ! فَقُلْتُ: مَنْ؟ فَقَالَ: أَما بَنُوْ
فُلاَنَة ـ لاِبْنَتِهِ ـ بَنيَّ؟ أَمَا بَنُوْ فُلاَنَة ـ لاِبْنَتِهِ ـ
بَنِيّ؟.قَالَ: قُلْتُ: اَلله!! أَيَكُوْنُ بَنُوْ بَنَاتِكَ بَنِيْكَ،
وَلاَ يَكُوْنُ بَنُوْ فَاطمَة بَنِي رَسُوْلِ اللهِ ؟! قَالَ: مَا لَكَ؟
قَاتَلَكَ اللهُ ! لاَ يَسْمَعَنَّ هَذاَ أَحَدٌ مِنْكَ ؟!
  </p>
</blockquote>

Dhakwan, a slave of Mu’awiya, reports: Mu’awiya [once] said [to me]:
Surely I do not know anyone call these two boys (Imam al-Hasan and Imam
al-Husayn (AS)) the two sons of the Messenger of Allah (S). Therefore
say: “They are the sons of ‘Ali (AS)”. Later, Mu’awiya ordered me to
write down the names of his sons in sequence of nobility. I wrote the
names of his sons and the names of the sons of his sons, but did not
write the names of the sons of his daughters.

Then I came to him with the written script. He looked at it, and
retorted: Woe be unto you! You have forgotten the elders from among my
children! I said: Who are they? He said: Aren’t the sons of that
daughter [of mine] my sons? Aren’t the sons of such and such daughter of
mine my sons? Dhakwan said: I remarked [in amazement]: God!! Are the
sons of your daughters your sons, whereas the sons of Fatima (AS) not
the sons of the Messenger of Allah (S)? He said: What is the matter with
you? May Allah kill you! No one should hear this from you![^5]

2. Fakhr al-Din al-Razi in his *Tafsir Mafatih al-Ghayb* narrates the
following from Shu’bi:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كُنْتُ عِنْدَ الْحَجَّاجِ، فَأُتِيَ بِيَحْيَى بْن يَعْمَر، فَقِيْهُ

I was with Hajjaj [bin Yusuf al-Thaqafi] and Yahya bin Ya’mar, the
jurisprudent of Khurasan, was brought from Balkh shackled with iron.
Hajjaj said to him: You think that Hasan and Husayn are from the progeny
of the Holy Prophet (S)? He said: Of course yes. Thereupon Hajjaj said:
You must bring me a clear exposition for that from the Book of Allah or
I surely will cut your body into parts. He said: I will bring for you a
clear exposition from the Book of Allah, O Hajjaj. Shu’bi says: I was
surprised at his audacity in responding with the [concluding] words, “O
Hajjaj!” Thereupon Hajjaj said to him: But do not bring for me the verse
**“*****let us call our sons...*****” (3:61)**

He said: I will bring you a clear exposition from the Book of Allah, and
that is Allah’s speech

***“...And Noah We had guided before, and from his offspring, David and
Solomon up to the phrase [in the next verse] “...and Zechariah, John,
Jesus...(84-85)***

Who then was the father of Jesus, while he is attached to the progeny of
Noah? Shu’bi says: Thereupon Hajjaj lowered his head for some time, and
then raised it and said: It is as if I have not read this verse from the
Book of Allah. Release him![^6]

3. Thiqat al-Islam Muhammad bin Ya’qub al-Kulayni narrates in his
Al-Kafi:

It is narrated from Abu al-Jarud: Abu Ja’far [al-Baqir (AS)] said to me:
O Aba al-Jarud, what do they say about al-Hasan A and al-Husayn (AS)? I
said: They are against our belief that they are the two sons of the Holy
Prophet (S). He (AS) said: Then with what [proof] did you argue with
them? I said: With the word of Allah about ‘Isa bin Maryam

***“...And from his [Noah’s] offspring, David and Solomon, Job, Joseph,
Moses and Aaron thus*** ***do We reward the virtuous; and Zechariah,
John, ‘Isa...”*** **(6:84-85)**

Therefore He placed *‘Isa* in the progeny of Noah (AS). Imam (AS) said:
So what did they say to you? I said: They said: It is possible for a son
of a female to be a son, but he would not be from the loin. He (AS)
said: So with what [other proof] did you argue against them? I said: We
argued against them with the word of Allah**,*****”...Come! Let us call
our sons and your sons...”*** **(3:61)** He (AS) said: And what did they
say to you? I said: They said that sometimes in Arabic rhetoric a person
may call the sons of another man as “our sons”.

Thereupon Abu Ja’far (AS) said: O Aba al-Jarud indeed I will give you a
verse from the Book of Allah, the Sublime and Exalted [proving] that
they (Imam al-Hasan and Imam al-Husayn (AS)) are from the loin of the
Holy Prophet (S), and none save the disbeliever would negate it. I said:
And where is it, may I be made your ranson? He (AS) said: From where
Allah, the Exalted, says

**“*****Forbidden to you are your mothers, your daughters and your
sisters, your paternal aunts and your maternal aunts, your brother’s
daughters and your sister’s daughters, your] foster- who have suckled
you and your sisters through fosterage, your wives” mothers, and your
stepdaughters who are under your care] born [of the wives whom you have
gone into but if you have not gone into them there is no sin upon you
and the wives of your sons who are from your own loins..”*** **(4:23)**

Ask them, O Aba al-Jarud, was it permitted for the Messenger of Allah
(S) to marry with the wives of al-Hasan and al-Husayn (AS)? If they say
‘yes’, then surely they have lied and voilated the bounds. And if they
say “no”, then they [surely] are his two sons from his loin.[^7]

We wish to suffice with the aforesaid incidents. Otherwise there are so
many other traditions where this relationship is clearly and explicitly
mentioned.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ياَ بْنَ رَسُوْلِ اللهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**O product of the Messenger of Allah**

The word اِبْن *‘ibn’* etymologically means ‘*the edifice of*’ or the
‘*product of*’. Al-Isfahani in his *al-Mufradat* says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
انّ الإبن سُمّي اِبْنًا لِكَوْنِهِ بِنَاءً لِلاَبِ، فَإِنَّ الاَبَ
هُوَ الَّذيْ بَنَّاهُ وَجَعَلَهُ اللهُ بنّاءً فِيْ اِيْجَادِهِ،
وَيُقَالُ لِكُلّ مَا يَحْصُلُ مِنْ جِهة شيء اَوْمِنْ تَرْبِيَتِهِ اَوْ
بِتَفَقُّدِهِ اَوْ كَثْرَةِ خِدْمَتِهِ لَهُ اَوْ قِيَامِهِ بِاَمْرِهِ:
هُوَ اِبْنُهُ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

Surely الاِبْن*al-ibn* was known to be so because it is a building
(*bina’*) of the father, for it is the father who built him and Allah
made him to be the builder in his existence; and *ibn* is known to be
anything that is attained because of another thing or training or
guardianship or a lot of service or doing something on one’s
behalf...[^8]

Therefore it is right to say that Imam al-Husayn (AS) is the product or
fruit of the Holy Prophet (S) in terms of spiritual upbringing. It is in
the environment of the Holy Prophet (S) that Imam al-Husayn (AS) grew
and learnt so many important things. In some traditions the Holy Prophet
(S) also addresses Imam al-Husayn (AS) as *thamarata fu’adi* (the fruit
of my heart). For example, once ‘A’isha seeing the cordial encounter of
the Prophet (S) with al-Husayn (AS) who was then a small baby on the
laps of the Prophet (S), asked him:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا رَسُوْلَ اللهِ مَا اَشَدّ اِعْجَابِكَ بِهَذاَ الصَّبِيّ
  </p>
</blockquote>

O Apostle of Allah, how attached are you to this child!

And the Prophet (S) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَيْلَكِ وَكَيْفَ لاَ اُحِبُّهُ وَلاَ اَعْجَبُ بِهِ، وَهُوَ ثَمَرَةُ
فُؤَادِيْ وَقُرَّةُ عَيْنِيْ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

Woe be to you, and how should I not love him and not get attracted to
him, while ***he is the fruit of my heart*** and the apple of my
eyes?[^9]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ياَ بْنَ رَسُوْلِ اللهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**O product of the Messenger of Allah**

The genitive construction ‘*Rasulullah*’ alludes to a particular
identity of the Holy Prophet (S) which is his apostleship (*al-risala*).
Therefore *Ibnu Rasulillah* would mean the product of the Messenger of
Allah. Specifying this patronym alludes to the reality that Imam
al-Husayn (AS) was built to exemplify the attributes that a Divine
Messenger must have. Obviously this does not mean that he (AS) was a
Divinely proclaimed Messenger, for the Holy Prophet (S) was the Seal of
all the Apostles (*khatam al-rusul*), but alludes to the fact that he
manifested the qualities of a Divine Messenger.

In fact the word ‘*rasul*’ when employed in the general sense refers to
any kind of Allah’s messenger, such as the Angels. When Angel Jibra’il
(AS) appears before Hadhrat Maryam (AS) in the form of a handsome young
man, and the latter seeks refuge in Allah and advises him to observe
piety, Jibra’il (AS) responds saying:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّمَا أنَا رَسُوْلُ رَبِّكِ لِأَ هَبَ لَكِ غُلاَمًا زَكِيًّا
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Surely I am only a messenger of your Lord, so that I may gift you a
pure male offspring. (19:19)***

And Imam ‘Ali (AS) is reported to have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلْمَلاَئِكَةُ هُمْ رُسُلُ اللهِ كَسَايِرِ اَنْبِيَاءِ اللهِ إِلى
اْلَخلْقِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

...The angels are the messengers of Allah to the creatures like the rest
of the prophets of Allah...[^10]

Sometimes the word ‘*rasul*’ is also used for a destitute who is
extremely poor. If he seeks help, then he is in reality spreading the
message of being openhanded. Those therefore who shun such people are in
reality shunning a messenger of Allah. Imam ‘Ali (AS) is reported to
have said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلْمِسْكِيْنُ رَسُوْلُ اللهِ إِلَيْكُمْ فَمَنْ مَنَعَهُ فَقَدْ مَنَعَ
اللهَ، وَمَنْ أعْطاهُ فَقَدْ أعْطى اللهَ .
  </p>
</blockquote>

The extremely poor is a messenger of Allah unto you; so whosoever
refuses to help him, surely he has refused Allah, and whosoever gives
him, then surely he has given to Allah.[^11]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ياَ بْنَ رَسُوْلِ اللهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**O product of the Messenger of Allah**

The word ‘Allah’ here specifies the kind of message that the Holy
Prophet (S) bears. As explained earlier, the name *Allah* exemplifies
all the perfect attributes of God, and therefore the Holy Prophet is the
bearer of the message of all the perfect attributes. The Holy Qur\`an in
fact is a written document that calls the human beings to embellish
themselves with the attributes of Almighty Allah.

And Imam al-Husayn (AS) being the fruit and edifice of a messenger of
*Allah*, qualifies as a caller to all the perfect Divine Attributes. In
fact one of the characteristics of the Infallible Imams of the Ahl
al-Bayt (AS) is that they are الدعاة إلى الله *‘al-du’at ila
Allah’*(callers to Allah). This call is not only in the realm of words.
Their deeds and actions portray the Divine Atrributes. In the well-known
*Ziyarat al-Jami’a* we read:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلسَّلاَمُ عَلى الدُّعَاةِ إِلى اللهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Peace be on you callers unto Allah.[^12]

In another *Ziyarat* of Imam al-Husayn (AS) declaring our total
commitment and harmony with his noble spirit, we repeat the following
seven times:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَبَّيْكَ دَاعِيَ اللَّهِ إِنْ كَانَ لَمْ يُجِبْكَ بَدَنِي فَقَدْ
أَجَابَكَ قَلْبِي وَشَعْرِي وَ بَشَرِي وَرَأْيِي وَ هَوَايَ عَلَى
التَّسْلِيمِ لِخَلَفِ النَّبِيِّ الْمُرْسَلِ وَالسِّبْط الْمُنْتَجَبِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Here I am, O caller to Allah; if my body did not respond to your call
[due to its absence during the tragedy of Karbala], then surely my
heart, hair, skin, opinion, and desire have responded in submission to
the call of the successor of the Divinely sent Prophet (S) and his
chosen gradson.[^13]

Here there is another allusion worthy of contemplation: notice the words
“*khalaf al-nabi al-mursal*” which brilliantly manifest the kind of
relationship we are trying to declare. In the Arabic, a *khalaf* is “a
successor”. And when the adjective *al-mursal* follows *al-nabi*, there
is a particular implication we are trying to convey. In short, we are
declaring that Imam al-Husayn (AS) succeeds the role of shouldering the
mission of the Apostle of Almighty Allah.

There are other clear indications also that show that the Infallible
Imams of the Ahl al-Bayt (AS) possessed attributes that qualified them
to be bearers of Allah’s message and inviters of the same. In *Ziyarat
al-Jami’a* we read:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَبَلَغَ اللهُ بِــكُمْ اَفْضَلَ شَرَفِ مَحَلِّ
الُمَكَرَّمِيْنَ،وَاَعْلى مَنَازِلِ الْمُقَرَّبِيْنَ، وَاَرْفَعَ
دَرَجَاتِ الْمُرْسَلِيْنَ، حَيْثُ لاَ يَلْحَقُهُ لاَحِقٌ، وَلاَ
يَفُوْقُهُ فَائِقٌ...
  </p>
</blockquote>

And Allah made you attain the best sanctimonious station of the ennobled
ones, and the highest stations of the near ones, and **the most exalted
stations of the** ***mursalin*** **(apostles)**, where none can join or
transcend...[^14]

This clearly tells us that the Imams (AS) had qualities to carry out the
duty of passing on the message of Allah to the people. And by the phrase
*“arfa’a darajat al-mursalin”* we should appreciate the fact that they
even transcended messengers of Allah preceding the Holy Prophet (S).
This is because they bore the message of *Khatam al-Rusul* (the Seal of
the Messengers).

In another *Ziyarat* of Imam al-Husayn (AS) we address him as:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكَ يَا وَارِثَ مُحَمَّدٍ رَسُوْلِ اللهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Peace be on you, O Inheritor of Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah.[^15]

Those who can appreciate the subtle implications of the above statement,
understand how vocal it is in revealing the distinction of Imam
al-Husayn (AS). We confess that he inherited the Holy Prophet (S)’s duty
of conveying the message of Allah. All the components of the above
expression such as “*al-salamu*”, “*alayka*”, “*ya*”, “*waritha
Muhammad*”, “*waritha Muhammadin Rasulillah*”, “*Rasul*”,
*“Rasulillah”*, *“Allah”*, etc. are worthy of reflection. Therefore,
read and ascend!

The Relation Between ‘Abd And Rasul

An important point to bear in mind is that in order for Imam al-Husayn
(AS) to really be a *rasul* and a conveyer of Allah’s message to the
people, it is incumbent on him to be an ‘*abd* (an utterly submissive
servant of Allah). Hence it was apt to address him with the teknonym Abu
‘Abdillah in the first verse and thereafter with the patronym *ibnu
Rasulillah*. We find a similar case when we recite our *tashahhud* in
the cananonical prayer. We say:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لاَ شَرِيْكَ لَهُ
وَاَشْهَدُ اَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرُسْوْلُهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

I bear witness that other than Allah there is no god, and I bear witness
that Muhammad is **His utterly obedient servant and Apostle**.

Notice that the phrase *“‘abduhu*” precedes “*wa rasuluh*”, which
alludes to the sequence we are talking about.

However, this station is even higher than being the servant of “Allah”.
Here the third person pronoun “hu” affixed to ‘abd and rasul refer to
the Divine Essence. Discussing this intricacy here is beyond the scope
of this commentary.
