Dedication
==========

My book is a modest piece of work. It is a story of a journey ... a
story of a new discovery, not a technical or natural discovery, but one
in the field of religious and philosophical schools. Since any discovery
is based primarily on a healthy mind and clear comprehension, which
distinguishes human beings from all other creatures, I would like to
dedicate this book to every healthy mind.

A mind which puts truth to the test and knows it from wrong, a mind
which weighs all that has been said in the scale of justice, and always
comes out in favor of reason.

A mind which compares words and sayings, and has the ability to
distinguish between the logical and the not so logical, and between the
strong and the feeble. Allah, the Most High, said,  
 “Those who listen to the saying and follow the best of it, those are
guided by and they are the mindful.”

To all of those I dedicate this book, hoping that Allah, Praise be to
Him the Most High, opens our minds before our eyes, to guide us, to
enlighten our hearts, to show us clearly the right way so we follow it,
and to show us clearly the wrong way so we avoid it, and accepts us with
His good servants, for He listens and He answers.
