83. Reward of doing a favor to our master, the Master of the Time (aj)
======================================================================

This matter could be explained from some aspects:

First: *Dua* – as we explained about it – is a form of paying respect
and honor to people, and it is a kind of favor and goodness, as is very
much clear.

Second: It is that praying for advancement in the reappearance and
deliverance is having effect and role as mentioned in the traditions
regarding this matter and which we explained in detail. And arranging
for all that is greatly effective in this matter, is doing favor to our
master who is apprehensive, hidden and awaited.

Third: It is that obedience of the command of His Eminence and
compliance with regard to the master, in whichever way it might be, is a
favor upon him.

Rather we can say that: *Dua* for His Eminence is a favor on the seal of
the prophets and the Purified Imams (as) and all the prophets and
messengers and all the believers. Because reappearance of His Eminence
is in fact deliverance of all the saints of Allah. As Imam Ja’far Sadiq
(as) has mentioned in his *Dua*after Noon Prayer and on the first of the
month of Ramadan. Thus praying for it is the most obvious type of
favoring.
