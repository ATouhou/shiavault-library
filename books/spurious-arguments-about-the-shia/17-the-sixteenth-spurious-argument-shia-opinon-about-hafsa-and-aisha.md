The Sixteenth Spurious Argument: Shia Opinon about Hafsa and Aisha
==================================================================

Some people spuriously criticize the Shias cursing the wives of Prophet
Muhammad (s), especially Aa’isha (daughter of Abu Bakr; the first
caliph) and Hafsa (daughter of Umar; the second caliph), and that they
ascribe adultery to them, Allah forbid!

The Answer
----------

This is a great calumny. When did the Shias ascribe adultery to “Aa’isha
and Hafsa? This is definitely not true. In fact, they condemned their
disobeying Allah and His Messenger and they have determined that they
both indeed had disobeyed and broke the order of Allah and His
Messenger. The Holy Qur’an has confirmed this. Allah says,

***If you both turn to Allah, then indeed your hearts are already
inclined (to this); and if you back up each other against him, then
surely Allah it is Who is his Guardian, and Jibril and the believers
that do good, and the angels after that are the aiders. (Qur’an 66:4)***

The Shia condemn “Aa’isha for encouraging Talha and az-Zubeir to break
their homage to Imam Ali (a), when she gathered a group of hypocrites,
mounted a camel, and set out with Talha and az-Zubeir to fight Imam Ali.
Indeed, they fought him and were unjust to him.
