Preamble
========

Allah (SWT) has created all women, but each individual woman is
different. For example every woman has her own unique blood cycle. In
Islamic law there are different rules for the kind of blood seen by a
woman. There are specific rules for Haidh, Istihadha and Nifas. It can
often be very confusing for a God wary woman to understand what state
she is in and follow the necessary rulings according to Islamic
Jurisprudence, so that she can seek closeness to Allah (SWT). First, let
us talk about the different kinds of blood seen by a woman.

Different Kinds of Blood Seen by a Woman
----------------------------------------

There are 3 types of blood that a woman may see:

• Istihadha (irregular blood discharge during the month)

• Haidh (period or menstruation)

• Nifas (blood after childbirth)
