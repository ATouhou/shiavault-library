Nearby Damascus
===============

When the Hussain Convoy reached nearby Damascus, Sayyeda Um Kalthoum
approached Shamer and said: "I need to ask you something?"

So he said: "What do you need?"

She said: "If we are to enter the city, do take us from a way where only
few people can see us, and ask them to take out the heads from between
our rides and carry them away from us, as we are humiliated from all the
looks we are getting while we are on this situation!"

So, the cursed man answered to her request by placing the heads that was
on the spears in the middle of the womenâ€™s rides and he went through the
staring crowds while in their bad situation till they reached the gate
of Damascus.

Thus the first of Safar was the day that the head of Imam Hussain (Q)
was brought to the city of Damascus.
