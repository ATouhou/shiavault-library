Commandments, Advice
====================

Commandments of Allah (swt)
---------------------------

**Surah An – Nahl, 16:90-91**

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ اللّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالإِحْسَانِ وَإِيتَاء ذِي
الْقُرْبَى وَيَنْهَى عَنِ الْفَحْشَاء وَالْمُنكَرِ وَالْبَغْيِ

yanhaa ‘anil-fah-shaaa-’i wal-munkari wal bagh-yi; ya-‘izukum
la-‘al-lakum tazak-karuun.

*90. Behold, God enjoins justice, and the doing of good, and generosity
towards (one’s) kindred; and He forbids all that is shameful and all
that runs counter to reason, as well as envy; (and) He exhorts you
(repeatedly) so that you might bear (all this) in mind.*

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَأَوْفُواْ بِعَهْدِ اللّهِ إِذَا عَاهَدتُّمْ وَلاَ تَنقُضُواْ
الأَيْمَانَ بَعْدَ تَوْكِيدِهَا وَقَدْ جَعَلْتُمُ اللّهَ عَلَيْكُمْ

*91. And be true to your bond with God whenever you bind yourself by a
pledge, and do not break (your) oaths after having (freely) confirmed
them and having called upon God to be witness to your good faith:
behold, God knows all that you do.*

Advised to seek refuge with God, from Satan
-------------------------------------------

**Surah Fussilat, 41:36**

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَإِمَّا يَنزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ
إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Wa ’im-maa yanza-ghan-naka minash-Shaytaani nazghunfasta-‘iz bil-laah.
’In-naahuu Huwas-Samii-‘ul-‘Aliim.

*36. Hence, if it should happen that a prompting from Satan stirs thee
up (to blind anger), seek refuge with God: behold, He alone is
all-hearing, all-knowing!*

In this verse the best possible way and the greatest and best remedy
against an open attack from the satanic forces is given i.e., to seek
refuge with God and the promise of response from God is there for
everyone who seeks to have it.

 How many poor people have been corrupted because of their poverty?  
 How many wealthy people have been corrupted because of their wealth?

*31. And tell the believing woman to lower their gaze and be mindful of
their chastity, and not to display their charms (in public) beyond what
may (decently) be apparent thereof; hence, let them draw their head -
coverings over their bosoms. And let them not display (more of) their
charms to any but their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s
fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers, or
their brother’s sons, or their sisters sons, or their woman folk, or
those whom they rightfully possess, or such male attendants as are
beyond all sexual desires, or children that are as yet aware of women’s
nakedness; and let them not swing their legs (in walking) so as to draw
attention to their hidden charms.*

*And (always), O you believers - all of you - turn unto God in
repentance, so that you might attain to a happy state!*

The above verses of ***Surah Nur, 24:30-31*** are clear in what they
mean and the legislation they lay down regarding men and women’s duties
regarding the use of veil and guarding their chastity. Islam therefore
does not prohibit woman to come out from the four walls of her home but
prohibits her exposing her ornaments or adorning the parts of her body,
to other than those who are mentioned in the exceptional clause.

The Holy Prophet (S) has cursed the husband who agrees to his wife
getting adorned and going out exposing her beauty to the others.

The Holy Prophet (S) has said:

“‘You give me the guarantee for six things on your behalf and I will
guarantee your getting Paradise for your eternal abode.

1. To speak always the truth.

2. To fulfil your promise.

3. To discharge faithfully a trust.

4. To guard your private parts against any forbidden use.

5. To be away from the forbidden acts.

6. Guard yourself against consuming the forbidden or ill-earned food or
drink.”

Hijab

**Surah Al – Ahzab, 33:59**

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَاء
الْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ذَلِكَ

Ghafuurar-Rahiimaa.

*59. O Prophet! Tell thy wives and thy daughters, as well as all (other)
believing women, that they should draw over themselves some of their
outer garments (when in public): this will be more conducive to their
being recognised (as decent women) and not annoyed. But (withal) God is
indeed much-forgiving, a dispenser of Grace!*

Under this injunction every believer woman has been commanded to wear an
over-garment or a covering mantle so that their feminine beauty might
not attract the attention of men to stimulate evil intentions for a
covering on the body of a woman would also indicate that the woman is
pure, chaste, modest and the one pure in character and would never
tolerate the least overtures or disregard to her chaste womanhood and
consequently even the worst character will not dare cast even an evil
look on such chaste ones and going without such a protection is
indirectly inviting overtures and encouraging romance towards them.

’In-naa ‘araznal-’Amaanata ‘alas-Samaa-waati wal-’Arzi wal - Jibaali
fa-’abayna ’ay-yahmil-nahaa wa ’ash-faqna minhaa wa hamalahal-’Insaan:
’In-nahuu kaana zaluuman-jahuulaa;-

*72. Verily, We did offer the trust (of reason and violation) to the
heavens and the earth and the mountains: but they refused to bear it
because they were afraid of it. Yet man took it up - for verily, he has
always been prone to be most unjust, most ignorant.*

This verse on ‘Trust’ is a serious issue on the application of the
knowledge of the spirit of the Holy Qur’an. What God offered to the
heavens and the earth and the mountains who rejected it, could not be
anything simple or ordinary. It must be something very serious, grave
and important, the acceptance of which would naturally carry a great
reward and the failure to discharge it will also be very grave.

In ***Surah al-Hashr, 59:21:***

“‘*Had We bestowed this Qur’an from on high upon a mountain, thou
wouldst indeed see it humbling itself, breaking asunder for awe of
God....’ And (all) such parables We propound unto men, so that they
might (learn to) think.’”*

the sending down of the Holy Qur’an on the mountain is referred, but in
a hypothetical sense and the concluding words of the verse say that it
is a parable used for people to reflect, which means that such
expressions are not to be taken in the literal sense but must be studied
with the inner or latent meaning treasured in them for its correct
interpretation. It is said that the heavens and the earth and the
mountains, (i.e. every creature other than man) refused to accept the
offer, i.e. in other words, they expressed their inability to accept the
responsibility. It could be possible that these creations with all their
greatness in size, did not think it possible for them to discharge it,
although the reward for discharging it, could be something equally great
and glorious.

We see that everything in the celestial and the terrestrial world known
to us, works like an automation without any personal choice of change or
alteration in its respective activity, and this must be that much which
they accepted to work and that which they rejected or begged to be
excused to accept, must be the otherwise, i.e. the faculty of choice
which is obviously and manifestly found only in Man. No doubt this is
the great Trust for it is really a task to hold the independence of
choice in this world of innumerable powerful distractive attractions and
yet to choose the right course of fulfilling the Will of the Creator
Lord, by avoiding the strong pull from the innumerable powerful
temptation and being steadfast on the right way.

Man has been too audacious to accept the offer with the ignorance of the
difficulties in discharging the ‘Trust’. Thus man with his ignorance
accepted it and subjected himself to the toil of discharging it, thus he
as *‘Zaloom’* i.e. one who is the most unjust to himself in subjecting
himself to the task and *‘Jahool’* i.e. the one most ignorant of the
responsibility while undertaking it. It is presently seen that having
taken the responsibility most of mankind have failed to discharge it and
became hypocrites and disbelievers and have earned the wrath of God,
while some of them proved totally faithful to the trust and true to
their accepting it and entitled themselves to the special and exclusive
Grace and Mercy of the Lord.

In ***Surah al-Baqarah, 2:30-34***, is mentioned of this criterion in
which man was declared superior to the angels. Man was taught the Names
(of certain beings) which even the angels did not know. It clearly
infers that the angels were asked if they were prepared to bear the
burden of the divinity reflected through the divine entities displayed
to them, which they could not.

Therefore the destiny made available to Man was the greatest, the
highest, the most glorious one any mortal could ever have, and God
endowed in man the great receptive qualities to get the divine
attributes reflected in him and at the same time left to him also the
choice of getting deviated by the distractions or to rise into the
heights of the divine regions avoiding the fall into the abyss of
degradation and humility.

But, man did not then realise what a tremendous task he was undertaking
nor did he ever consider whether he would be able to rise equal to it,
i.e. man basically failed to measure his own power to achieve the task
or to assess his own knowledge of the great responsibility he was
undertaking, hence he being referred to as ‘*Zaloom’* and *‘Jaloom’*
i.e. unjust and ignorant.

It is this great and unique undertaking which entitled man to be the
*Vicegerent of God on earth.* mentioned in ***Surah al-Baqarah, 2:30***:

“*(recollect O Our Apostle Muhammad) When said thy Lord unto the angels:
“Verily I (intend to) appoint a vicegerent in the earth” they said,
“Wilt Thou (O our Lord!) appoint therein one who will cause mischief and
shed blood, while we celebrate by Thy praise and hallow Thee alone?”
Said (the Lord to the angels) “Verily, I know what ye know not.””*

Fasting
-------

**Surah Baqarah, 2:183**

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا
كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Yaaa -’ayyu - hallaziina aamanuu kutiba ‘alay-kumus-Siyaamu kamaa kutiba
‘alal-laziina min-qablikum la-’allakum tatta-quun.

*183. O you who have attained to faith! Fasting has been ordained for
you as it was ordained for those before you, so that you might remain
conscious of God.*

Allah (swt) has said in Hadith al Qudsi that:

“The fast is for Me, and I shall give its reward.”

Fasting is the only act of worship which consists of a negative aspect
only, for example, not eating - not drinking etc. while all other acts
of worship, like prayer and pilgrimage, giving of charity etc consist of
positive actions or are made up of positive and negative aspects. The
positive actions cannot be absolutely pure in showing the worshipper’s
spirit of servitude or the Lordship of Almighty Allah (swt). It cannot
be free of materialistic imperfections and limitations, and sometimes it
may be done to please someone other than Allah (swt) (as in the case of
hypocrisy and showiness). But fasting is an act of worship in which one
has just to abstain from lust and desire and restrain oneself from
worldly matters. This negative aspect is a thing which nobody can know
except Allah (swt). It is a dealing entirely between the servant and his
Lord, and therefore this worship is purely for Allah (swt); others can
have no share in it. The servant worshipped Him in a way that nobody
knew but Allah (swt), so he will be given its reward in a way that
nobody will know it but Allah (swt).

Man must not postpone the doing of good deed and worship of his Creator

*68. But (let them remember always that) if We lengthen a human being’s
days, We cause him to decline in his powers (when he grows old): will
they not, then, use their reason?*

Man should never postpone his exercise of moral choice - for if human
beings are superior creatures inasmuch as they have been endowed with
the faculty of discernment and a wide measure of free will, let them
also remember that ***“man has been created weak”*** **Surah an-Nisa,
4:28** and liable to decline still further in old age, hence the time at
his disposal is short.

*7. Whatever (spoils taken) from the people of those villages God has
turned over to His Apostle - (all of it) belongs to God and the Apostle,
and the near of kin, and the orphans, and the needy, and the wayfarer,
so, that it may not be (a benefit) going round and round among such of
you as may (already) be rich. Hence, accept (willingly) whatever the
Apostle gives you (thereof), and refrain from (demanding) anything that
he withholds from you; and remain conscious of God: for, verily, God is
severe in retribution.*

*8. (Thus, part of such war-gains shall be given) to the poor among
those who have forsaken the domain of evil: those who have been driven
from their homelands and their possessions, seeking favour with God, and
(His) goodly acceptance, and who aid (the cause of) God and His Apostle:
it is they, they who are true to their word!*

This verse clearly lays down the formula giving out the classes of the
beneficiaries whom the property of *‘Fie’* or spoils of war obtained
without a fight, has to be distributed. It is earmarked for God, for the
Holy Prophet (S), the kith and kin of the Holy Prophet (S) (*Sa’daat*)
i.e. Bani Hashim, the orphans, the needy and the wayfarers. The warriors
are not entitled to any share in the *‘Fie’* for the reason that there
was no necessity of their services.

The reason for this allotment by God is given saying that what was
restored to the Holy Prophet (S) without any fight might not also be
taken away by the other people to enrich themselves further while the
poor among the near of kin to the Holy Prophet (S) on whom *‘Sadaqa’*
and other such alms from the others are forbidden.

Unfortunately, this verse is misinterpreted to say that the reason was
not to allow the Holy Prophet’s (S) share to be inherited at all. Here
the Holy Qur’an expressively asserts that the property restored to the
Holy Prophet (S) without the efforts of the Muslims, does not go to the
public treasury.

It goes to people specified in this verse. The Holy Prophet (S)
distributed the lands of the Jews restored among the Mohajirs who had
left their property at Mecca and were a burden on the Ansars, the
inhabitants of Medina. By the order of God, he therefore gave *‘Fadak’*
to his daughter Fatima (a) in the same manner he gave to the other
Mohajirs. Thus *‘Fadak’* was handed over to his daughter during his
lifetime. However, history is proof of what happened after the demise of
the Holy Prophet (S), where it was claimed that this was a part of the
*‘Baitul-Mal’* or public treasury.
