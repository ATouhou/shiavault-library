Singing and Adultery
====================

Singing becomes the cause of Adultery as the below mentioned tradition
states:-

The Holy Prophet (S) said," Singing is a ladder to Adultery."

Singing gives rise to the lust in man which ultimately gives out bad
consequences. Not only he who sings but also the one who listens
attentively to it becomes negligent towards Allah and is ready for
immoral deeds.

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (a.s) said," All those past times and amusement are
major sins, which makes a person negligent in remembering Allah. For
example people indulging in singing, music and musical gadgets.

Yes, indeed it’s a fact that music not only makes shame and modesty
disappear but also destroys love, brotherhood and generousness. In
short, it makes the whole environment a specimen of Hell.
