Fifth Assembly
==============

(This is) From what he dictated on Monday, the 17th of Ramadhan, and was
heard by Abul Fawaris - may Allah keep him - reported to me by the grand
Sheikh Al-Mufid, Abu Abdillah, Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Nu’man, may
Allah continue to protect him and grant him beneficent care, having read
over to him.

1. Illness purifies a person of his sins
----------------------------------------

*He said: Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Umar ibn Salim al-Ji’abi reported to me
from Abu Abdillah Ja'far ibn Muhammad al-Hasani, who reported from
al-Fadl ibn al-Qasim, who reported from his father, from his
grandfather, who reported from his father, that Abdullah ibn Muhammad
ibn Aqil. ibn Abi Talib who said:*

I heard ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn, Zainul Abedeen (as) say: "A nerve (of a
Mu’min) does not twitch, nor does he have a headache except because of
his sins. And that which Allah forgives is much more." And whenever he
saw a sick person having recovered, he would say: "May the purification
from the sins do you good! Now start (good) deeds all over again."  
  

2. The Prophet (SAW) on his successor
-------------------------------------

*He said: Abu Hafs Umar ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Ali al-Sayrafi reported to me
from Abul Husayn al-Abbas ibn al-Mughairah al-Jawhari, who reported from
Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Mansoor al-Ramadi, who reported from Abdul Razzaq,
who reported from his father, who reported from Mayna, the client of
Abdul Rahman ibn Auf, who reported from Abdullah ibn Mas'ood who said:*

On the night of the delegation of Jinn (i.e. during the battle of
Tabuk), we were with the Prophet, peace be upon him and his progeny,
when he made a station at Ula. Then he went away, and when he returned,
he heaved a sigh. Then he said: "O Ibn Mas'ood, I have been warned of my
impending death." So I said: "O messenger of Allah, appoint a
successor." He asked: "Who?" "I said: "Abu Bakr." He said: (The Prophet)
walked for sometime, and heaved a sigh and then said: "My death has been
announced to me O Ibn Mas'ood."

Then I said: "Appoint a successor, O messenger of Allah." He asked:
"Who?" I said: "Umar." He remained silent, and then walked for sometime,
heaved a sigh, and said: "I have been given news of my death, O Ibn
Mas'ood!" So, I said: "Appoint a successor!" He asked: "Who?" I said:
"Uthman." He kept silent, walked for sometime, heaved a sigh and said:
"O Ibn Mas'ood, my death has been announced to me!" I said: "Appoint a
successor, O Prophet of Allah" He asked: "Who?" I said: "‘Ali ibn Abi
Talib." He heaved a sigh and said: "By He Who controls my soul, if they
obey him (i.e. ‘Ali), they will definitely enter Paradise, everyone of
them."

3. The calamity of denying the pen to the Prophet (SAW)
-------------------------------------------------------

*He said: Abu Hafs Umar ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Ali Al-Sayrafl reported to me
from Abul Husayn al-Abbas ibn al-Mughairah al-Jawhari, who reported from
Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Mansoor al-Ramadi, who reported from Ahmad ibn
Swaleh, who reported from Anbasah, who reported from Yunus, from Ibn
Shihab from Ubaidullah ibn Abdullah ibn Utbah, from Abdullah ibn Abbas
who said:*

When the death of the Prophet, peace be upon him and his progeny, was
approaching, there were some people, including Umar ibn al-Khattab, in
the house. The Prophet, peace be upon him and his progeny, said: "Come,
let me write for you a testament so that you may never go astray after
that!" So, Umar said: "Do not give him anything, for he is overwhelmed
with pain; and you have the Qur'an, the Book of Allah is sufficient for
us."

Then the inmates began disputing each other, some saying, "Rise, and
(let) the Prophet write for you", while others agreed with Umar. When
there was too much noise and dispute, the Prophet, peace be upon him and
his progeny, said: "Go away from me".

Ubaidullah ibn Abdullah ibn Utbah said: Abdullah ibn Abbas, may Allah
bless him with mercy, used to say: "What a calamity! Total calamity,
which prevented the messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his
progeny, from writing for us that testament because of their disputation
and noise."

4. Some companions who reneged
------------------------------

*He said: Abu Bakr, Muhammad ibn Ummar ibn Salim al-Ji’abi, reported to
me from Abu Abdillah Ja'far ibn Muhammad a.-Hasani who reported from Abu
Musa Isa ibn Mehran al-Must'ataf, who reported from Affan ibn Muslim,
who reported from Waheeb, who reported from Abdullah ibn Uthman ibn
Khuthaym who reported from Ibn Abi Maleekah, from Ayesha who said:*

I heard the Prophet, peace be upon him and his progeny, say: "As if I am
at the Pool (Kawthar) seeing those who arrive at me; and there are some
who are pushed away from me, so I say: My Lord! (these are) my
companions, my companions!" Then the voice says: "You do not know what
they did after you. They continued to renege, by turning back on their
heels."

5. Some companions who will never see the Prophet (SAW) again
-------------------------------------------------------------

*He said: Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Umar ibn Salim reported to me from Abu
Abdillah Ja'far ibn Muhammad al-Hasani, who reported from Isa ibn
Mehran, who reported from Abu Mu'awiyah al-Dhareer, who reported from
A'amash, from Shaqeeq, from Ummu Salemah, the Prophet's wife, who said
that Abdul Rahman ibn Awf (once) called upon her and said:*

"O Mother, I fear that my abundant wealth may destroy me. I am the
richest among the Quraish." She said: "O Son, spend (in the way of
Allah), for surely, I heard the Prophet, peace be upon him and his
progeny, say: From my companions, there will be some who will never see
me again after I have departed from them."

He said: Abdul Rahman left, and on his way met with Umar ibn
al-Khattaibn He informed him about what Ummu Salemah had said. He (Umar)
came to Ummu Salemah with insistence that he be allowed to visit her,
then he said: "O mother, am I among them?" She said: "I do not know, nor
am I going to absolve anyone beside you."

6. Allah tests His servants
---------------------------

*He said: Al-Sharif Abu Abdillah Muhammad ibn Muhammad Tahir al-Musavi
reported to me from Abul Abbas Abmad ibn Muhammad ibn Saeed al-Hamadani,
who reported from Yahya ibn Zakariyya Ibn Shayban, who reported from
Muhammad ibn Sinan, who reported from Ahmad ibn Sulayman al-Qummi
al-Kufi, who said:*

I heard Abu Abdillah Ja'far ibn Muhammad (as) say: "Even a prophet among
the Prophets may be tested with thirst till he dies thirsty; even a
prophet among the Prophets may be tested at a deserted place till he
dies naked; even a prophet among the Prophets may be tested with
diseases and illness till he dies; even a prophet among the Prophets may
come to his people, stay with them so as to enjoy upon them obedience to
Allah, and call them to the absolute unity of Allah, yet he may not be
spared a night, nor given an opportunity to complete his speech, nor
given even a patient listening, until he is killed. Verily, Allah, Most
High, tests His servants according to their station in His estimate."

7. Imam Husayn (as) as an ideal
-------------------------------

*He said: Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Umar al-Ji’abi reported from Abul Abbas
Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Saeed, who reported from Yahya ibn Zakariyya, who
reported from Uthman ibn Isa, who reported from Ahmad ibn Sulayman and
Imran ibn Marwan, from Sama'ah ibn Mehran who said:*

I heard Abu Abdillah Ja'far ibn Muhammad (as) say: "The person mentioned
by Allah in the verse: ***'And mention in the Book, Ismail; indeed he
was true to his promise, and he was a messenger Prophet.'*** (Maryarn,
18:54) he was the one who Allah tested by his people, so they pulled off
the skin from his face and scalp.

Then Allah sent His angel unto him, who said: "The Lord of the entire
creation greets you with peace; and says: I have seen what your people
have done to you, so ask Me whatever you want." He said: "O Lord of the
worlds, I have an ideal in the person of al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali ibn Abi
Talib, peace be upon them." Then Abu Abdillah said: "He was not Ismail
the son of Ibrahim, peace be upon our Prophet and upon both of them."

8. Fatimah's (as) elegy on Fadak
--------------------------------

*He said: Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Umar al-Ji’abi reported to me from Abu
Abdillah Ja'far ibn Muhammad ibn Ja'far al-Hasani, who reported from Isa
ibn Mehran, from Yunus, from Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Sulaiman
al-Hashemi, from his father, from his grandfather, from Zainab ibn ‘Ali
ibn Abi Talib (as) that she said:*

When the opinion of Abu Bakr and his supporters became unanimous about
depriving Fatimah, peace be upon her, from Fadak, and she lost all hope
about his reconsideration, she came to her father's grave, threw herself
upon it, and grievously complained about the way the {people} treated
her. And she wept, till the earth on the grave became wet with her
tears, and then she said in her elegy:

*"There have been after you news and incidents*  
*were you to witness them, you would have disapproved them;*  
*We have missed you, the way a parched land misses the rainfall,*  
*your people are in total disarray, see how they have reneged.*  
*Jibraeel used to endear us with the verses (of Qur'an),*  
*but after you have hid from us, all good is also concealed;*  
*You were the moon, from whose light people benefited,*  
*and upon you was revealed the books - from the Lord Almighty.*  
*Men have attacked us and humiliated us,*  
*after the Prophet, and all wealth has been usurped;*  
*The perpetrator of injustices to us will know his fate*  
*on the day of Judgement, where he will finally land.*  
*We have come across things which no one before us,*  
*neither from Arabs nor from the Ajam have suffered;*  
*So, we shall continue weeping over you as long as we live,*  
*and as long as we have eyes which well up with flowing tears."*

9. On constraint and indulgence
-------------------------------

*He said: Al-Shareef Abu Abdillah Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Tahir
reported to me from Abul Abbas Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Saeed, from Ahmad
ibn Yusuf al-Ja'fi, from al-Husayn ibn Muhammad, from his father, from
Adam ibn Uyaynah ibn Abi Imran al-Hilali al-Kufi, who said:*

I heard Abu Abdillah, Ja'far ibn Muhammad (as) say: "How often a
moment's constraint and patience can bring about long lasting pleasure
and satisfaction, and how often a moment's indulgence can result in a
prolonged grief and sorrow."

10. Traditions from a truthful source
-------------------------------------

*He said: Abul Qasim Ja'far ibn Muhammad al-Qummi, may Allah bless him
with mercy, reported to me from Sa'd ibn Abdullah, who reported from
Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa, who reported from Harun ibn Muslim, from
‘Ali ibn Asbat, from Saif ibn Umayrah, from Amru ibn Shimr, from Jabir
who said:*

I told Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn ‘Ali al-Baqir (as): "When you relate a
tradition to me, provide its chain of narrators for me." He said: "My
father reported to me, from my grandfather, from the messenger of Allah,
peace be upon him and his progeny, from Jibraeel (as), from Allah, Most
High. Whatever I mention to you is based on this chain of narrators."
And then he said: "O Jabir, a tradition received by you from a truthful
source is better for you than the whole world and whatever is in it."

11. Acting without understanding
--------------------------------

*He said: Abul Hasan Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Hasan reported to me from his
father, from Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Saffar, from Ahmad ibn Muhammad
ibn Isa, from Muhammad ibn Sinan, from Musa ibn Bakr, who said:*

Someone who heard from Abu Abdillah Ja'far ibn Muhammad (as) reported to
me that he said: "One who acts without any understanding and vision, is
like a person walking behind a mirage on a levelled desert, the faster
he runs the farthest he ends up.
