Sahifa Kamila And Merits Of The Two Caliphs
===========================================

Ahlul Sunnat say that in a supplication of Sahifa Kamila are mentioned
merits of the Righteous Caliphs. The supplication does not mention any
names but it says: “Companions, who helped the religion, bore troubles
and strived greatly in the establishment of faith.” Such companions are
intended in this supplication. There can be no indication in this
supplication for the three Caliphs, because those people did not help
the faith in anyway, they bore no difficulties for religion and did not
make any efforts for the establishment of religion. They always left the
Prophet surrounded by enemies and bolted to save their dear lives. They
never faced the infidels. They always avoided the hardships of Jihad.
Then how can Imam (a.s.) pray for such people?

But since the word of ‘companions’ appears in this supplication, Ahlul
Sunnat thought of their three Caliphs at once. Here the situation of
Ahlul Sunnat is like the drowning man who clutches at the straw. The
writer would like to state that if Imam Zainul Aabideen (a.s.) had
really meant the two Caliphs, there was nothing preventing him to
mention them by name.
