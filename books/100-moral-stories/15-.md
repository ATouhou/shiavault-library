THE ANGEL
Once upon a time there was a child ready to be born. One day the child
asked God, “They tell me

you are going to send me to earth tomorrow but how am I going to live
there being so small and

helpless?” God replied, “Among the many angels I have chosen one for
you. She will be waiting for

you and will take care of you.”

Said child, “But tell me here in Heaven I don’t do anything else but
sing and smile. That’s what I

need to be happy!” God replied, “Your angel will sing for you every day.
And you will feel your

angel’s love and be happy.”

And, said the child, “How am I going to be able to understand when
people talk to me, if I don’t

know the language that men talk?” “That’s easy”, God said, “Your angel
will tell you the most

beautiful and sweet words you will ever hear, and with much patience and
care, your angel will

teach you how to speak.” The child looked up at God saying, “And what am
I going to do when I

want to talk to you?” God smiled at the child saying, “Your angel will
teach you how to pray.”

The child said, “I’ve heard on earth there are bad men. Who will protect
me?” God replied, “Your

angel will defend you, even if it means risking life!” The child looked
sad, saying, “But I will always

be sad because I will not see you anymore.” God replied, “Your angel
will always talk to you about

me and will teach you the way to come back to

me, even though I will always be next to you.”

At that moment there was much peace in Heaven,

but voices from earth could already be heard.

The child in a hurry, asked softly, “Oh God, if

I am about to leave now please tell me my angel’s

name!” God replied, Your angel’s name is of no

***MOTHER!***

importance… you will simply call her
