Distinguished Benefactor: Mr. Moussa Chahine

Only an unusually noble, spirited man as mentioned above, would achieve
what normally takes a whole community to accomplish. The author wishes
to express his sincere appreciation to Mr. Hussein Hakim, a professor of
linguistics from Michigan City, Indiana, for his editorial work.
