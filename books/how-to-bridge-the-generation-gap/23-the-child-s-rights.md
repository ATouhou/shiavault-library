The Child’s Rights
==================

The Father
----------

My child! In order not to judge in a one sided manner, I should tell you
that as any child is obligated to his parents, they in return are
obligated to him too. In reply to a man who had asked about his
obligations to his child, the Holy Prophet (S) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
تحسن اسمه وادبه وضعه موضعاً حسناً.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“It is for you to give him a good name and to raise him in a good
manner and to teach him an appropriate trade”* [^1]

The Holy Prophet (S) has other points in this respect such as:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
علموا اولادكم السباحة والرماية.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Teach your children swimming and archery.”* [^2]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يلزم الوالدين من العقوق لولدهما ما يلزم الولدلهما من عقوقهما.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Parents are equally obliged to discharge their responsibilities
towards their children and are accountable in case of failure. Similarly
children are responsible to discharge their obligation towards parents”*
[^3]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
رحم الله من اعان ولده على بره قال قلت كيف يعينه على بره قال يقبل يسوره
ويتجاوز عن معسوره ولا يرهقه ولا يخرق به.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“May Allah have mercy upon those parents who help their children so
that the children could reciprocate the same towards them. They asked
how they can help. He replied by accepting any easy task he may fulfill;
and by not requiring him to do hard* *labour; and by not being rough and
unfair to him.”* [^4]

Imam ‘Ali (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لا تقسروا اولادكم علي اخلاقكم فانهم مخلون لزمان غير زمانكم.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Do not force your children in having the same characteristics as you
do. Because they created in an era which is different from yours.”*
[^5]  
 Further he said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وحق الولد على الوالدان يحسن اسمه ويحسن ادبه ويعلمه القرآن.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“A father has three obligations towards his child: 1. To give him a
good name, 2: To raise him in a good manner, and 3: To teach him Holy
Qur'an.”* [^6]

I think, by this, he does not merely mean the pronunciation of Qur'anic
words, but rather the practice and implementation of its commandments,
method, and its exalted moral guidelines in their day of day lives. You
should familiarize yourself with the sublime realities in the Qur'anic
text, so that you can meet your spiritual needs. What better honour is
there to lead a life according to the teaching of the Holy Qur’an?

Our fourth Imam, Imam Sajjad (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
واما حق ولدك فان تعلم انه منك ومضاف اليك في عاجل الدنيا بخيره وشره
وانك مسئول عماوليته من حسن الادب والدلالة على ربه عزوجل والمعونة له
على طاعته فاعمل في امره عمل من يعلم انه مثاب على الاحسان اليه معاقب
على الاسائة اليه.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“You should be aware of the fact that your child* *has come from you
and that people associate his good or bad deeds with you. You are
responsible to teach him good manners,* *and to guide him to the way of
the Creator of the World and to help him on obeying Him. Most assuredly,
you will be rewarded for the being good to your child, and will be
punished for abusing him.”* [^7]

Imam As-Sadiq (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
برالرجل بولده بره بوالديه.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“He who is* *beneficent* *to his child, is so to his parents”* [^8]

Our seventh Imam, Imam Musa al-Kazim,[^9] (as) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يستحب عرامة الغلام فى صغره ليكون حليما فى كبره.
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“It is appropriate to encourage a boy during his childhood to do
difficult work in order to grow up a patient and meek adult.”* [^10]

The Child

As you admit for the most part, rearing a child and preparing him for a
material and spiritual life is up to his parents.

[^9]: The Seventh Imam, Musa, entitled al-Kazim (128/44-183/799). The
son of the sixth, he was contemprerary with such Abbasid caliphs as
al-Mansur and Harun al-Rashid. He lived most of his life in Medina with
several restrictions placed upon him and finally died in prison in
Bagdad. After him, the Imams were often not able to live in their
traditional home of Medina, but were forced to remain near the caliph in
Baghdad or Samara. He is buried in Kazimayn in Iraq.
