With Insight
============

![](/sites/default/files/insight.gif)

One who sees with his heart,

and acts **with insight**,

considers before doing anything

whether his action would

be to his benefit or harm.

If it is beneficial for him,

he performs it,

but if it is harmful,

he refrains from it.

(Sermon 154)
