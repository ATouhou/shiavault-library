6. the Generous Gift To the Prophet
===================================

When the day came that the famous combat of Kheybar took place, and
after the great heroism of Ali Ibn Abi Tâléb before the great gates of
Kheybar’s fortress, the war ended finally, and victory belonged to
Muslims.

There was a little village near Kheybar by the name of “Fadak’’; its
Jewish inhabitants had made peace with the Prophet. They had offered him
half of their village to make peace with him, and to show him their
loyalty;

In return, they had asked the permission to remain in their homeland.
This piece of land became a possession of the Prophet. The Messenger of
God gave the money that came from his land to the poor families of Bani
Hashem Tribe.

But with the coming of the sourate : Ar- Roum, [where it said]: ‘‘You
should give your relatives’ due’’, the Messenger of God, offered Fadak
to Fâtemeh, by God’s Command.
