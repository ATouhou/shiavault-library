description: |
  The essays presented by the author here were written in Iran over a
  period of about ten years (1989-1999). The title of the collection is
  not meant to suggest that these are the most important topics of
  contemporary Islamic thought, merely that they are some topics of
  current discussion among Muslims. These are semi-popular essays written
  with several purposes in mind.
