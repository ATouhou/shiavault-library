Bashir, An Opponent Of Ali Among The Narrators Of Ahlul Sunnat
==============================================================

We mention herewith the names of great narrators who are considered
reliable among Ahlul Sunnat scholars and their traditions are mentioned
in the six canonical books and these narrators are from the companions
of the Messenger of Allah (S), at the same time they were also great
enemies of His Eminence, Ali (a.s.). Moreover, some people of Basra,
Kufa, and Medina were also his enemies, who harbored enmity towards His
Eminence, Ali (a.s.) and also cursed him. Anyhow, they are as follows:

Anas bin Malik, Zaid bin Arqam, Ashath bin Qays, Abu Masood, Kaabul
Ahbar, Samra bin Jundab, Abu Huraira, Abdullah bin Zubair, Walid bin
Uqba, Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman, Qaaqa bin Shur, Najjashi, Kaab bin
Juail, Hanzaltul Katib, Jurair bin Abdullah Alkhali, Imran bin Hasi,
Wael bin Tajaral Khazrami, Mutraf bin Abdullah, Alaa bin Ziyad, Abdullah
bin Shafiq, Maratul Hamdani, Abdullah bin Numair, Aswad bin Yazeed,
Masruq bin al-Ajda, Qays bin Hazim, Abdul Rahman bin Atiyya, Makhool and
Zuhri.

Woe upon these writers who were not fit to love His Eminence, Ali
(a.s.). The love for His Eminence, Ali (a.s.) is the soul of Islam and
those who do not love His Eminence, Ali (a.s.) have no deliverance from
hell. Because the hearts of hypocrites are bereft of Aliâ€™s love and the
place of these hypocrites is in hell.
