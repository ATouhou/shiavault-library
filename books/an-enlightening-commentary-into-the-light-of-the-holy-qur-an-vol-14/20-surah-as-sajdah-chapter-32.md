This Surah is one of 29 Suras that begin with abbreviated letters and
after which the Qur’an is glorified.

It is one of the four Suras of Qur’an which contain obligatory
prostration. According to the tradition recorded in Majma‘-ul-Bayan, the
holy Prophet (S) used to recite this Surah and Surah Al-Mulk every night
before sleeping.

Similar to other Meccan Suras, there are some almost detailed
explanations about Origin and Resurrection in this Surah, too. The end
of the disbelievers is also mentioned in it, in order that the faith of
the believers and their steadfastness against the pressure of the
enemies would be strengthened.

To perform bowing and prostration at night, when people are asleep, is
mentioned as one of the specialities of the true believers pointed out
in verse No. 25, the recitation of which needs obligatory prostration.
