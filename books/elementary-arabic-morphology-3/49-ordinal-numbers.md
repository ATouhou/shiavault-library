261. An ordinal number indicates the order of things.

262. The ordinal numbers are:**أوّل ، ثانٍ ، رابعٌ ، خامسٌ ، سادسٌ ،
سابعٌ ، ثامنٌ ، تاسعٌ ، عاشرٌ ، مائةٌ ، ألفٌ.**

263. There are four types of ordinal numbers: singular, from first to
tenth, compound from eleventh to nineteenth, coupled, from twenty-first
to ninety-ninth, and decimal numbers, from twentieth to ninetieth, and a
hundredth and a thousandth follow these as well (in cardinal numbers
these two numbers followed the singular numbers).

264. Ordinal numbers are in congruence with the numbered word in
masculinity and femininity, except decimal numbers; for they stay in one
form. Compound ordinal numbers are like compound cardinal numbers in
that both their parts are indeclinable on a *fathah*
