Publisher's Foreword
====================

{Verily this Qur'an guides to that which is most upright.} 1

The Holy Qur'an is the eternal celestial message revealed by Allah to
His prophet Muhammad (Blessings and Peace be upon him and his family) so
that he might rescue a confused humanity from the darkness of doubt and
ignorance to the light of certainty and knowledge, for the Qur'an
delineates the road of guidance and righteousness in both religious and
worldly affairs.

The Qur'an represents the foundation stone of Islam, which Allah has
promised to keep free from corruption:

{We have sent down the Reminder and We shall be its protectors.}2

Therefore the hand of corruption has not touched it like it has the
other divine books. The Qur'an remains the eternal divine message that
has come for humanity in its entirety. The enemies of Islam despite
their efforts to the contrary, have not been able to fault the integrity
of the Holy Qur'an after the challenge posed by Allah for them to bring
forth even one chapter of its ilk. Human intellect has not been able to
meet this challenge.

Allah Almighty says in the Qur'an:

{If you are in doubt as to that which We have sent down upon Our
servant, then bring forward a chapter of its ilk and call upon your
witnesses other than Allah if you speak the truth.}3

One of the most important reasons for the preservation of the Qur'an in
addition to it being the will of Allah is the fact that the Messenger of
Allah concerned himself with collating the Qur'an during his life and
insisted upon it. Hence, from then until now, the Qur'an has remained
the same without any change.

1 The Qur'an: The Night Journey (17):9.
2 The Qur'an: The Rocky Tract (15):9.
3 The Qur'an: The Heifer (2):23.

This book, 'When was the Qur'an Compiled' by the esteemed writer and
source of religious knowledge Imam Muhammad Shirazi, deals with the
subject of the collation of the Qur'an. It provides firm evidence that
the Holy Qur'an was compiled at the time of and at the command of the
Prophet, peace be upon him, in the form in which it exists today
dispelling the view of those who imagine that the Qur'an was compiled
after the time of the Messenger of Allah.

The writer also tackles the question of the non-corruption of the
Qur'an, which Shi'a scholars have stated throughout history refuting the
notion that there has been any addition to or subtraction from the
verses of the Qur'an. Imam al-Shirazi then touches upon the
inauthenticity of the different 'readings' except that which is present
in the holy text itself.

Finally he presents a number of traditions regarding many aspects of
the Holy Qur'an. This is seen as further evidence that the Holy Qur'an
was compiled in the form we have it today, and 'in use' by the Muslims
during the lifetime of the holy Prophet of Islam, Muhammad peace be upon
him and his infallible descendants.
