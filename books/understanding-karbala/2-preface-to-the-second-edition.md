Preface to the Second Edition
=============================

The first edition of this book was published in 1982. Since long all the
copies are exhausted but there is still public demand for this book.
Hence the second edition is being published in 1989 with further
corrections and additions.

An article titled, “Who were the killers of Imam Husayn (a.s)” is added
in this edition. It was first published in the Muharram issue of
Sarfaraz Journal (Urdu) of 1954/1974.

The typographical mistakes remaining in the first edition have been
corrected. May Allah not allow more mistakes to remain in it.

Although to remain free of errors is only for the infallibles.

My first writing on “Karbala’ Shinasi” (Understanding Karbala’) was a
short article that I had written on the aim of Martyrdom and it was most
probably published in the Muharram issue of Sarfaraz Journal of 1946. If
before going to the press we are able to locate that article, it would
also be included in this book. Otherwise, Insha Allah[^1] it would be
reserved for the next edition. And there is no Tawfeeq[^2] except from
Allah.
