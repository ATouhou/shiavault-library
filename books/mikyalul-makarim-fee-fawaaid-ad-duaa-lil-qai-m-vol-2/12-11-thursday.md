11. Thursday
============

“The importance of praying for the reappearance of our master, Imam
az-Zaman (aj) can be seen from what the renowned Sayyid (Ibne Tawoos)
has written in Jamaal al-Usboo. He writes, ‘From the duties of Thursday,
it is recommended to send blessings on the Holy Prophet (S) a thousand
times, and it is recommended that one should say:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد وعجل فرجهم
  </p>
</blockquote>

O Allah, bless Muhammad and the progeny of Muhammad and hasten their
reappearance.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد، وعجل فرجهم، وأهلك عدوهم من الجن والانس من
الأولين والآخرين.
  </p>
</blockquote>

O Allah, bless Muhammad and the progeny of Muhammad and hasten their
reappearance. And destroy their enemies, from the Jinns and humans; from
the first and the last.[^1]

Further endorsement of what we have said also lies in the traditions
which state that it is the day when our deeds are presented before the
Messenger of Allah (S) and the infallible, holy Imams (as). According to
some other traditions, on this day, Imam (as) prays for his Shias and
followers.

I say: Hence, it is appropriate for a believer that he suffices for his
master, helps him in his invocation treading on his path, and in
conformity with his Imam’s deeds. Traditions concerning presentation of
deeds to the Messenger of Allah (S) and the Holy Imams (as) are in
abundance, as mentioned in Usool Kafi, Basairud Darajaat and Tafseer
al-Burhan etc.[^2] However we have refrained from quoting them as it
would prolong the discussion.
