Preface
=======

Our former discussion was about the meaning of the historical or social
evolution of man in the past. We-examined the question whether the
processes which man and his society have undergone may be called
evolution or at least progress, or whether there is a third alternative
explanation that in some aspects of social life considerable progress
has been made, while in other aspects there has been no progress or
evolution. Or we may, at least, say that if there has been progress it
has been very slow and out of harmony with the rate of progress in
technical matters and evolution of social structure. The dimension in
which man has not been able to make proportionate advance is the human
dimension of social life.

If we liken man's social life to an individual human being, technical
progress and social development may be thought of as the body of
society, while the human aspect of social life is the ethos of the
individual. We may conclude, therefore, that humanity has physically
overgrown, while its spirit and human ethos have made very little
headway. The divergence between various views concerning the future is
rooted in this matter.
