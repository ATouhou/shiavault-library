89. Getting the highest stations of martyrs
===========================================

Among the effects of this *Dua* is that one would become eligible for
the highest stations of martyrs in *Qiyamat*. It is mentioned in
*Minhajur Rishaad*from His Eminence, Abul Hasan Moosa bin Ja’far (as) in
a tradition:

“…Among the highest levels of the martyrs on the Judgment Day are for
those who have helped the Almighty Allah and His Messenger in their
absence and those who have defended Allah and His Messenger.”

I say: The point of evidence derived from this tradition is that as we
have mentioned a number of times, praying for an early reappearance of
our master, the Master of the Time (aj) and helping him is same as
helping the Messenger of Allah (S).
