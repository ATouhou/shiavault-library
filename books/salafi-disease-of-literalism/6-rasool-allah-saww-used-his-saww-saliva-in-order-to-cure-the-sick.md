Rasool Allah [saww] Used His [saww] Saliva in Order To Cure the Sick
====================================================================

Narrated Sahl:

On the day (of the battle) of Khaibar the Prophet said, "Tomorrow I
will give the flag to somebody who will be given victory (by Allah) and
who loves Allah and His Apostle and is loved by Allah and His Apostle."
So, the people wondered all that night as to who would receive the flag
and in the morning everyone hoped that he would be that person. Allah's
Apostle asked, "Where is 'Ali?"

He was told that 'Ali was suffering from eye-trouble, so he applied
saliva to his eyes and invoked Allah to cure him. He at once got cured
as if he had no ailment. The Prophet gave him the flag. 'Ali said,
"Should I fight them till they become like us (i.e. Muslim)?" The
Prophet said, "Go to them patiently and calmly till you enter the land.
Then, invite them to Islam, and inform them what is enjoined upon them,
for, by Allah, if Allah gives guidance to somebody through you, it is
better for you than possessing red camels."

Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52, Number 253

Narrated Yazid bin Abi Ubaid:

I saw the trace of a wound in Salama's leg. I said to him, "O Abu
Muslim! What is this wound?" He said, "This was inflicted on me on the
day of Khaibar and the people said, 'Salama has been wounded.' Then I
went to the Prophet and he puffed his saliva in it (i.e. the wound)
thrice., and since then I have not had any pain in it till this hour."

comments on Salafi scholarship?

Narrated Thumama:

Anas said, "Um Sulaim used to spread a leather sheet for the Prophet
and he used to take a midday nap on that leather sheet at her home."
Anas added, "When the Prophet had slept, she would take some of his
sweat and hair and collect it (the sweat) in a bottle and then mix it
with Suk (a kind of perfume) while he was still sleeping. "When the
death of Anas bin Malik approached, he advised that some of that Suk be
mixed with his Hanut (perfume for embalming the dead body), and it was
mixed with his Hanut.

Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 74, Number 298 Taking benefits from the places
of Standing of the Prophets Allah says in Qur'an about the benefit of
standing place of Ibrahim (as):

<p dir="rtl">
فِيهِ آيَاتٌ بَيِّـنَاتٌ مَّقَامُ إِب'رَاهِيمَ وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ
آمِنًا وَلِلّهِ عَلَى النَّاسِ حِجُّ ال'بَي'تِ مَنِ اس'تَطَاعَ إِلَي'هِ
سَبِيلاً وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ الله غَنِيٌّ عَنِ ال'عَالَمِينَ
</p>

[Pickthal 3:97] Wherein are plain memorials (of Allah's guidance); the
place where Abraham stood up to pray; and whosoever entereth it is safe.
And pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto Allah for mankind,

And Allah also tells in Qur'an about the Samari, who took benefit from
the dust, from where Jibrael (as) passed away. When Samari put that mud
into the idol of calf (which he made himself), that idol started
speaking due to the sacred blessing of that dust. Allah tells us in the
Qur'an:

<p dir="rtl">
قَالَ بَصُر'تُ بِمَا لَم' يَب'صُرُوا بِهِ فَقَبَض'تُ قَب'ضَةً مِّن'
أَثَرِ الرَّسُولِ فَنَبَذ'تُهَا وَكَذَلِكَ سَوَّلَت' لِي نَف'سِي
</p>

[Pickthal 20:96] He (Samiri) said: I perceived what they perceive not,
so I seized a handful from the footsteps of the messenger (Jibrael), and
then threw it in.

Note: Almost all the Ahadith of Rasool Allah (saww) inform us that this
messenger was Jibrael (as). Please also note that Maulana Maudoodi
contrary to almost all other "Muafassirin" from 1st century up till this
14th century, refused to accept that the Barakah in footsteps of Jibrael
(as) here (while this thing goes against the Salafi Doctrine). But
Qur'an and Prophetic Ahadith are so much clear that even Saudi Published
Urdu Qur'an also accepted the Barakah in the footsteps of Jibrael
(as).

And also when one blind Sahabi asked Rasool Allah [saww] to pray in one
part of his house, so that he can take that place as place of worship
and attain benefit from it's barakah.

Narrated Mahmuid bin Rabi' Al-Ansari:

'Itban bin Malik used to lead his people (tribe) in prayer and was a
blind man, he said to Allah's Apostle , "O Allah's Apostle! At times it
is dark and flood water is flowing (in the valley) and I am blind man,
so please pray at a place in my house so that I can take it as a Musalla
(praying place)." So Allah's Apostle went to his house and said, "Where
do you like me to pray?" 'Itban pointed to a place in his house and
Allah's Apostle, offered the prayer there Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 11,
Number 636 See also:

2. Malik's Muwatta book 9, Number 9.24.89

And also the Sahaba used to get benefit of Barakah by the house in
which Rasool Allah [saww] entered.

Narrated Abu Burda: When I came to Medina. I met Abdullah bin Salam. He
said, "Will you come to me so that I may serve you with sawiq (i.e.
powdered barley) and dates, and let you enter a (blessed) house in which
the Prophet entered?

Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 58, Number 159 Sahaba seeking help/benefit in
need from hands of Rasool Allah [saww] The first hadith Imam Ahmad
related from Anas ibn Malik in his Musnad is:

"The whole Community of the people of Madina used to take the hand of
the Prophet and rush to obtain their need with it." Ahmad Musnad 3:98

Narrated 'Aisha:

The Prophet, during his fatal ailment used to blow (on his hands and
pass them) over his body while reciting the Mu'auwidhat (Surat-an-Nas
and Surat-al-Falaq). When his disease got aggravated, I used to recite
them for him and blow (on his hands) and let him pass his hands over his
body because of its blessing. (Ma'mar asked Ibn Shihab: How did he use
to do Nafth? He said: He used to blow on his hands and then pass them
over his face.)

Umm Aban, daughter of al-Wazi ibn Zari narrated that her grandfather
Zari al-Abdi, who was a member of the deputation of Abd al-Qays, said:
"When we came to Medina, we raced to be first to dismount and kiss the
hand and foot of Allah's Apostle... (to the end of the hadith)" Abu
Dawud, 41: 5206

al-Tabarani in al-Awsat and al-Kabir (4:16), and Imam Ahmad in his
Musnad (5:67-68) with a sound chain as stated by al-Haythami in
al-Zawa'id (4:211) narrated through Handhalah Ibn Hudhaym that the
latter went with his grandfather, Hudhaym, to the Prophet.

Hudhaym said to the Messenger of Allah: "I have sons and grandsons,
some of whom are pubescent and others still children." Motioning to the
young child next to him, he said: "This is the youngest." The Prophet
brought this young child whose name was Handhalah next to him, wiped on
his head, and told him, "barakallahu fik," which means: "May Allah bless
you." After that, people started to bring Handhalah a person with a
swollen face or a sheep with a swollen udder. Handhalah would place his
hand on that part of his head the Prophet wiped, then touch the swollen
part and say Bismillah, and the swelling would be cured.
