11: Hud (hud)
=============

This chapter contains 123 late Meccan verses, except for vv. 12,17 and
114 which date from Madina. They are arranged in ten sections. The
chapter was revealed after the previous one on Jonah 10 and is thus the
second in the A. L. R. series; it likewise precedes the next one on
Joseph 12.

Hud was an ancient prophet who was sent to the nation of \`Ad which
lived in southern Arabia along the Indian Ocean. His story begins at v.
50 in section V, following that of Noah (III-IV). The chapter also
mentions two other Arabian prophets at length, Shu'ayb (VIII) and Salih
(OR Methusaleh in Genesis 5:25-27 in the Old Testament) (VI); and then
Abraham (VII), Lot (VII) and Moses (IX).

A quality of " Mercy, " God's essential rah ma, flows through this
chapter as each prophet's message to his own people comes up in turn
(II, III,, VI, VIII). These parallel stories which contrast the Arabian
prophets with the strictly Biblical or Hebrew ones show us they are
meant to be analogies.

Judgment comes at the end of section ix.
