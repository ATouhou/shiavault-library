Commentary : Verse 48
=====================

(48) وَ يَقُولُونَ مَتى‏ هذَا الْوَعْدُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صادِقينَ

48."They say:'When will this promise be, if you are truthful'"

**Commentary :**

The idolaters, ridiculing the prophets(a.s.), used to ask them that if
they were right, when the time would come for Allah's punishment. This
humiliating way of asking questions was a sort of reinforcement for
those individuals who might be affected by them. However, in order to
realize that an action will occur, should one necessarily know it's
timing.

The verse says:

" They say: 'When will this promise be, if you are truthful ?"


**Commentary : Verse 49**

(49) قُلْ لا أَمْلِكُ لِنَفْسي‏ ضَرًّا وَ لا نَفْعاً إِلاَّ ما شاءَ
اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلٌ إِذا جاءَ أَجَلُهُمْ فَلا يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ
ساعَةً وَ لا يَسْتَقْدِمُون

49. " Say: 'I do not possess any harm or profit for myself except as
Allah wills. To every people is a term appointed. When their term comes,
then they shall neither put(it)off an hour, nor hasten(it). '"

**Commentary :**

Facing this question, Allah orders His Prophet to provide them with an
answer in several ways. The first step is that he should tell them that
the timing for such a thing is not at his disposal. He is not the author
or proprietor of any profit or loss for himself(much less for
them)except those ordained or predetermined by Him. The verse says:

" Say: 'I do not possess any harm or profit for myself except as Allah
wills. ..."

Muhammad(p.b.u.h.) should announce that he is His sole and only
Messenger and Prophet. It is He who fixes the timing of the punishment
which is within His power.

The above sentence alludes to the unity of actions which pre- supposes
that all and every thing in this world eventually returns to Him, and
when deviators are being punished with His justice, it is He Who sets
the course of action.

Obviously, this does not contradict the stipulation that Allah has
bestowed upon us powers and abilities by which we are entitled to partly
gain or lose and to be able to make decisions regarding our own
destiny.

Then, the Qur'an, referring to another issue, declares that each
community and every tribe has a predetermined time of death and a point
of its termination, which, when it comes, there will be no delay or
advancement in its occurrence. The verse continues saying:

"... To every people is a term appointed. When their term comes, then
they shall neither put(it)off an hour, nor hasten(it). '"

In fact, the Qur'an warns the polytheists not to hasten and jump unduly
to conclusions. When the timing of their death comes no delays or
advances will happen.


**Commentary : Verse 50**

(50) قُلْ أَ رَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَتاكُمْ عَذابُهُ بَياتاً أَوْ نَهاراً ما
ذا يَسْتَعْجِلُ مِنْهُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ

50. " Say: 'Have you considered If His punishment comes upon you by
night or by day, what portion of it will the sinners wish to hasten ?"

**Commentary :**

The Qur'an raises the third answer in this verse. It orders the
Prophet(p.b.u.h.) to tell the infidels that it is not improbable for
Allah's punishment to come to them during the day- time or at night.
Then, are they in a position to repel such a sudden punishment from
themselves ? The verse says:

" Say: 'Have you considered If His punishment comes upon you by night
or by day, what portion of it will the sinners wish to hasten ?"

In this case, under what pretexts do the culprits and sinners make
haste.

Upon this meaning, Sura An- Naml, No. 72, verse 17 says:

"And they say: 'when will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful
?"


**Commentary : Verse 51**

(51) أَ ثُمَّ إِذا ما وَقَعَ آمَنْتُمْ بِهِ آلْآنَ وَ قَدْ كُنْتُمْ
بِهِ تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ

51. " Is it when it(the punishment)comes to pass, you will believe in
it ? Ah! Now ? And you wanted(aforetime)to hasten it on ? "

**Commentary :**

The Qur'an provides the fourth answer for them in this noble verse,
asking them whether they intend to believe in Him once the punishment
emerges.(Faith established under such circumstances is fruitless). They
would be told implying that: 'Now, that the punishment has come, you
have faith and supplicate and you repent while before this you were
ridiculing and were hastily asking for the punishment. '

The verse says:

" Is it when it(the punishment)comes to pass, you will believe in it ?
Ah! Now ? And you wanted(aforetime)to hasten it on ? "


**Commentary : Verse 52**

(52) ثُمَّ قيلَ لِلَّذينَ ظَلَمُوا ذُوقُوا عَذابَ الْخُلْدِ هَلْ
تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ بِما كُنْتُمْ تَكْسِبُون

52. " Then it will be said to those who were unjust: 'Taste you the
enduring punishment! Are you requited aught save what you used to earn
?"

**Commentary :**

Those who have oppressed themselves will be told on the Day of
Resurrection that they should suffer eternal punishment in the Hereafter
following their sufferings afflictions in the world. The verse
declares:

" Then it will be said to those who were unjust: 'Taste you the
enduring punishment! Are you requited aught save what you used to earn
?"

It signifies that they have been called to accept the truth and they
have been guided, after firm proofs were offered to them, removing all
their pretexts and excuses.

They will be told that: they kept on insisting upon their infidelity
and denial, and not abandoning their misleading course. Now, it is time
for they to receive punishment for their acts.

The reason why the term "taste" has been employed in connection with
suffering punishment is that this sense has a stronger effect on man
than the other senses.


**Commentary : Verse 53**

(53) وَ يَسْتَنْبِئُونَكَ أَ حَقٌّ هُوَ قُلْ إي وَ رَبِّي إِنَّهُ
لَحَقٌّ وَ ما أَنْتُمْ بِمُعْجِزينَ

53. " And they ask you to inform them saying: 'Is that true ? Say:
'You! by my Lord! Verily it is the truth; and you cannot
frustrate(Him)'. "

**Commentary :**

The words in the foregoing holy verses were about the punishment and
suffering of the wrongdoers both in this world and in the world
hereafter. This verse also follows that same topic.

At first, the Qur'an implies that the wrongdoers and the idolaters
regard the Prophet(p.b.u.h.) with astonishment as to whether the promise
of the divine punishment in this world and the Hereafter is true. The
verse says:

"And they ask you to inform them saying: 'Is that true ? ..."

Allah commands His Prophet(p.b.u.h.) to answer them emphatically saying
that his answer is positive and he swears by his Lord that this is a
reality and there is no doubt about it.

And if they think, they can escape the divine punishment, they have
committed a grave mistake, for they will never be able(to prevent it)and
make Him unable to act. The verse continues saying:

"... Say: 'You! by my Lord! Verily it is the truth; and you cannot
frustrate(Him)'. "
