Responsibility 88: Respecting Things Related to the Imam Part 3
===============================================================

Another responsibility of the true believers is to honor the specific
times, days and nights which are related to the Imam.

For example, on the days of ‘Eid which include: ‘Eid al-Qurban; ‘Eid
al-Ghadir, ‘Eid al-Fitr, the 15th of Sha’ban (the birth anniversary of
the Imam), the days which mark the birth or the martyrdom of each of his
pure forefathers, the day of Nawruz which marks the (solar) new year;
the Hajj season; the Day of ‘Ashura, the night preceeding and the day of
Jumu’ah, and the nights of Qadr in the month of Ramaďhan, must all be
respected and honored.

In these time periods, it is incumbent upon a true believer to pay
special attention to the Imam and more than other people, one should
strive to fulfill the rights of the Imam which are related to these
specific times.

As for how one can show honor and veneration to some of these time
periods, this shall be mentioned in later sections. However generally
speaking, respecting the times which are related to the Imam can be
carried out in various ways such as performing the specific acts of
worship which have been mentioned in the traditions.

The etiquette which each of these time periods have related to them has
been mentioned in the books of traditions and Du’a, and these should be
followed by the true believers. Therefore, the supplications and Ziyarat
which have been mentioned to be read at specific times should be
performed in order to fulfill this responsibility.
