Lesson 22 : Sources of the Shari’a
==================================

**1. The Qur’an & the Sunna of the Prophet**

The Muslims during the days of Prophet Muhammad lived by the shari’a by
following the Qur’an and the sunna. Sunna means the example of the
Prophet.

(Sunna is sometimes written as ‘sunnat’.) Was not the Qur’an enough on
its own? The Qur’an is a book of guidance which was sent for the entire
human world till the end of time. As such, it only deals with the
general issues and mentions only the basic principles underlying the
Muslim way of life.

The Qur’an is more like a constitution than a book of law. The deals
were left to the Prophet.

The Qur’an itself clearly explained this relationship between the
Prophet and itself in the following verses:

He raised up among the common people a Messenger from among themselves
to recite to them His revelations, to purify them, and to teach them the
Book and the wisdom. (62:2)

And We have revealed, to you (O Muhammad) the Reminder (that is, the
Qur’an) so you may clarify to the people what has been revealed to them,
and so that they may reflect. (16:44)

These two verses definitely prove that Prophet Muhammad was not just a
‘mail-man’ whose only job was to deliver the Qur’an to us. He was a
teacher and a commentator of the Qur’an. Even his actions are a source
of guidance for Muslims:

You have a good example in Allah’s Messenger for whosoever hopes for
God and the last day, and remembers God oft. (33:21)

The obedience to the Prophet has been considered as the proof of loving
Allah:

Say (O Muhammad), ‘If you love Allah, then follow me; (if you do so)
Allah will love you and forgive for you your sins.’ (3:31) To show the
importance of obeying the Prophet, Allah further says: Whoever obeys the
Prophet has surely obeyed Allah, (4:80)

The Qur’an is not only silent on the details of things which can change
over time, it is also silent on the rules of worship which can never
change. For example, the Qur’an in twenty-five different places commands
the Muslims to say the daily prayers (salat), but not once has Allah
explained how the Muslims are to say their prayers.

(The only exception to this statement is that of salatu ‘lkhawf, the
prayer said in a battle-field or when one is in danger.) This silence on
the part of the Qur’an, I believe, was for the specific purpose of
forcing the people to go to the Prophet, ask him for details and follow
his example.

**2. The Example of the Imams**

After the Prophet’s death, the Muslims were very much divided on the
issue of leadership. This gave birth to the two groups known as the
Shi’a and the Sunnis. The Shi’a lived by the shari’a by following the
Qur’an, and the sunna of the Prophet and of the Imams.

The sunna, in Shi’a definition, means “the sayings, deeds and silent
approval of the Prophet and the twelve infallible Imams of Ahlu
“l-bayt.”

Although the issue of the leadership has already been discussed in
another lesson in Part One, I would like to mention one reason why the
Imams of Ahlu 1-bayt are preferable as the source of the sharia than
anyone else.

The Muslims of the early days realized the importance of the Prophet’s
sunna and started to memorize his sayings known as hadith. Later
generations preserved the saying they had heard from the companions of
the Prophet in the books of hadith.

Even the actions of the Prophet, observed by his companions, were
preserved in writing. But this process of preserving the sunna of the
Prophet “was not immune from mistakes and forgery.

Many sayings were invented and wrongfully attributed to the Prophet
during the early period of the Islamic history, especially during the
Umayyid era.

At times, the rulers bribed the companions to fabricate ‘hadith1 in
their favour and/or against their opponents. At other times, some people
invented ‘hadith’ for apparently good causes not realizing that they
were using the wrong means of trying to make people more religious!

Abu ‘Ismah, Faraj bin Abi Maryam al-Marwazi was asked: “From where have
you got all these traditions narrated through ‘Ikrimah, from Ibn ‘Abbas,
from the Prophet, describing the reward of reciting each and every surah
(chapter) of the Qur’an?”

He said, “I found people interested only in the fiqh of Abu Hanifah and
maghazi of Ibn Ishaq; therefore, I forged these ahadith for the pleasure
of God to bring them back to the Qur’an.”

In this background of the early development of hadlth, we must find an
authentic and informed source for the sunna of the Prophet.

When you look at the Muslims of the Prophet’s days, you can find no one
who was more knowledgeable, informed, reliable and closer to the Prophet
than the Ahlu 1-bayt, the family of the Prophet: Fatimah, ‘Ali and their
sons.

After all, it is the Qur’an which testifies to their spiritual purity
of the highest form by saying: “Verily Allah intends to purify you, O
the Ahlu ‘l-bayt, a thorough purification.” (33:33) Combine this verse
about the Ahlu ‘1-bayt’s purity with the following: “It is the holy
Qur’an in a preserved tablet, none shall touch it but the purified
ones.” (56:79)

The real sense of this verse is that the Qur’an which is “in a
preserved tablet” is not accessible to anyone except those who are
purified by Allah. This shows that the Ahlu ‘1-bayt could understand the
Qur’an better than any other Muslim.

It is for this very reason that Allah commanded His Messenger to ask
the people to love his Ahlu 1-bayt: Say (O Muhammad), ‘I do not ask from
you any reward (for teaching Islam to you) except to love my near ones.’
(42:23)

This love was made obligatory because it would automatically entail
obedience of those whom one loves. If the Ahlu ‘1-bayt were not
truthful, reliable, and worthy of following, would Allah command us to
love them?

These few verses of the holy Qur’an are enough to show that the best
commentators of the Qur’an and the most authentic source for the
Prophet’s sunna are the Imams of Ahlu ‘1-bayt.

The Prophet himself said, “I am leaving among you two worthy things. As
long as you hold fast on to them both, you will never go astray after
me. One is greater than the other: the Book of Allah (which is a rope
suspended from the heaven to the earth) and my descendants, my Ahlu
‘1-bayt.

They will not separate from each other until they come to me at the
(fountain of) Kawthar (in the hereafter). Therefore, see how you
recompense me by the way you deal with them.”

This is not the place to discuss the authenticity of this hadith, but
it will suffice to quote Ibn Hajar al-Makki, a famous Sunni
polemicist.

After recording this hadlth from various companions who had heard it
from the Prophet at various places and times, Ibn Hajar says, “And there
is no contradiction in these [numerous reports] since there was nothing
to prevent the Prophet from repeating [this statement] at those various
places because of the importance of the holy Book and the pure
Family.”2

We can conclude from these verses and the hadith mentioned above that
the Ahlu 1-bayt are the divinely appointed commentators of the Qur’an,
and the most authentic and the best source for the sunna. It is for this
reason that we prefer them to all other sources.

Even when we quote a hadith from the Imams of Ahlu ‘1-bayt, it is
actually the hadith of the Prophet which they have preserved as the true
successors of the last Messenger of God. Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.),
the sixth Shi’ite Imam, says:

My hadith is the hadith of my father, the hadith of my father is that
of my grandfather, the hadith of my grandfather is that of Husayn [bin
‘Ali], the hadlth of Husayn is that of Hasan [bin ‘Ali], the hadlth of
Hasan is that of Amiru ‘1-mu’minin [‘Ali bin Abi 2Ibn Hajar al-Makki.
as-Sawa’iqu ‘l-Muhriqah, chapter 11. section 1..

Talib], the hadith of Amiru ‘1-mu’minm is that of the Messenger of God
(s.a.w.), and the hadith of the Messenger is a statement of Allah, the
Almighty, the Great.”3

The historical circumstances did not allow the opportunity to the first
three Imams of Ahlu 1-bayt to formally teach and train their followers
in the matters of the shari’a. It was after the tragedy of Karbala that
the Imams, especially the fifth and the sixth Imams, got the opportunity
to formally train their followers in the shari’a laws.

The training by these Imams actually laid the foundation for the
development of ijtihad among the Shi’as after the occultation of the
twelfth Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi (a.s.).

During the Minor Occultation (ghaybat) of the Present Imam, it was
still possible for the Shi’as to present their problems to the Imam
through his specially appointed representatives. These representatives
were ‘Uthman bin Said al-Amri (260-265 AH), Muhammad bin ‘Uthman
al-’Amri (265-305 AH), Husayn bin Ruh (305-326 AH), and ‘All bin
Muhammad al-Samiri (326-329 AH).

However, after the Imam went into the Major Occultation, the problems
of the shari’a were resolved through the process known as ijtihad and
taqlid—the two most important ways of living by the shari’a.

Ijtihad, in Shi’a jurisprudence, means “the process of deriving the
laws of shari’a from its sources.” A person who can do ijtihad is known
as a “mujtahid”. Taqlid means “to follow the mujtahid in the laws of
shari’a.”
