Introduction To Applications of Two Tendencies By Way of Criticism and Narration
================================================================================

Under this heading, we shall dwell on indications drawn with a motive of
creating Islamic unity. However it has become a ground for serious
criticism because of the standards of evaluation output.**[1]** It is of
such a nature that we cannot see any religious origin in it; nor could
it be turned into a religious thought. However in a particular period of
time they might have shown a very good ability towards creating Islamic
unity.

We shall introduce each of these indications. We shall treat the
analysis done by religious scholars as source pertaining to second
tendency.

These analyses are collected here to show correct outlooks and to
scrutinize insincere writings.

**[1]** As our aim in this writing is identification of all types of
conjectures that are being spread and to warn about them we have
presented the actual quotations that mention those conjectures so that
readers may gain complete information about them. It is also important
to remember that acceptance of any of these propagated views is related
to a type of acceptance of all other conjectures, so we must not be
careless of any of these things. (The arrangement of Criticism and
Scrutiny of these conjectures is done according to this relationship).
