***In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

This Surah was revealed in Mecca and contains sixty nine verses. The
names of some of Suras such as Al-Baqarah Al-Fil, An-Naml, and An-Nahl,
have been taken from the names of the animals which are mentioned
somehow in these verses.

In verse No. 41 of this Surah, the construction of Polytheism is counted
the frailest building like the house of spider and, thus, this Surah has
been nominated as Surah ‘Ankabut.

This Surah speaks about a few subjects, such as: Faith, the man’s duty,
the Divine trial, the history of some prophets, prohibition of unfair
disputes, and relying on other than Allah.

The Virtue of Surah ‘Ankabut
----------------------------

Majma‘-ul-Bayan narrates a noble tradition from the holy Prophet (S) who
said:

*“Whoever recites Surah ‘Ankabut will have ten good rewards as the
number of all believers and hypocrites.”*
