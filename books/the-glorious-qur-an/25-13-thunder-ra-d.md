13: Thunder (ra'd)
==================

These 43 verses arranged in six sections are mostly late Meccan,
although some date from Madina. The chapter was revealed after Muhammad
47 and before The Mercy-giving 55. It has " A. L. M. R. "for its
initials, almost like the second, third and twenty-ninth to
thirty-second chapters.

The law of consequences is stated here, and in section III we are told
who will go to Heaven and who to Hell. We are warned against other
failings that may lead us astray.
