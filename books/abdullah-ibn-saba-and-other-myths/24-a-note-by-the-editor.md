A Note by the Editor
====================

I am honored to have had the pleasure to review, edit, and compare the
English translation of Truth Behind Fiction, Abdullah Bin Saba (a study
in the early history of Islam), with the Persian translation.

Special thanks are due to Mr. Muhammad â€˜Alavi, who kindly read a few
chapters, and compared them with the original Arabic text.

Some sections were altered with minor changes and some others were
either revised or completely retranslated.

It is our sincere hope, that this study will induce and encourage some
Western scholars, to do a more thorough research in other matters and
periods, finding out the truth behind myth which has prevailed for many
centuries.

Hossein Saheb.
