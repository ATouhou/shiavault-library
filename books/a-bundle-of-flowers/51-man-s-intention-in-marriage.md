Man's Intention in Marriage
===========================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "He who marries a woman only for her beauty
(regardless of her Faith), he will not see (gain) what he likes; and he
who marries a woman only for her wealth, Allah will leave him with that
wealth only. Therefore, it is to you that you look for a religious
wife."

The Holy Prophet (S) said: He who marries a woman for her wealth, Allah

woman for her religion, Allah will gather those merits for him."

Al-Tahthib, vol. 7, p. 399

wealth may cause her disobedience; but marry a religious woman for her
Faith."
