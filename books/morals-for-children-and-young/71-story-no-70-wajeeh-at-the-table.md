Story no. 70: Wajeeh at the table
=================================

Whenever Wajeeh sat at the table and started to eat food, he did not say
Bismillah and did not thank God after meals.  
 One day his brother, Najeeb said “Don’t you see that before Mom and Dad
begin to eat they say Bismillah and at the end of it they say Alhamdu
lillah?  
 Wajeeh replied “Why do they do so?  
 His brother said “They say so because all these vegetables, fruits,
bread, water and everything else is gifted to us by God. So it is very
good if we start and end food with his name”.  
 And other tan that, the leaders of Islam have always requested us to
say this and we must obey them.
