Question 25: Circumcision
=========================

**Question:** What is the philosophy of circumcision with reference to
personal hygiene?

**Answer:** The answer to this question is absolutely clear, because:

(1)    Many people who are not circumcised have a lot of smegma in their
foreskin and circumcision is the remedy to this problem.

(2)    Statistics show that those who are not circumcised are more prone
to the Cancer of penis. However it should be kept in mind that, those
infants who are circumcised very early the wound could remain on the tip
of their penis if it is not attended to properly the urine tube becomes
very narrow. So care should be taken that these children along with
getting the benefit of this religious ritual, should not be subjected to
agony and suffering which is possible due to negligence.
