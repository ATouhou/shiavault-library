GENEROSITY
Mahatma Gandhi went from city to city, village to village collecting
funds for

the Charkha Sangh. During one of his tours he addressed a meeting in
Orissa.

After his speech a poor old woman got up. She was bent with age, her
hair

was grey and her clothes were in tatters. The volunteers tried to stop
her,

but she fought her way to the place where Gandhi Ji was sitting.

“I must see him,” she insisted and going up to Gandhi Ji touched his
feet.

Then from the folds of her sari she brought out a copper coin and placed
it at his feet. Gandhi Ji

picked up the copper coin and put it away carefully. The Charkha Sangh
funds were under the

charge of Jamnalal Bajaj. He asked Gandhi Ji for the coin but Gandhi Ji
refused.

“I keep cheques worth thousands of rupees for the Charkha Sangh,”
Jamnalal Bajaj said laughingly

“yet you won’t trust me with a copper coin.” “This copper coin is worth
much more than those

thousands” Gandhi Ji said. “If a man has several lakhs and he gives away
a thousand or two,

it doesn’t mean much.”

But this coin was perhaps all that the poor woman  "Overlook and forgive
the weakness of

possessed. She gave me all she had. That was very  generous people,
because if they fall

down, Allah gives his hand in their hands

generous of her. What a great sacrifice she made. That is

and helps them…." Imam Ali (AS)

why I value this copper coin more than a crore of rupees.
