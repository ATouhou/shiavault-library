Kumayl bin Ziyad
================

On Thursday night, the Muslims finish the night prayers. They sit down
in lines. They implore Allah, the Merciful Creator, to forgive them
their sins. They ask Him to be pleased with them.

Sweet words flow out of the mosque minarets. The words fly high in the
clear sky full of stars:

*Allah, I implore You with Your mercy that has included everything,*

*And with Your power with which you have overcome everything,*

*And everything has yielded to it...*
