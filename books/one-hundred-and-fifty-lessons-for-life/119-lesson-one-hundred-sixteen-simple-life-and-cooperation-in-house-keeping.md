Lesson One Hundred Sixteen: Simple Life And Cooperation In House-Keeping
========================================================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كانَ عَلِىٌّ عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ يَحْتَطِبُ وَ يَسْتَقِى وَيَكْنِسُ وَ
كانَتْ فاطِمَةُ تَطْحَنُ وَ تَعْجِنُ وَ تَخْبِزُ!
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

‘Ali (a.s.) collected wood (for his home) from the desert and fetched
water and did the cleaning, and Fatima (a.s.) made flour, and kneaded it
and baked bread.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

A world of magnificence of spirit and high human rank is hidden in this
short tradition in respect of the great leader of Islam, Imam ‘Ali
(a.s.) and the role model for women, Fatima (a.s.) . Their life was very
simple and independent but full of sincerity, purity, co-operation and
assistance. Work was not a dishonor. Cooperation and understanding was
considered a basic privilege and non-adornment was much admired. This
lifestyle is no longer found in the homes these days and, consequently,
tranquility and peace have disappeared.
