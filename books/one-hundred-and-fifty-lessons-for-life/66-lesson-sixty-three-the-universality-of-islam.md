Lesson Sixty Three: The Universality of Islam
=============================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لا يَبْقَى عَلَى ظَهْرِ الأَرْضِ بَيْتُ مَدَر وَ لا وَبَر إلاّ
أَدْخَلَهُ اللّهُ كَلِمَةَ الإِسْلامِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

There will not remain any house on the earth, not even mud houses and
woollen tents, that will not be filled by Allah with the religion of
Islam

Brief Description
-----------------

Everyday this reality becomes more obvious , i.e., that the world has
two alternatives: either it will accept Islam, or it will not accept any
religion. And since being without a religion is against man’s nature, it
shall finally accept Islam. At present a wave of attention to Islam has
permeated different parts of the world.

But this matter would be accomplished upon the advent of Imam Mahdi (may
our soul be sacrificed for him). Thereupon, idolatry and polytheism
would be removed from the earth and Islam will prevail throughout the
world. The Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) has given the
good tiding in the above tradition.
