Responsibility 53: Assisting the Imam Part 5
============================================

Another responsibility is to recite Du’a al-Nur[^1]. This supplication
has been narrated from the A\`immah of the Ahlul Bayt (as) and is a
prayer which is found in many of the reliable books of supplication.

It has been narrated that Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad as-Sadiq (as) said:
“Any person who makes a promise with Allah with this du’a for forty
mornings will be among the helpers of our Qa\`im (ajtf).

If that person is to die before the return of the Imam, then Allah the
High will bring him forth from his grave (to help the Imam). For every
letter of this pact, one thousand good deeds will be written in the
person’s book of records and one thousand sins will be erased.”[^2]

This supplication has been mentioned in responsibility forty-eight.
