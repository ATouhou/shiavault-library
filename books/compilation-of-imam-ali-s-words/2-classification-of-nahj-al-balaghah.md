Classification of Nahj Al-balaghah
==================================

Nahj al-Balaghah is a vast and deep ocean of knowledge that cannot be
fathomed easily. Although scholars and researchers have tried to delve
into this ocean of wonder, they have not yet succeeded in fully locating
or comprehending the pearls of knowledge that the words of Imam 'Ali
contain.

The topics or subjects of this immensely rich book are so broad and
varied that they cannot be easily enumerated. Thus, those who have
focused their research on Nahj al-Balaghah, have endeavoured to identify
the subjects of this book to their best ability, yet it could be said
that they have succeeded fully in their efforts. Some of the prominent
efforts made in this field are as follows:

A. Martyr Murtaza Mutahhari says in his valuable book "Sayri dar Nahj
al-Balaghah", that there are quite many subjects and topics in this book
which could be broadly defined as follows: 25

1. Theology and the Supernatural / Ilahiyyat wa Mawara ' al-Tabi'ah
2. Manners and Worship / Suluk wa Ibadat
3. Government and Justice / Hakumat wa Idalat
4. World and worldliness / Dunya wa Dunya-Parasti
5. Epic and Bravery / Hamasah wa Shaja'at
6. Poetical Saga and Mysteries / Malahim wa Maghibat
7. Supplications /Du'a wa Munajat
8. Criticism of People's Behaviour
9. Social Principles
10. Islam and Qur'an
11. Ethics and Self-Reform
12. Personalities

B. The Syrian Researcher, Labib Bayzun in his book, Tasnif Nahj
al-Balaghah has presented a more precise categorization in this regard.
Actually he has categorized the contents of Nahj al- Balaghah under nine
general definitions, each of which consists of several subjects -49 in
all- and each subject is made up of numerous specific topics numbering
376. His definitions are as follows:

1. Fundamentals of Religion / Usul al-Din
2. Practical Laws of Religion / Furu ' al-Din
3. Leadership and Leaders / al-Imamah wa al-Aimmah
4. Lifestyle of Imam 'Ali ( 'a) / Sirah al-Imam
5. Wars of the Imam during his caliphate / Hurub al-Imam
6. State Policy / Siyasah al-Dawlah
7. Social Affairs / al-Shu'un al-Ijtima'iyyah
8. Man and Personal Affairs / al-Insan wa Shu'unuh
9. Maxims and Advices / al-Mawa'iz wa al-Irshadat
C. In the book al-Dalil 'ala al-Mawzu 'at Nahj al-Balaghah 27 Nahj
al-Balaghah has been categorized into 7 broad definitions and 132
specific subjects. The definitions are as follows:

1. Divinity and Universe / al-Ilahiyyat wa al-Ka'inat
2. Prophethood / al-Nabuwwah
3. Fundamentals of Religion and Practical Laws / al-'Aqa'id wa
al-Ahkam

5. History / al-Tarikh
6. Society, Politics and Economy / al-Ijtima ' wa al-Siyasah wa
al-Iqtisad
7. Ethics / al-Akhlaq
D. Uways 'Abd al-Karim Muhammad in his book al-Mu'jam al-Mawzu'i li
Nahj al-Balaghah is critical of the methods used by earlier scholars to
classify Nahj al-Balaghah. He has pointed out the deficiency in their
approach and has categorized Nahj al- Balaghah into 22 sections, each of
which contains a number of subjects, which in turn cover many topics. He
has listed 604 topics in all.28 The 22 sections in which he has divided
the book are as follows

1. Wisdom and Knowledge / al-Aql wa al-Ilm
2. Islam, Faith, Certainty, Disbelief, Polytheism and Doubt /
al-islam wa al-Iman -wa al-Yaqin wa al-Kufr wa al-Shirk wa al-Shakk.
3. The Qur'an and the Prophet's Sunnah / al-Qur'an wa Sunnah
al-Nabawiyyah

The Characteristics of the Just and Rightly Guided Imam in Nahjul
Balagha
There is a famous tradition from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) recorded
by both - the Shias and the Ahle Sunnah traditionalists:
'One who dies without recognizing the Imam of his time, dies the death
of ignorance.'
This means that even if a person accepts and conforms to all the
Islamic beliefs and puts in practice all the edicts, but dies without
recognizing the Imam of his time, his death will be on ignorance and
apostasy. Such a person is condemned to eternal Hellfire regardless of
his deeds in this world. This is because good deeds will only benefit a
person provided his beliefs are correct, as espoused by the Quran and
traditions. Hence, any person, who wants to secure himself from the
raging fire of hell, should necessarily possess the recognition of the
Imam of his time and not simply rely on his worship and virtuous
deeds.
