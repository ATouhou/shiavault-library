Subject: Re: Ahl Al-sunnah and Ibn Taymiya
==========================================

Dear brothers,

as-Salamou alykum wa rahmatoullahi wa barakatouh,

I agree with brother Masud when he says that we can NOT rely on ibn
taymiyya in matters os aqueedah in the end part of his posting (I only
pur the beginning here above).

Someone was defending ibn taymiyya a few weeks, so please find a
contribution on this subject taken from the aqueedah of Ahl-es-Sunna wal
Jamaa (ashaira wa maturidiyya).

Assalamo Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu

Concerning the accusation of Ibn Taymiyyah that he attempted to ascribe
human qualities to Allah Subhana wa Ta'ala: Some of the people who lived
in the same era as Ibn Taymiyyah accused him of this and they had no
proof to back up their accusations whatsoever.

The people after them received this information from what Ibn Batutah
collected. As most of us know, Ibn Batutah was not a scholar either of
hadith OR aquidah. Besides, he never met nor heard Ibn Taymiyyah
speak.

The biography of Ibn Taymiyyah shows that he always strongly opposed
those people who attempted to ascribe human qualities to Allah Subhana
waTa'ala (See Hayat Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah by Muhammad
al-Baytar). You can find more proofs in Ibn Taymiyyah's book, Sharh
Hadith An-Nuzool (Commentary on the Hadith of Nuzool).

There are many proofs that Ibn Taymiyyah had the same be- lief and
aquidah as the Sahabah and the scholars of As-Salaf. To show just one
example: Ibn Taymiyyah says in his book, al-Aquidah al-Wasitiya, pg. 9,
...and

from the belief in Allah is the belief in what Allah ascribed for
himself in the Quran and in the Sunnah without falsifying or denying or
"takeef" (ie-to question how his attributes are). And he quotes this
ayah from the Quran, Sur- ah al-Shurah, Ayah 11:

...there is nothing whatsoever like unto Him and He is the one that
hears and sees.

And Ibn Taymiyyah explains that the Muslims from Ahl al-Sunnah wa
Jama'ah don't deny what Allah ascribed to Himself & don't falsify His
words. And they believe in all His names and ayat. And they don't make
comparisons between Allah and his creatures because there is nothing
like Him. And Allah knows best about everything and about Himself.

This is one of many examples that proves that Ibn Taymiyyah never
claimed "tashbeeh" (ie-never attempted to ascribe human qualities to
Allah). I read many of ibn taymiyya books and the books wrote by other
scholars to refute him. It is very clear that ibn taymiyya was refuted
by the majority of scholars.

he was accused not to belong to the Salafi school. I showed this in a
previous message and I will repost this message soon in sha'a Allah. The
scholars of Ahl eSunna wal Jamaa from the 4 schools refuted his opinions
and ibn taymiyya always tried to escape from punishment by saying the 2
shahadas.

ibn taymiyya and his disciple ibn aljawziyya (different from the great
hanbali scholar Ibn alJawzi) are not considered to belong to the salafi
school. ibn taymiyya was put in jail because of many of his wrong
teachings concerning the aqeeda. He was not put in jail by some tyranic
ruler.

He was put in jail to preserve the people from his ideas. (See Rihlat
Ibn Battoutah where ibn battoutah said: when i came to damascus there
was a man called ibn taymiyya speaking about religion science, but there
was something strange in his mind... Once he was doing "kutbat aljuma'a"
and he said yanzilou rabbuna ila assam'a adunya, then he went down two
steps on the minbar and he said "kanuzuli hatha" (like my descending).
the people of damascus jumped on him and wanted to kill him. al-'imam
al-mujtahid asSubkiy wrote many books to refute ibn taymiya.

This event of ibn Taymiya is registered by the bokks of history and
they are available and may be the Muslims need to read them or some of
their contents. Ibn Taymiyah was put in jail by the agreement of the
Muslim scholars of Egypt and ashSham. His imprisonment came as a result
of the ijma^ of the scholars of his age..

In addition, not only ibn battouta spoke about ibn taymiyya but a lot
of scholars wrote books and letters to warn the people from this man. i
have a long list of these Ulema and their books. I have a lot of their
books also.

Among the great Ulemas from ahl es-Sunna wal jama'a who refuted him and
decalred that his is out of the right way of islam:

1) "aSubki" in his "aRasae'l aSubkiyya firrad ala ibn taymiyya",
2) ibn hajar alhaytami, in al-Fatawa al-Hadithiyya
3) Abou hayyan alandaloussi in an-Nahr almaadd
4) ibn hajar alaskalani in fath albari page 410 fascicle 13 kitab
atawhid. from the 12th hegire century
5) Sheikh ahmad ibn Zayni dihlane in finat alwahhabiyya,
6) sheikh Muhammad ibn darwiche al-Hout from beirut in his book Rasail
fi akidat ahl-esunna waljamaa.
from the 20th century
7) sheikh muhammad Ouwayss from alAzhar in his book ibn taymiyya laysa
salafiyyan, and many others.

In fact, there are many sayings of ibn taymiyya related to TAJSIM, in
his own books. He pretended in his fatawa, (al-asma'a was-sifat) that
the ahl-esSunna wal Jamaa did not refute Mujassima (those who attributed
body to Allah).

He even said that there isn't any single text from the Salaf to refute
mujassima. While in fact, al-'imam Ahmad said that the person commits
kufr if he says Allah is a body (jism) even if he says that Allah is a
body not like other bodies (jism la kalajsam).

He was quoted saying that "The terms are taken from language and
al-'Islam and the people of language have put this term (body) on
something that has length, width, thickness, image, structure and
components and it was not narrated in ash-shari^ah (Islamic law).
Therefore, it is invalid and cannot be used" (end of quotation of Imam
Ahmad).

al-bayhaqiyy narrated that about Ahmad in his book manaqib Ahmad and
az-Zarkashiyy narrated the first saying of Ahmad. Notice that Ahmad did
not accept the term (body not like other bodies) because it does not
befit Allah and the language does not accept that. I also quoted the
saying of al-Imam al-Ash^ary from Kitab An-Nawader:

"If someone belives that Allah is a body then he ignores Allah and he
is a kafir".

To be continued..


In sha'a Allah

**Walid Dabbous**

**Ibn Taymiyyah:**

Ibn Taymiyah (d. 728/1328) was a theologian who was sent to the jail by
the consensus (Ijma'a) of prominent Sunni scholars of his time (in Egypt
and Damascus) because of his heretical beliefs.

He was considered an innovator and a heretic and some Sunni scholars
went so far as to declare his writings as Kufr. Now he has become a
Muslim scholar for Wahhabis! I don't want to go into the details of the
charges against Ibn Taymiyah which was raised by prominent Sunni
scholars about his heretical beliefs such as his idea that Allah has
limbs and these limbs are physical (Haqiqi) and so on since it needs
thousands of lines by itself.

Among those Sunni scholars who denounced him, are Taqi al-Din Subki,
Ibn Hajar al-Haythami, Ibn Hajar al- Asqalani, al-Izz ibn Jama'a,
Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, Abu Hayyan al- Andalusi, Shaykh Ahmad Ibn
Zayni dihlani, Shaykh Mohammad Ouwayss from al- Azhar, and many
others.

In their fatwa, they called Ibn Taymiyah as a misguided person who was
deserting the Sunni tenets. I refer Sunni brothers to their authentic
Fiqh book called "The Reliance of the Traveller" for a biography of Ibn
Taymiyah.

Now, as for Ibn Taymiyyah: A number of prominent Muslim scholars of
great repute -have- in fact pronounced kufr on Ibn Taymiyyah, although
the majority of scholars of ahl-al-Sunnah have not pronounced kufr on
him. Many have, however, criticized him for innovation (bid\`ah). Among
those who criticized him are -Ibn Hajar al-\`Asqalani (FatH al-Baaree,
[Vol 12, p202], [V 13, p 410]),

-Ibn Hajar al-Haytami ([al-Fataawaa al-Hadeethiyyah p116, p203],
[Haashiyah, p443, p489])

-Taqi al-Deen al-Subki ([al-sayf al-Saqeel], [al-durrah al- maDiyyah]

Others include Taj al-Deen al-Subki, al-Hafiz al-Dhahabi, Ibn Daqeeq
al-\`Eed and Zayn al-Deen al-\`Araaqee.

Firstly, we should realize that those scholars who pronounced kufr on
him based their verdicts on very real evidence from Ibn Taymiyyah's own
books. One of the primary contentions of these group of scholars was
that Ibn Taymiyyah believed in - eternity of the universe, which is that
he said that some kind of creation always existed.

Also a large number of scholars, of both former and latter times, have
criticized some of Ibn Taymiyyah's opinions as innovations. It cannot be
denied that in some issues, Ibn Taymiyyah (though he may have had good
intentions) has contradicted the consensus (ijmaa\`) of the Muslim
scholars. Some of these issues are doctrinal (e.g. he believed that
Allah can be described with (limits), compare this to the mainstream
Sunni creed as presented by Imam al-Shafi\`ee, for example in , p8, or
Abu Haneefah (al-fiqh al-akbar, p57), al-Tahawi (al- \`aqeeedah
al-TaHaawiyyah), al-Bayhaqi (al-Asmaa' waS-Sifaat, p410), etc), others
are related to fiqh (jurisprudence) (e.g. his opinion that three
divorces pronounced together do not all take effect - this fatwaa
incidentally was the reason that Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali forsook Ibn
Taymiyyah).

The following article is written by a Sunni brother. This also shows
the fact that ortodox Sunnis beleive that Allah can be seen but we don't
know how? He talks but we don't know how?

He is stablished on the trone but we don't know how? On the other hand
Wahhabis attribute physical entities to it, while shia do not beleieve
Allah has hand at all. Shia also beleive he can not be seen at all, and
so on.
