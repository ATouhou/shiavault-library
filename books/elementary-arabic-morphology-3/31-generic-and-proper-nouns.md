========================

145. What is a generic noun?

146. What is a proper noun and how many types of proper nouns are there?

147. What is the ruling regarding a compound proper noun?

148. Does a proper noun become indefinite?

145. A generic noun is a word that is applicable for every instance of
it and does not indicate one instance disregarding another, for example:
**کتاب.**

146. A proper noun is a word that indicates one instance of a genius
without regarding another. There are two types of proper nouns; a
singular proper nouns, for example: **سلیم,** and compound which is
either by a compliment to a prefixed noun, for example: **عَبد الله,** a
real compound, for example: **بَیتَ لحم,** or attribute, for example:
**تأبَّط شراً.**

147. The ruling regarding a compound due to a compliment to a prefixed
noun is that the prefixed word is put into whatever state that the
previous situation calls for and the compliment is put into the genitive
state, for example: **جاء عبدُاللهِ.** The ruling regarding the real
compound noun is that the first word is indeclinable with a *fathah* and
the second letter is declinable, for example: أ**عجبتني بَیتَ لح**مُ.
The ruling regarding the compliment due to being an attribute is that
both words accept the signs of whatever state they are in, for example:
**تأبَّطَ شراً.** Proper nouns are also divided into metonymy, which
start with *āb* or *um*, for example: **أبو** **یوسف** and nicknames,
which can either be positive or negative, for example: **المصطفی** which
is the nickname of the last Prophet, Muhammad (s).
