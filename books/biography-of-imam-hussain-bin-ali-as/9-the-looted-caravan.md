The Looted Caravan
==================

After burning their dead and leaving the bodies of the holy Imam and
his martyred devotees unburied, lying on the plain of the massacre, the
Devil's forces left the plain of KARBALA for KUFA with the virtuous
ladies and the innocent children of HUSSAIN'S family as their captives,
on bare backs of camels, snatching away their veils, without any purdah,
with their necks tightly tied in ropes. The sick holy Imam Ali son of
HUSSAIN, who could not even sit up owing to his illness, was bound in
heavy chains and was made to walk barefooted on the thorny plains and on
the burning sand of the desert, form KARBALA to KUFA and from KUFA to
Damascus.

**THE TORTURES OF THE JOURNEY**

The history of the tortures of the journey from KARBALA to KUFA and
from KUFA to Damascus which the sick Imam Ali, the helpless ladies and
the young children were put to, is a very pathetic record of the worst
brutality ever recorded on earth, the narration of which in detail needs
a separate volume. The captives of the family of the holy Imam were
first marched on public roads and through the streets of town of KUFA,
to the open court of IBN-I-ZIAD the Governor of KUFA, and from there
they were marched to Syria to be presented in the open court of the
brute YAZID who before an audience of hundreds of his courtiers, seated
on the throne there, were purchased by his wealth and who had signed the
death warrant of the holy Imam supporting the claims of the Brute to be
Deputy of the holy Prophet.

**THE DIVINE LIGHT SHINES OUT**

Every soldier who was given the severed head of a martyr, to carry it
raising it on his lance was made responsible for its safe custody.
KHOOLE a hard-hearted tyrant was put in charge of the holy head of
HUSSAIN. As the Brute's army marched from KARBALA after the great
massacre, it halted near KUFA where KHOOLI lived. KHOOLI left the camp
in the night to visit his wife in the town and carried with him the holy
head, and to hide it form his wife, he kept it covered under ashes of
the hearth in the kitchen of his house. When KHOOLI'S wife came out of
her room in the middle of the night, she fund pillar of light rising out
from the hearth in the kitchen. She was stunned and when she saw through
a hole in the door, she found some heavenly figures descending form
heaven on a severed head in the hearth. She rushed back into her room
and waking up KHOOLI reported the matter to him. KHOOLI could no more
conceal the matter and spoke out to her what he had hidden in the
hearth. The good lady cried aloud cursing his saying: "May the wrath of
God be on thee O' cursed One! Thou hast brought the holy Head of HUSSAIN
the holy Imam in my house". Crying aloud, shedding tears, the good lady
madly rushed out of her house again entered the house, and ultimately
gave up her life crying for the holy Imam.

THE SEVERED HEAD OF HUSSAIN RECITES THE WORD OF GOD

The Devil's army marched with severed heads of the martyrs raised on
their lances. Among the heads, were the head of the baby son of HUSSAIN,
ALI-E-ASGHAR. It is now left to the tender hearts of gentle women to
imagine in their own places, what would have been the feelings of the
mothers, the sisters and the children among the captives who were
marched along with the army, looking all the time at the severed heads
of their dear ones, on the points of the lances raised before their
eyes. Historians, reporting the gruesome events of the great tragedy,
say that people noticed the lips of the severed head of the holy Imam
moving, and when people applied their ears carefully, the heard the holy
lips uttering clearly the following verse of the Chapter 'KAHF' of the
holy QUR'AN:

"â€¦AAYAA TINA AJBAD" [18:9] "Thinkest thou that the Fellows of the Cave
and the Inscription were of Our wonderful Signs". [18:9] The one who
heard the recital of the sacred words, immediately cried out saying:
"Nay! O son of the holy Prophet! The event of thy wonderful sufferings
and patience is more astonishing". Since its severance from its body,
the holy head of HUSSAIN till its burial after about a year of remaining
in the custody of the Brute at Damascus, it manifested miracles after
miracles proving the Unity of God, the glory of the Lord of the
Universe, the bonafide of the apostleship of his grandfather, the holy
Prophet Muhammad, and the truthfulness of Islam, as God's prescribed
religion for Mankind as a whole.

**THE CAPTIVES IN DAMASCUS**

Even during the most miserable journey, the severed head of the holy
Imam manifested several miracles which guided several good-hearted
Christians and Jews to embrace Islam, most of whom after embracing the
Truth attacked the brutes and were ultimately martyred by the Devil's
forces.

When the looted Caravan entered Damascus, at the orders of the Devil
YAZID, the whole town was ordered to be fully decorated and the people
to be engaged in rejoicing and making merry at the success of their
Ruler. To please the Brute the people dressed in the festive robes were
extremely jubilant, amusing themselves in fanciful plays and
merrymaking. When the looted Caravan of the holy House of the Prophet
passed through the public streets and the busy bazaars,

people in huge numbers thronged to have a view of the captives whereas
the godly ladies of the family of the holy Imam who where captives, felt
mortally ashamed and insulted and covered their holy faces under the
hair of their heads. While the sorrow-stricken ladies were seated on the
bare backs of the camels with the hair of their heads covering their
faces, the heads of the martyrs raised on the point of the lances were
marching before them. The poor ladies sometimes looked at the heads of
their martyred husbands, brothers and children, with tears flowing from
their eyes. The children seeing the severed heads of their loved ones
cried aloud innocently calling them to return to them and to relieve
them of their torturous miseries.

After parading through the crowded streets and the busy bazaars
thronged with the rejoicing public, the ladies and the children tied in
ropes and the sick Ali in chains with the severed heads of the martyrs,
were presented openly in the fully attended court of YAZID surrounded by
his courtiers. YAZID sat on the throne and kept the severed head of the
holy Imam down in front of him, drank wine, and ridiculed the holy Imam
and his family standing before him utterly helpless tied in ropes as
captives. What all before the holy Family in the Devil's court is also a
long history of unbearable sorrow and the worst degradation of the godly
ones, which will surely move the coldest heart to tears.

The captives were imprisoned in every narrow, dark and roofless cell.
The members of the holy Family suffered the hardships and the tortures
of imprisonment in the cell for a long time until in the prison expired
SAKINA the three years old dearly loved daughter of HUSSAIN. She died of
wounds caused by the whips and slaps of the tyrants, particularly of the
wounds she received from the stone-hearted SHIMER. After a long
imprisonment, the sick Imam Ali, with the other captives, was released.
They returned to KARBALA, and after burying the bodies of HUSSAIN and
the other martyrs which were lying unburied till then, they returned to
Medina. Thus the holy Imam HUSSAIN offered the Greatest Sacrifice to
reestablish the Truth firmly never again to be shaken by any one until
the Day of Judgment.

**THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHESIES THE MARTYRDOM**

This is the Sacrifice which has been prophesied also in the Old
Testament in which God promise to avenge the blood of the holy Imam
HUSSAIN: "For this is the day of the Lord God of Hosts, a day of
Vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries and the sword shall
devour, and it shall be satiated and made drunk with their blood for the
Lord God of Hosts hath a Sacrifice in the north country by the river
Euphrates" Jer. 46:10 This is the 'ZIBHE AZEEM' or the Greatest
Sacrifice, the Lord has foretold to take place instead of Abraham's
Sacrifice:

"Most surely this is a manifest trial, And We ransomed with a Great
Sacrifice And We have shifted it among the later generation". This
happened on 61 A.H. on the Bank of the Euphrates at KARBALA in Iraq.

**WHO WAS VICTORIOUS: YAZID OR HUSSAIN?**

Although the hosts of the Devil numbered in thousands and the
supporters of the cause of Truth for which the holy Imam stood, could be
counted on fingers, and the holy Imam, with his numbered devotees, was
mercilessly massacred and the ladies, the queens of virtue and chastity
along with the innocent children were taken captives and put to every
disrespect, indignity understood who was the Arch-Devil and who was the
Divinely Chosen Guide for Humanity. Many people embraced Islam at the
guidance they received from the severed head of HUSSAIN when thy saw it
glorifying the Lord even from the point of the lance during the
torturous journey to KUFA and from KUFA to Damascus.

The realization of the Truth, the World exhibited after the martyrdom
of holy Imam, made even the Devil acknowledge the virtual, spiritual
Victory of the holy Imam. Identifying oneself as the admirer of YAZID is
far beyond any possibility when there is none today who would even like
the idea of taking the devil's name in connection with any goodness save
those who would like to associate themselves with the Brute in the
licentious performances enacted. Whereas ever since the martyrdom of
HUSSAIN, the act of admiring and appreciating the holy Imam and his
devotees is enjoined as a duty of every true believer in God and the
sincere lover of Truth, deeming it with a conviction that admiration of
the Great Sacrifice and feeling for the sorrowful plight of the holy
Imam and his godly devotees carries special blessings in this world, and
with high spiritual honors and great rewards in the life hereafter.

**WHAT IS 'SHAHADAT' OR MARTYRDOM**

Whoever is taken unawares or shot dead or suddenly killed be that even
for any matter of goodness on the part of the murdered one, other than
God's cause, cannot be called a martyr. It can no doubt be said that the
assassin had been cruel and the good man had been unjustly killed, but
he cannot be a martyr in the proper or the right sense of the term, for,
perhaps, if the murdered one had an opportunity or the chance to escape
death, he might have successfully avoided it, or if he had been warned
of the fate, he would have changed his views or conduct to avoid the
cause for the murder.

A martyr in the true and the proper sense of the term is the one who
stands for Truth and Righteousness even at the cost of his life and
property not excluding his near and dear ones.

**Jesus and Hussain**

The holy QUR'AN asserts in unequivocal terms that Jesus was neither
killed nor crucified by the people: [4:157-158]

Even taking for granted the statement of our Christian brethren the
crucifixion of Jesus under the evidence of the holy Bible of the
Christian Church itself, can never be a martyrdom at all as the Bible
says that Jesus avoided the end by hiding himself which suggests his
unwillingness to meet death in the cause of Truth. Besides, when caught
by the enemies, he began imploring God to see that the cup was passed
over and he be saved, and while he was put on the cross as alleged by
the Christian belief, he began crying aloud to God in agony saying that
he had been forsaken by Him. Could this be becoming even of any ordinary
believer in God with the conviction of his faith in Him? How could such
a weak-hearted one totally void of faith in the All-Merciful Lord, be a
religious leader, even that the son of God? How could the one forsaken
by God be the savior of Humanity? The Bible itself declares:

"And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed saying
O' my Father if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless
not as I will, but as thou wilt". "And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried
with a loud voice, saying: 'Eli, Eli LAMA SABACHTHANI', to say, My God,
my God, why hast thou forsaken me". Math (27:46)

The above statement of the Bible of the Christian church establishes
the following points against Jesus:

1- Jesus was frightened of death.
2- Jesus was unwilling to drink the cup of death in the way of the
Lord.
3- Jesus wanted God to avoid his drinking the cup of death.
4- Jesus wanted God to avoid His Will to take place.
5- In the agony against the fear of death Jesus lost all faith in God
and believed to have been forsaken by Him, Thus according to his own
words, the forsaken son can do nothing for others for he himself has
been forsaken.

Let us take the case of HUSSAIN:

1- HUSSAIN traveled all the distance from Medina to KARBALA to drink
the cup of death accompanied by untold miseries and tortures.
2- HUSSAIN offered not only himself but the dearest ones of his nearest
kith and kin, and the sincerest of friends with matchless faith in God
and devotion to Him.
3- At every step, HUSSAIN suffered the worst tortures and the greatest
loss with perfect patience, fortitude, submission and surrender to the
Divine Will, every time praying for his offerings to be accepted by the
Lord.
4- While under the swords of the heartless assassins, he only prayed to
God for the salvation of the Faithful, far from being a complainant, he
prayed for his sacrifices to be accepted.
5- He proved his being the Greatest Martyr, the King of Martyrs who
offered not only himself but his dearest ones counted to about
seventy-two, by glorifying God in God's own Words when his head was
severed and raised on the point of the lance.

In short, HUSSAIN'S martyrdom has no parallel in the history of great
scholar IMADUDDIN HUSSAIN ISPHAHANI known as IMAD ZADEH, TEHRAN, His
inquiry is based upon the following sources:

1- TABARI.
2- IBNE ATHIR.

**THE MARTYRS OF KARBALA: THE KIND OF MEN THEY WERE**

As already said in the foregoing pages, those who surrendered their
souls in the way of the Lord at KARBALA were the divinely selected ones
of the human family. They were ideal personalities with unique qualities
which humanity could justly be proud to own in their kind as the
matchless gems which the world had ever seen. Each one of the great
martyrs was a model of the integration of the unique personality traits
some of which each one of them possessed as peculiar to himself. They
were the noblest models divinely set up for the members of the human
family to follow.

The faith in God, the sincere devotion, the dauntless courage, the
unconquerable fidelity, the unfailing patience, the charitable
disposition, the ideal consideration for the life after death and the
ever mindfulness of the Day of Judgment which the great martyrs
manifested in the hour of heir trial at KARBALA were obviously the
qualities they were divinely conditioned with for the fulfillment of the
Divine Plan of the enactment of the glorious 'ZIBHE AZEEM'. Every one of
martyrs was a glorious human metal with the polish necessary to get
reflected through it the divine attributes of the Creator Lord of the
Universe. In short, KARBALA was a historic, a unique and the greatest
exhibition of the best specimens of the various noble qualities endowed
in the children of Adam, particularly those of the seed of Abraham
through Muhammad, Ali and FATEMA. Any one desirous of having a view of
the glorious manifestation of divinity in man, and the ideal integration
of the Divine attributes in a human personality may look into the
wonderful sacrifice which HUSSAIN, the King of Martyrs, offered in
KARBALA, in the way of the Lord.

It is a historic fact that a large crowd followed HUSSAIN from Mecca
but before the great offering he had to make, HUSSAIN started shifting
the human stuff there with him through his repeated sermons prophesying
the torturous sufferings and the gruesome massacre in store for those
who remain with him. Thus the holy Imam made the questionable stuff
leave his camp after which remained only the sincere ones who were
wholly devoted to the Lord and who were really anxious of surrendering
themselves in His way. While he wanted those who were then with him to
leave him and go away, HUSSAIN wrote letters and sent messages to the
chosen few worthy of inclusion into his fold informing them of the
arrival of the awaited hour. Thus were collected the gems worthy of
presenting to the Lord, Shunting out all the unworthy stuff.

**THE COMPANIONS OF HUSSAIN AND THOSE OF THE HOLY PROPHET**

It is the historic truth that the kind of faithful companions the holy
Imam HUSSAIN had gathered around him was not given to any of the
Apostles of God including Jesus and even the holy Prophet Muhammad to
claim such a band of men of spotless character and godly conduct in such
a large number among their companions. While one of the disciples of
Jesus betrayed him and connived to get him in the hands of his enemies,
none of the other disciples offered to get killed with their Master. In
the case of the companions of the holy Prophet, most of those who claim
prominence in their devotion to him, deserted him leaving him in the
Jaws of death, not once or twice but on every occasion when they felt
any danger to their life.

But in the case of HUSSAIN, the faithfulness and the devotion of his
comrades in the worst and the most torturous miseries which culminated
in the gruesome massacre of one and all of them, is nothing but a
matchless marvel which has thrown the human world into wonder and has
moved every human heart to sorrow and grief for them, with tears
irresistibly rushing into eyes of men, women and even children in
sympathy for the great sufferers in the way of the Lord.

brother and the Standard Bearer of the holy Imam at KARBALA. Let any one
try his own luck even today by invoking the Mercy of the All-Merciful
Lord in the holy name of this Saintly son of AMIRUL MOMINEEN ALI. His
holy shrine in KARBALA stands today as the resort for the sure rescue of
his sincere devotees to get the help from God at the times of
unavoidable needs, risks and dangers.

divine qualities he was exclusively distinguished with, cannot be given
in this brief work.

He was next only to the holy Imam in KARBALA. The 'ALAM' or the Banner
which he held on behalf of the holy Imam, was the Standard of Islam or
Truth, which is hoisted by the SHIAS, popularly during the mourning

King as a token of their loyalty to him. The Banner being the Standard
of Truth is only revered and respected and never worshipped as wrongly
imagined and depicted by some ignorant ones. Worship in Islam is due to
none but the One, the Only True God. 53- ABDULLAH IBNE HUSSAIN, known as

HERO

Today when the leaders of every religion are revered only by their
respective followers, the holy Imam HUSSAIN is the International Hero
who occupies a special position of love, honor, reverence and holiness
in the hearts of the followers of all the religions in the world. People
in every part of the world, without any distinction of caste, creed,
color or nationality, love HUSSAIN and hold him in reverence,
recognizing and hailing him as a Great Hero of Truth. Millions of
educated men and women today with ample proof, believe that the holy
Soul of the King of the Martyrs commend their prayers to be heard by God
and thus draw great blessings from the All-Merciful Lord through the
mediation of the Greatest of the Martyrs in His cause.

HUSSAIN, THE KING OF MARTYRS

Having gone through the above very brief sketch of the terrible
sufferings of the holy Imam HUSSAIN along with his family and friends
unequalled in History of Mankind, and the great unparalleled sacrifices
he has offered in the way of God to save the Truth for the guidance of
the human race as a whole with which the holy Imam defied the might of
the Devil's forces surrendering his all, any intelligent person will
unhesitatingly declare the holy Imam to be the King of Martyrs.

Some people have, even wrongly gone to the extent of worshipping
HUSSAIN as God Himself or His incarnation which is totally wrong. Today
Muslims, Hindus, Christians, PARSIS, Jews and people of every religion
love HUSSAIN paying him their sincere homage and revere him in their own
ways. Those who believe in God and godliness take pride in naming their
children after the holy names of the House of the holy Prophet, but none
even tolerates his issues to be called by the cursed names of those who
had tortured the holy Family, although the great tyrants ruled empires
in their respective times. Every, justice loving soul today hates the
Arch-Devil YAZID, son of MU'AVIAH, deeming him the Devil incarnate.

**WHERE IS YAZID?**

Thus the holy Imam established the Truth and won an everlasting Victory
over Falsehood. He has not only proved YAZID, the Drunkard, the
Debauchee, the Gambler to be one worse than a brute and a devil but has
crushed falsehood for ever and placed the Truth in the highest pinnacle
of prominence and regard, in its original purity. And now no evil hand
can touch it till the end of the world. YAZID has earned the curse of
God and of the whole of the God-loving humanity in this world and a
permanent abode in hell for himself and his comrades for ever.

**THE FRIENDS AND FOES OF THE TRUTH, CLEAR DISTINCTION**

Now, to know who are the followers of the Truth, and who are the
supporters of Falsehood, is very easy. All those who love HUSSAIN will
naturally be found weeping, mourning, or at least feeling sorrowful for
the calamities that befell the holy Imam in establishing the Truth.
Those who rejoice and make merry must naturally be the enemies of the
holy Imam, and the supporters of the cause of Falsehood of which the
Devil YAZID was an embodiment.

**THE KING OF MARTYRS MOURNED**

Every Since the massacre of the holy Imam and his faithful devotees at
KARBALA, true Muslims during the month of MOHARRAM express their grief
and feelings for the sufferings of the holy Imam, in their own ways
according to the customs of their own countries. Some enthusiasts among
the people beat their breasts to say that they who do not care for their
own selves and hurt their own bodies in love for the holy Imam, in
fighting against the forces of the devil. During this mourning period,
the mourners men, women and children generally dress in black, and give
up every kind of rejoicing. The mourning for the holy Imam is observed
through organized congregations called 'MAJALIS-E-AZA' or the Mourning
Congregations.
