The Believing Woman
===================

Mus'ab ordered his soldiers to arrest Mukhtar 's wife. Her name was
Umra. Her father's name was al-Numan bin Bashher al-Ansary. She was a
believing woman.

Mus'ab asked her to disown her husband. She said:

*I won't disown him. He fasted in the day. He said his prayers at night.
He sacrificed himself for Allah and His Apostle. He took revenge on Imam
Husayn's killers.*

Mus'ab said with threat:

*I'll kill you!*

The believing woman said:

*To die a martyr for Allah is better than this world. I'll die and enter
paradise! I prefer Imam Ali to everything!*

Mus'ab decided to kill her. In the dark, a person took her to a place
between Hira and Kufa. In that desert, the person beheaded her. She died
a martyr for Imam Husayn's aims.

Mukhtar and his wife passed away. They wrote a bright page in the
history of Jihad. The page has illuminated the way for generations.
