The Day of the Warning
======================

Another day came. It was not less important than that day of the
revelation of the mission.

When the Quranic verse of the Warning (And warn your nearest relations
... Quran, 26:214) was reveled to the Prophet believed in the mission,
to invite the close relatives of Quraysh and to tell them about the
purpose of this invitation but the crowed separated without any use. The
Prophet (s) tried again to gather them. And as soon as he finished his
speech, his uncle Abu Talib said to him: "How much we like to assist
you, to accept your relatives gathering and I am one of them but I am
the first of them to do what you like. Follow what you are ordered of.
By Allah, I will still be your guard and protector but my self doesn't
obey me to give up the religion of Abdul Muttalib." (1)

Abu Lahab (2) objected to Abu Talib by saying: "By Allah, this is the
evil! Prevent him (Muhammad) before he will spoil the others." Abu Talib
answered him: "By Allah, we will defend him as long as we are alive."
(3) Then he turned to his nephew and said: "O my

p.321.

master! Get up and say whatever you like. Inform of your God's mission.
You are the most truthful, the most honest." (1) What a faith that
overcame Abu Talib to make him rush from among more than forty persons,
who were seized by ignorance and whose eyes were covered by a haze that
they couldn't see the light shining from the mission of this new
prophet.

It was Abu Talib, who offered his support, who accepted the advice and
who believed what his nephew had said. Wouldn't this refer to the deep
faith, the true submission and the reasonable obedience of him, who
could distinguish between the truth and the falsehood? If Abu Talib
hadn't believe in the Prophet's mission, he would have adopted another
situation like that of Abu Lahab and he wouldn't confute Abu Lahab so
severely until he said to him: "Be silent, O you to say so ... !? (2)

Weren't Abu Talib and Abu Lahab two brothers and both of them were
uncles of the Prophet (s)? So why did each of them have a different
situation? This defended, assisted, encouraged the Prophet (s) and
strived against the arrogants of Quraysh with a sharp tongue and that
defamed the Prophet, prevented people from believing him, distributed
his speech and mocked his mission.

Wasn't the faith-alone-that imposed upon Abu Talib his situation, which
he had never deviated from? And wasn't the polytheism-alone-that imposed
upon Abu Lahab his situation, which he had never given up? After Abu
Talib showed the arrogants of Quraysh that he had submitted to the
mission of Muhammad (s), he

saw some eyes looking askance at him and trying to devour him
grudgingly. He thought that he had to mystify his real situation to be
free in working for the sake of the mission without being restrained by
any one of those arrogants. This explained his saying: "... but my self
doesn't obey me to give up the religion of Abdul Muttalib."

But what was the religion of Abdul Muttalib? It was the very religion
of Abraham (s) was but a continuation of that religion and a completion
of all those previous divine religions. This was the way that Abu Talib
decided to follow in order to confuse the arrogants of Quraysh about the
truth of his real belief. He said to his nephew: "Get up o my master!"
This word (my master) was a certain evidence that Abu Talib had believed
in the mission of his nephew. My master was a word that Abu Talib
addressed his nephew; the orphan, whom Abu Talib himself had brought up,
whereas it was Muhammad (s), who had to say it to his uncle with his
many years of old, but it was the prophecy that made Abu Talib say it!
But Allah gave Muhammad (s) many excellences when He had chosen him for
the mission that were above uncleship, oldness, bringing up and
guarding.

All that Abu Talib had perceived when he said to his nephew: "Get up my
master!" He was his master as long as he was the Prophet. He had to
believe in his mission, to obey him and to submit to his orders. Then he
added after saying: "... my master ... Say whatever you like and
announce your mission. You are the most truthful and the most
trustworthy." As long as Abu Talib thought that Muhammad (s) was the
most truthful one, so how would he deny his mission? But he noticed some
eyes winking and some tongues backbiting with sarcasm and mockery until
he heard someone saying: "He ordered you to obey your son." (1) They
meant Ali when the Prophet (s) had appointed him as his guardian. But
Abu Talib didn't pay any attention to what they said. In fact he
answered them with a word that disappointed them and supplied his son
Ali with a great power of encouragement: "Let him (Ali) alone. He would
never fail to assist his cousin (Muhammad) .... (2)

This was not the first word that Ali had heard from his father showing
his contentment with his supporting his cousin; the master of the
humanity. Abu Talib had seen Ali offering the prayer behind the Prophet
(s) in the first moment of the mission in a secret place for fear of the
polytheists. Then Ali answered his father: "O father! I have believed in
Allah and His Apostle. I have believed in all what the Prophet has said.
I have offered the prayer with him and followed him."

Abu Talib said to his son: "As long as he invites you for goodness, you
are to keep to him." (3) What a fine word it was that showed a deep
faith rooted in the heart of its sayer. The Prophet (s) would invite but
to goodness and so every reasonable one had to keep to him. This was
also another evidence showing the

faith of Abu Talib otherwise he wouldn't encourage his son to keep to
the Prophet (s) with his mission. If it was not so, he would prevent his
son from following Muhammad and to deny his mission and to direct his
son to the right way according to his own thought. Abu Talib was certain
that his nephew was inspired by the Heaven; therefore he encouraged his
son to keep to him. This was not the only line in the shining page of
Abu Talib's history but there were many other bright lines. It was
mentioned that Imam Ali (s) had said: "My father said to me: O my son!
Keep to your cousin for you will be safe from any immediate or later
evil. Then he recited:

Ali and Ja'far are my trusts
whenever the time brings distresses and disasters.
O you both! Support your cousin and don't fail him.

He is my blood-brother's son.
By Allah I won't fail the Prophet
Neither will any of my sons. (1)

It was a clear confession of Abu Talib when saying: "By Allah, I won't
fail the Prophet." It was a great swear that Abu Talib had really been
loyal to and had done his best to carry out. Neither he nor any of his
sons tried to fail the Prophet (s) a moment throughout their lifetime.
They supported him until the last moment of their lives. Once again Abu
Talib invited his brother Hamza (Abu Ya'la) (2) to spread the religion
of Allah and encouraged him to tolerate the distresses he would face in
the way of this great task and asked him to assist his nephew, whom
Allah had entrusted with this mission, with all power he had. He
recited:

O Abu Ya'la! Be patient with the distresses you face
in revealing the mission of Ahmad. (3)
Strive to firm this religion!
Surely you will succeed with your hard attempt.
Follow him, who has been sent by Allah, sincerely and determinedly
O Hamza, don't be unbeliever!
I as so happy when you say: I am a believer,
so be a supporter of the Prophet for the sake of Allah Talk to Quraysh
about what you believe in,
and say loudly to them: Ahmad has never been a magician! (4)

Abu Talib was an Islamic propagandist, who seized any opportunity to
express what there was there was in his heart. He would be very happy
when Hamza would say: I am a believer. Declaring this, he had to support
the Prophet (s) for the sake of Allah and not for the kinship because
faith and religion would be above anything else according to Abu Talib's
thought!

It would be better to end this chapter with a word by al-Barazanji. He
said: "It was mentioned so recurrently by many of the historians that
Abu Talib loved the Prophet (s), guarded him, supported him, assisted
him in revealing the mission, believed in all what he had said and
ordered his sons like Ali and Ja'far to follow him and support him."
Then he added: "These facts showed clearly that Abu Talib's heart was
full of faith in the Prophet (s)." (1)

**Jihad**

The mission of the Prophet (s) became so active and spread its rays
here and there for the Prophet (s) had a strong fortress saving him from
the storms. His uncle Abu Talib had promised Allah to support His
religion, which his nephew had been entrusted with by his God. Abu Talib
tried his best to save and support his nephew even if he would be to
sacrifice his sons or himself for the sake of the Prophet's mission. The
Prophet (s) began to announce his mission openly after being surrounded
by this guard and support. He set out courageously and bravely without
fearing anything as long as he had a fortress he could resort to.

Now a new bright page of Abu Talib's history opened. After the page of
believing, the page of jihad and firm defense began its shining lines in
the way of the real sacrifice for the true belief. He defended the
Prophet (s) against the arrogants of Quraysh and made the way free for
him to spread his mission. Abu Talib not only defended the Prophet (s)
but he also defended anyone who had believed in the Prophet (s), against
the tormenting of the oppressive polytheists of Quraysh.

It was a page full of sacrifice, true jihad and steadfast defending.
Would life have a meaning without a firm belief, deep-rooted faith,
steadfast jihad and a truthful brave tongue? If the tongue couldn't
carry out the task alone, there would be sharp swords, muscular hands
and great wills. Hence the Prophet (s) became so active in his mission
and his voice became so loud. Quraysh began to fear this new mission,
which invited the people to profess in the unity of the One and Only God
and to discard those idols, which were made of wood and stone by their
own hands and which didn't hear or see and didn't benefit or harm.
People stood up before those idols tied up like subservient slaves
losing power, option and reason in front of dead substances. It didn't
show save the ossification of minds, the death of senses and the
stupidity of traditions.

The new mission spread widely and the believers increased. The Prophet
(s) began to announce his mission openly. He mocked the idols, around
which there were flocks of beastly people ready to sacrifice themselves
for. The Prophet (s) began to make them think about their dark and
bitter reality they lived in and invited them to come out of their
sphere. But alas! The blind wouldn't know what light was as the bat,
which wouldn't fly during the brightness of the day!

The people of Quraysh became so angry when Muhammad (s) defamed their
idols. They didn't find save Abu Talib to make reparation to them. A
group of notable men of Quraysh went to Abu Talib complaining against
his nephew. They said: "O Abu Talib! Your nephew abused our gods,
faulted our beliefs, stultified our traditions and considered our
forefathers as deviants. So either you prevent him from doing that or
you leave him alone to us. And as you are in disagreement with him as we
are, so we will relieve you of him." (1)

Abu Talib answered them leniently and gently until they left but the
Prophet (s) kept on spreading his mission. But when they didn't find any
result for their

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 This showed the secret of concealing the faith by Abu Talib;
otherwise they wouldn't go to him complaining against his nephew unless
they thought that Abu Talib had the same belief of theirs. But if they
knew that he had believed in the Prophet (s), they would declare the war
against him and the results would be very bad against the new mission,
which was still fresh and in the beginning of its long difficult way.

complaint, they decided to go to Abu Talib complaining again: "O Abu
Talib! You are so old and you have honor and high position among us. We
asked you to prevent your nephew from keeping on his doing but you
didn't. By Allah, we won't tolerate abusing our forefathers, faulting
our traditions and defaming our gods. So either you make him refrain
from his doings or we will fight him and you until one of the parties
will be defeated." Abu Talib stopped between two difficult situations;
each of them was so serious. He was afraid if he declared the war
against his people that it would do away with the young and the old and
at the same time he could never fail the divine mission where he had
promised to support hid nephew, the Apostle of Allah; moreover he had
been recommended by his father Abdul Muttalib to support Muhammad (s)
and to believe in him when he would be chosen by the Heaven.

He made up his mind. He called for his nephew and told him of what the
delegation of Quraysh had said to him. He wanted to be sure about the
determination of his nephew in carrying out the mission. Then he said to
him: "Save yourself and save me and don't burden me with what I can't
bear." He didn't notice of his nephew but determination, strictness,
firmness and seriousness. His nephew said: " O uncle! If they put the
sun in my right hand and the moon in my left hand to give up this
matter, I will never do until Allah makes it overcome or I die for it."
He had a look at his nephew as he got up to leave and a deep pain was
inside his heart thinking that -as some historians mentioned- his uncle
would betray him or would leave him alone without any support so some
tears fell down from the Prophet's eyes .... (1)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 We don't think that the Prophet (s) thought that his uncle would fail
him whereas he knew well his uncle's firm situation but those tears were
because the Prophet (s) felt pity for his uncle, who would be in a very
critical situation for the sake of him.

Abu Talib noticed that and became uncomfortable ... a moment passed and
he became more determined and firm. He determined to support the Prophet
(s) and his mission even if he would confront all of Quraysh or even the
Arabs all in all. He had to strive as long as the divine will had chosen
him to be the guardian of the Prophet (s) since the first day and since
the first dawn of the mission.

"O my nephew! Come one!"

With this word Abu Talib broke the silence and the long pondering of
his nephew. He added: "O my nephew, go ahead! Say whatever you like! By
Allah, I will never betray you whatever happens." (1) Then he recited:

By Allah they won't reach you whatever numerous they were
until I am buried under the ground.
Announce your mission and never mind anything,
and let your eyes be delighted.
You invited me and I knew that you were sincere to me.
You are the most truthful, the most honest.
I have known that the religion of Muhammad
is the best of religions among all of the people. (2)

attention to them. These verses showed clearly the faith of Abu Talib
in wonderful images and certain concepts that couldn't be distorted or
misworded.

After the conversation occurred between Abu Talib and the delegation of
Quraysh, Abu Talib wanted to relieve his nephew and to reassure his
heart so he recited these verses to show his nephew that his uncle was
still the supporter, the assistant and the defender as ever as he had
been and as ever as he would be until he would meet his God after
contenting his conscience, achieving his promise and carrying out his
father's will. He would never fail his nephew or leave him alone. He
assured him that he would never mind for the deviate flocks of Quraysh
for no one of them would harm him until Abu Talib would be buried under
the ground. The last verse confirmed Abu Talib's faith in Muhammad's
mission after he had encouraged his nephew to announce his mission
openly in the previous verses.

These verses showed the true faith of Abu Talib besides his full
knowing about the other religions when saying that the religion of
Muhammad (s) was the best of religions at all.

But the evil fancies and the bad intentions didn't want to let the
brightness of these verses spread easily so they tried to throw some
ashes upon it. They added another verse to distort the pure image that
expressed the faith of Abu Talib. They fabricated the following verse:

Lest I will be blamed or it will be shameful to me,
I may declare believing!

You can see clearly the great difference between this verse and the
verses you have just read above. Ahmad Zayni Dahlan said about this
further verse: "It was said that this verse was fabricated and added to
the poetry of Abu Talib. It was not of his actual saying." (1)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 Refer to al-Ghadeer, vol.7 p.334,

And if we agreed with those, who ascribed the verse to Abu Talib, who
hadn't said it; nevertheless it wouldn't serve their aim and wouldn't
satisfy their purpose. The meaning of the verse would be thus: if he
didn't fear to be blamed or abused, he would be able to declare his
faith in the mission of Muhammad (s) openly in front of the people of
Quraysh and wouldn't keep it secret. It didn't mean that if he didn't
fear to be blamed, he would be a believer. If it had this meaning so it
would definitely contradict the meaning of the previous verses, in which
he had confirmed his believing in his nephew when he had invited him to
his mission.

Till now everyone, even those who tried to distort the real image of
Abu Talib, said that Abu Talib was acute, prudent, quick-witted,
eloquent and sharply discerning. Would it be acceptable for him to
contradict himself within a few lines of poetry?

Quraysh knew the real situation of Abu Talib towards the new mission
and towards the Prophet (s). They became so angry that he had this firm
situation and that all their attempts failed. They asked him to prevent
his nephew from abusing their gods but he didn't. They asked him to
leave Muhammad (s) alone to them but they found that he encouraged
Muhammad (s) to spread hid mission and that he promised to support and
to defend him. After all of that the polytheists of Quraysh found a new
way to conclude a deal with Abu Talib.

They came to Abu Talib bringing with them Imare bin al-Waleed. They
said to him: "O Abu Talib! This is Imara bin al-Waleed. They said to
him: "O Abu Talib! This is Imara bin al-Waleed. He is the best young man
and the most handsome of Quraysh. Take him as your son and give us your
nephew, who denied your religion and your forefathers' religion,
separated the unity of your people and mocked their traditions. We kill
him and it will be a man for a man."

If Abu Talib didn't know how to behave in the serious situations, he
would send a loud laugh scornfully and slightingly towards this silly
word but he said prudently and bravely: "By Allah! What a bad deal it
is! Do you give me your son to feed him for you and I give you my son to
be killed? By Allah, this will never be at all!" What silliness it was
indeed. It showed the devaluation, the irrationality and the
unintellectuality of those people. Then al-Mut'im bin Adiy bin Nawfal
bin Abd Manaf, who was the an ally of Abu Talib, said: "O Abu Talib! By
Allah, your people have been fair to you. They try to rid you form what
you hate ... but I don't see that you want to accept their attempt
...!"

Abu Talib answered him:" By Allah, they haven't been fair to me. But
you failed me and supported them against me. Do whatever you like!" (1)
Then Abu Talib recited a poem criticizing al-Mut'im bin Adiy about his
betraying and then he criticized everyone betraying him of the family of
Abd Manaf (2) and everyone of Quraysh bearing enmity against him.

Abu Talib thought, after declaring his situation towards Quraysh, that
he had to armor himself and to be ready for the emergencies he might
face from Quraysh after they knew his situation. He didn't find save the
Hashemites to depend upon in his struggle against Quraysh. He invited
them to be with him to defend the new religion and to protect the
Prophet (s) against the evil

doers of Quraysh if they would try to do any harm to the Prophet (s).
All the Hashemites compiled with his invitation except that deviate
brother Abu Lahab, the cursed. Abu Talib became so delighted when he saw
the great situation of the Hashemites that he would not worry much about
the Prophet (s). He thanked his kin and praised them for their support
and assistance. He poetized this gratitude and praise in a poem to be
eternal throughout the generations. He had to mention Muhammad (s), who
had the great honor and glory that no one else than him had. He
recited:

If one day Quraysh gathers to pride,
Abd Manaf will be their best and purest essence.
And if Abd Manaf gets the honor,
Hashem will be the most honorable among them,
And if the Hashemites pride one day,
Muhammad will be their most glorified essence.
Quraysh, all in all, rushed against us,
but they failed and lost their reason.
We have never accepted any unfairness,
and if they show haughtiness, we are always humble to people.
We defend our sanctuary whenever there is a danger,
and strike whoever try to harm a rock of it.
With us the withered plant become fresh.
and under our shadow it grows and lasts. (1)

The Prophet (s) and his mission became so strong and the disagreement
increased between the Hashemites and Quraysh. Abu Talib began to fear
for the Prophet (s) from Quraysh more than before. He began to care much
for

him and tried not to let him alone so that he might be hurt by anyone
of Quraysh. Once Abu Talib missed his nephew. He looked for him but he
didn't find him. He became so worried and upset. He determined to
revenge after hearing that Quraysh intended to assassinate the Prophet
(s) to do away with the new mission. He called for the young men of the
Hashemites and ordered each of them to hide a weapon under his cloths.
He ordered each one of them to stay beside a chief of Quraysh and agreed
with them upon a certain sign that if he failed to find Muhammad (s),
they would revenge Muhammad's blood upon those men of Quraysh at the
same moment.

The young men took their places as they were ordered by the old man. He
went to look for his nephew. When he found him safe, he took him by the
hand and stood before the people of Quraysh shouting: "O people of
Quraysh! Do you know what I have intended to do? ..." He told them about
his plan and his young men's intention and asked his young men to show
their weapons. He challenged them by showing them his powerfulness. The
defeat appeared upon the faces of Quraysh especially the arrogant Abu
Jahl.

Abu Talib said to them: "By Allah! If you kill him, I will never let
any of you alive. It will be the war until we or you are perished." (1)
Then Abu Talib recited some verses praising his nephew after criticizing
the bad situation of Quraysh. He declared for Quraysh that he was the
guardian of Muhammad (s) and his family:

Inform Quraysh wherever they are,

that I am, with swearing by the reciters,
the books and the scientists,
a sincere guardian of Muhammad's family.
My heart and conscience love them.
I won't give up my kin and sons,
even if the war brings its disasters.
Do they order their people to kill Muhammad so unfairly?
I swear that Quraysh will gain nothing,

My nephew is my heart-root.
Will the young men drink pure water,

O you, the son of the master of Qussay! (1)
As if your face is like the full moon. (2)

There was another event, in which Abu Talib had proved his powerfulness
and sovereignty over Quraysh. One day while the Prophet (s) was offering
the prayer, Quraysh wanted to mock at him and to disturb his prayer.
They asked Abdullah bin az-Ziba'ra to undertake this mean task. He took
some feces and blood of an animal and stained the Prophet (s) while he
was prostrating in his prayer. The Prophet (s) hadn't save Abu Talib to
resort to. He went to his uncle heartbrokenly and his eyes were full of
tears. It was a great insult. His uncle became very angry about what
happened to his nephew. He had to revenge him on them and to repay them
the insult.

He, holding his sword, rushed towards them with his nephew. His face
was overcome with rage and the signs of revenge were talking loudly
until he reached the meeting of the people. They were afraid of his
angry look. They tried to run away before him but he nailed them in
their places with a sudden word: "By Allah, if any of you

moves from his place, I will cut him with my sword." They stuck to the
ground as if they lost their will. He approached to them and asked hid
nephew: "My son! Who is the doer?" The Prophet (s) pointed to Abdullah
bin az-Ziba'ra. Abu Talib approached to him and hit him on his nose.
Then he stained the people's faces, beards and cloths with feces and
blood. He scolded and insulted them severely. Then he turned to his
nephew saying victoriously: "O my nephew! Are you satisfied now? Do you
know who you are? You are Muhammad bin Abdullah (he detailed his
lineage). By Allah, you have the most honored ancestry and the highest
rank among the all. O people of Quraysh! Whoever of you wants to move,
let him do. You know well who I am!" (1) Then Abu Talib recited:

You are Muhammad the Prophet,
a generous master and a son of generous masters.
They are the highborn and so are you.
The best of the origin was the root; Amr (2)
who crumbled bread in the bowels,
when the life of Mecca was miserable!
How are you wronged while I am still alive?
I am the brave, the powerful!
And your men, as if they are lions!
I have known that you are truthful;
You haven't said but the truth since you have been a child! (3)

Abu Talib began his poem with a clear confession that would let no way
for anyone to argue or to object ... so

what was the difference between saying the shahada (... and I witness
that Muhammad is His Apostle) and Abu Talib's confession (You are
Muhammad the Prophet)? There was no difference, for both showed
confessing the prophecy of Muhammad (s). But the black hearts and the
filthy consciences had their own purposes when distorting the truth and
changing the reality.

After he praised his ancestors and mentioned the deeds of Amr (Hashem,
their grandfather) who enacted feeding the pilgrims when Mecca was
afflicted with some years of bannerness. He satiated the hungry stomachs
and relieved the distressed hearts. After that Abu Talib showed his
sympathy towards his nephew and assured that his nephew wouldn't be
defeated as long as he was surrounded by lions that would tread upon
whoever thought of doing any evil against him. Then he ended his poem
with two verses, in which he certified the truthfulness of his nephew
and that he had never heard him saying but truth and rightness since his
earliest childhood and he had never found him deviate from the right way
at all.

This was but a clear confession of the Prophet's mission by Abu Talib
as a divine mission. It showed the definite faith of Abu Talib. It would
be better to quote these verses too to show the reader the real thinking
of Abu Talib towards Muhammad (s) and his encouraging him to keep on
carrying out his task determinedly.

Before these verses ibn Abul Hadeed said in his Sharh Nahjol Balagha:
"... and from among his (Abu Talib's) famous poetry are these verses, in
which he addresses Muhammad, clams his heart and orders him to announce
his mission."

Never let those sinuous hands and cawing voices prevent you from the
rightful task you carry out.


My hand is yours whenever you face your opponent, and my soul is
sacrificed for yours in the disasters. (1)

If we investigate all the poetry of Abu Talib about this subject, our
way will be so long and ramified but let's go back to our main subject.
Abu Talib wouldn't support Muhammad, as he had done since his childhood
until he was chosen by the Heaven for the divine mission, as a kin but
he supported the very mission, in which he believed, and he supported
everyone, who believed in it. He wouldn't be tranquil if any one of
Muhammad's follower was harmed because of the mission.

He had many shining pages of such support that we wouldn't pass by
without referring to some of them. The polytheists of Quraysh tortured
Othman bin Madh'oon aj-Jumahi when he became a Muslim. they wanted to
deviate him from the right way he had chosen. When Abu Talib heard of
that, he revenged Othman on Quraysh. Then he recited:

Is it because you remember untrustworthy time,
you are sad and you cry with agony?
Or you remember impudent people,
wronging whoever invites to faith?
Didn't you see, o Quraysh -Allah may degrade you all-,
that we revenged for torturing Othman bin Madh'oon?
We fight injustice and face whoever wants to harm us with every sharp
weapon in our hands.
Sharp swords, as if they are mixed with salt,
relieve our avengement on the mad's heads,
until the men of no reason submit,
and become lenient after haughtiness,
or until they believe in a wonderful divine book revealed to a prophet
like Moses o Jonah. (1)

p.74, Abu Talib p.33, Divan Abu Talib p.11, A'yan ash-Shia, vol.39
p.150.

What did he mean in his last verse by a wonderful book revealed to a
prophet like Moses or Jonah? Would it be but believing in the holy
Quran? It was a divine book revealed to a prophet among the prophets,
whom Allah had chosen. After all these things, could any one deny the
faith of Abu Talib unless that one was a deviate enemy? Besides the
evidence this poetry had that proved the faith of Abu Talib, it
certified what we have said before that Abu Talib had known much about
the previous religions that preceded the mission of Muhammad (s), which
confirmed the continuity of the religion of Abraham otherwise Abu Talib
wouldn't mention these religions.

Then he wasn't satisfied with that until he invited the polytheists to
follow this new religion. He made them choose either to be stricken by
the sharp swords or to believe in this wonderful book. Describing the
Quran as (wonderful book) had its similar thing mentioned in the holy
Quran itself: (Surely we have heard a wonderful Quran, guiding to the
right way, so we believe in it) 72:1-2.

Quraysh tortured many Muslims in order to make them give up Islam.
Among those, who had been tortured, was Abu Salama bin Abdul Assad
al-Makhzoomi, who didn't find save Abu Talib to resort to in order to be
saved from the torture of Quraysh. When the tribe of Makhzoomi knew that
Abu Talib had protected their man, they sent a delegation to him. They
said to Abu Talib: "O Abu Talib! You have protected your nephew Muhammad
from us then why do you protect our man from us?"
