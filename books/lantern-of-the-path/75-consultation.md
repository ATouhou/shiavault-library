Consultation
============

Take counsel in the matters faith demands of you with one who has the
following five qualities: intellect, knowledge, experience, good
counsel, and precaution. If you find these five things in a person, then
make use of them, be resolute and rely on Allah. This will lead you to
what is correct.

As for matters of this world which do not pertain to faith, make
decisions about them and then do not think about them further. If you do
this, you will obtain the blessings of livelihood and the sweetness of
obedience.

Knowledge is obtained through consultation. The man of intellect is he
who derives new knowledge from consultation, and that guides him to
obtain his goal. Consulting a proper counsellor is like reflecting upon
the creation of the heavens and the earth and the destruction of both,
since the more intense a person's reflection upon these two things, the
deeper he penetrates into the seas of the light of gnosis and the more
he increases his understanding and certainty.

Do not take counsel from someone when your intellect does not give him
any credence, even if he is famous for his discernment and
scrupulousness. When you take counsel from someone your heart trusts, do
not disagree with what he advises even if it is contrary to what you
want. Surely the self combines both acceptance of the truth with what is
opposed to it - that is, on receiving other truths which are clearer to
him. Allah has said,


<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَشَاوِرْهُمْ فِي الأَمْرِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Take counsel with them in the affair.*** (3:159)


and again,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَأَمْرُهُمْ شُورَى بَيْنَهُمْ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Their rule is to take counsel among themselves.*** (42:38)


that is, they consult each other about it.
