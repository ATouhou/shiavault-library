Commentary : Verse 93
=====================

93- إِن كُلُّ مَن فِى السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ إِلآَّ ءَاتِى
الرَّحْمَنِ عَبْداً

93. " There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the
Beneficent (Allah) as a servant."

**Commentary:**

All the world of existence and its creatures are wholly under the
command of Allah, and they are His servants. Why do you consider the
servant of Allah as His child?

It is for this reason that the Qur'an, concerning the matter, in this
holy verse, says:

" There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the
Beneficent (Allah) as a servant."

These servants obey Him, but in the meantime He does not need their
obedience. It is those creatures who are totally in need of
Him. \* \* \* \* \*


**Commentary : Verse 94.95**

94- لَقَدْ أَحْصَاهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً

95- وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَرْداً

94. " Certainly He has counted them, and He has numbered them
exactly."

95. " And every one of them shall come to Him on the Day of
Resurrection, all alone."

**Commentary:**

He knows the exact number of all parts of the world of existence
entirely.

The knowledge of Allah (s.w.t.) encompasses not only the universals,
but He also knows the details of the matters. The verse says:

" Certainly He has counted them, and He has numbered them exactly."

That is, never think that with the existence of all these servants, how
He may know the account of them wholly.

Therefore, in the second holy verse, mentioned in the above, the Qur'an
says:

" And every one of them shall come to Him on the Day of Resurrection,
all alone."

Thus, both Jesus, and Ezra, and angels, and all human beings are
involved in this general commandment. Yet, how disgrace is the
consideration of belief of a child for Him, and how low do we bring His
Pure Essence from the climax of Dignity and Grandeur!


**Commentary : Verse 96**

96- إِنَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ سَيَجْعَلُ
لَهُمُ الرَّحْمَنُ وُدّاً

96. " Verily those who believe and do righteous deeds, soon the
Beneficent (Allah) will appoint love for them."

**Commentary:**

The words in this verse, as well as the next couple of verses, are
about the faithful believers and also about the faithless cruel unjust.
The contents of these verses are also upon the Qur'an and its glad
tidings and warnings. At first, it says:

" Verily those who believe and do righteous deeds, soon the Beneficent
(Allah) will appoint love for them."

Faith and righteous deed has a reflection as vast as the world of
existence, and the ray of love emerged from it can cover the whole
expansion of creation. Allah, the Pure Essence, loves such believing
people. They are beloved with all those who are in the skies. This
affection will brighten the hearts of men who are on the earth.

To be beloved is a divine bounty which may be given to the believers
and the righteous, as the Qur'an says: "…soon the Beneficent (Allah)
will appoint love for them." Yes, the one who loves only Allah will be
loved heartily by all people with the help of Allah. In general, he who
remembers Allah, He will have His favor upon him. The Qur'an says:
"Therefore, remember Me, and I will remember you; …" (Sura Al-Baqarah,
No. 2, verse 152).

It is interesting that the Prophet (p.b.u.h.) in a traditions says:
"When the Lord loves one of His servants, He says to His great angel,
Gabriel, that He loves so and so, then do love him. Gabriel will love
him and, then, he calls in the skies that Allah loves so and so, then do
love him; and thereafter, all those who are in the skies will love him,
and then the acceptance of this affection will reflect in the earth.

And when the Lord hates a person, He tells Gabriel to hate him, and
Gabriel hates him. After that he calls out among those who are in the
skies that Allah hates him, then do hate him. Thus, all those who are in
the skies will hate him, and afterward, the reflection of this hatred
will be found in the earth."

This tradition has been recorded in many Islamic traditional sources as
well as in many commentary books, but this is a tradition of the text
recorded in the Commentary of Fi-Zalal, vol. 5, p. 454 which is adopted
from Ahmad, Muslim, and Bukhari.

Verily, what a pleasure is better than this that a person feels that he
is beloved by all the pure and the righteous of the world of existence?
And how painful is that a person feels that the earth, the skies, the
angels and the believing people all hate him?

However, besides the books of Shi'ah, there are numerous traditions
recorded in the books of tradition and commentary compiled by the
scholars of the Sunnite upon the occasion of revelation of the verse
under discussion, narrated from the Prophet of Islam (p.b.u.h.) , which
denote that this verse has been revealed mostly in regard to
Ali-ibn-Abitalib (a.s.). Among them are: Zamakhshari in Kashshaf;
Sebtayn-ul-Jauzi in Tathkirah; Ganji Shafi'i; Qurtabi his famous
Commentary book; Mu'jab-ud-Din Tabari in Zakha'ir-ul-'Ughba; Neyshaburi
in his well-known commentary book; 'Ibn-i-Sabbaq Maliki in
Fusul-ul-Muhimmah, Suyuti in Durr-ul- Manthur; Heythami in
Sawa'igh-ul-Muhraghah; and 'A-lusi in Rouh-ul-Ma'ani. Some of these
traditions are as follows:

1. Tha'labi, in his commentary book, narrates from Bara'-ibn-'A-zib:
"The Messenger of Allah (p.b.u.h.) told Ali (a.s.): 'Say: O' Allah!
Appoint a covenant for me with yourself, and set my love in the hearts
of the believers'. Then this verse was reveled." (Ihghagh-ul-Haghgh,
vol. 3, p.p.83-86)

This very statement exactly, or with a little difference, has been
cited in many other Islamic books.

2. In a lot of Islamic sources it has been narrated from 'Ibn-'Abbas
who said: "The verse 'Verily those who believe and do righteous deeds,
soon the Beneficent (Allah) will appoint love for them.' Has been
revealed in regard to Ali-ibn-Abitalib (a.s.), which means that Allah
appoints his love in the hearts of the believers." (According to
'Ihghagh-ul-Haghgh, vol. 3, pp.83-86)

3. Upon the commentary of this verse, it is cited in the book entitled
'Sawa'igh' that Muhammad-ibn-Hanafiyyah said: "There is no faithful
believer but there is love of Ali and his Ahl-ul-Bayt in his heart."
(Ihghagh-ul-Haghgh, vol. 3, pp. 83-86)

4. Maybe, for the same reason it has been cited in a correct and
authentic tradition narrated from Amir-ul-Mu'mineen Ali (a.s.) who said:
"Even if I strike the nose of a believer with this, my sword, for hating
me, he will not hate me, and even if I pile all the wealth of the world
before a hypocrite in order that he loves me, he will not love me. This
is because it is a verdict pronounced by the tongue of the unschooled
Prophet (p.b.u.h.) as he said: 'O' Ali! a believer will never hate you
and a hypocrite will never love you'." (Rauh-ul-Ma'ani, vol. 16, p. 130;
Majma'-ul-Bayan, vol. 6, p. 533; and Nahaj-ul-Balaqah, saying No. 45)

5. Imam Sadiq (a.s.) in a tradition said: "The Prophet (p.b.u.h.) in
his last prayer invocated in regard to Amir-ul-Mu'mineen Ali (a.s.) so
loudly that people could hear, saying: 'O Allah! Bestow the love of Ali
upon the hearts of the believers, and appoint his awe and greatness in
the hearts of the hypocrites'. Then this verse and the verse next to it
were revealed." (Nur-uth-Thaqalayn, vol. 3, p. 363)

It has also been narrated from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) who said: "The love of
Amir-ul-Mu'mineen Ali (a.s.) is a reward that Allah gives to the
believers who have righteous deed." A similar meaning to this tradition
has been narrated from the holy Prophet (p.b.u.h.) in regard to the love
and affection of the believers unto Ali (a.s.). (Al-Kafivol. 1, p. 431,
Tafsir-i-Furat, p. 247)

However, as it was said in the commentary explanations of the
abovementioned verses, the revelation of this verse upon Ali, as a
complete example, does not contrast the generality of the meaning upon
the believers wholly, with a hierarchical order, of course.
