Explorers of Spiritual Territory
================================

That, to my mind, is the supreme significance of martyrdom. All human
history shows that the human spirit strives in many directions, deriving
strength and sustenance from many sources. Our bodies, our physical
powers, have developed or evolved from earlier forms, after many
struggles and defeats.

Our intellect has had its martyrs, and our great explorers have often
gone forth with the martyrs' spirit. All honour to them. But the highest
honour must still lie with the great explorers of spiritual territory,
those who faced fearful odds and refused to surrender to evil. Rather
than allow a stigma to attach to sacred things, they paid with their own
lives the penalty of resistance.

The first kind of resistance offered by the Imam was when he went from
city to city, hunted about from place to place, but making no compromise
with evil. Then was offered the choice of an effectual but dangerous
attempt at clearing the house of God, or living at ease for himself by
tacit abandonment of his striving friends.

He chose the path of danger with duty and honour, and never swerved from
it giving up his life freely and bravely. His story purifies our
emotions. We can best honour his memory by allowing it to teach us
courage and constancy.
