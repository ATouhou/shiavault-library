سَأَلْتُ رَسُولَ اللٌّهِ (ص): أَيُّ الأَعْمَالِ أَحَبُّ إِلـى اللٌّهِ
عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ؟ قَالَ الصَّلاَةُ لِوَقْتِهَا. قُلْتُ ثُمَّ أَيُّ
شَيْ‏ٍءٍ؟ قَالَ بِرُّ الْوَالِدَينِ. قُلْتُ ثُمَّ أَيُّ شَيء‏ٍٍ؟ قَالَ
الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللٌّهِ.‏

[Ibne \`Abbas states:] “I questioned the Messenger of Allah (peace be
upon him and his family): Which deed is the most beloved in the eyes of
Allah, the Mighty, the Glorious?”  He (peace be upon him and his family)
replied: “(Offering) prayers at their stipulated times.” I then asked:
“Which is the next most beloved deed?” He (peace be upon him and his
family) answered: “Goodness towards (one’s) parents.”  I asked him
again: “After this which is the most beloved act?”  He (peace be upon
him and his family) said: “Jihad in the way of Allah.”
