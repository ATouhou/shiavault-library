Harmony and Co-existence
========================

The Father
----------

Now that we are talking about the family environment, I should tell you:
The green family tree will bear sweet fruits only when its roots i.e.
parent are compassionate and its branches i.e. children have
understanding. This tree, in whatever home happens to be, will bring
about a warm and pleasant atmosphere of love.

The sweet fruit of such a tree is comfort and happiness, because the
kindness of parents and the understanding of children bring harmony and
peace. That, in return, prevents creation of problems and
misunderstandings. Thus, no dissatisfaction and hard feelings will
appear among them, with such co-existence, everyone will discharge his
own duties and will respect the right of others. The father fulfils the
duties of fatherhood; the mother that of motherhood; and the children
behave like children. Oh! How fortunate is a family which comprises such
members and how blessed is a house that has such inhabitants.

The Child
---------

Your conversation having such sweet words and appropriate metaphor is
every fascinating for me and in respect of content too it is meaningful
and perfectly correct. There is no doubt about its wisdom.
