Chapter Six : Violence Against Woman
====================================

In Islamic teachings, all kinds of violence against all people have
been banned. Gentleness, however, has been emphasized in social
relations. The Holy Prophet (a.s.) said: "Nothing is more beloved to
Allah and his Messenger than faith and gentleness with people. And
nothing is more hateful to Allah and His Messenger than polytheism and
violence against people." 1

The subject of violence is sometimes misused and misinterpreted. To
understand the concept of violence truly, it should be born in mind that
the Islamic reprisal of the criminals, Jihad with the unfaithful, and
using war instruments against violators of human rights are vital issues
recommended to Muslims throughout the Qur'an. Reprisal is sometimes a
vital tool, because violators and oppressors do any oppression, kill and
torture cruelly for their interests, and use the highest levels of
violence.

Before such people, non-violence has an inhumane meaning. It is in fact
like gentleness to a rapacious leopard. The behavior of the holy Qur'an
toward these violent individuals is for the interest of humanity :

(Whoever then acts aggressively against you, inflict injury on him
according to the injury he has inflicted

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 Bihar al-Anwar,
72/457, quoted from Nawadir ar-Rawandi.

on you, and be careful of your duty to Allah and know that Allah is
with those who guard against evil.) 1

The only way for facing these human-like savages is violence and not
logic. Some simple-minded proponents of western liberal-democratic
school think that the oppressors can be confronted with logic and
ethics, without any violence. All the past and present realities and
instances nullify this false imagination. This is also rejected in the
overall history of the prophets.

The Prophet of Islam, who is (Mercy for the worlds) and whose motto is
"I have been sent (as prophet) for completing the nobilities of
character" went to 83 wars. He battled even with inner opponents and had
a decisive behavior with Muslims who did not accept some Islamic rules.
This statement of the Prophet (a.s.) manifests the true way for Muslims
:

"Goodness, all the goodness is maintained by (the force of) the sword.
People are directed to goodness only by the sword. And the swords are
keys to the Paradise and the Hell." 2

The same tradition 3 is also narrated from Imam Baqir (a.s.), the fifth
infallible Imam.

Prophet Muhammad (a.s.), the great leader of humanity and the best
teacher of ethics and divine principles, thinks that all the goodness is
materialized by the power of the swords. He considers the instruments of
power as the only way for gaining peaceful and humane goals. The Prophet
(a.s.) knows that the cruel and voracious people do not leave

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ I Qur'an, 2: 194.
2 Wasa'il al-Shi'a 11/5.
3 Ibid 11/9.

murder, crime, oppression, and disloyalty and do not accept
righteousness except by the force of the sword. In the present era, we
see clear instances of these criminals who oppress the third world
nations. They oppress the nations concerning oil price. They suppress
national movements. Food and drug companies use their power to force and
dominate nations. They spread viruses so that their products be sold,
making the vital foods and drugs the most violent instruments for
reaching their goal. The weapon producers start wars among innocent
people to sell their products, beside many other inhumane methods. After
this much violence that is unprecedented in history, they now speak of
non-violence. They suggest logical and humane behavior toward oppression
to make the youth away from the principles of Jihad, martyrdom, and
sacrifice. They want to abolish revolutionary bases and pave the way for
inhumane rulers.

As was mentioned, according to the Prophet (a.s.), violence is the
worst thing and it is equal to polytheism. Of course, this prohibited
violence is the one against Allah's servants; these Allah's servants
means trustworthy, faithful, and responsible people, not the oppressive
criminals. So, one should be aware of propagandas and be careful of
usage and aim of apparently beautiful words.

Surely, Islam has condemned violence and aggression. Even the annoying
of any living being is forbidden in Islam. Imam Sadiq (a.s) said: "By
Allah, the pious are prosperous. Do you know them? Those who do not
annoy a very small ant that is hardly seen." 1

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ I Bihar al-Anwar
75/152.

Furthermore, any kind of trivial annoyance that makes others unhappy is
considered a devilish doing in Islam. The Prophet of Islam (a.s.) said,
"One, who annoys a faithful, annoys me and one, who annoys me, annoys
the Almighty Allah. One, who annoys Allah, is cursed in the Torah, the
Bible, the Zabur (the Psalms), and the Qur'an." 1

Imam Sadiq (a.s) stated, "The Almighty says: Let him, who harms My
faithful servant, expect a war from Me." 2

Insulting and disrespecting others is also forbidden in Islam. The
Prophet (a.s.) said, "The meanest of people is he who insults people."
3

Scaring and distressing others is considered away from true belief, as
the Holy Prophet (a.s.) stated, "One, who distresses a faithful and then
he gives him all the world, shall not ransom himself by that nor shall
he be rewarded for it." 4

Finally, any kind of unpleasant and unkind behavior is not acceptable.
The Prophet of Islam (a.s.) said, "Whoever pushes a faithful to demean
him by it, slaps him on the face, or does something to him that he
hates, the angels curse him until he shall satisfy him (the faithful)
against himself, repent, and ask Allah to forgive him." 5

It was mentioned that a faithful means a faithful man and a faithful
woman, who are both included in all these rulings. These rulings have
been given more importance in family relationships.

What was stated is the general Islamic teaching. The Qur'anic verses
and traditions of the Prophet's household (a.s), however, emphasize the
avoiding of violence more deeply about woman (This issue will be
discussed in details in the last chapter).

The Holy Qur'an states: and treat them kindly ...) 1

Even in talking about the divorcing of woman, the Holy Qur'an stresses
kindtreatment: (And when you divorce women and they reach their
prescribed term, then either retain them in kindness or release them in
kindness, and do not retain them for injury, so that you exceed the
limits, and whoever does this, he indeed is unjust to his own soul; and
do not take Allah's communications for a mockery ...) 2

Divorce and separation often go with harms, hatred, and unwanted
reactions. The Qur'an prevents these issues, saying that if a man wants
to divorce his wife, he should not annoy or harm her or behave violently
toward her, observing the principle of 'kindness'.

Therefore, even in quarrels, the principle of 'kindness' should be
observed in dealing with women.

In another Qur'anic verse about the breastfeeding period, the principle
of 'kindness' and the providing of mothers' needs are emphasized :

(... and their maintenance and their clothing must be borne by the
father of the child according to usage ...) 3

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 Qur'an, 4: 19.
2 Qur'an, 2: 231.
3 Qur'an, 2: 233.

The criteria for providing the mother's needs should be "kindness"; not
the necessary amount, but more than that. Considering the Qur'an's
emphasis on the "kindness" criteria in treating women, the concept of
'kindness' should be studied carefully to see if it is the same as the
legal criteria or something more than justice and law.

The concept of "kindness", which defines the social verdict of
'enjoining good' (al-Amr bil Ma'ruf) in the Islamic teachings, has a
deeper meaning than the mere lawfulness and justice. It includes the
legal and just rights, plus ethical and humane ones. Such a humane
behavior deserves human high values. So treating woman legally or justly
is treating her in a way determined by the law, but treating woman with
"kindness" means treating her beyond her (only) legal rights; treating
her also as ethics and Islamic values determine. In other words, it
means observing the obligatory deeds and the recommended deeds as
well.

In the book Majma' al-Bahrayn, we read: "'kindness' is a general term
for anything that is Allah's obedience, His pleasure, doing good to
people, and any action that is considered good by the Sharia (laws) or
logic ..." 1

Aminul Islam Tabarsi says, "Behaving with 'kindness' is the behaving
according to Allah's commands, observing woman's rights, satisfying her
needs, and having good temper and good behavior with her. It is also
said that 'kindness' means not to beat woman, not to speak badly with
her, but to speak with good humor ..." 2

Attention should be paid that in addition to observing the right and
justice, kind and humorous behavior and following

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 Majma' Al-Bahrayn,
3/159
2 Ibid 3/ 25

ethical criteria are considered as 'kind treatment'. It should also be
borne in mind that the "kindness" mentioned in the Qur'anic verses
refers to a general rule, rather than an exception or specified
situation. In other words, it cannot be said that women should be dealt
with kindly in some specific situations and not in others. Such a
meaning is in full contrast with the verses containing the principle of
'kindness'. Therefore, this principle is the general Islamic rule in
dealing with woman. The peak of forgiveness toward women is stated in
this Qur'anic verse :

(... Then if you hate them (wives) it may be that you dislike a thing
while Allah has pledged abundant good in it ...) 1

Aminul Islam Tabarsi says, "... There is abundant good in keeping wives
who are not much beloved... and this verse encourages the husbands, who
do not like their wives, to have patience and not to divorce them. This
patience is encouraged as far as there is no harm to one's life,
religion, or property ..." 2

This is recommended to men who have ethical, behavioral, or other
problems with their wives and who rush to divorce them, not behaving
patiently or ignoring some of their desires.

The Holy Qur'an has also warned seriously against the annoying of women
:

(And those who speak evil things of the believing men and the believing
women without their having

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 Qur'an, 4: 19.
2 Majma' al-Bayan, 3/25.

earned it, they are guilty indeed of a false accusation and a manifest
sin.) 1

This verse follows another one that mentions the annoying of Allah and
His Messenger (a.s.), thus the immorality of the annoying of believing
women becomes more manifest. These were examples of verses that
explicitly prohibited any violence against women.

The same concept has been mentioned in traditions too. Imam Baqir (a.s)
has quoted from the Prophet (a.s.): "Does one of you beat his wife and
then he still wants to embrace her?!" 2

Considering these discussions, it may be asked that why the Holy Qur'an
has mentioned the beating of women in this holy verse: (And as to those
on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in
the sleeping places, and beat them. Then if they obey you, do not seek a
way against them.) 3

Islam has obliged woman to obey her husband in marital issues as a
right of the husband. The importance of such needs and fulfilling them
is certain. If conjugal needs are not responded to, the disobedient wife
may face violence from the husband, since man is naturally more
powerful. The Holy Qur'an in this case has limited such violent
behavior, setting specific stages for the husband to enforce his wife to
obey him and fulfill his desires. (Slightly) Beating a wife is only
allowed in case of her disobedience of matrimonial concerns. The amount
and quality of this beating is

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 Qur'an, 33: 58.
2 Wasa'il al-Shi'a, 14/119
3 Qur'an, 4: 34.

determined in traditions and Qur'anic exegesis. It is defined as a
gentle beating that leaves no scar. 1 To avoid any kind of extreme
violence in this regard, Imam Sadiq (a.s) has defined this beating as:
"It is the beating with a toothbrush." 2

This beating in fact declares an ethical opposition, not physical
punishment. It should also be kept in mind that the beating itself
follows two ethical and educational stages, as specified in the same
Qur'anic verse : (... admonish them ... leave them alone in the sleeping
places.)

To avoid going to extremes in leaving a disobedient wife alone, such as
long-time leaving, sleeping in another room, or leaving the house, it is
being determined as its least amount. Imam Baqir (a.s) said, "The verse
means sleeping with his back toward the woman." 3

Even in leaving women in their sleeping places, any kind of
mistreatment is forbidden. So if women abandon the most necessary and
primary relations with their husbands, they first face an ethical, then
an educational reaction, and later a punitive one, in the same way as
determined by Imam Sadiq (a.s.) and not more than that.

Some jurisprudents believe that woman's obedience to her husband is
only obligatory in case of the ordinary matrimonial relationship. Even
if some other kinds of pleasures are lawful in Islam, women are not
forced to obey their husbands in them. As her obedience is not
compulsory

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 Majma' Al-Bayan
3/44.
2 Ibid.
3 Majma' al-Bayan, 3/44.

in all desires of the husband, disobedience of them is not regarded as
'desertion'. 1

'Obedience' and 'desertion', which are set principles in matrimonial
issues, should not accompany violence and harm. They are in fact
assessed with 'la dharar' (no harm) principle, i.e. obedience of woman
to man's request should not cause any harm to woman in any way. Imam
Sadiq (a.s) was asked about Allah's saying in the verse (Neither shall a
mother be made to suffer harm on account of her child, nor a father on
account of his child), 2 and he answered: 'Some breastfeeding women
deserted their husbands' desires ... so Allah prohibited man to harm his
wife and woman to harm her husband.' 3

Even if this specific tradition had not been narrated about 'not to
harm woman', the general 'La dharar' (no harm) rule involves any kind of
harm. According to this rule, any kind of harm in social, family, and
individual relations is banned.
