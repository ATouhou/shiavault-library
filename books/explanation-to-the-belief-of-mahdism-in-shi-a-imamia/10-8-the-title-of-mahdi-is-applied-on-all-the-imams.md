8. The title of Mahdi is applied on all the Imams
=================================================

As we said earlier this title in its general sense is also applied on
all the Imams; on Imam Husayn and so forth. The traditions also indicate
that all the Imams are Mahdi: However there was only one whose
particular qualities and condition pointed to, and that was the twelfth
Imam.
