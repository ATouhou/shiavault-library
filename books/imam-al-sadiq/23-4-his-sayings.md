4- His Sayings
==============

Al- S&liq, peace be on him, has original sayings and rare words. They
raise the good souls to the classes of angels and lead people to the
virtue and happiness when they use and consider them carefully. I have
collected and selected a group of them in earnest. He, peace be on him,
said:

1. Intellect is that with which people worship the Most Gracious (Allah)
and with which they obtain gardens.

2. Verily, the reward is equal to intellect.

3. The most perfect of men in intellect is the best of them in ethics.

4. Intellect is the pillar of man.

5. Intellect is the guide of the believer.’ [1]

6. The perfection of intellect is in three (things): humbleness for
Allah, good certainty, and silence except for good.

7. Ignorance is in three (things): Haughtiness, the intense of dispute,
and the ignorance in Allah.

8. The best nature of intellect is worship, the strongest speech for it
is knowledge, and its most abundant luck is maxim.[2]

9. To consider knowledge very much opens intellect.[3]

10. Knowledge is a shield, truthfulness is might, ignorance is
abasement, understanding is glory, generosity is success, good behavior
causes friendship, he who has knowledge about his time, ambiguous things
do not attack him, and determination is mistrust.

11. If you want that you are honored, then be soft. And if you want that
you are abused, then be rough.

12. He whose origin is noble, his heart is soft, and he whose race is
rough, his liver is thick.

13. Whoever is extreme gets involved, and whoever is afraid of the
consequence refrains from entering what he does not know.

14. Whoever attacks a matter without knowledge cuts off his own nose.[4]

15. Scholars are trustees, the Allah- fearing are strongholds, and
guardians are masters.[5]

speed of walking does not increase him but farness.

18. Allah does not accept any act without knowledge, there is no
knowledge without act, so whoever knows, knowledga leads him to act, and
whoever does not act gets no knowledge, but belief is a little of a
little.

19. The favor is not perfected but with three (things):

by doing it quickly, debasing it, and hiding it.

20. Not everyone who sees a thing is able to do it, not everyone who is
able to do a thing is successful in doing it, and not everyone who is
successful in it. when intention, ability, success, and righteousness
come together, happiness occurs.

21. Four things of which little is much: Fire, enmity, poverty, and
illness.

22. Twenty- day- friendship is a relationship.

23. Whoever does not feel shame during absence and does not repent
during old age and does not fear Allah during loneliness, then he has no
good.

24. Whoever honors you, then honor him. And whoever scorns you, then
honor yourself from him.

25. To forbid generosity is mistrust in Allah.

26. Verily, the family of a person are his prisoners, so whomever is
bestowed upon him, then he should be generous toward them, and if he
does not (do that), that favor is about to disappear from him.

27. Three (things) with which Allah does not increase the Muslim person
but glory: To forgive him who wrongs him; to give him who deprives him,
to visit him who abandons him.

28. When the believer becomes angry, his anger should not take him out
of the truth; and when he becomes satisfied, his satisfaction should not
bring him in falsehood.

29. Friendship has five conditions. Whoever has them, then attribute him
to it. Whoever has not them, then do not attribute him to any of it.
They are: the good of his friend should be his good, his inward thoughts
for him should be like his openness, no money should change him against
him, he should hold the view that he is worthy of all his friendship,
and should not abandon him during misfortunes.’[1]

30. The noble man should not turn up his nose at four (things): his
standing from his sitting for his father, his service for his guest,
taking care of his riding animal even if he has a hundred slaves, and
his service for his teacher.

31. (Religious) scholars are the trustees of prophets unless they come
to the doors of supreme rulers.[2]

32. A man from the people of Iraq (ahl al- Sawâd) went to him (alSâdiq)
frequently, then he broke away from him, So he (the Imam) asked some
people about him. To detract from him, one of them said:” He is

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2   Lawlqih al- Anwar by aI- Shi’a: 1/28.

Nabati.” So, he (the Imam), peace be on him, said:” The origin of the
man is his intellect, his ancestry is his religion, his generosity is
his piety, and men are equal in Adam (Adam).”[1]

33. Noble deeds are ten, if you want them to be with you, then let them
be, they are with the man and are not with his children; they are with
the child and are not with his father; they are with the slave and are
not with the master: What are they? He, peace be on him, said: the
truthfulness of men, the truthfulness of the tongue, paying the trust,
linking the relatives on the maternal side, entertaining the guest,
giving food to the beggar, rewarding the favors, to avoid blaming the
neighbor, to avoid censuring the friend, and their head is modesty.[2]

34. Some of the correctness of the belief of the Muslim person is that
he should not please men through angering Allah, and do not blame them
for what Allah has not given him, because the miserliness of the miserly
does not drive livelihood, and the hatred of the hater does not live it
away, and if one of you escaped from his livelihood as he escapes from
deat, his livelihood would reach him as death reaches him.

35. Verily, with his justice, Allah has put comfort and ease in
certainty and satisfaction, and put worry and sorrow in doubt and
anger.[3]

36. The head of the obedience of Allah is patience and pleasure for what
Allah likes and dislikes for the servant, and if the servant is
satisfied with what Allah likes and dislikes for him, it will be good
for him in what He likes and dislikes.

37. Indeed, the most knowledge of all men in Allah is the most satisfied
of them with death.[4]

38. Do not BACKbite, so you are BACKbited, and do not dig a judge you
would be judged by.

39. Be ware ofjoking because it loses face and the dignity of men.

40. Do not dispute, so your glory goes, and do not joke, so you are
dared (so men dare to say rude things about you).[5]

41. Be ware of the dispute because it brings about the hateful ugly
thing and shows the defect.[6]

42. Whoever is not shy of seeking legal livelihood, his provisions is
light, and his family leads a life of ease and comfort.[7]

them, favor is not favor but with him who has ancestry and religion,
Allah, the Exalted, sends down endurance according to the affliction and
livelihood according to the provisions, whoever appreciates his
livelihood, Allah, the Exalted, gives him, and whoever wastes his
livelihood, Allah, the Exalted, deprives him (of that).[4]

I (the author) say: Some of these clauses are attributed to the
Commander of the Faithful (Amir al- Mu’minTn) in Nahj al- Ba1agha, and
al- Sâdiq, peace be on him, may have mentioned them as qauotations.

47. The richest riches is he who is not captive for greed.[5]

48. Nothing is better than silence, no enemy is more harmful than

and thankfulness during the blessing.[7]

50. The believer is popular, and there is no good in him who neither
associates nor is associated.[8]

51. It was said (to him): What is good behavior?

be in no need of men.

despair of what is in the hands of men is glory for the believer in his
religion.

66. To visit blood relatives improves manners, makes the self good,
increases livelihood, and delays death.[6]
