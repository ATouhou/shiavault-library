The Learned Man and the Hungry Dog
==================================

Isphahan is a beautiful city in Persia. In this lovely city there once
lived a very great learned man. He was also very poor. His name was
Mohammad Baqar. Because he lived in tsphahan he is known as Mohammad
Baqar - e - Isphahani which means Mohammad Baqar of Isphahan city.

Mohammad Baqar - e - Isphahani was poor and therefore he could not
afford good food. He had no money to buy rich food. For many years he
had been living on simple food. Once he felt like eating liver. Food
made from liver is tasty and rich in strength. So he began to save money
each day from his small earnings so that he could buy a pound of liver
and thus satisfy his desire.

After many days he saved enough money to buy a pound of liver He was
happy. He went to the bazaar and bought a nice piece of his favourite
liver.

Feeling very very happy he was returning home from market with the
parcel in his hands. On the way home, near a ruined house, he saw a
bitch with her puppies. The dog with her young ones looked very hungry.
Her stomach had gone deep inside. She was not able even to give milk to
her little ones and feed them. The bitch and her puppies were also
shivering from the cold climate.

Mohammad Baqar - e - Isphahani felt sorry for the poor animals. He went
near them and stroked them kindly. Then he opened his parcel of liver
and cut small pieces and then piece by piece fed them. The bitch while
eating looked thankfully at Mohammad Baqar - e - Isphahani and then at
the sky, as if she was thanking Allah for the favour and praying for the
generous and kind man.

Having fed the animals Mohammad Baqar - e-Isphahani went home. Tired
and hungry he slept that night shivering in the cold. But, somehow he
felt happy.

Soon after this incident the learned man began to get rich. Gradually
he became richer and richer until he was a millionaire. He became so
rich that once when the King of Isphahan was in need of money, Mohammad
Baqar - e - Isphahani gave him a loan of 20,000 dinars.

Moral: Kindness is never wasted.


**The Five Loaves**

Zarr Bin Hobeish relates this story. Two travellers sat together on the
way to their destination to have a meal. One had five loaves of bread.
The other had three. A third traveller was passing by and at the request
of the two joined in the meal. The travellers cut each of the loaf of
bread in three equal parts. Each of the travellers ate eight broken
pieces of the loaf.

At the time of leaving the third traveller took out eight dirhams and
gave to the first two men who had offered him the meal, and went away.
On receiving the money the two travellers started quarelling as to who
should have how much of the money.

The five-loaf-man demanded five dirhams. The three-ioaf-man insisted on
dividing the money in two equal parts.

The dispute was brought to Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib (the Caliph of the
time in Arabia) to be decided. Imam Ali (a.s.) requested three-loaf-man
to accept three dirhams. The man refused and said that he would take
only four dirhams. At this Imam Ali (a.s.) returned, "You can have only
one dirham. You had eight loaves between yourselves. Each loaf was
broken in three parts. Therefore, you had 24 equal parts.

Your three loaves made nine parts. Out. of which you have eaten eight
portions, leaving just one to the third traveller. Your friend had five
loaves which divided into three made fifteen pieces. He ate eight pieces
and gave seven pieces to the guest. As such the guest shared one part
from your loaves and seven from those of your friend. So you should get
one dirham and your friend should receive seven dirhams."
