Al Hajjaj
=========

Imam Ali passed away. Mu'awiyah became a Caliph. Unjust rulers succeeded
him. Life in Kufa became unbearable.

The rulers imprisoned and killed the God-fearing followers of Ahlul
Bayt.

Ziyad bin Abeeh ruled Kufa. Then his son Ubaidullah succeeded him. The
latter killed the Prophet's grandson. Besides he killed seventy of his
companions and his family.

Al-Hajjaj did his best to please the Umayyad rulers. He filled his
prison with innocent men and women. In his prison, there were fifty
thousand men and thirty thousand women.

The prison was roofless. The prisoners were subjected to sun and heat in
summer. And they were subjected to rain and cold in winter.

A person had been in prison for months. One day his mother went to the
prison to visit him. She was astonished to see him. She said:

*He's not my son. My son is white. This young man is a Negro. I don't
know him.*

The young man reminded his mother of some marks. The mother became
certain of her son. She burst into tears. Then she died of sadness.
