61: Sincere Repentance And Fulfillment Of Rights
================================================

As mentioned above, our sins and disobedience of Shariah play a great
part in prolonging the Ghaibat of Imam (aj). The Tawqee of Imam (aj)
further says, “That which keep us away from them are the unpleasant
things that we hear about them and do not like and those we never
expected from them. And Allah is He Whose help is sought and He is
sufficient for us and most excellent is the Protector.”[^1]
