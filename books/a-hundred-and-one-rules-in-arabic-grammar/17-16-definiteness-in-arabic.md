16. Definiteness in Arabic.
===========================

As you might have noticed in the phrases in point \#11 above, adjectives
in Arabic usually follow nouns and agree with them in terms of number,
gender, case, and definiteness/indefiniteness.

**a. small book    کتابٌ صغيرٌ**

** b. the small book  **الکتابُ صغيرٌ****

If an adjective completely agrees with its noun in every aspect, then
you have a phrase, as in examples (a) and (b) below. However, if a noun
(subject) is definite and its adjective (predicate) is indefinite you
have a sentence, as in (c).

**(a) a new house                 بيتٌ جديدٌ**

**(b) the new house          البيتُ الجديدُ**

**(c) The house is new**البيتُ جديدٌ    **  ** ****
