The Rain
========

![](/sites/default/files/rain.gif)

The riser has risen,

the sparkler has sparkled,

the appearer has appeared.

Allah has replaced

one people with another.

We awaited these changes

as the famine stricken await **the rain.**

Certainly the Imams are

the vicegerents of Allah

over his creatures,

and they make people know Allah.

No one will enter Paradise,

except he knows them

and they know himâ€¦..

(Sermon 150)
