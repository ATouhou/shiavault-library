Bondage ('Ubudiyah)
===================

The roots of conduct have four aspects: conduct with Allah, conduct
with the self, conduct with creation (i.e. people), and conduct with
this world. Each of these aspects is based upon seven principles, just
as there are seven principles of conduct with Allah: giving Him His due,
keeping His limits, being thankful for His gift, being content with His
decree, being patient with His trials, glorifying His sanctity, and
yearning for Him.

The seven principles of conduct with the self are fear, striving,
enduring harm, spiritual discipline, seeking truthfulness and sincerity,
withdrawing the self from what it loves, and binding it in poverty
(faqr).

The seven principles of conduct with creation are forbearance,
forgiveness, humility, generosity, compassion, good counsel, justice and
fairness.

The seven principles of conduct with this world are being content with
what is at hand, preferring what is available to what is not, abandoning
the quest for the elusive, hating overabundance, choosing abstinence
(zuhd), knowing the evils of this world and abandoning any desire for
it, and negating its dominance.

When all these qualities are found in one person, he is then one of
Allah's elite, one of His close bondsman and friends (awliya')
