ABSTRACT
========

This short story addresses our quest for knowledge from the perspectives
of two brothers. One brother, Ali, follows the educational system
proposed by Alfred North Whitehead, while the other brother educates
himself through the classical method. The story is based on Lewis
Carroll's*Alice in Wonderland* , and begins with a romantic episode in
which Ali expresses his desire to know more about infinity. At the same
time his brother is reading a book - the content of which seems to
change depending on the reader’s interpretation. While his brother
struggles to understand a book that is more than a collection of inert
ideas, Ali is guided by a white-headed rabbit into a Gabriel’s Horn
passage. Here he visits an alternate reality where he learns about the
true reality of life and consciousness. When he returns to his brother,
Ali’s perspective is forever changed, and he must synthesize the lessons
of this strange world in a life that is now extraordinary.
