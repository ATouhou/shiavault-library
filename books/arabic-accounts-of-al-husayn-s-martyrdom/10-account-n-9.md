Account N. 9
============

**al-Madaâ€™ini**

We have no clear idea of the account of al-Mada'ini. It is possible
that it is the main source of al-Baladhuri for Abu Mikhnaf, but
al-Baladhuri introduces his account with the collective qalu. However,
this version does not refer to the variation from \`Awana which Ibn
al-Kalbi has introduced into his account. Al-Mada'ind is used as a
source by Abu al-Faraj for a report from al-Qasim b. al-Asbagh which has
already been cited, and there are other reports from him which are not
from Abu Mikhnaf. So clearly he used other material to supplement Abu
Mikhnaf s account.
