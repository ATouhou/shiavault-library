Chapter 11: Composition of the Human Body
=========================================

The Imam said that while all human beings were made from the earth,
which was a known fact, he also said that whatever is in the earth is
also in the human body, but all elements are not in the same proportion.
Four elements are in very large quantity, eight elements in small
quantities and eight elements in minute quantities. This theory was
proved to be correct as late as the 18th century with the dissection of
the human body.

Results of these analysis show that the ratio of the major elements in
human bodies is the same throughout the world as Imam Jafar al-Sadiq
(A.S) had said. The four elements which are in large quantities in the
human body are: Oxygen, Carbon, Hydrogen and Nitrogen. The eight
elements which are in small quantities are : Magnesium, Sodium,
Potassium, Calcium, Phosphorus, Sulphur, Iron, and Chlorine. The other
eight elements which are in very minute quantities are : Molybdenum,
Cobalt, Manganese, Copper, Zinc, Fluorine, Silicon and Io! dine.
