52: the Mount (toor)
====================

This chapter of 49 Meccan verses is arranged in two sections. It was
revealed a fter Worship (Bowing Down on Your Knees) 32 and before
Control 67.

Its chief quality lies in its poetic mood which describes both Doomsday
and Bliss (I), plus offering a long and direct challenge to
disbelievers. This includes Muhammad's classic rebuttal (II)-for which
SEE Chapter 21 on prophets as well. The Prophet himself said that this
chapter helps one believe in God and also in either His punishment or
His favor.
