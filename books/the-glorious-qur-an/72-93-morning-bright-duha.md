93: Morning Bright! (duha)
==========================

These 11 early Meccan verses were revealed after Daybreak 89 and before
the next chapter which is called Consolation (or Relief) 94. The first
two paragraphs deal with the sense of history, while the third and
fourth concern some of the Prophet's personal experience and spiritual
striving. Here we glimpse

Muhammad's childhood; one should bear in mind that the Prophet had once
been a poor orphan boy, protected only by his extended family.

The passage shows the intimate manner in which God comforted him during
the Prophet's deep anxiety. Nicholson has a beautifully rhymed
paraphrase of this chapter on pp. 152-3 of his Literary History! of the
Arabs.
