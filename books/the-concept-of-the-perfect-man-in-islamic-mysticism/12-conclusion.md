Conclusion
==========

According to Islamic mysticism, the essence of God is absolutely hidden
and cannot be comprehended. We know God through His names and
attributes. The names and attributes emerge from the essence and the
world emerges from God’s names and attributes. God first discloses
Himself in His names, and then with the mediation of His names in the
world. The highest discloser and manifestation is in the human being
which is the most universal being and capable of reflecting all God’s
names. This is due to the nature of the human being which is composed of
both physical and spiritual, earthly and heavenly, and material and
immaterial substances. The human has reason and a tendency toward the
good, but at the same time, it has selfish desires too. Since he has
free will, man can go in any direction. He can achieve the highest
stages of perfection, as he can fall into the lowest pit of deficiency.
The perfect man is the one who fully actualizes his potential for
perfection. He is the vicegerent of God, the microcosm, the bearer of
God’s trust, the intermediary cause of creation, the ultimate goal of
the world, the channel for sustaining the world and guardian of the
world, the friend of God, the mirror through which one can see God, the
master, guide and perfect example in the journey toward God, the
prophet, the Imam.
