Chapter 1 : Religion
====================

Religion means a particular system of faith and worship. When we
believe in something strongly and firmly, we say it is my religion. So
by definition, if we do not act in accordance to our religious faith and
belief, it means that we do not really believe in that religion. If we
do things against the teachings of our religion then it means that we do
not have faith in our religion. The Holy Quran has told us about such
people.

"Of the people there are some who say: we believe in Allah and the last
day;' but they do not (really) believe." (2:8)

The Holy Quran does not recognise anyone as Muslim if he or she is not
practising its teachings. Thus, a true Muslim is one who follows the
teachings of Islam at all times. If we are tr ue Muslims then we should
follow the laws of Islam in and out side our home, i.e. in classroom, in
playground, in mosque , on streets and where ever we are.

In Islamic terminology, the word 'Deen' is used for religion. But Deen
is much more

comprehensive in its magnitude than Religion. Thus, our Deen is Islam
which is more than a Religion.

Unlike other religions which are confined to worship only, Islam
offers:

G a complete code of life.
G a code of behavior.
G a perfect system of social interactions.
G a full constitution of government.
G a balanced curriculam of comprehensive education.
G a right approach to conscious seientific exploration.

**Is religion necessary ?**

There are many people in this world who do not believe in religion.
They think that religion is not necessary. They give some baseless
arguments in suppor t of their assumption. For instance, they say;

1. Man knows what is good and what is bad for him. So he does not need
any prophet to teach him.

2. There are many different religions in this world with entirely
different teachings and contradictory concepts. Interestingly enough,
all religions proclaim that they alone have all the truth while others
are wrong. How can it be true?

3. Religious restrictions and commandments consume a lot of human
energy and time. So religion is a barrier in progress and scientific
advancement.

4. Religion does not allow us to enjoy life.

We can convincingly prove that all these arguments are totally baseless
and have no substance in them.

Let us analyze the contents of each argument one by one.

1. It is true that Allah (swt) has given man marvelous brain which can
identify good and bad. But still we find that people greatly differ in
their judgment about good and bad things.

For instance, many people appreciate nudity, drinking alcohol, gambling
and many other such acts which are regarded by others as heinous crimes.
Moreover, human brain has certain limits beyond which it can not
perceive.

We can know by scientific explorations what is happening on Moon, Mars,
and in all other planets. But we can never know by any sophisticated
technology the facts of grave and burzakh, and the events that will
occur in the hereafter. For all such information, we need a prophet who
has direct communication with Allah(swt), The Lord of the Universe.

Thus, undoubtedly men are intelligent beings but they cer tainly need
the help of prophets in almost every field of knowledge.

We can see today that world's top scientists are doing grave mistakes
just because they do not follow the teachings of the Holy prophets.
There is no dispute today that scientific and technological advancement
has become a threat to mankind.


Thus, human intellect is not sufficient to discover all the realities
of the universe. The tr ue religion teaches us all those things which no
one can discover by his effor ts.

2. It is true that there are many different religions with different
teachings and none of them are true except one.

The true religion can be discovered by everyone after research. For
instance, in market we know both pure and impure, real and ar tificial,
good and defective things are sold by the people. Everyone claims that
he has the pure, real and good things which is not always correct.

What do we usually do in all such cases ? Do we stop buying things
because many are selling impure or defective things and everyone is
claiming that he alone has the best and pure things ? Not at all. We
make all possible efforts to find the shop which is selling the right
things.

Similarly if one realizes the impor tance of religion, he or she can
identify the true religion after research and studies.

3. The third argument is also grossly wrong. We spend a lot of time in
eating, sleeping, resting, playing and socializing with people. The
consumption of time and energy in all these natural functions is quite
high. But we never complain that these acts (sleeping, eating and
meetings) are wasting a lot of our time and energy and therefore we
should stop them in order to progress in science and technology.

In fact, we realize that moderate eating, sleeping, and playing
generate energy to do more work. Similarly worshipping Allah subhanu
taala increases our potential to do more scientific work.

A person who sincerely worships Allah(swt) with understanding will
never waste his time in watching useless films, listening music,
gambling in casinos or any other hopeless thing. People waste their
tremendous amount of energy and time in doing the things which are
prohibited in Islam.

Thus, by following the teachings of the true religion we not only save
our precious time and energy but also use them for constructive work.

4. The fourth argument is also not correct. The true religion makes our
life full of pleasure. Many chronic diseases such as AIDS, cancer, and
heart problems are making human life miserable. No one can enjoy life
with fear that he can be the next victim of any of these killing
diseases. But the true followers of the true religion have no fear. They
know that life in this world is temporary and ultimately they have to
leave this world for another permanent world.

Thus, for a purposeful and prosperous life religion is essential.
However, the choice of a wrong religion can destroy the life here and
here-after.

Finally, we can prove that religion is necessary by analyzing
ourselves. We have a natural instinct to know about ourselves. We can
feel this urge in times when we are free of external pressures. For
instance, it has been observed in many cases of serious car accidents,
that when the unconscious person recovers, he instantly asks many
questions to the people standing around him. He asks; where I am ? How I
came here ? Who brought me here ? What has happened to me ? Am I safe
?

All such questions clearly show that man has a natural instinct to
know: from where he has come and where he has to go finally. The true
religion has the correct answers to these questions. If anyone is
ignoring these questions then it means that he is insensible.

This is what Ammr-ul-momineen Hazrat Ali (as) said in one of his
sermons ; " People are sleeping, they will awake after their death." The
true religion tells us many things which we can never know from any
other source. For instance, Islam gives us correct answers of the
following difficult questions :

**Who has created the universe ?**

Who has created the millions of types of living species ?


Who has made humans superior over all the creatures?

Why has He created us ?

No one can know how the universe and every thing in it has come into
existence. What scientists tell us about the origin of the universe and
the living creatures is their guesswork.

This is the reason that there are many different theories in science
with entirely different explanations. For instance, Big-bang theory,
Steady state theory, and theory of evolution give different stories
about the existence of the universe. Until today, no scientist can say
with certainty that he really knows about the origin of the universe and
life.

But the holy Quran tell us very clearly about the origin of the
universe.

"He (Allah) created the heavens and the universe..... He makes the
night overlaps the day and the day overlaps the night. He has subjected
the sun and the moon to His laws. Each follows the course for a fixed
time ---- Is not He the Exalted in Power - HE Who forgives again and
again. (39:5)

The basic aim of this lesson is to equip you to fight intellectually
with the false propaganda of the West which they have been tactfully
doing against the religion. The students should realize that religion is
a necessity of life.
