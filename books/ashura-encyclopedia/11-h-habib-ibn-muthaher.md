H - Habib Ibn Muthaher
======================

He was a loyal and close friend of the prophet Muhammad (pbuh&hf), and
was originally from the tribe of Bani Asad. He fought with Imam Ali Ibn
Abi Talib in all his battles and the Imam Ali taught him "Ilm Almanaya
was Albalaya" which means that Habib could fore- see into the future and
know how any given person would die. He gave his allegiance to Muslim
Ibn Aqeel in Kufah. He also was a close friend of Maytham Al-Tammar, a
loyal companion of Imam Ali.
