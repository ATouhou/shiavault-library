More Arguments On the Hadith
============================

The Sunni argument for the prohibition of Mut'a based upon the Hadith
can be summarized as follows: The reason that the scholars have differed
concerning Mut'a is that it was permitted and then banned a number of
times.

Ibn al-Arabi (d. 638/1240), the famous Sufi who wrote on the meaning of
the Shari'ah, calls Mut'a one of the most remarkable edicts in Islamic
law, since it was permitted at the beginning of Islam, then forbidden at
the Battle of Khaibar, then permitted again at the war of Autas.

Finally it was forbidden and remained forbidden. No other edict in
Islam was changed a number of times with the exception of the Qibla (the
direction of prayer), for that was abrogated twice before being
finalized.

Al-Qurtubi reports that other authorities who have studied the
traditions concerning Mut'a say that its edict was changed seven times.
He refers to the traditions in six Sunni collections explaining how the
situation of Mut'a was changed.

As for the Hadith of Sabra, which states that the Prophet permitted
Mut'a at the Farewell Pilgrimage in the year 10/632, Abu Ja'far
al-Tahawi acknowledges that this is not in keeping with the other
Hadith. He explains that the Prophet permitted Mut'a at the conquest of
Mecca, when the men complained of separation from their wives.

They could not have complained of such separation during the Farewell
Pilgrimage, since all of the wives were present, and the single men
could have taken permanent wives in Mecca. So the special situation that
existed during the other journeys and battles was lacking.

However, we can explain the situation as follows: Since the Prophet
usually permitted Mut'a during journeys away from Medina, in this case
also he permitted it; but then he banned it for the final time wanting
all the Muslims to know about it, for all of them were present for the
Farewell Pilgrimage.

There is also the fact that the Meccans were in the habit of practicing
Mut'a widely. Thus the Prophet banned Mut'a in Mecca so that they would
understand that they could not continue in their former custom.

The Shia answer to the Sunni argument on the basis of Hadith can be
summarized as follows: As has been mentioned already, if Mut'a was made
forbidden in the last pilgrimage where according to al-Tahawi's argument
most of the Muslims were with the Prophet, then how can only Sabra have
heard of the saying of the Prophet?! Moreover, the Hadith demonstrating
that Mut'a is forbidden are in conflict with those that show it is
permitted.

They also conflict with Hadith that show that Mut'a continued to be
permitted during the times of the Prophet, Abu Bakr, and Umar, up until
the time that Umar banned it. The correct course of action is to prefer
those Hadith which establish its permissibility, for a number of
reasons:

(a) The Hadith indicating the permissibility of Mut'a outnumber those
which show that it is banned.

(b) Everyone agrees that the, traditions indicating that Mut'a was
permitted at certain times are authentic and have been transmitted in
parallel, but this is not the case concerning those which indicate that
it was banned.

Hence one can speak of a consensus (Ijma') in the sense that all
Muslims at one time agreed that Mut'a was permitted, even though
afterwards a disagreement arose. In order to choose the right course, we
can not base ourselves upon opinion but must hold fast to that which we
have certainty. Hence we must conclude that Mut'a is still permitted, as
long as we do not have firm knowledge to the contrary.

(c) The traditions which point to the banning of Mut'a are themselves
questionable. When we realize that one of the incontestable elements of
Shia as established by the Imams of Ahlul-Bayt is the permissibility of
Mut'a, then no Hadith related from Ali stating that Mut'a is forbidden
can be authentic.

Someone who held without question that Mut'a is permissible would not
relate a Hadith from the Prophet that it is forbidden. On many occasions
Ali censured Umar's banning of Mut'a. His saying: 'If Umar had not
banned Mut'a, no one but the wretched would practice fornication' is
well-known, and no one has questioned its authenticity.

Reference: Jawahir, v5, pp 162-163.

Those who hold that Mut'a is forbidden have also claimed the consensus
of the Community as one of their proofs. They say that after Umar banned
Mut'a, all of the Prophet's Companions went along with him with the
exception of Ibn Abbas, and perhaps he might have changed his opinion
towards the end of his life.

In answer to this claim, the Shia point out that 'consensus' was never
established for the banning of Mut'a; and in any case, the very fact
that the Shia Imams (the Household of the Prophet) who are the very
pillars of Islam, have all agreed that Mut'a is permitted shows that
there was in fact no consensus.

Moreover, from the first the Shia have agreed on the permissibility of
Mut'a, to such an extent that this view has always been singled out as
one of the specific features of Shia. Given this fact, to claim
consensus is meaningless. In addition, as we have seen above, many of
the Prophet's outstanding Companions and their followers held that Mut'a
was permitted.

Finally, the claim that Ibn Abbas changed his view on Mut'a toward the
end of his life has never been substantiated. Even if it were to be
proven, one could only claim consensus if we were certain that no one
was opposed to the view that Mut'a is forbidden; whereas we know that in
fact the number of opponents was quite large.

In short, the Shia conclude, there is no real evidence to show that
Mut'a is not permitted; and when the Hadith are investigated, the
conclusion is likely to be reached that not only is it permitted
(Mubaah), it is even recommended (Mustahabb).

**The Opinion of the Four Sunni Schools of Law**

The four Sunni schools of law agree that temporary marriage is invalid.
That which invalidates the contract is the stipulation of a time period.
If such a marriage takes place, it must be annulled, and if it is
consummated before the annulment takes place, the woman must be paid the
"normal dowry".

The Shafi'i school adds that even if the time period stipulated by the
contract is the life-time of the husband or the wife, the contract is
still invalid, since the contract of marriage requires that its effects
continue after death.

That is why a spouse may give his or her spouse the ritual purification
of the dead before burial (otherwise, the washer of the dead must be of
the same sex as the corpse). A marriage contracted with a stipulation
that it comes to an end when one of the spouses dies would mean that the
effects of the marriage would end at death. So such a stipulation
invalidates the contract.

The Hanafis add that if the time period stipulated is so long that as a
rule the spouses could not remain alive until it comes to an end (e.g.,
if the man were to say: "I will marry you until the hour of
Resurrection"), then we can no longer call the marriage "temporary". in
effect this stipulation means forever.

Hence it is not considered as a stipulation of a time-period and the
contract is sound. If the husband's intention in contracting the
marriage is to enjoy the woman's company only for a period of time, but
he does not make such a stipulation in the contract, the marriage is
correct.

In the same way, if a person should marry making it a condition of the
contract that a divorce will take place after a certain period of time,
the contract is correct but the condition is nullified, since such a
condition can not limit the contract.

Reference: Fiqh Ala al-Madhahib al-Arba'a, v4, pp 90-94

In any case the four Sunni sects agree that the punishment for a person
who enters into a temporary marriage is not the same as that of the
fornication. In the latter case the punishment (Hadd) is 100 lashes for
each party in the case of an unmarried woman, and stoning to death in
the case of a married woman.

But the punishment for Mut'a is defined as Ta'zeer, i.e., less than the
full punishment for fornication, depending on circumstances and the
opinion of the judge. The penalty for fornication is not specified by
the Sunnis because certain doubts remain concerning the status of Mut'a
as a result of the traditions of Ibn Abbas.

**The Opinion of the Shia School of Law**

The Shia have always considered Mut'a to be of special importance and
have tried to keep it alive as an institution of Islamic society. The
Shia law of Jurisprudence is often referred to as the "Ja'fari school of
law", since in reality the sixth Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq (AS), had a
golden opportunity of teaching during the clashes between the Umayad and
the Abbasid.

During that short period when the tyrants of both sides were busy with
each other, the Imam was teaching Jurisprudence and theology in classes
with as much as 5000 students. Hence it is appropriate to quote a few of
his many sayings concerning the Mut'a.

Imam Ja'far Sadiq (AS) said: "Mut'a was approved by the text of the
Quran and became part of the Sunnah of the Prophet." (Wasa'il al-Shia,
v14, p437).

Imam Ja'far considered the Quranic verse referred to above (4:24) the
basis for Mut'a. He said: "The verse proves the permissibility of
Mut'a." (Wasa'il al-Shia, v14, p439).

Once Abu Hanifa, the founder of one of the four Sunni sects (who was a
student of the Imam Ja'far before he starts his business), asked the
Imam about Mut'a. He replied: "Which of the two Mut'a do you mean?" Abu
Hanifa answered: "I have already asked you about the Mut'a of the
Hajj.

So tell me about the Mut'a of marriage." The Imam said, "Glory be to
God! Have you not read the Quran? 'So those of them whom you enjoy, give
to them their appointed wages' (4:24)." (Wasa'il al-Shia, v14, p437).

Someone asked Imam Ja'far (AS): "Why is it that four witnesses are
necessary [for proof to be established] in cases of adultery, but two
are sufficient in the case of murder?" He replied: "God made Mut'a
permissible for you, but He knew that you would not approve of it. So He
made the witnesses to number four as a protection for you.

If it were not for that, it would be brought against you [that you are
committing fornication, whereas you are in fact practicing Mut'a]. But
seldom do four witnesses come together on a single matter." (Wasa'il
al-Shia, v14, p439).

The Imam Ja'far (AS) considered Mut'a a divine mercy by means of which
people were saved from the sin of fornication and delivered from God's
retribution. Concerning the Quranic verse: "Whatsoever mercy God opens
to men, none can withhold (35:2)," the Imam said: "Mut'a is part of that
mercy." (Wasa'il al-Shia, v14, p439).

The Imam Ja'far said: "I do not like a man to leave this world without
having married temporarily, even if only on one occasion." (Wasa'il al-
Shia, v14, p444).

The Imam Ja'far said: "It is reprehensible in my eyes that a man dies
while there yet remains a practice of the Messenger of God that he has
not adopted." He was asked: "And did the Messenger of God practice Mut'a
?" He replied: "Yes." Then he recited the Quranic verse: "And when the
Prophet confided to one of his wives a certain matter...(66:3-5)"
(Wasa'il al-Shia, v14, p442).

Note how beautiful the Imam explains the reason why one should uphold
the practice of Mut'a. The encouragement, promotion, and rewards for the
Mut'a are not for the physical/sexual action, but are rather due to
REVIVING the Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH&HF) which has been forsaken by
the majority of Muslims. If Umar would not have abolished this Sunnah of
the Prophet, such reward would not have been attached to the Mut'a.

The Shia call Abu Ja'far Muhammad al-Tusi (d. 460/1068) the "Elder of
the Denomination" (Shaikh al-Ta'ifa), since he was the first who
organized a systematic methodology for demonstrative jurisprudence
(al-Fiqh al- Istidlali). We can conclude this discussion with a summary
of his views on Mut'a. He writes that the Shia reasons for considering
Mut'a permissible are as follows:

- The Consensus of the Twelver Shi'ites.

- The words of the Quran : "Marry such women as seen good to you!
(4:3)," since Mut'a is a kind of marriage, but one which men desire to
perform by expending their property.

- The words of the Quran: "So those of them whom you enjoy, give to
them their appointed wages (4:24)." The word Istimta'a (enjoy), unless
otherwise qualified, signifies temporary marriage.

- Ibn Masud's version of the Quran, which adds the words "to an
appointed time" to the above verse.

- There is no disagreement over the fact that Mut'a was allowed at the
beginning of Islam. So those who claim that the verse was abrogated must
prove their assertion.

- The principle from which discussion must begin is that Mut'a is
permitted. That it should be forbidden should be proven.

- The words of Umar concerning the two types of Mut'a. Here Umar tells
us that at the time of the Prophet, Mut'a was permitted, i.e., that it
was a part of the religion of Islam. Proof must be provided that it is
no longer so.

Reference: al-Khilaf, v2, pp 179-180

After referring to the above reasons, al-Tusi answers the arguments of
those who claim Mut'a is forbidden in much the same way that we have
seen above.
