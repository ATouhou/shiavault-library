Discourse Two Criticism and Scrutiny of Analyses Propagated About Consultation of Caliphs With Ali
==================================================================================================

What doubts are propagated in this regard?
------------------------------------------

One of the wrong analyses propagated by some extremist unity-seekers is
that in spite of differences between Ali and Caliphs, the Caliphs
consulted Ali whenever necessary.

They thus say:

“He**[1]** sought answers to his difficulties in Ali’s company. Ali
explained to him issues not clear to him. And he executed Ali’s judicial
decrees. Ali too like a kind lover used to guide his beloved. He did not
keep anything short from him. We shall deal with Ali’s practical conduct
with Umar. This will show good relations between these two great
historical persons.”!**[2]**

Does Consultation Alone Suffices to Prove Good Relations?
---------------------------------------------------------

Now our aim is to answer this question: to offer consultation or to give
opinion on various issues wherein ignorance of Caliphs pushed and
enmeshed them which was about to leave bad effects on Islamic
legislation and spoil fundamentals, is it enough to show existence of a
lover and a beloved type of relations? In later chapters we shall dwell
upon relations between Ali and Caliphs on the basis of historical
evidences.

While it is that:

“It must be acknowledged that had not the Imam gone to help the Caliphs,
Muslims would have been involved in a great chaos. It was likely that
Muslims could have even apostised. Or when they did not receive an
answer, Islam itself would have fallen into suspicion and it was likely
they would have denounced Islam as a false religion.”**[3]**

Reply to this question needs a thorough research regarding consultation

But first only by way of logical refutation we want to mention that by
studying history we can also find cases in which Muawiyah sought Ali’s
opinion.

The table given below show instances of Muawiyah referring to Hazrat Ali
(a.s.), taken from the valuable book of *Ali and the Caliphs* by
contemporary research scholar, Shaykh Najmuddin Askari.

On investigation it does not remain concealed that relationship of
Muawiyah with Amirul Momineen (a.s.) was in no sense cordial and these
referrals and consultations in no way prove good relations between them.
Except that we want to be careful in passing off as good straining of
relations of the Imam (a.s.) with Muawiyah and for the aspect of
protecting Muslim unity suffice to say:

“But he took Muawiyah to task because his act had gone beyond the

Analysis of Consultation of Caliphs with Amirul Momineen (a.s.) on the basis of Statistical Scrutiny
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the basis of this only consultation does not describe the motives of
the two sides and for obtaining correct analysis from consultation of
Caliphs with Amirul Momineen (a.s.) it is necessary to examine each
instance of these consultations case by case basis. We should classify
each instance according to the subject of inquiry and mode of referral
etc. and then analyse on the basis of statistics.

Therefore we have made a systematic table of all instances of referrals
in the book, *Min Noor-e-Ali, Part Two, Ali wa Khulafa*,**[2]** written
by Shaykh Najmuddin Askari, and classified by subject of inquiry and
mode of consultation.
