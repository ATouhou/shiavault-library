216. A conjunct is that whose meaning is not complete except by the
sentence mentioned after it called a relative clause.

217. There are two types of conjuncts: specific and common.

218. Specific conjuncts become masculine and feminine and dual and
plural unlike common conjuncts that remain in one form in all cases.

219. The specific conjuncts are:

• Masculine:

    1. **الّذی** (single)

    3. **اللّذانِ اللّذَینِ** (dual)

    5. **اللّذِینَ** (plural)

• Feminine:

    1. **الّتی** (single)

    3. **اللّتانِ اللّّتَینِ** (dual)

    5. **اللّواتی اللاتی اللائی** (plural)

220. The common conjuncts are: **من ، من ، ذا ، هي.**

221. *Man* is used for beings with intellect, for example: **اِقبَل
عُذرَ مَنِ اعتذرَ إلیکَ** and *mā* is used for beings without intellect,
for example: اِ**غفِر لنا ما فَرَطَ مِنَّا.**

222. *Dhā* is used for beings with and without intellect and it
condition is that it comes after an interrogative *man* or *mā*, not
alluding to it or compounded with it, for example: **ماذا فعلتَ؟**

223. *Ay* is for beings with and without intellect and is different from
all other conjuncts in that it is always dynamic, for example:**یسرُّني
أیُّهم هو قادمٌ,** except if the pronoun that comes at the beginning of
the relative clause is erased, in this case it is indeclinable on a
*dummah*, for example**:یسرُّني أیُّهم قادم**ٌ.
