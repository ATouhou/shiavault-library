Conclusion
==========

From our discussion it has become clear that the spiritual life in Islam
is wider in its scope and more profound in its depth than what is found
in other religions, for, as we have explained, Islam in its breadth has
laid down detailed guidelines for all of the possible situations of
human existence, whether as regards this world or the next; and in its
upward flight and its depth it aims at a goal beyond that of other
creeds.Â
