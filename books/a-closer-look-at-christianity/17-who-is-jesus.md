Who is Jesus?
=============

If Jesus is not God, not the son of God, and not one of three (trinity),
then who is Jesus? I have briefly discussed this in Chapter Three “Is
Jesus the Son of God?” This time I would like to expand on Jesus’ life
(peace be upon him). I want to talk about Jesus from birth, starting
with his mother (peace be upon them both) till the day he was taken up
to God.
