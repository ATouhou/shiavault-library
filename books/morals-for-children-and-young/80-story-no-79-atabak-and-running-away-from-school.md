Story no. 79: Atabak and running away from school.
==================================================

Atabak was tired and fed-up of having to go to school and attend
classes.  
 So he ran away from school.  
 His father and mother tried their best to persuade him to go back, but
it was all in vain.  
 At last he left school and used to play in te streets and do nothing
else.  
 After some days, some relatives of his came to his town and brought
gifts for everyone.  
 They gave Atabak a frame on which was written ‘Seek education from the
cradle till death’.  
 Because he was illiterate, he was greatly ashamed, and at the same
time, decided to continue education.  
 He did so, and not only was he no longer illiterate, he reached high
status.
