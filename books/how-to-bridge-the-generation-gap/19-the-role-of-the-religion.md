The Role of the Religion
========================

The Father
----------

Our questioning bout religious matters is a highly recommended and
acceptable deed. In order to have a stronger faith, one should accept
religious matters only after conducting a thorough conscientious
research. These questions not only will not upset your father and
mother, but rather, will make them hopeful of a happy future for you.
That is because religion is the means of improving peoples conduct. The
Prophet (S.) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اني بعثت لا تمم مكارم الاخلاق
  </p>
</blockquote>

“I was assigned (to Prohethood) so that human being may achieve
perfection in good conduct.” [^1]  
 Anyone who approaches religion has a better conduct.

This better conduct in itself, is the source of happiness. Therefore,
the parents are dutiful to accept such a child with open arms and to
offer him religious guidance following logic of the Holy Qur'an as it
says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ادْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Invite (all) to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful
preaching: and argue with them in ways that are best and most
gracious.”*** **(The Holy Qur'an 16: 125)**

Therefore parents are obliged to provide easy answers for the different
religious questions raised by their children.

The Child
---------

It is very pleasing to see you agree with me on this particular subject.
I should thank you for that and I am hopeful that with your help and
guidance, I will be able to acquire new knowledge about religion.
