105. The Haal Construction الحال
================================

As indicated earlier the active participle can be used in the Haal
Construction. It has to be indefinite and in the accusative case. It has
to agree with the modified noun in number and gender. Also, you need to
remember that the**Haal** could be a clause. Notice how the following
sentence can be expressed.

<p dir="rtl">
حضَرَتِ الطالِبَة ُ إلی الصَّفِّ حامِلـَة ً کـُتـُبَها.
</p>

**    The student (f) came to class carrying her book.**

1. حضَرَتِ الطالِبَة ُ إلی الصَّفِّ وهي تـَحمِلُ کـُتـُبَها.

2. حضَرَتِ الطالِبَة ُ إلی الصَّفِّ تـَحمِلُ  کـُتـُبَها.

You might have noticed that the verb of the Haal Clause has to be in the
present indicative mood. Because the verb** حَمَلَ** is transitive, the
active participle derived from it would take an object. That is why the
noun**کـُتـُبَها** in the sentence above is in the accusative case.

Obviously, if a verb is intransitive, such as** ** ** ضَحِكَ** , the
active participlewill not require an object. Check the following
sentence:

<p dir="rtl">
**حَضَرَتِ الطالِبَة ُ إلی الصَّفِّ ضاحِکـَة ً.**
</p>

The student (f) came to class smiling.

**You need to remember that whether the Haal Construction  الحال is
expressed by a verbal sentence or an equational sentence, the
independent pronoun agrees with the noun modified by the .الحال**

<p dir="rtl">
**دَرَسَ العَرَبيَّة َوهو **صَغيرٌ.****
