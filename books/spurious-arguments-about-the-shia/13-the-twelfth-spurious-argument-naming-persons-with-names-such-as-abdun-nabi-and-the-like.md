The Twelfth Spurious Argument: Naming Persons with names such as Abdun-Nabi and the like
========================================================================================

Some criticize the Shias because they give their sons names like
Abdun-Nabi óthe Prophet’s slaveó, Abdur- Rasul óthe Messenger’s slaveó,
Abd Ali óthe slave of Alió, Abdul-Husayn óthe slave of Husaynó, whereas
such names are not permissible because servantship for other than Allah
is polytheism.

The Answer
----------

Associationism is to worship other than Allah, either worshipping that
thing alone or along with Allah. Worship is submitting to the worshipped
taking it to be divine and godlike. However the mere using of the word
servant in front of a created thing does not mean worshipping. The Holy
Qur’an and many Prophetic traditions confirm this fact. Allah says,

***And marry those among you who are single and those who are fit among
your male slaves and your female slaves. (Qur’an 24:32)***

It does not mean that the slave worships his master. The same is said
about names like Abdun-Nabi and Abdul- Husayn. At the same time, those
who criticize the Shias for using these names, they themselves call
their bosses “my master’ and they have no problem with it!
