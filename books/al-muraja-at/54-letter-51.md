Rebutting the Arguments Through Similar Ones
--------------------------------------------

**Muharram 14, 1330**

Their debaters may refute your claim by citing texts which enUmarate the
virtues of the three righteous caliphs, and by citing other texts
praising the posterity from the Muhajirun (Meccan Immigrants) and the
Ansar (Medenite Supporters); so, what would you say to that?

Sincerely,

*S*
