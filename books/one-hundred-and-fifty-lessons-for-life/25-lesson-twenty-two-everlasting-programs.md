Lesson twenty two: Everlasting Programs
=======================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إنَّ اللّه لَمْ يَبْعَثْ نَبِيّاً إلاّ بِصِدقِ الْحَدِيثِ وَ أَداءِ
الأَمانَةِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Allah instructed all prophets to invite people to honesty and trust.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

A healthy society is based on a number of core values, the most
important of which is the priceless asset of public confidence and
trust.

This is when the spoken word and actions take place in an environment of
mutual trust. The greatest enemy of this valuable treasure is lies and
treachery.

In the societies in which lies and treachery are popular, people are
afraid of each other, people feel lonely, not knowing who to turn to and
end up bearing a heavy load of life alone.

This is the reason why invitation to honesty and trust has always been
included in programs of all the divine prophets.
