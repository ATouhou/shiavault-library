description: |
  This work contains a number of speeches, articles, books, and
  question-and-answer sessions of the erudite professor, Haḍrat Ayatullah
  Muhammad Taqi Misbah Yazdi (may his sublime presence endure), which have
  been compiled, edited and published by the author on the subject of
  Wilayat al-Faqih. We believe that in the current status of our society,
  wilayat al-faqih constitutes the central pillar of Islam, and its safety
  contributes to the splendor of Islam and Islamic laws and values in the
  society. As such, we have decided to elucidate this theory, support it
  academically and logically, and enlighten the general public,
  particularly the young generation of our country who probably know very
  little about this theory and its ramifications, and thus discharge a
  small part of our religious duty. Likewise, we have tried to deal with
  all the aspects of this theory to address the subjects which we find
  significant and controversial. However, things like the brevity of
  content and the readers’ patience and the time that they have been taken
  into account as far as possible.
