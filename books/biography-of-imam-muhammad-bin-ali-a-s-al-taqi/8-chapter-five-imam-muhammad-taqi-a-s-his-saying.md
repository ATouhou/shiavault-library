Chapter Five : Imam Muhammad Taqi (a.s.) His Saying
===================================================

**INTRODUCTION:**

Although Imam Muhammad Taqi (A.S) lived a very short life, his services
to Islam are many.

After his father he lived for over sixteen years during which he was
busy teaching Islam whether he was in Medina or in Baghdad, As was
pointed out earlier, at one time alone} he was asked thirty thousand
questions on various subjects on Islam and he answered them all.

In this chapter we shall reproduce a few sayings and words of advice
that Imam Muhammad Taqi (A.S.) gave to his followers.

**SAYINGS AND WORDS OF ADVICE**

The Imam (A.S.) is reported to have said:

1. The trust in Allah is like the value of everything that is precious,
and it is also a ladder to every high and sublime goal. 2. A person who
follows his desire ends up yielding to his enemies.

3. Do not act like a friend of Allah in public but His enemy in
private.

4. Who ever had found a helper in Allah, has found a Mansion in
Paradise

5. Imam Muhammad Taqi (A.S.) reports from Imam Ali (A.S.) who said,
"When the Prophet (S.A.W.W.) sent me to Yemen he said, O Ali, any one
who expects goodness from Allah is never disappointed and any one who
asks His guidance has no cause to regret."

6. Imam Muhammad Taqi (A.S.) reports Imam Ali (A.S.) to have said,
"Rise up early in the morning for the pleasure of Allah as Allah bestows
a blessing on those who rise early."

7. Sheikh Sudduq reports in his "Itiqadatul Imaniyyah" that Imam
Muhammad Taqi (A.S.) was asked as to why some Muslims dislike death. The
Imam (A.S.) replied "They are ignorant of it and therefore they dislike
it. If they possessed knowledge of it and were true friends of Allah
they would love it and would surely know that the other world is better
for them than this.

"The Imam (A.S.) added, "O Slave of Allah! Why does the child or the
mad man refuses to take the medicine which cleanses his body and removes
his pain?

I swear by him who sent Muhammad (S.A.W.W.) as the Prophet of truth,
those who prepare themselves for death as they are required, they will
find death a better cure than medicine.

If only they knew what a blessing death would be to them. Then they
would call out for it and desire medicine more than the wise and
resolute man who desires it so as to use it to cure their illness and
recover their health."

8. Imam Taqi (A.S.) also is reported to have advised his followers to
be good to the creation of Allah. He also said that, he who does not act
with concern and compassion for others will find himself deprived of
care and compassion from others.

Such a person will also find himself a target of intense calamities.
The Imam (A.S.) added that any person who stops being good to others
will soon face severe trouble.

9. Warning his followers not to be oppressors, the Imam (A.S.) said
that on the Day of Judgement oppressors will be in a worse position than
those whom they oppressed in this world.
