 The Noble Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) has said:  
  

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ حَفِظَ عَـلـى أُمَّتِـي أَرْبَعِينَ حَدِيثًا يَـنْتَفِعُونَ بِهَا
بَعَـثَهُ اللهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَقِيهاً عَالِـماً.

*“The person from amongst my nation who memorizes forty traditions
pertaining to those issues of religion which he is in need of, Allah
shall resurrect him on the Day of Judgment as a scholar with a deep
insight into the faith.”*

In following the above hadith, The Islamic Education Board of The World
Federation of KSIMC (IEB ‑ WF) has decided to publish a series of
booklets of 40 ahadith on different subjects. The ahadith, which have
been selected from various sources, are short and simple and therefore
easy to understand and memorize. It is envisaged that the booklets will
not only be useful for Zakireen, Madrasah teachers and students, but
will be of benefit to the Ummah at large.

The collection of the ahadith, together with their translation in
English, was carried out by Shaykh Shahnawaz Mahdavi.  IEB ‑ WF would
like to thank Shaykh Mahdavi for his efforts in the compilation and
translation of this work. May Allah (Glory and Greatness be to Him)
accept this work as a further attempt by IEB ‑ WF to propagate Islam.
