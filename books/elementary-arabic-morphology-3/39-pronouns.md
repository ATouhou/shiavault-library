209. A pronoun is a word that takes the place of an apparent meaning,
for example: **هُوَ** which takes the place of whoever it is referring
to.

210. There are two types of pronouns: separated pronouns which are
either inchoatives or are mentioned after **إلا,** for example: **هوَ
نائمٌ و ما نائمٌ إلا هو,** or connected pronouns which are like a part
of the word that comes before them, for example: **الهاء** in
**رَحِمَهُ.**

211. There are two types of separated pronouns in relation to their
case: nominative **(هو ، هما ، هم ، هي ، هما ، هنَّ ، أنت ، أنتما ، أنتم
، أنت ، أنتما ، أنتنَّ ، أنا ، نحن)** and accusative **(إیّاه ، إیّاهما
، إیّاهم ، إیّاها ، إیّاهما ، إیّاهنَّ ، إیّاهک ، إیّاهکما ، إیّاهکم ،
إیّاهک ، إیّاکما ، إیّآهکنَّ ، إیّاهي ، إیّاهنا** **).**

212. There are three types of connected pronouns in relation to their
designated case: those who are only nominative (*alif, wāw, nūn, yā' and
tā'*), for example: **قاموا,** those that are either accusative or
genitive (the first person *yā'*, the second person *kāf*, and the third
person *hā'*), for example: **أکرَمَکَ سیَّدک,** and those that come in
the nominative, accusative, and genitive cases which is the **نا,** for
example: **ربَّنا إنَّنا سمعنا** .
