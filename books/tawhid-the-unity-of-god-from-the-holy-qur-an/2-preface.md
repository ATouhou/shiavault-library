Preface
=======

The fundamental principle in which Islam is very insistent is that all
believers should have an overall and clear understanding of their
Creator and to maintain a true and fruitful relationship with Him.

This is expressed through Tawhid, on which we have concentrated in this
pamphlet, by collecting some of the holy verses of the Holy Qur'an.
