62. Angels seek forgiveness
===========================

That which proves this honor is a tradition mentioned in the first
volume of *Biharul Anwar* from His Eminence, Abu Abdillah Sadiq (as)
that he said to Dawood bin Sarhan:

“O Dawood, convey my greetings to my followers and tell them: May Allah
have mercy on one who meets another and discusses our matter as the
third of them will be an angel who will seek forgiveness for them, and
no two people gather to talk about us, but that the Almighty Allah boast
to His angels with regard to them. Thus whenever you have a gathering
you must have discussions about us as your gathering and talking about
us is revival of our matter and the best of people after us are those
who talk about our affair (*Wilayat*) and who invite to our
remembrance.”[^1]

I say: The point of evidence is that praying for an early reappearance
of our master, the Master of the Time (aj) is the most obvious
implication of this and this description best fits the supplicants for
Imam Mahdi (aj). May the Almighty Allah give us the *Tawfeeq* to become
one of these.
