Lesson Forty Four: Some Signs of Belief
=======================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلْمُؤْمِنُ حَسَنُ الْمَعُونَةِ خَفِيفُ الْمَؤُنَةِ، جَيِّدُ
التَّدْبِيرِ لِمَعِيْشَتِهِ لا يَلْسَعُ مِنْ جُحْر مَرَّتَيْنِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

A believer provides valuable assistance, has low expenditure, and is
prudent in life, and is never bitten twice from one hole (never
inflicted twice from one source). [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Belief has some scientific, moral and social manifestation and signs,
without which it is only a meaningless name. The above tradition refers
to four signs of it:

1- believers provide valuable assistance to their Muslim brothers
because their help is accompanied with compassion, honesty and
awareness.

2- they do not have a luxurious and costly standard of living and do not
commit offenses to provide for it.

3- they are prudent and aware in life especially in economic affairs.

4- they take lesson from each event immediately and thus they are not
inflicted twice from the same source.
