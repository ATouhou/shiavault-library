Lesson One Hundred Twenty Nine: Place Of Knowledge And Wisdom
=============================================================

Imam Al-Kadhim (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اِنَّ الزَّرْعَ يَنْبُتُ فِى السَّهْلِ وَ لايَنْبُتُ فِى الصَّفا
فَكَذلِكَ الْحِكْمَةُ تَعْمُرُ فِى قَلْبِ الْمُتَواضِعِ وَ لا تَعْمُرُ
فى قَلْبِ الْمُتَكَبِّرِ الْجَبّارِ!
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Cultivation grows on soft land, not on the stones! Similarly knowledge
and wisdom sprout on the heart of modest people, not on the heart of the
unjust arrogant persons![^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The first step in acquiring knowledge is humility: humility towards
truth, humility towards the teacher and anyone who knows more than us
and could teach us something.

For this reason, ignorance and arrogance usually go hand in hand.
Arrogant ones never admit their ignorance, and if a reality happens to
be different from that which serves their pride and arrogance, they
would deny it and oppose it. They do not accept the truth from anyone
and remain engulfed in their ignorance.
