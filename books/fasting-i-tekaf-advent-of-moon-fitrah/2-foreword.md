rituals and decrees associated with **fasting** & **iâ€™tekaf**.

earlier by few Momineen in the form of pamphlet. It was felt appropriate

Care has been taken to sideline the differences in verdicts of these
Mujtahids except where necessary. Every care has been taken to narrate
the **precautionary** **aspect** of their verdicts.

Those interested in details please refer to ***Tozeeh-ul-Masail*** and
other books.

To make the book **reader** **friendly**, easy and familiar words have
been used so that the reader does not feel any inconvenience to
understand.

intention of ***Rijay-e-Matloobiat***.
