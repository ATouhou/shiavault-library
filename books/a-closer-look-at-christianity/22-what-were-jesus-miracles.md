What were Jesus’ miracles?
==========================

Jesus (P.B.U.H.) had many miracles. They are mentioned in the Holy
Quran, and I have already mentioned two of them: the first being his
birth without a father, and the other being his speech while he was in
the cradle. God says in the Holy Quran,

“And will send him as a Messenger to the Children of Israel with the
Message, ‘I come to you with a Sign from your Lord, which is, that I
will fashion out for you a creation out of clay after the manner of a
bird; then I will breathe into it a new spirit and it will become a
soaring being by the command of ALLAH; and I will heal the night blind
and the leprous, and I will quicken the dead by the command of ALLAH;
and I will announce to you what you will eat and what you will store up
in your houses. Surely therein is a Sign for you, if you are
believers.’” (Ch 3: Vr 49).

• He was able to make birds out of clay, and breathe life into them.

• He was able to bring back the dead to life.

• He was able to predict what people stored of food.

• He was able to heal the blind, and the leprous.

• He was able to do all this by God’s permission and will.
