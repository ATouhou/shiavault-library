***In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful***

All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds and may prayer and
peace be upon our master and Prophet, Muhammad, and his pure progeny,
and may Allah’s curse be upon all their enemies from the first to the
last one.

Thaqalain tradition is a famous and well-known tradition that is
reported by [both] Sunnites and Shiites. Hundreds of prominent narrators
and tradition memorizers belonging to various centuries, have narrated
this tradition from around forty male and female companions of the Holy
Prophet (s), using numerous ways.

Since there is no objection about the reporters and the content of this
tradition, some self-interested figures have fabricated the tradition of
adherence to Book (Quran) and Tradition (Prophets Tradition) [instead of
Quran and Prophets Progeny] as two weighty things. The Holy Prophet (s)
according to this tradition which is quoted by Sunnites, said:

**“I am leaving two precious things among you: Allah’s Book and my
tradition.”**

It is worth mentioning that according to some sources the Holy Prophet
(s) said this word in his speech in Farewell Hajj.

The present pamphlet studies this tradition and its reporters,
critically examines them and shows the truth to those who seek it.
