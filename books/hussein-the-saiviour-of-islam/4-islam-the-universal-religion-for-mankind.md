Islam the Universal Religion For Mankind
========================================

THE CONCEPTION OF God in Islam is unique in its strict unitarian
aspect. The jurisdiction of God, is not restricted or limited to any
section of hunianitv or to any part of the world. God according to Islam
is the 'Rabbul- Aalameen' (i.e., The Lord of the Worlds i.e., the
Absolute Monarch of the whole Universe).

Prophets sent before the Holy Prophet Muhammad, were not for the human
race as a whole, they were for particular peoples in various parts of
the earth.

Even Jesus, the immediate predecessor of the Holy Prophet Muhammad,
about his own self, had said:- "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of
the House of Israel."

Math. 15- 22- 26

But Muhammad the Holy Prophet, the Last Apostle of God was not to guide
any particular tribe, community or any part of the human race, but for
mankind as a whole, and the religion Islam was revealed to be current
for all times until the Day of Judgment. The Holy Prophet Mubammad had
been sent as the Rahmatwun- lil Aalameen' (i.e., the Mercy unto the
Worlds or the Universe).

"We have sent thee an Apostle for mankind." 4:19 " Say 0' ye people, I
am the Apostle of God unto you all" 7:158 "We sent thee not but a Mercy
unto the Worlds." 21 :107

"We sent thee not but unto mankind as a whole." 34 :z8 No creed
preached by any religious leader or apostle prior to the Holy Prophet,
was ever given any name, for it was incomplete and no imperfect thing,
is ever given any name. Since the religion preached by the Holy Prophet,
was the divinely perfected code of discipline for human life on earth,
it was named Islam and was prescribed for the human race for all times
till the end of the world.

" This day have I perfected for you your religion and corn- pined My
bounties on you and pleased Islam to be your religion." 3:3 "Verily the
religion with God is Islam and whosoever seeketh . a religion other than
12am, it shall never be accepted of him. 3:18, 4:125, 2:112

**The Holy Qur'an- the Word of God**

THE CODE OF control, regulation and the discipline of the human life on
the earth, called the Holy Qur an, is not a Book edited by any mortal.
It does not contain legends and stories or any collec- tion of folklore
on the life of the Holy Prophet or about the faith Islam. It is the very
Word of God which was recorded then and there as it was revealed to the
Holy Prophet through the Messenger Angel Gabriel, which is a complete
Book, sent down for the use of the pious ones in the human race as a
whole, for all times in all parts of the world.

" This is the Book, there is no doubt therein, a guide for the pious
ones." 2:2

**To Destroy Islam is to Destroy Humanity**

WHEN IsLAM IS the divinely revealed religion for the human race as a
whole, as the only religion acceptable to God (3:84), none but the Devil
alone would aim to destroy or corrupt it, and the one who aims to do it,
would be the worst enemy of mankind. He would naturally be the devil in
human form. And the one who saves the religion from being destroyed or
getting corrupted, would un- doubtedly be the Greatest Benefactor and
the Saviour of Truth and humanity as a whole. It has been clearly
announced by the Lord in the Holy Qur an that the one who saves a single
human life, has saved humanity as a whole.

"Whosoever killeth a person without its being in return for killing a
man, it is as though lie hattb killed mankind as a whole, and whosoever
saveth a life, it is as though he hath saved the life of mankind as a
whole. 5:32 The Fate of the Apostolic Missions, Previous to the Holy
Prophet Muhammad ALTHOUGH THE All-MERCIFuL Lord sent His apostles to
guide humanity in the various parts of the earth, but the satanic
resistance against every such godly mission was also counteracting
against any lasting effect. Most of the apostles were killed. The sacred
heavenly scriptures which were given to those apostles were either
corrupted or made totally extinct. Fabricated stories from the folklore
of the various people, were used as sacred scriptures and mankind was
misled by imposters.

Divine Measures to Secure the Final Word of God for Ever

THE- ALL-KNOWING CREATOR Lord of the Universe, with His infinite
knowledge, knew about the utter darkness which would shroud the human
world, and had also determined the panacea for it,in tile mission of the
Last of His apostles about Thorn Jesus had declared that the Comforter
who would come after him will abide for ever. John 14:16.

As all the previously revealed scriptures had been either cor- rupted
or were made extinct, the Almighty Lord willed that the Holy qur an, His
Final Word, shall be preserved for ever, beyond the reach of any satanic
hands with any questionable intention to meddle with it. The Lord has
declared:

"Verily We sent down the Reminder (The Qur'an) and Verily, We
(Ourselves) shall be its Guardian." Holy Qur'an 15:9 To preserve the
Holy Qur'an in its original purity both in its verbal form as well as
its meaning, and to keep the divine guidance always current and ever
available to every seeker after truth, the Holy Prophet Muhammad was not
sent alone into the world. As Aaron was given to Moses to assist him and
to succeed him, along with the Holy Prophet, his cousin Mi, son of
Abu-Taleb, from the same holy family of Abraham, was given his advent,
to be his Vicegerent and his Successor. Thus was started the line of the
Holy Imams (i.e., the Divinely Commissioned Guides) who were destined to
be the authentic custodians of the Holy Qur'an, and as the fountainheads
of the correct knowledge of the Word of God, to guide mankind towards
the correct belief and the proper practice of the Faith.

If these guides, the Holy Imams, had been from any family, other than
the family of Muhammad, it would have been mis- construed as another
authority parallel to that of the Holy Prophet. The grace of the Lord,
avoided this confusion and established one single authority of the Last
of His apostles, as the unique one, with the unity of purpose. Hence it
was divinely destined that the line of the Divine Guides called the
Jmams, to succeed the Last Apostle, also, to be from the same stock of
the Holy Family of Abraham, and this was also the covenant with
Abraham.

" And as for Iskmael, I have heard thee ; Behold, I have blessed him
and will make him fruitful and I will multi- ply him exceedingly, TWELVE
PRINCES shall he beget and I will make him a great nation. Gen. 18 :20
Both the Holy Prophet Muhammad and his Vicegerent Ali were brought into
the world from one and the same family, with whom the Lord had
established an Everlasting Covenant (Gen. 17 :7, 8).

Muhammad to be the Promised Last Apostle, the 'Comforter' the ' Spirit
of Truth' the ' Holy Ghost', and the 'Maetrea' prophesied by Buddha, and
Ali his cousin, his adopted son, his son-in-law and his Vicegerent to be
the starter of the line of the Promised Twelve Princes or the Twelve
Holy Imams in the seed of Abraham, through Ishmael.

The family ABRAHAM and the Promised Last Apostle MUHAMMAD and the
Twelve Princes (The Holy Imams) **The Divinely Planned Measure for an
Everlasting Guidance to Humanity**

IT IS QUITE obvious that the Divine Plan was to associate the lives of
most of the leading apostles of God, with some tragic ends, for it is an
acknowledged fact of the phenomena of human psychology that human
sympathy always goes without fail, to the victims of an unprovoked
aggression. It was obviously destined to rouse the sympathy and the
support of the whole human world for the Truth for which the martyrs had
sacrificed their lives. It will be seen that most of the apostles of God
and all the divinely chosen guides called the Imams, excepting the
Twelfth one, were martyrs. The story of Jesus is made attractive by its
being narrated by the people of the Christian church associating it with
the alleged crucifixion along with the other sufferings of his at the
hands of the Jews.

Muhammad, the Last Apostle of God, left this world having been poisoned
by one of the Jewesses of Khaiber. Lady Fatema, the Lady of Light, the
beloved daughter of the Holy Prophet, the wife of Au the First Holy
Imani, the mother of Hasan and Husain the Second and the Third Imams,
who had her advent to be a Model of the correct Islamic womanhood on the
earth, was killed by the fall of the door of her abode, caused by some
tyrant.

This Holy Lady suffered so much at the hands of the people after the
departure of her father, the Holy Prophet, that she once addressing the
holy soul of her departed father, said:-

"0' Father dear! after thy departure, fell on me such cala- mities that
if they had fallen on the bright days the days would have turned into
dark nights."

Ali-al-Murtaza

The Vicegerent of the Holy Prophet, the First divinely chosen Imam, was
martyred while in prayer in the Mosque at Kufa. Hasan-al-Mujtaba

The First son of Mi and Fatema, the first grandson of the Holy Prophet
Muhammad and the Second Holy Imam, was martyred by poison. He was made
to leave this world von iitting blood with bits of his liver.

**Husain-Shaheede Karbala**

The Second son of Au and Fatema, the second grandson of the Holy
Prophet and the Third Holy Imam, was butchered at Karbala along with his
faithful devotees, by Yazid son of Ma aviah, a very brief narration of
whose great martyrdom forms the subject of this brief work.

Ali-az-Zainulabideen

The eldest son of 1-Tusain. the Third Imam, and himself the Fourth
Imarn was poisoned by the Omayyid Kalif Walid bin Abdul Malik. Muhammad
al-Ba quir

The son of Ali az-Zainulabideen the Fourth Imam, and himself the Fifth
Imam, was poisoned by Hisham bin Abdul Malik.

Jafer-as-Sadiq The son of Muhammad-al-Baquir the Fifth Imam, and
himself the Sixth Imam, was poisoned by Mansur.

Musa-al-Kazim

The son of Jafer-as-Sadiq the Sixth Imahi and himself the Seventh Imam,
was poisoned by Haroon-ar-Rasheed.

Ali-ar-Riza

The son of Musa-al-Kazirn the Seventh Imam, and himself the Eighth
Imam, was poisoned by Mamun- ar Rasheed.

Muhammad-at -Taqi

The son of Ali-ar-Riza the Eighth lmam, and himself the Ninth Imam, was
poisoned by Mo'tasim.

Ali-an-Naqi

The son of Muhammad-at-Taqi the Ninth Imam, and himself the Tenth Imam,
was poisoned by Mo'tasim.

Hasan-Al-Askari

The son of Ali-an-Naqi, the Tenth barn, and himself the Eleventh Imam,
was poisoned by Mo'tamad.

Muharnrnad-al-Mahdi

The son of Hasan-al-Askari, the Eleventh Imam, and himself the Twelfth
and the Last of the divinely commissioned Imams, was aimed at to be
killed by Mo' tamad, but by the Divine Will, disappeared, and at the
Will of the Almighty, he is alive. This Last Guide in the seed of
Abraham through Ishmael is kept alive and is awaited to reappear at God
s Will, as is the belief about Jesus the Last One in the seed of Abraham
through Isaac.

There are two facts which are obviously wonderful for everyone who
comes across the lives of the Holy Fourteen, (i.e., the Holy Prophet,
his daughter Fatema and the Twelve Imams):

1. The Holy Prophet is known as the unlettered one, i.e., the one who
did not have any education under any mortal in this world and so was
every one of the Holy Fourteen, but every one of them was a fountainhead
of knowledge of the highest order. 2. None of the Holy Ones, save the
Fourteenth, (i.e., the Twelfth Imam) died of any natural death, for all
the thirteen were martyred either secretly by poison or openly killed.
Only the Fourteenth has been spared since he has been divinely secured
and kept alive for the guidance of mankind to the end of the world.

As Islam stands for the uplift of humanity as a whole, any sacrifice
for it would naturally be for the cause of the whole of the Human race.
As it is impossible to accommodate in this brief work here, all the
heart-rending details of the greatest sacrifice offered by Husain, only
a few leading events are mentioned in these few pages which will suffice
to give any intelligent reader, a view of the situation in which Husain
surrendered his all to fulfil the Lord s Covenant to save Humanity from
getting astray after the departure of the Holy Prophet.

The other reference used

HAVING MENTIONED IN the foregoing pages, the blessings, which the Holy
Prophet Muhammad had brought for mankind, it is needless to repeat the
same. Only the relevant events directly con nected with the great
sacrifice are, as a necessity, referred to here for the guidance of the
readers.

{40} Husain's Mother Why the Last Apostle of God was given only a
Daughter and not any son to survive?

THE HOLY PROPHET Muhammad had two Sons and a daughter, but Sons he did
not need, for his apostleship had to conclude with his ministry, and if
any son of the Holy Prophet had survived, it would have given the chance
to the people to hail the son of the Prophet also to be another prophet
of God, whereas there was no prophet to come after him. It may be said
that this was the reason of the male issues of the Holy Apostle leaving
this world, in their very infancy. But the Holy Prophet needed a
daughter of his own purity of spirit and body, to reflect the divine
light of guidance in her ideal character arid present an authentic model
of the correct Islamic womanhood to the world. Hence Fatema, the Lady of
Light, was born to the Holy Prophet, who, for her godly qualities, is
known in the Islamic World by the following epithets :-

1. Az-Zahra - The Shining.
2. Al-Batul - The Liberator of Sinners.
3. A1-Azra - The Clean, the Pure.
4. Sayyeddatun-Nisa - The Chief of Women.
5. Afzalun-Nisa- The Superior-most of women.
6. Kkairun-Nisa- The Best of Women.
7. Mariam al Kubra - The Senior Mary.

Mary, the mother of Jesus, was the mother of only one heavenly guide to
the children of the House of Israel, whereas Lady Farenia besides her
being the daughter of the Holy Apostle of God, was the mother of the
Eleven Divinely Commissioned Guides, (i.e., the Holy Irnams). It is a
unique instance in the history of the world that the issues of a single
pair to have Eleven Heavenly Guides, consecutively one after another.

8. Al-Muharaka - The Blessed one of God.
9. As-Sadiqa - The Truthful.
10. Al-Muhaddisa - The one who talked to her mother from the womb of
her mother even prior to her birth.

(When God could make Jesus talk from the cradle when he was just born,
there cannot be any wonder if the Almighty causes another one blessed by
Him, to act in a similar manner).

There are several other cpitbets of this great heavenly being who was
the Lady of Light. Naturally Husain, the Kino of Martyrs could not have
been born of any ordinary wonian other than the one like the Lady Fatema
with the divine attributes she was exclusively blessed with.

It has already been said that one of the unique distinctions of the
family of the Holy Prophet Muhammad, is that right from the Holy Prophet
down to the Eleventh Imarn, including Idadv Fatema, all the Holy
Thirteen were Martyrs.
