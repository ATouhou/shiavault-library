Lesson Fifty: Slander
=====================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلْغِيْبَةُ جُهْدُ الْعاجِزِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Slander is the last effort of weak people.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Few sins can be found among the capital sins that indicate meanness,
weakness, humiliation, and cowardice like slander does.

Slanderers falsely blame and ascribe faults to others and damage
reputations to satiate the fire of their envy and malice . They are weak
and mean persons who do not have the courage to confront their victims
with their baseless and unfair criticisms and can only stab others in
the back.

It is mentioned in one of the traditions that even if a slanderer
repents and the repentance is accepted, he shall be the last one
entering paradise. Otherwise, he would be the first one entering hell.
