(5) Yazid's Demand For Allegiance
=================================

In the treaty which Hassan and Moawiyah signed

Moawiyah had himself agreed; it was underlined

The question of successor, would not be imposed

But be left to Muslims as they pleased to dispose.

No sooner was the said treaty signed

A campaign was re-started, Ali's name to malign

And to build up Yazid, against people's voice

As heir to the Caliphate, the best of choice.

With rise of Moawiyah, virtue was shamelessly replaced

The democratic rule of Islam, was likewise displaced

The oligarichal rule of heathen was triumphant

The attendant vice and immorality were rampant.

The wealth from his subjects, he pitilessly extracted

He lavished on the mercenaries, who were fully protected

They, in turn, helped to repress ruthlessly all murmuring

With fraud and treachery, were smashed all rumblings.

Before he died, Moawiyah summoned his aides

The oath of fealty to Yazid, he made them take

This was Yazid's solitary title to the Caliphate

It was assumed, as if it was his father's heritage.

Cruel and treacherous was he, as notorious as his father

He lacked pretence, to cloak the game of murder

His depraved nature knew absolutely no pity or justice

He was addicted to the vilest and grossest of vices.

His friends were outcasts of both sexes

He killed and tortured for pleasure and taxes

Such was the Caliph, Commander of the Faithful

A being, whose entire bearings, was most hateful.

Husayn was in Medina; a message was received

By the local governor, in an envelope sealed

Obtain his allegiance, was the strict command

Kill him on the spot, if he refuses the demand.

The governor was unnerved, he was perplexed

To kill Husayn in Medina was no easy t ask

He consulted Marwan; he summoned Husayn

Who well knew Yazid's dirty and nefarious game.

Husayn point blank refused to acknowledge

The title of tyrant; of falsehood and subterfuge

His character, he regarded with contempt and abhorrence

His vices he despised, no less than his arrogance.

He returned to his grandfather's earthly abode

He dreamt of the Prophet, in tearful voice he spoke

" O, son of mine, O thou art a part of me,

The enemies are bent to torment and slay thee."

Accompanied by Zainab he visited the tomb of his mother

What a heart rending scene it was; it caused a shudder!

It was Husayn's last farewell before the fateful journey

Guided by the unseen hand of - shall we say, Destiny

The fateful hour had arrived for the long awaited fight

Between forces of darkness and Angels of Light

Husayn knew that from childhood he had been reared

To perform this sacred mission, he knew absolutely no fear.

"For Mecca I leave, and then for a place beyond"

For a farewell pilgrimage, the plans were drawn

Hurried preparations were made for the journey

An unknown destination was on the itinerary.
