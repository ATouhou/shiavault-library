Preface to the Second Edition
=============================

The first edition of this book was published on 15th Sha'ban, 1388 A.H.
(7/11/1968), by Haji Mohamed A. Khimji. The booklet was introduced in
the classes of Religious Studies in Secondary Schools. Within a short
period the book went out of stock; but the demand increased every day.

Therefore, the Mission has decided to reprint it. This edition has been
completely revised (according to the Fatwa of Agha Syed Abu’l Qasim
al-Khu’i, Dama Dhilluhul-Aali, Najaf, Iraq). Also, many subjects have
been added because of the popular demand. For example, details of
*Ghusl*s, prayers of Ayaat, Jumu’ah, ‘Eidain, Mayyit and Jama’at.

This has increased the pages from 52 to 85. Also, the size is enlarged
and the type used is bigger and clearer.

I am very thankful to Haji Amirali Haji Karim, Nairobi, to prepare
questions which have been given at the end of the book.

I hope this edition will be more useful than the previous one.
