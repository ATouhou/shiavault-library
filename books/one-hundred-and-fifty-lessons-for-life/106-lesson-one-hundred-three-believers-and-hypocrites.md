Lesson One Hundred Three: Believers And Hypocrites
==================================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إذا رَأَيْتُمُ الْمُؤْمِنَ صَمُوتاً فَادْنُوْا مِنْهُ فَإنَّهُ يُلْقِى
الحِكْمَةَ وَ الْمُؤْمِنُ قَلِيلُ الْكَلامِ كَثِيرُ الْعَمَلِ وَ
الْمُنافِقُ كَثِيرُ الْكَلامِ قَلِيلُ الْعَمَلِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

When you find a believer silent, approach him because you will hear wise
sayings. Believers talk less and are action oriented whereas hypocrites
are talkative and inexperienced. [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Man’s power is not unlimited and everlasting. Therefore, when his
energies are used in one direction, there will be less energy left for
other things. So it is not surprising if talkative people are short on
actions and experience.

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) always
advocated positive and effective living, says that believers are those
who emphasize deeds, not just words, while he considers the opposite
attribute of all talk and no action as the sign of the hypocrites.
