Surah Taha, which is one of the Meccan suras, contains 135 verses and
its content, like other Meccan suras, is mostly about ‘Origin and End’.

This holy Surah is the first Surah of the Qur’an which has explained the
Story of Moses (as) in details, and about 80 verses of it have been
stated in this regard.

A part of the Surah is upon the greatness of the Qur’an and the
attributes of Allah, while another part of it relates to the story of
Adam and Eve and the temptations of Satan. And, finally, there have been
stated some awakening advices in this holy Surah.

Imam Sadiq (as) says:

 *“He who continues reciting Surah ‘Ta Ha’ will be loved by Allah
(s.w.t.) and, on the Day of Resurrection, his book of deeds will be
given to his right hand…”*[^1]
