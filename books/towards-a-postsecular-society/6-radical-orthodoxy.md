Radical Orthodoxy
=================

A number of Christian theologians, including Rowan Williams - the
current Archbishop of Canterbury - have adopted strands of postmodern
philosophy to invigorate 21st century Christian theology. The group of
theologians following this investigation based in Cambridge are
developing a line of thought sometimes known as the ‘radical orthodoxy,’
a term that underlines the possible contradictions. In the terminology
adopted here these thinkers and writers (which also include Don Cupitt,
founder of the ‘Sea of Faith’ movement) are giving a postsecular slant
to presecular religious thought, and it is an open question as to which
era the end result belongs to. Nevertheless the radical orthodoxy
belongs with interfaith initiatives and other recognitions of the
democratic and pluralistic world of today, and hence form an important
part of the postsecular context which derives from the presecular.
