22: Pilgrimage (anbiya)
=======================

This chapter of ten sections contains 78 verses from Madina except for
VV. 52-55 (in section VII), which were revealed on the road between
Mecca and Madina during the prophet's Hijra or Transfer to the latter
city in the year 622 A. D. It comes after Light 24 in the order of
revelation, and before Hypocrites 63.

The first section contains a beautiful description of how each
individual is created. It then proceeds to the matter of the Pilgrimage
the sin of association, and polytheism (VI). Self-defence is permitted
Muslims (VI) and the matter of retaliation is discussed (VIII). The
chapter ends with the parable of "The Fly" (X) and an impassioned plea
for sincere worship.
