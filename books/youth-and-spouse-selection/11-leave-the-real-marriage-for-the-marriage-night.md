Leave the Real Marriage for the Marriage Night
==============================================

My sister and brother, we have recommended to your parents, and were
recommend it to you as well-leave the real and actual marriage to the
marriage night. Now that the elders have shown confidence in you, you
also endeavour to honour their confidence. Do have enjoyable and lovely
relations, but leave the real marriage and its peculiar issues for the
marriage night.

I pray to the Almighty that you have a dynamic and prosperous life along
with faith, piety, and duty consciousness.

**Be felicitous:**
