Commencement of the Minor Occultation (ghaibat-e-sughra)
========================================================

The minor occultation commenced from the year 260 A.H. Why the minor
occultation? Perhaps because its duration is shorter or maybe because
there was a link between Imam (a.s.) and the people. During this era,
Usman Ibn Saeed Amri (r.a.) took many people to the service of
Imam-e-Zaman (a.t.f.s.) and brought the replies of numerous letters from
Imam (a.s.) to them. Therefore, those Shias, who were inclined to get
some information from Imam-e-Zaman (a.t.f.s.) and desired to forward
their queries to him, almost had a direct contact with him (a.t.f.s.).
That is, they got their religious queries answered through minimum links
and on numerous occasions through Imam’s letters and signatures.

In this period, it was prohibited to utter the name of Imam-e-Zaman
(a.t.f.s.). Why? Because it created some problems and difficulties for
the Shias and hence, they remembered him by the title of “Saahebuz
Zamaan”.

Thus, for the Shias, it was forbidden to take the name of Imam (a.s.),
which was the same as the name of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.).
Quite a few jurists considered this edict to be applicable till date.
The reason they cite is that when something is declared to be illegal,
it continues to be so, till the promulgator who has issued the
legislation, lifts the restriction. And in this case, its illegality has
not yet been removed.

Some other jurists are of the view that this restriction was confined
to the era of the minor occultation, when Imam-e-Zaman (a.t.f.s.) was
subject to danger. But presently, it has been revised and they don’t
regard uttering the name of Imame- Zaman (a.t.f.s.) in this time as
haraam (forbidden). This restriction was applicable only in olden times
when even in the books his name was written as M-H-M-D.

**The Special Deputies of Hazrat Mahdi (a.t.f.s.)**

Usman Ibn Saeed was the special deputy for duration of two and a half
years. After his demise, as per the advice of Imam-e-Zaman (a.t.f.s.),
his son Muhammad Ibn Usman was raised to the state of deputyship. A
reliable narrator of Imamite traditions, he remained in this coveted
position for a period of thirtyfive years and executed his
responsibilities.

After him, an Iranian from the renowned family of Nawbakht, Husain Ibn
Rauh Nawbakhti, became the special deputy and continued to be so for
duration of twenty years.

Ali Ibn Muhammad Samori or Seymouri, an inhabitant of Saamarra,
followed Husain Ibn Ruh on the advice of Imam-e-Zaman (a.t.f.s.) and the
recommendation of Husain Ibn Ruh.

The era of special deputyship of these four lasted till the year 329
A.H. Of course, apart from these four special deputies, Imam-e-Zaman
(a.t.f.s.) did have deputies and representatives in far-flung Islamic
cities and towns but these formed the core of representation. These
representatives were either appointed by Husain Ibn Ruh and his ilk or
some times by Imam-e-Zaman (a.t.f.s.) directly but ultimately, had to
act through any of these four special representatives.

From among this second line of deputies, there was one in Qum who
abused his position after being in it for some time. Although he was a
directly appointed representative of Imam-e-Zaman (a.t.f.s.), yet this
appointment did not render him an infallible. Finally, he misused his
status and attributed lies and falsity to Imam-e-Zaman (a.t.f.s.). He
put the people’s wealth and property to personal use. Consequently,
Husain Ibn Ruh received a signed letter from Imam-e-Zaman (a.t.f.s.)
cursing this deputy. His name was “Muhammad Ibn Ali Shalmaghani”, who
was based in Qum and was conferred with special deputyship. Apart from
him, there were a couple of other people who were rejected by
Imam-e-Zaman (a.t.f.s.) after being appointed as deputies.

In the preface of the book “Kalemah al-Imam al-Mahdi”32, a brief
history of the deputies has been jotted and a list of fifteen people has
been mentioned, who were appointed by Imam-e-Zaman (a.t.f.s.) directly.
Of course, these fifteen did not bear the same position as the four
special representatives and hence, in common understanding, it is famous
that the special deputies were only four in number.

Six days prior to his death, the fourth special deputy, Ali Ibn
Muhammad Seymouri (a.r.) received a signed letter (tawqee) from
Imam-e-Zaman (a.t.f.s.), reminding him of a few things. This letter is
quite well known and has been recorded in quite a few books with
explanations.

“O Ali Ibn Muhammad Seymouri! May Allah increase the reward of your
brothers concerning you? You will die after six days. Now, you don’t
appoint anybody as your successor for special deputyship because the
door of representation now stands closed and the major occultation shall
begin. The reappearance will not occur except by the order and
permission of Allah. This reappearance will take place only after the
earth becomes replete with injustice, oppression, and the hardening of
hearts. Beware! Soon there will be 32 This book was compiled by the
martyr Sayed Husain Shirazi (a.r.) and has been translated into Persian
by the author of this book.

a number of my Shias who will claim to meet me. Anybody who makes such
a claim before the emergence of Sufyani and the heavenly shriek is a
liar and a deceiver. There is no power and strength except that of
Allah.33” In this letter, mention has been made of the prolongation of
the major occultation, the shutting of the door of representation, and
the fact that anybody claiming to meet Imam (a.s.) at will, is a liar
and a cheat. Six days after the receipt of this letter, Ali Ibn Muhammad
(a.r.) completed his pending tasks, made his will and expired.

This was the brief history of the minor occultation till the
commencement of the major one, which began when Imam-e-Zaman’s
(a.t.f.s.) age was seventy-four.
