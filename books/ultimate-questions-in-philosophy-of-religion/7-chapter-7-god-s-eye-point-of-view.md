Chapter 7: God's Eye Point of View!
===================================

Who goes to heaven Dad?
-----------------------

Leo was the Member of Parliament in my area in Sydney . One day we had a
friendly chat and he told me how stunned he was when his 10 year old
daughter asked him; “Dad! Who goes to heaven?”

After a long pause I said: “what I'm sure about my sweet heart is that
the politicians are the last to go to heaven, but as a Christian, I
suppose, those who have faith in Jesus would go to heaven.”

I was more puzzled when she asked me: “Dad! If you were not born
Christian, would you give the same answer?”

“Well, maybe not”, I answered while lifting up my shoulder. She again
continued: “Dad! Since God owns the heaven and the hell, we need to know
God's point of view, but how?”

Religious Pluralism
-------------------

The Oxford dictionary defines pluralism as ‘the principle that different
groups can live together in peace in one society.' Pluralism also refers
to the acceptance of many groups in society, or many schools of thought
in an intellectual or cultural discipline. In philosophy however, it
means that reality is composed of many parts and that no single
explanation or view of reality can account for all aspects of life
*(Encarta).*

The definition of pluralism becomes more ambiguous when the term is used
to express ‘religious pluralism', because, in this sense, religious
pluralism depends, in part at least, upon what is meant by ‘religious'.

If ‘religious' is identified with Abrahamic religions or a belief in
God, then our conception of religious pluralism includes only those
individuals and communities that fit under the umbrella of Judaism,
Christianity and/or Islam, or Theism.

If, on the other hand, what is ‘religious' is identified with the human
quest for meaning, purpose, and identity, then our understanding of
religious pluralism includes all such quests, whether traditionally
religious or not.

The Central Core of Religious Pluralism
---------------------------------------

The most widely recognised meaning of religious pluralism is the
recognition of all different, even seemingly contradictive, religious
experiences. In other words, according to ‘religious pluralism',
religions such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism etc, are,
although different, all true and their followers are all on Right Paths.

They all believe in ‘an absolute transcendence', even though they share
different experiences in obtaining that goal. According to this meaning
of religious pluralism, everyone should be content with any philosophy
that he holds, whether he believes in God or not, or one God or many
Gods, whether what he believes in is an absolute transcendence or not.
Regardless of what one believes, he is on the right path and he has a
share of the truth.
