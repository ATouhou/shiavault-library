Mustahab Hajj
=============

Article 9
---------

It is Mustahab (recommended) for persons who are not able to perform
Hajj or do not have other conditions or have performed obligatory Hajj,
to perform Hajj and it is Mustahab to perform it every year. But if due
to extreme congestion of Hajjis there is a interruption for people who
have not performed their obligatory Hajj yet, then it is preferred not
to perform Mustahab Hajj.

It is also preferred to give turns to persons who have not performed
obligatory Hajj and want to perform for the first time; but if
(assumably) the house of Allah has enough places remaining for Hajjis
for one year then it is obligatory for the religious governor to send
groups of people for performing Hajj even if they have already performed
their obligatory Hajj.

Article 10
----------

Permission of the husband is not necessary for the wife to perform
obligatory Hajj, but the permission is necessary when wife wants to
perform Mustahab Hajj. Also if Mustahab Hajj is bringing hardship and
hurt to father or mother then there is a problem.
