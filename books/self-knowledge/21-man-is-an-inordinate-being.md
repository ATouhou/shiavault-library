Man is an inordinate being
==========================

This fact is expressed in the following verse: ***“Nay! Man is most
surely inordinate, when he sees himself free from need.” (96:6,7)***

Human beings feel self-sufficient when they enjoy the status of wealth,
health or position. When a man has no money or social position or is not
from an important family, he is not inordinate. To illustrate, one of
the companions of the Prophet (S) was quite poor. He asked the Prophet
(S) for help. He gave him some money. That money was blessed and had
good effects. Day by day his money increased. He used to pray behind the
Prophet (S). But as his money increased, his worship decreased. The
Prophet (S) began to feel concerned about him. So, one day he asked that
man to pay the money back. When he paid it back, his money was no longer
blessed. He became poor again and started to attend the mosque regularly
and say his prayers behind the Prophet (S).
