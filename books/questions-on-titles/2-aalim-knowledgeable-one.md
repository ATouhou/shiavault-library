Aalim (knowledgeable One)
=========================

When does one become knowledgeable? When a person realises that what he
does not know is far greater than what he knows, he ends up referring to
himself as a 'seeker of knowledge'. In fact, what a person knows is
immaterial when compared to what he does not know. It is pointless to
even compare.

It therefore follows from this that when a person declares himself to
be an Aalim, then he is surely an ignorant one as he has yet to even
realise that he does not know. He does not even know what it is that he
does not know.

AL KAFI - H 56, Ch. 3, h4

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from Muhammad ibn 'Isa from Yunus from
Jamil who has said the following: "I heard Imam abu 'Abd Allah,
recipient of divine supreme covenant, saying, 'People become of three
groups: Scholars, those who learn and garbled ones. We are the scholars.
Our followers are the ones who learn. The rest of the people are garbled
ones." On top of this is the statement of Imam Ali (a.s.):

Whosoever neglects to say 'I don't know', will fall in the trap of
death - Nahj Ul Balagah, Saying 85 (Arabic Version)

So the Holy Infallibles (a.s.) are the Ulama (Knowledgeable Ones). Can
anyone in his right mind argue with this? I don't think so. Yet the
priests go around referring to themselves as Ulama. In fact, in England,
we have an organisation formed by these priests who have named it
'Majlis E Shia Ulama Europe', and most of the resident priests of the
Imambargahs of England, as well as the freelancers are members of this
organisation.

It looks like all these priests have yet to realise that what they know
is infinitesimal compared to what it is that they do know, and that they
are nothing but seekers of knowledge. Or is it that they do know and are
trying to elevate their status among the people by adopting such
titles?

So what kind of a scholar is a scholar?

AL KAFI - H 45, Ch. 2, h2 (EXTRACT)

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn 'Isa from
Muhammad ibn Khalid from abu al-Bakhtari from abu 'Abd Allah, recipient
of divine supreme covenant, who has said the following: "The scholars
are the heirs of the prophets because the prophets did not leave any
Dirham or Dinar (units of money) as their legacy. What they left was
certain pieces of their statements. Those who acquired anything of these
pieces of their statements have certainly gained a colossal share.

H 52, Ch. 2, h9

Al-Hassan ibn Muhammad has narrated from Ahmad ibn Ishaq from Su'dan
ibnMuslim from Mu'awiya ibn 'Ammar who has said the following: "Once, I
asked (Imam) abu 'Abd Allah, recipient of divine supreme covenant,
'There is a man who recounts your Hadith and spreads them among people
and ties them to their hearts and the hearts of your followers.

Also there is a worshipper among your followers who does not narrate
your Hadith. Which of these two people is better?' The Imam replied,
'The one who narrates our Hadith and ties them up to the hearts of our
followers is better than seventy thousand worshippers.'"

So, at the end of the day it all points in the same direction. A
scholar is one who narrates Hadeeth and not the one who goes around as
an expert in jurisprudence. Wasaail Us Shia Vol 11 H 27; Bihar Ul Anwaar
Vol. 82 H 2; Rijal Kashi Vol 3.

Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said: Understand the status of our Shias according to
the good reports from us for we do not recognise the Faqih from among
them to be a Faqih unless he becomes a Muhaddith (Narrator of
traditions)

This is explained in more detail under the chapter on Fuqaha. Let us
now look at a Hadeeth frequently quoted by the priests.

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn 'Isa from
Muhammad ibn Khalid from abu al-Bakhtari from abu 'Abd Allah, recipient
of divine supreme covenant, who has said the following: "The scholars
are the heirs of the prophets because the prophets did not leave any
Dirham or Dinar (units of money) as their legacy. What they left was
certain pieces of their statements.

Those who acquired anything of these pieces of their statements have
certainly gained a colossal share. You must be very careful, when
acquiring such knowledge, to know from what kind of people you receive
them. After (the death of) every one of us (the Ahl al-Bayt,

family of the Holy Prophet, recipient of divine supreme covenant),
there comes a just person who removes (and exposes) from (the texts of
Shari'a) the forgeries of the exaggerators, the materials of the
fallacious ones that might have been made to infiltrate and the
interpretations of the ignorant ones." For some reason the priests
usually only quote the words, 'The scholars are the heirs of the
prophets' and thereby claim justification for all of their actions. Agha
e Khomeini has quoted in his book Islamic Government and the Rule of the
Jurist:

"The fuqahâ are the trustees of the prophets ('a) means that all of the
tasks entrusted to the prophets ('a) must also be fulfilled by the just
fuqahâ as a matter of duty"

He then goes further and uses another Hadeeth in this manner. AL KAFI -
VOL 7 (ARABIC VERSION)

The Commander of the Faithful ('a) said to Shurayh: "The seat [of
judge] you are occupying is filled by someone who is a prophet ('a), the
legatee of a prophet, or else a sinful wretch." He then uses this
Hadeeth to prove his claim and says: Considering the fact that the
fuqahâ do not have the rank of prophethood, and they are indubitably not
"wretched sinners," we conclude that, in the light of the tradition
quoted above, they must be the legatees or successors of the Most Noble
Messenger (s).

Have you noticed his proof? This involves very strange logic. Even if I
were to accept this logic, then why restrict this to only Jurists? By
this proof whosoever is not "wretched sinners," would end up being a
trustee of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.).

Incredible! This thinking goes even further when they use this Hadeeth
for themselves:

MUSTADRAK AL WASAAIL - VOL 17 H 21468

Allamah Hilli in his writing quotes: 'The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) said
that the scholars of my Ummah are like the prophets of the
Israelites'.

MY! My! My! The Prophets of the Israelites include the Prophets Musa
(a.s.) and Isa (a.s.). There is no limit to a person's aspirations now
is there? So which scholars is this Hadeeth referring to? The priests or
the Holy Infallibles (a.s.)? The following Hadeeth has answered this
question.


Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from 'Abd al-'Aziz ibn
al-Muhtadi from 'Abd Allah ibn Jundab to who Imam al-Rida, recipient of
divine supreme covenant, wrote the following: "Thereafter (after
thanking Allah I must say), Muhammad, recipient of divine supreme
covenant, was the trustee of Allah in the matters of His creatures. When
he was taken away from this world, we, Ahl al-Bayt, inherited him; thus,
we are the trustees of Allah over His earth.

QUESTIONS

When will all these priests realise that they are not knowledgeable,
but are only seekers of knowledge?

When was the last time you heard from the mouth of a priest the words
'I don't know'?

Why do they concentrate mainly on Fiqh and not on Hadeeth?
