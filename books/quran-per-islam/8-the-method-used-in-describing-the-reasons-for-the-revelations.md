The Method Used in Describing "the Reasons For the Revelations
==============================================================

Past scholars of Islam, and in particular the Sunni scholars, attached
great importance to the order of revelation of the chapters. Among the
narration on the subject is that of Ibn 'Abb?s, who has said that "the
beginning of each chapter which was revealed in Mecca was recorded as
having been revealed in that very place, then God added what He wanted
to it. (40)the following is the order of revelation of the Qur'an
(beginning with the Meccan verses): (1) Read in the name of your Lord.
(XCVI:)

(2) Nun. (LXVIII:)

**Further Tradition Concerning the Order and Place of Revelation**

The tradition of Ibn 'Abbas mentions one hundred and thirteen chapters,
the chapter "al-F?tilah" not being counted among them. There is another
saying, related by a!-Byhalia from 'Ikrimah(41), which enumerates one
hundred and eleven chapters, the three chapters "al-F?tibah," "The
Heights," and "Counsel" not being mentioned When al-Bayhaqi relates this
same tradition from Ibn 'Abbas it includes all one hundred and fourteen
chapters The tradition of al-Bayhaqi reckons "The Defrauders" as one of
the Medinan chapters in opposition to the other traditions, which count
it as Meccan The order mentioned in these two traditions for both the
Meccan and Medinan chapters is different from that of other traditions
Another tradition, related from 'All ibn Abi Talbah,(42) says:

The chapter "The Cow" was revealed in Medina and "The Family of
'Imran," "Women," "The Table Spread," "Spirits of War," "Repentance,"
"The Pilgrimage," "Light," '1'hc Clans," "Those Who Deny," "Victory,"
"Iron," "She That Disputes," "Exile," "She That Is To Be Examined,'
'"The Helpers of Allah (The Ranks)," "Mutual Disillusion," "0 Prophet if
you divorce women," "0 Prophet why do you ban," "The Dawn," "The Night,"
"We have revealed it in the night of power," "The Clear Proof," "When
the earth shakes," "When the help of Allah comes," and the rest of the
chapters were revealed in Mecca

The intention of the tradition seems only to establish the difference
between the Medinan and Meccan chapters and to define the order of
revelation of the chapters mentioned The chapters "Table Spread" and
"Repentance" are, without doubt, later in revelation than that indicated
in this tradition Moreover, chapters "The Dawn," "The Night," and "The
Night of Power," are counted as Medinan chapters, whereas the above
tradition counts them as Meccan

Likewise, "The Thunder," "The Beneficent," "Man," "The Congregation,"
"The Private Apartments" are considered as Meccan, where as in the above
tradition they are counted as Medinan

In another tradition related by Qatadah,(43) "The Cow," "The Family of
'Imr?n," "Women," "The Table Spread," "Immunity," "The Thunder," "The
Bee," "The Pilgrimage," "The Light," "The Clans," "Muhammad," "Victory,"
"The Private Apartments," "Iron," "The Beneficent," "She that disputes,"
"Exile," "She that is to be Examined,' '"The Ranks," "The Congregation,"
"The Hypocrites," "Mutual Disillusion," "Divorce," the first thirteen
verses of "0 You 'Prophet! Why do you ban," "When the earth Shakes" and
"When the help of Allah comes," were revealed in Medina and the est in
Mecca This tradition is contrary to the previous traditions and, in
particular, with regard to the mention of "The Defrauders," "Man," and
"The Clear Proof

"This tradition is, however, unacceptable according to the Science of
traditions, being disconnected from direct transmission from the Prophet
It is also unclear whether Ibn 'Abbas learned of the order of revelation
from the Prophet himself or from some other unidentified person, or
arrived at it by by subjective decision. If the latter is the case, it
has no value or authenticity but for himself. It has also no value
historically, as Ibn 'Abb?s did not have close contact with the Prophet.
It is obvious that he could not have been present nor a witness to the
revelation of all these chapters. Even if we suppose the tradition to be
true, it is still not totally acceptable in matters outside the law of
the shari'ah.

The only way to discover the true order of the chapters, and whether
they are Meccan or Medinan, is to examine the content of the chapters
and to compare them with the circumstances and social reality before and
after the migration. Such a method is effective in certain cases; the
content of chapters "Man," "The Coursers," and the "Defrauders" testify
to their being Medinan, although some of these traditions only establish
them as Meccan.
