Imam Hasan Al-askari (a)
========================

In the time of our 11th Imam, Imam Hasan al-Askari (A) there lived a
Christian priest, who could make it rain by raising his hands up to the
sky.

The Muslim king began to get worried because the Muslims' faith started
to waver and if the Muslims left Islam he would have no one to rule
over.

The king went to the Imam Hasan al-Askari (A) whom he had imprisoned
and told him that the Muslims were losing faith in Islam because of the
Christian priest.

Imam (A) told the king to arrange a gathering of all the people and the
priest.

At the gathering Imam (A) asked the Christian priest to pray for rain.
When the priest raised his hands to pray it began to rain. Imam (A)
asked for whatever was in the priest's hand to be taken away and then
told him to pray for rain again.

The priest tried and tried but he could not get it to rain.

Imam (A) then showed the people the bone that the priest was holding in
his hands. Imam (A) told the people that it was a bone of a Prophet and
that was what was causing it to rain and not the priest.

Imam Hasan al-Askari (A) then prayed for rain and it rained.

**Moral:**

When things happen that make you question your faith remember you do
not know or understand everything.

The rulers of the time of our 11th Imam, Imam Hasan al-Askari (A) knew
that the Imams (A) were going to be 12 in number and that the last of
them was going to be the son of Imam Hasan al-Askari (A) and would
finally take control of the world.

The rulers wanted to stop the 12th Imam (A) from being born, so they
tried to keep Imam Hasan al-Askari (A) imprisoned for most of his
life.

They had forgotten how Fir'aun had tried to stop the reign of Prophet
Musa (A) by killing all the baby boys born to the Isralites, yet he
himself was bringing up the one he wanted to kill.

Motamid, who was the 'Fir'aun' at the time of Imam Hasan al-Askari (A)
did everything in his power to stop the birth of the 12th Imam (A).

Motamid had had Imam (A) under his watchful eye from the age of four,
and imprisoned following the death of his father, the 10th Imam, Imam
Ali an-Naqi (A).

Allah had planned for the 12th Imam (A) to be born so an incident
occurred where Motamid had to ask Imam Hasan al-Askari (A) for help to
save the faith of the Muslims.

The incident was that at a time of severe draught a Christian priest
was able to make it rain, which was making the Muslim people question
their faith.

So Motamid had to ask Imam Hasan al-Askari (A) for help, before there
were no Muslims to rule over.

Imam (A) showed how the priest was making it rain using the bone of a
Prophet (A) and how Imam (A) could make it rain without the help of
anything.

The Muslims were overjoyed and Motamid had no choice but to let Imam
(A) free. It was during this period that the 12th Imam (A) was born.

**Moral:**

Allah says in the Holy Qur'an, Sura Ali Imran verse 54:"And they
planned, and Allah planned, and Allah is the best of planners."ie.
Whatever Allah has decided no-one can change.

Once in the time of our 11th Imam, Imam Hasan al-Askari (A), there
lived a man who only had a little money left.

Now this man was scared about what he was going to do when even this
little bit of money finished, so he decided to hide this money by
digging a hole in his garden and putting it there.
The man then went to Imam Hasan al-Askari (A) and told him that he had
no money and needed Imam's (A) help.

Imam Hasan al-Askari (A) gave the man a whole bag of money and told him
that the Imams (A) always help anyone that asks them for help, so there
had been no need for him to have lied.

Imam Hasan al-Askari (A) continued that the man should be grateful for
whatever Allah has given him. Imam (A) then told him that the money that
he had hidden would not be there when he would need it.

The man realised what he had done was wrong.

Later when the man needed some more money, he went to dig out the money
that he had hidden and found it gone. His son had found out about it and
taken it.

Exactly like Imam Hasan al-Askari (A) had said, that when he would need
the money it would not be there.

**Moral:**

1. You should trust in Allah to look after you.
2. You should thank Allah for whatever He has given you.
3. You should never lie, as you will be found out. Even if no-one finds
out, Allah knows.
