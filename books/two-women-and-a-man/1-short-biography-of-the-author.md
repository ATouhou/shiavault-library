Short Biography of the Author
=============================

Amina Haider Al-Sadr, the famous Muslim author also known as Bint
Al-Huda played a significant role in creating Islamic awareness among
the Muslim women of Iraq. She was in her twenties when she began writing
articles in Al-Adhwa, the Islamic magazine printed by the religious
intellectuals of Al-Najaf (Iraq) in 1379 (1959).

Bint Al-Huda grew up with a serious love of learning. She became aware
of the Muslim womenâ€™s sufferings and the great disasters that were
damaging Islamic ideology in her country.

In 1400 (1980) the religious leader Baqir Al-Sadr and his sister Bint
Al-Huda were arrested. After three days of unimaginable torture, they
were murdered by the tyrannical Iraqi regime. Islam suffered a great
loss when these two Muslim personalities were killed in cold blood.
