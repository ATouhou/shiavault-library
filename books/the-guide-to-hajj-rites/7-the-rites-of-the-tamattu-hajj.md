The Rites of the Tamattu‘ Hajj
==============================

397. The rites of Hajj of TAMATTU’ are thirteen:

1. Ihraam.
2. Woquf or staying in Arafaat.
3. Woquf or staying in Mash‘ar.
4. Ram’y or stoning of Jamarat al-Aqabah in Mina.
5. Had’y or slaughter of the sacrifice in Mina.
6. Halq / taqseer or the shaving of the head or trimming its hair in
Mina.
7. Tawaaf al-Ziyaarah.
8. Salaat al-tawaaf or the tawaaf prayer.
9. Sa‘y.
10. Tawaaf al-Nisa’.
11. Salaat Tawaaf al-Nisa’ or the tawaaf prayer.
12. Mabeet or staying over night in Mina.
13. Ram’y or stoning of the three Jamaraat.

**1. Ihraam of the Tamattu‘ Hajj**

398. The first of the Hajj rites is the ihraam, which is obligatory for
the Tamattu‘ Hajj, and in fact it is a rukn – a principal element, and
the Hajj is invalidated if deliberately abandoned.

399. The process of the ihraam is the same as that for the Umrah, as
mentioned previously, with the exception of the niyyah and the place of
[declaring and assuming] ihraam. The niyyah or intention is to state, “I
declare and assume the ihraam for the TAMATTU' HAJJ seeking nearness to
Allah Almighty”. As for the place of ihraam, one must do so in the holy
city of Makkah.

400. The first time one can declare and assume the ihraam is after
completing the rites of Umrah, and the time of [declaring] ihraam
extends to the ninth day of Dhil-Hejjah, which is the day of woquf in
Arafaat, when it becomes obligatory upon the pilgrim to declare and
assume ihraam so that he can observe the woquf in time.

401. [The pilgrim] declares and assumes the state of ihraam for the
Tamattu‘ Hajj from the holy city of Makkah, and it is preferable to do
so from Masgid al-Haraam, preferably from Hijr Isma’el or Maqaam Ibrahim
peace be upon them. He should wear the two garments of ihraam, and then
declares the niyyah of ihraam for the Hajj as mentioned previously, and
then utters the talbiyah as previously mentioned. [Case \# 166].

402. If one forgot to declare and assume the ihraam from the holy city
of Makkah, and he left Makkah on the eighth day for Mina or Arafaat, and
then remembered the oversight, it is obligatory for him to return to
Makkah to declare and assume the ihraam there. The same applies if he
left Makkah without declaring and assuming ihraam due to not being
conversant with the ruling of the case. He should return to Makkah to
declare ihraam there, if possible.

403. He who is obliged to return to Makkah to declare and assume
ihraam, if he is excused from doing so, or in doing so he would not be
able to come back to Arafaat in time for the Designated (ikhtiari)29
woquf on the ninth day, which is from noon to sunset, he must declare
and assume the ihraam from the spot remembered or realised this, and
this would be sufficient for him.

404. If one did not remember his failure to declare and assume ihraam
until after completing all of the rites, his Hajj is correct if this was
due to oversight or ignorance.

405. If one deliberately failed to declare and assume ihraam until he
missed the time for the two woquf’s, his Hajj is invalidated, and so too
if one had not assumed ihraam, due to oversight or ignorance, and after
29 The Haajj (pilgrim) is obliged to perform certain rites during
particular Designated times specified for different rites and sites.

If under certain circumstances s/he fails to perform those rites during
their relevant Designated times, then s/he must perform those missed
rites during their relevant Emergency times.

being reminded he did not declare and assume ihraam when it was
possible for him to do so.

**2. Woquf in Arafaat**

406. The second rite of the Hajj is Woquf in Arafaat. It is obligatory
for the Haajj (pilgrim) to observe Woquf [being preset] in Arafaat, in
that he is present there all the time from midday or noontime until
sunset, [referred to as the Designated (ikhtiari) woquf]. This does not
mean that he should stand on his feet.

407. It is obligatory to observe the Woquf in Arafaat itself, for it is
not sufficient to observe the Woquf in Namirah, or other areas in the
vicinity of Arafaat. Arafaat has known borders with clear visible signs
stating “The Start of Arafaat” and “The End of Arafaat”, and therefore
one may not breach those borders.

408. The rukn, or principal element of the woquf is the extent that can
be called as woquf, which literally means “being present there”30, and
the time that exceeds the rukn is obligatory, and it is not permitted to
abandon the excess time. BUT if one [deliberately] abandons the rukn –
the basic woquf itself until time of the Designated woquf has lapsed,
until sunset, his Hajj is invalidated, and neither the Emergency woquf
[in Arafaat] nor that in Mash‘ar would be of any use to him.

409. The Emergency Woquf in Arafaat is from the time of sunset [on the
ninth day] until the time of Fajr on the day of Eid [the tenth day].
410. If one forgets to observe the woquf in Arafaat [on time], it is
obligatory for him to do so in the Designated time if it was possible,
failing that, he should observe the Emergency woquf, and then observe
the woquf in the Mash‘ar and his Hajj is valid.

30 Being present in Arafaat even for a few minutes constitutes the rukn
of woquf, and if one after, say, ten minutes left Arafaat, he has
disobeyed the orders of Allah Almighty and has sinned, but his Hajj
would not be invalidated.

411. As mentioned previously, it is obligatory [for the pilgrim] to
observe the woquf in Arafaat [during the entire period] from midday
noontime / midday until sunset. If, due to deliberate failure, one did
not observe the woquf on time, [i.e. not from precisely noontime, but
from later on], he has sinned but his Hajj is correct and he is not
liable [to do or give] anything. However, if this was due to an
oversight or another excuse, he has not sinned, and his Hajj is correct
too.

412. If one did not observe the woquf in Arafaat up to the end of the
required time, i.e. he deliberately left Arafaat before sunset, if he
repented and returned before sunset, he is not liable to a kaffaarah,
and if he does not repent and does not return, he is liable to a
kaffaarah of a camel. If he could not afford a camel, he must fast 18
days continually with no interruption between those days. The fast can
be in Makkah, en route back to his hometown or when at home.

413. If due to oversight one departed [Arafaat] before sunset and did
not realise this during the time [before sunset] he is not liable to
anything. If he realised the oversight before sunset, it is obligatory
for him to return to Arafaat, and to remain there until sunset. If he
dos not do so and does not return, he has sinned and the ruling of his
case is similar to the one who deliberately left Arafaat. The ruling of
the one who does so out of ignorance is the same as that who had
forgotten, even if his ignorance being due to him being moqassir.

414. The Designated woquf for Arafaat – as mentioned before – is from
midday to sunset, and the Emergency Woquf is from sunset to fajr. The
latter is qualifying for anyone who forgot to observe the woquf in
Arafaat, or was excused due to any other reason. However, in the case of
the Emergency Woquf it is not obligatory to observe it completely and
entirely31 as it is required in the case of the Designated woquf.

The obligation in this [Emergency Woquf] is the extent that can be
called as “being present there”. However, the Emergency Woquf is a
substitute for the Designated woquf as far as the obligation of
observing the entire 31 i.e. from sunset to fajr.

period is concerned, if it was possible to do so. This is provided this
would not detract him from [the woquf] in the Mash‘ar before sunrise.
415. If one observed the Emergency Woquf [in Arafaat], and it was not
possible for him to observe the woquf in the Mash‘ar before sunrise, his
Hajj is invalidated by deliberately failing to observe the woquf in the
Mash‘ar.

Therefore it is obligatory for him, if it was possible, to ensure that
he observes the woquf in the Mash‘ar, by observing the Emergency woquf
in Arafaat, and then come to the Mash‘ar.

If that was not possible, he should limit [his woquf] to observing the
woquf in the Mash‘ar [only], and [go on] to complete his Hajj.
Similarly, if he missed observing the woquf in Arafaat completely due to
forgetting, oversight or any other reason, and he did not remember it
until after the elapse of the woquf time, but it was possible for him to
observe the Woquf in the Mash‘ar in the Designated time, his woquf in
the Mash‘ar is qualifying and his Hajj is valid.

416. The above ruling concerning the one who had forgotten applies to
the qaasir ignorant, but as for the moqassir, the ruling in this case is
inconclusive [i.e. no fatwa is given in the validity or invalidity of
the Hajj].

417. If the judge or mufti of the non-Shi’a announced the day of
Arafaat and the day of Eid, and one is not sure of the invalidity of the
announcement, or if one was sure of the invalidity of the announcement
but was confined to comply with that, then it is permissible for him to
follow accordingly for the two woquf’s, and the Hajj is valid and he
does not need to repeat.

**3. Woquf in the Mash‘ar al-Haraam**

418. The third rite of the Hajj is the Woquf in the Mash‘ar al-Haraam.
Mash‘ar al-Haraam is also known as al-Muzdalafah and Juma‘, and it is
located between Arafaat and Mina, and there are signs indicating its
borders.

419. It is obligatory to observe the woquf in Mash‘ar al-Haraam after
departing from Arafaat on the eve of the Eid, and as a precaution one
should observe mabeet32 and at the break of Fajr one should declare the
intention by stating, “Aqifu (I remain) in the Mash‘ar al-Haraam from
the Fajr to Sunrise, for the Tamattu‘ Hajj seeking nearness to Allah.

” If he departs from it [Mash‘ar al-Haraam] and went beyond the
Mohassar valley before sunrise, he has sinned, and he should give a
kaffaarah of a sheep as a precaution.

420. The entire woquf in the Mash‘ar is obligatory and what can be
called as woquf or “being there” is a rukn (principal element of the
woquf).

Thus he who completely abandons to observe it would invalidate his
Hajj, and if he became insane or lost consciousness, or fell asleep,
etc.

after he observed what could be called as woquf, that would be
sufficient to him in discharging his due in this respect. But if the
above-mentioned scenarios happened to him during the entire period, as a
precaution, his woquf is invalidated in certain cases, [but not always,
the details of which are beyond the scope of this presentation].

421. The Woquf in the Mash‘ar is not meant to be standing on the feet,
but it is sufficient for one to be there, regardless of whether he was
sitting or standing, sleeping or awake, or walking or moving from one
place to another.

422. It is permissible to depart Mash‘ar for Mina before the break of
dawn for women, children, the elderly, and the sick for whom the
congestion [of the day] would cause too much hardship for them. Also it
is permitted to depart for those who have an urgent business to do.

423. If one does not manage to observe the woquf in the Mash‘ar during
the designated time, it is sufficient for him to observe the woquf
there, even for a short time, before noontime / midday [on the day of
Eid].

32 The reference to mabeet in Mash‘ar al-Haraam points to the
requirement of being there for the entire period, whereas the woquf
points to being there for only a short period of time, like the case of
the women and children and the elderly, who can stay there for a
relatively brief period to be considered as woquf and then depart for
Mina.

424. There are three specific times for the woquf in Mash‘ar:

I. The Eve of the Eid, for one who is unable to observe woquf after the
break of Fajr, as mentioned before.
II. Between the break of Fajr and sunrise.
III. Between sunrise and midday / noontime.

425. For each of the woquf’s in Arafaat and Mash‘ar there are two
categories: the Designated (ikhtiari) and the Emergency. Depending on
the success or failure of the pilgrim in observing the two woquf’s, and
their respective categories, the following could arise:

I. The pilgrim observes both woquf’s in their Designated times, and
there is no problem with his Hajj.

II. The pilgrim does not observe either of them at all, his Hajj is
invalid, and thus he should perform the Mufradah Umrah with the ihraam
he assumed for the Hajj.

III. The pilgrim observes the Designated Woquf in Arafaat and Emergency
Woquf in the Mash‘ar, and his Hajj is valid. IV. The opposite of case \#
III (above), i.e. the pilgrim observes the Emergency Woquf in Arafaat
and Designated Woquf in the Mash‘ar, and his Hajj is valid.

V. The pilgrim observes the Emergency Woquf in both [i.e. Arafaat and
the Mash‘ar], and his Hajj is valid. VI. The pilgrim observes the
Designated Woquf in Arafaat only, and his Hajj is valid.

VII. The pilgrim observes the Designated Woquf in Mash‘ar only, and his
Hajj is valid.

VIII. The pilgrim observes the Emergency Woquf in Arafaat only, and his
Hajj is invalid.

IX. The pilgrim observes the Emergency Woquf in Mash‘ar only, thus his
Hajj is valid.

426. It is recommended that [while] in the Mash‘ar al-Haraam, one
should collect the stones [required] for the Ram’y [or the stoning of
the Jamaraat], and it is permissible to take more than that is required,
and it is permissible for others to collect for him, and if he ran out
of stones, he may collect stones from the valley of Mohassar or from
Mina.

427. After the sunrise on the day of Eid, it is obligatory for the
pilgrim to depart from Mash‘ar al-Haraam for Mina to perform its rites,
which are the Ram’y [stoning], Had’y [sacrifice], and Halq [shaving],
which are the fourth, fifth, and sixth rites of the Hajj.

**4 – 6. Rites of Mina**

4. Ram’y [stoning] of Jamarat-al-‘Aqabah 428. The fourth rite of Hajj
is the Ram’y. When the pilgrim arrives in Mina he should first go to
Jamarat-al-‘Aqabah, which is the first obelisk, also known as al-
Jamarat-al-Kubra – The Greater Obelisk. The pilgrim should stone this
obelisk with seven stones that he collected from the Mash‘ar, or from
within the borders of the sacred Haram. 429. The time for the Ram’y
[stoning] of the first obelisk is on the Day of Eid, from sunrise to
sunset. The Ram’y is the first of the rites of Mina, and thus it is not
permissible, as a precaution, to bring forward any of the other rites,
namely the Had’y and the halq.


**Obligations of the Ram’y**

430. A number of issues are obligatory in Ram’y:

I. niyyah or intention,
II. number [of stoning],
III. hitting of the Jamara,
IV. sequence of stoning,
V. Ram’y during the day.

**1. Niyyah**

431. [Declaring] the niyyah or intention is mandatory in Ram’y, and it
should be declared at the time of the first throw, and continue to be
the same to the last one. It is preferable for the Haajj (pilgrim) to
utter niyyah by saying, "Armi (I stone) Jamarat-al-‘Aqabah seven times
seeking nearness to Allah Almighty".

**2. The Number of Stoning**

432. It is obligatory that the Ram’y consists of throwing seven stones,
and therefore if they were less than that, it would not be qualifying,
and he must ensure to make up for the missing ones. On the other hand,
if one threw more than seven, [doing so] as a precaution, then there is
no objection to that.

**3. Hitting the Jamara**

433. It is obligatory in the Ram’y, that the Jamara, or its location,
is hit with every one of the seven stones in that Ram’y. If one [of the
stones] went astray, it is mandatory to attempt another throw so that it
hits the Jamara. [The stones] reaching [the Jamara, as opposed to
hitting it] is not sufficient, nor is placing the stones on the target,
[as opposed to throwing them].

434. If one threw the stone at the Jamara, and it hit something en
route, but it still hit the Jamara, then there is no objection to that,
and it counts [as one hit]. Unless the stone bounced off something that
is solid such as another stone, and eventually hit the Jamara, in this
case this does not qualify [as a hit], as a precaution.

435. If during the process of the Ram’y, the Raami [the person
performing the Ram’y - throwing the stones] doubted whether the stone(s)
hit the Jamara, he should assume not and throw others instead. 436. If
after completing the Ram’y he doubted whether he had hit the Jamara or
not, he should ignore his doubt, regardless of his doubt being about the
number of hits or any other obligatory aspect of the Ram’y.

437. It is permissible in general to perform the Ram’y from the upper
level, instead of the ground level, whether out of choice or due to
compulsion. Also it is permissible to hit the extensions of the column
of the Jamara, longitudinally or latitudinally.

**4. Sequential order**

438. It is mandatory that the Ram’y is done in sequential order, i.e.
to throw the seven stones one-by-one each hitting [the Jamara]. It would
not be acceptable if one threw the seven stones all at once, even if all
seven hit [the target]. Similarly it would not be acceptable if one
threw two or more stones at a time.

439. It is not mandatory to throw the stone with the right hand, and
one is permitted to do so with the left hand, even by choice. Although
throwing by the right hand is preferred.

5. To perform the Ram’y during the day

440. It is obligatory to perform the Ram’y during the daylight, i.e.
from sunrise to sunset. However, if one cannot observe the Designated
woquf in Mash‘ar al-Haraam, and observed the Emergency woquf during the
night, and entered Mina, it is permissible for him to perform the Ram’y
during the night, like the women, children, the elderly, and the sick.
441. If due to an excuse one performed the Ram’y during the night, but
during the day his excuse was no more, he is not obliged to repeat the
Ram’y, although as a precaution it is [recommended to do so].


**Some of the Conditions of the Ram’y**

442. [When collecting the stones, one should consider] some of the
conditions of the stones collected for the Ram’y:

• the stones should be virgin, i.e. they should not have been used for
Ram’y previously,

• they should be of an average size, neither too big nor too small, but
the size of a finger segment,

• they should be stones or pebbles but not clay or dried mud,

• it is not necessary for them to be taahir,

• they must be collected from the Haram district.

443. Continuity between the seven throws is not conditional, and one
may have a slight rest in the process. However, if the time gap was
long, he must, as a precaution, renew the Ram’y again. Similarly
continuity is not conditional for the three Jamaraat, i.e. one can
perform the Ram’y on the first in the morning, the second by midday, and
the third before sunset. This latter case is applicable to the 11th and
the 12th day, when one must perform the Ram’y on all three Jamaraat.

5. Had’y or Sacrifice

444. The fifth rite of the Hajj is the Had’y, which is the slaughter of
the animal that takes place after performing the Ram’y.

445. For the Had’y it is obligatory to offer one animal, and it is
recommended to offer more, without limit. The Had’y is obligatory in the
Tamattu‘ Hajj, even if the Hajj was a mostahab one, and even, as a
precaution, if one was from the people of Makkah. As for the qaarin, the
one performing the Qiraan Hajj, the Had’y is also obligatory as he
brings the Had’y with him. The exception is the Ifraad Hajj where a
had’y is not required.

446. If an animal is not available for slaughter or the Haajj (pilgrim)
cannot find an animal, even though he has the money to cover the cost,
and he decided to go back home, he must leave the money with someone he
trusts to buy and slaughter the animal on his behalf, during the month
of Dhil-Hejjah. If he could not do so in that year, he must do so in the
following year in the month of Dhil-Hejjah.

447. One Had’y must be offered by one person only, thus it is not
permitted for two or more individuals to share one Had’y, under normal
circumstances. If there is a necessity [to share one had’y], as a
precaution, [the individuals] should offer both the Had’y [the shared
one] as well as each fasting [ten days]33. This is applicable to the
obligatory Hajj, however, in the case of mostahab Hajj; it is
permissible to share one Had’y.

448. If one bought a Had’y and then lost it, he must buy a second one,
but if he found the lost one, he must slaughter the one he had lost,
and, as a precaution, it is recommended that he should also slaughter
the second one too. If he slaughtered the second one before finding the
one he had lost, it is preferred, but in fact obligatory as a
precaution, to it too.


**Obligations of the Had’y**

449. The obligations of the Had’y are:

I. The niyyah
II. That it is a cattle
III. That it is of a certain age
IV. That it is of sound creation – without any defects of missing
limbs
V. That the slaughter is carried out on the day of Eid
VI. That the slaughter takes place in Mina
VII. To observe the order, as a precaution
VIII. That it is not taken outside the [limits] of the Haram

1. The niyyah

450. The niyyah is obligatory for the slaughter, and it is preferred to
utter it by saying, “Adhbahu (I slaughter) the Had’y seeking nearness to
Allah Almighty”.

451. If one does not carry out the slaughter himself, both he and the
person carrying out the slaughter should utter the niyyah. If only he
uttered the intention, and not the slaughterer, this is sufficient. 33
Three days of which should be performed during the Hajj season, and the
remaining seven when they go back home.

2. That it is a cattle

452. It is obligatory that the Had’y is a cattle, i.e. it is a camel,
cow, sheep, and the goat is considered from [the category of] the
sheep.

3. That it is of a certain age

453. The age of the Had’y is sufficient if it is called, [in each case]
a camel, or a cow, or a sheep, or a goat, and it is not sufficient if it
is of a young age such that, in each case, it is referred to as young
weaning camel, or calf, or lamb, or kid. As a recommended precaution, •
the camel must have completed five years and entered the age of six,

• the cow has completed two years of age,

• the sheep has completed seven months, although [it is better] to have
completed one year of age and has entered the second,

• the goat has completed two years of age.

4. To be of complete creation

454. It is obligatory that the Had’y is of complete creation, and
therefore it does not qualify if the animal is one-eyed, or lame, or too
old, or of broken inner part of the horn34, or of missing ears or any
other limb, or castrated, or thin/skinny.

455. As a precaution, it is recommended that the Had’y is not hornless
or earless by birth. However, it is permissible if the ear was pierced
or slit, without anything missing from it. Similarly, [it is
permissible] if the [animal’s] exterior [part of the] horn is broken, or
if the sheep does not have a fat-tail by birth.

34 i.e. the horn is uprooted.

456. The conditions specified for the Had’y are applicable if these are
possible, otherwise if it is not possible [to obtain a perfect match]
but the imperfect, then that should be sufficient.

5. The slaughter should be on the day of Eid 457. It is obligatory that
the slaughter [of the animal] takes place on the day of Eid, or during
the daytime on the Days of Tashreeq, which are the 10th, 11th, and 12th
of Dhil-Hejjah, and it is permissible to delay the slaughter beyond
these days. However, if one delayed this due to an excuse or
deliberately, he has until the end of Dhil-Hejjah to do so and that
would be sufficient, although this delay constitutes a sin [for the one
who deliberately delayed this rite].

6. The slaughter should take place in Mina 458. It is obligatory for
the slaughter to take place in Mina, and it is not permissible to do so
elsewhere. It is permissible to carry out the slaughter in the new
slaughterhouses, which are said to be outside the limits of Mina, if
there were any confinement, restriction, or difficulty, etc.

7. Observing the order as a precaution

459. In carrying out the slaughter of the Had’y it is obligatory to
observe the order prescribed for it, as a precaution; that the slaughter
should be done after the Ram’y and before the halq (the shaving or
trimming of the hair). If one breached this order due to an oversight,
ignorance, or forgetting it, or due to confinement or difficulty, then
there is no objection to it.

8. Not to take it outside the Haram 460. It is obligatory that one does
not take any meat of the sacrifice outside the Haram. However, if there
is no use or consumption for it, it is permitted to take it outside. It
is also permitted [to take it outside] if the Haajj (pilgrim) bought the
[sacrificed] Had’y – that he had previously given it to a destitute.


**Miscellaneous issues**

461. If one slaughtered an animal assuming that it is well-nourished,
but then it turned out to be skinny, this is satisfactory and he is not
obliged to slaughter another one.

462. It is a recommended precaution for the Haajj (pilgrim) to eat from
the slaughtered animal, and offers some of it to a Mu’min (a believer) –
even if he is well off – or to his agent, and offer some other part of
the slaughtered animal to a destitute believer or his agent. The amount
of the gift and the charity should be one third of the slaughtered
animal, and it is permissible to give [some] as charity to another Haajj
(pilgrim) who is not well off.

463. If one could not find the perfect Had’y, but managed to find the
imperfect one, he should give preference to it over fasting. If he could
not find the Had’y and its cost, he must revert to fasting, if he is
able to [fast]. If he could not find the Had’y only, but could afford
its cost, he must deposit the cost with someone to buy the Had’y during
Dhil-Hejjah, if he were not to stay until the end of Dhil-Hejjah. If the
agent found a Had’y during the month of Dhil-Hejjah he should slaughter
it, otherwise he should delay it until the following year. If by then he
could not find it he should fast.

464. If one could not find the Had’y and could not afford its cost, he
should fast ten days; three during Hajj [season], and seven days when he
returns home. It is obligatory to fast the three days during
Dhil-Hejjah. If he could not afford the Had’y, or its cost, or its
alternative, i.e. the fast, he is not obliged to anything and nor is his
heir / eldest son.

465. If one fasted three days and then found a Had’y during
Dhil-Hejjah, then he is not obliged to offer the Had’y, although it is
preferential to do so.

466. If one dies before sending a Had’y to Mina [for slaughter], and he
was obliged to do so, his heirs must take the cost of the Had’y from
what he has left behind to buy a Had’y for this purpose.

6. Halq or Taqseer (Shaving or Trimming)

467. The sixth rite of the Hajj is shaving or trimming on the day of
Eid in Mina, and that must be done after the Ram’y and the Had’y. It is
permitted to bring it forward before Had’y if there are grounds for
confinement and hardship.

468. The halq consists of shaving the head entirely, and the taqseer is
to trim some of the hair of the head or beard, or moustache, or trim
some of the fingernails.

469. Using hair-cutting machine at fine scale qualifies for shaving.

470. A male [pilgrim] has the option between shaving or trimming, if
the Hajj was his first, although shaving is preferred in general,
especially on the first Hajj.

471. If one was an agent on behalf of someone else, the agent is
obliged to the rulings that apply to himself, so for example, if the
agent was on his second or more Hajj, he has the choice between shaving
or trimming even if he was acting on behalf of someone for his first
Hajj.

472. All of the above applies to male pilgrims, as for female pilgrims,
they are obliged to trimming, and they are not obliged to shaving at
all, and in fact it is forbidden for them to do so. They should trim
some of their hair or clip their fingernails as mentioned previously for
