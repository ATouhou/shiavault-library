The Burning of the Tents
========================

After Shamer Bin Zi Al-Jawshan had failed to kill Imam Zein El-Abedeen
(Q), the soldiers started to pull the ladies and children out of the
tents and set them on fire. So they came out weeping, bare footed and
without any of their belongings. And it is not hidden that all the tents
had been set on fire, as it was said by Imam Reda Q: "Our camps were set
on fire" Yet it appears that this pavilion, where all the ladies and
children had gathered along with Imam Zein El-Abedeen (Q), was the last
one to be burned after they had been pulled out of it.

That is when Sayyeda Zeinab (O) went out calling with a sad voice and a
depressed heart: ""Alas Muhammad, May the King of Heavens bless you,
this is Hussain, covered with blood and dirt, while his body parts are
cut off, How saddening is that! And your daughters are now captives. To
Allah we complain, to Muhammad Al-Mustafa, to Ali Al-Murtada, to Fatima
Al Zahra’a and to Hamza the Master of Martyrs!"

"Alas Muhammad this is Hussain thrown on the desert land, in the hot
wind. He had been murdered by the sons of wrong doers. Alas how sad and
distressed I am for you Aba Abdullah! Today, My Grandfather, Allah’s
Prophet (P), died". O Muhammad’s companions, here are the Pedigrees of
Al-Mustafa treated like captives!!"
