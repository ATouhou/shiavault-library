On Walking
==========

If you are intelligent, then you should be of firm resolution and
sincere intention before you set out for any place, for surely the
self's nature is to overstep the bounds and encroach on the forbidden.
You should reflect when you walk, and take note of the wonders of
Allah's work wherever you go. Do not be mocking, or strut when you walk;
Allah said,


<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلَا تَمْشِ فِي الْأَرْضِ مَرَحًا ...
  </p>
</blockquote>


*** Do not go about in the land exulting overmuch.*** (31:18)

Lower your gaze from whatever is inappropriate to faith, and remember
Allah frequently. There is a tradition which says that those places
where, and in connection with which, Allah is mentioned will testify to
that before Allah on the Day of Judgement and will ask forgiveness for
those people so that Allah will let them enter the Garden.

Do not speak excessively with people along the way, for that is bad
manners. Most of the roads are the traps and markets of Satan, so do not
feel safe from his tricks. Make your coming and your going in obedience
to Allah, striving for His pleasure, for all your movements will be
recorded in your book, as Allah said,


<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَوْمَ تَشْهَدُ عَلَيْهِمْ أَلْسِنَتُهُمْ وَأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَرْجُلُهُم
بِمَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>


***On the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet shall
bear witness against them regarding what they did,*** (24:24) and


<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَكُلَّ إِنسَانٍ أَلْزَمْنَاهُ طَآئِرَهُ فِي عُنُقِهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>


***We have made every man's actions to cling to his neck.*** (17:13)
