As regards the rights and status of women in society, the question
arises as to whether the natural rights and status of men and women are
identical or not; whether nature has gifted these rights bisexually or
unisexually.

What is now before the respected reader is a series of three articles
which, based on Quranic statements, claim that the question of the
system of rights for women in the home as well as in society should once
again be assessed.
