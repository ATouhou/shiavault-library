Chapter Four : the Hadith
=========================

**1. Preliminary Details & Definitions**

HADITH (حديث) literally means \`talk\`. Its plural is AHADITH.(أحاديث)
In SHI\`A terminology \`HADITH\` means the talk of a MA\`SUM and also
that narration which describes the talk, action or \`TAQRIR\` of a
MA\`SUM. Talk of a MA\`SUM includes his writings and sign (ISHARAH)
also. If a MA\`SUM abstains from a work or thing, then this abstaining
also is counted as an \`action\` (in the above definition).

\`TAQRIR\` of a MA\`SUM means that if a follower of a MA\`SUM did a
work in the presence of the presence of the MA\`SUM and the said MA\`SUM
did not prohibit that work\_ even though he was in a position to forbid
it is he so wished\_ then it is called \`TAQRIR\` of the MA\`SUM. We may
translate this term as \`tacit approval\` or \`silent approval\`.

If a narration does not reach up to a MA\`SUM, it is not counted as \`
HADITH \` according to SHI\`A terminology. (Though sometimes a talk of a
companion of a MA\`SUM or a disciple of such a companion is called \`
HADITH \` just as a figurative expression.) According to the SUNNI
terminology, talk, action and TAQRIR of the Prophet, his companions and
disciples of such companions is called \` HADITH \`. HADITH is also
known as KHABAR (خبر) i.e. news and ATHAR (أثر) i.e. trace or track.

Many terms will be used in the following chapters. It is, therefore,
necessary to explain important ones beforehand. Here a compete tradition
is given with its translation:

<p dir="rtl">
حماد بن سلمة عن محمد بن إسحاق عن عمرو بن شعيب عن أبيه عن جده قال : "قلت
يا رسول الله اكتب كل ما أسمع منك؟ قال, نعم . قلت في الرضا والغضب؟ قال,
نعم. فإني لا أقول في ذلك إلا الحق".
</p>

HAMMAD IBN SALMAH narrated from MUHAMMAD IBN ISHAQ who narrated from
\`AMR IBN SHU\`AYB who narrated from his father who narrated from his
father who said:

"I said, O Messenger of Allah, should I write everything which I hear
from you?" The Prophet said, "Yes, I said, 'In pleasure and
displeasure?" (That is, Should I write everything said by you in every
condition?) The Prophet said, "Yes! Because I do not say any condition
but the truth". The first part of the HADITH contains the names of the
narrators who had transmitted it one to the other. This chain of
narrators is called SANAD (سند) Its plural is ASNAD.

The second part is the actual narration beginning from "I said, 'O
Messenger of Allah' up to the end of the HADITH. It is called MATN (متن)
i.e. the next. The narrator is called RAWI (راوي). Its plural is RUWAT.
The SANAD and MATN together are called one HADITH. A scholar of HADITH
is called MUHADDITH (محدّث). Its plural is MUHADDITHUN or MUHADDITHIN.

2. The Status of HADITH.

After the QUR'AN, the HADITH of a MA'SUM is the most important binding
authority (HUJJAT) IN Islam; and if anyone wants to succeed on the Day
of Judgment, then he must follow the QUR'AN and HADITH together. For
example Allah says in the QUR'AN; "O You who believe! Obey Allah and
obey the Prophet and those who are Masters of the Affairs among you"
(4:63).

In this AYAH Allah makes it obligatory for the believers to obey the
Holy Prophet and the Masters of the Affairs, i.e. the Twelve Imams.
Obviously nobody can follow the Holy Prophet and the Imams unless he
knows what the Holy Prophet and Imams had said or done. And that brings
us to AHADITH.

**MEANING OF OBEDIENCE & FOLLOWING**

To follow a MA'SUM means to do the same work as has been done by the
MA'SUM with the same intention. For example, the Holy Prophet received
some money from a Muslim by way of ZAKAH; if now someone usurps some
property or money from someone without any religious authority it will
not be called following in the foot-steps of the Prophet. It should be
remembered that the AHADITH of the twelve Imams (a.s.) and the Lady
FATIMAH AZ-ZAHRA (A.S.) are The AHADITH of the Holy Prophet himself.

The Imams themselves have made it quite clear many times. For example,
IMAM MUHAMMAD BAQIR (A.S.) said, "When I narrate a HADITH without
mentioning any chain of narrators, then my SANAD is from my father, who
narrated it from my grandfather (IMAM HUSAYN) from his father (Imam Ali)
from the Messenger of Allah who heard it from JIBRA'IL who was informed
of it by Allah". The same declaration was made by IMAM JA'FAR AS-SADIQ
(A.S.) about his own AHADITH.

A person who did not see a MA'SUM or did not hear from him, the only
way for him to know the religion is through the AHADITH of the Holy
Prophet, the 12 Imams and the Lady FATIMAH AZ-ZAHRA (peace be on them
all). It is, however, necessary to see that the HADITH is authentic
before acting upon it. In the following pages some details about the
categories of AHADITH will be given to help the readers in this task.

3. The Categories of HADITH.

The value of a HADITH depends very much on the probity and
trustworthiness of its narrators, the RUWAT.

THE RUWAT:

Some important qualifications of a RAWI are as follows:

The RAWI of a HADITH must be an adult (BALIGH), sane, Muslim, just
(ADIL), and of good memory; according to the SHI'A ITHNA ASHERI sect, he
should also be a SHI'A ITHNA ASHERI, though in some cases, the AHADITH
narrated by non-ITHNA ASHERI Muslims are acceptable. ADIL means a person
who does not commit any major sin (not intentionally) then he repents at
once. Only an ADIL person can be relied upon. If he is not ADIL, he
might forge AHADITH and mislead people. Good memory is necessary for a
RAWI if he is to be trusted; otherwise, he may forget something and thus
change, add or omit some wordings from the HADITH.

It is not necessary that a RAWI should be a scholar or learned
person.


**The Four Types Of Hadith**

ALLAMAH AL-HILLI and the ULAMA coming after him have divided the
AHADITH into four categories according to the qualifications of the
RUWAT:

1. SAHIH (Correct: True): A HADITH all of whose RUWAT are SHI'A ITHNA
ASHERIS and all have been praised for their trustworthiness. For
example, such wordings have been used for all of them: "He is
trustworthy- THIQAH": "His AHADITH are correct- SAHIHU'L- HADITH" and
such other words which show their trustworthiness.

2. HASAN (Good): A HADITH, all of whose narrators are SHI'A ITHNA
ASHERIS but not all of them have been praised for trustworthiness;
instead some or all have been praised in such word: "He is
virtuous -MUSTAHSAN" or "He is of good memory- HAFIDH".

3. MUWATHTHAQ (Reliable): A HADITH not all of whose narrators are SHI'A
ITHNA ASHERI, but all have been praised for trustworthiness.

4. DA'IF (Weak): A HADITH, which is neither SAHIH, HASAN nor
MUWATHTHAQ.

The first three categories are considered as genuine. DA'IF has got no
worth at all, unless it was accepted by all 'ULAMA of the early period,
in which case it is called MAQBUL (acceptable), that is, accepted by
early scholars. As has been mentioned earlier, a HADITH consists of a
SANAD (chain of narrators) and a MATN (text). If a HADITH is classified
as DA'IF (weak), it means that that particular SANAD is weak. But that
same text might have been narrated somewhere else with SAHIH, HASAN or
MUWATHTHAQ SANAD; and the value of HADITH will change accordingly.

**MUTAWATIR & WAHID**

HADITH is also classified into "MUTAWATIR" and "WAHID" categories based
on the number of its ASNAD:

1. MUTAWATIR (متواتر) : It means a HADITH narrated at every stage by so
many people that the very number of narrators is enough to create a
conviction of its truth. A HADITH is classified as MUTAWATIR only if it
fulfils the following four conditions:

(a) There must be, in all stages of narration, so many people that
common sense cannot accept their coming together to forge a lie. If the
number is great, fro example, in the beginning and the end but too small
in the middle, such a HADITH is not called MUTAWATIR.

For example, the number of the narrators of the HADITH "INNAMA
'L-A'MALU BI 'N-NIYYAT- Verily, the actions are valued by the
intentions" is too great in the middle and the later stages, but in the
beginning its only narrator in UMAR IBN AL-KHATTAB. So, this HADITH is
not MUTAWATIR.

(b) The information conveyed should be about a thing which can be felt
by one of the five senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch).
(c) The hearers should not have prior knowledge of that matter.
(d) The hearers should not have a prior doubt about that information
nor a preconceived belief opposed to that information.

If a HADITH is classified as MUTAWATIR, then there is no need to look
at its individual ASNAD, or the credentials of its RUWAT. MUTAWATIR is
of two kinds:

i. MUTAWATIR in words:

A HADITH, which is narrated by all narrators with the same wording. For
example, the HADITH "MAN KUNTU MAWLAHU FA HADHA 'ALIYUN MAWLAHU - He
whose Master am I, 'Ali is his Master", and also the HADITH "MAN KADHABA
'ALAYYA FAL-YATABAWWA' MAQ'ADAHU FI 'N-NAR"- whoever tells a lie on me,
should prepare his abode in the Fire", are MUTAWATIR in words. ii.
MUTAWATIR in meaning:

If the narrators use different wordings but there is a common factor in
all narrations, then that common factor will be called MUTAWATIR in
meaning. For example, let us suppose that some one says that 'ALI IBN
ABI TALIB (A.S.) killed 35 enemies in the battle of BADR; another says
that he conquered the fortress of KHAYBAR; a third one says that he
stayed fighting in UHUD while others had fled away, and likewise. Now
all such narrations have one common factor- that 'Ali (a.s.) was
extra -ordinarily brave person. Though each and every narration in
itself may not be MUTAWATIR but the braver of Ali is MUTAWATIR.

2. WAHID: The second main category of HADITH based on the number of
narrators is WAHID (واحد). Every HADITH, whose narrators are not so many
as to make it MUTAWATIR, is called WAHID.

As the MUTAWATIR HADITH creates a sure knowledge of its truth, it is
obligatory to follow it. But the WAHID HADITH creates not a sure
knowledge but only a reasonable assumption of its truth. However, if the
WAHID HADITH is substantiated by the context or association (QARINAH)
which creates certainty of its truth, then it will be obligatory to
accept and follow it like a MUTAWATIR HADITH. Here are a few examples of
such contexts:

- Conformity with logical reasons;

- Conformity with the clear meaning of the QUR'AN;

- Conformity with other authentic AHADITH;

- Conformity with an unanimous belief of the Muslims and / or the SHI'A
sect of Islam.

If a WAHID HADITH is associated with any of the above mentioned
contexts, it must be accepted and followed. If it is not joined by any
such context, then also according to many 'ULAMA, it is allowed to
follow it, provided it is not against any accepted tenets of the
religion.

4.Recording of the AHADITH.

As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the Holy Prophet (P)
encouraged people to write down whatever they heard him saying.
Unfortunately, the first three Caliphs reversed this policy and forbade
people to narrate or write any HADITH of Prophet (P). The first caliph
burned such writings and this policy was followed by the 2nd and the 3rd
caliphs.

In contrast to this policy, IMAM ALI IBN ABI TALIB (A.S.) always
emphasized the importance and essentiality of writing the AHADITH. Many
companions of the Prophet like 'ABDULLAH IBN ABBAS, SALMAN AL-FARISI,
ABU DHARR AL-GHIFARI, BILAL and ABU RAFI' wrote down the traditions of
the Holy Prophet. Likewise many of their disciples, like MITHAN TAMMAR,
ALI IBN ABU RAFI, RABI'AH IBN SUMAY, ASBAGH IBN MUBATAH, UBAYDULLAH IBN
AL-HUR, and SULAYM IBN QAYS AL-HILALI also wrote the traditions heard
from Imam Ali and other trustworthy companions.

Unfortunately almost all those books are now lost except the book of
SULAYM IBN QAYS AL-HILALI. The system established by the Prophet (P) and
Ali (a.s.) was followed by the Imams of AHLUL-BAYT, and we find that
thousands of famous companions of Imams (a.s) had collected all the
AHADITH they heard from them. Some of those companions are so highly
respected that a HADITH narrated by any one of them is considered
authentic by many SHI'A scholars. Such companions of the Imams are
divided into three groups:

First Group consists of six companions of Imam MUHAMMAD AL-BAQIR (A.S.)
and Imam JA'FAR AS-SADIQ (A.S.) as follows:

1. ZURARAH IBN A'YAN.
2. MA'RUF IBN KHARABBUDH.
3. BURAYD IBN MU'AWIYAH AL-BIJILLI.
4. ABU BASIR AL-ASADI.
5. FUDAYL IBN YASAR.
6. MUHAMMD IBN MUSLIM ATH-THAQAFI.

Some people count ABU BASIR AL-MURADI in place of ABU BASIR AL-ASADI.
Second Group consists of six companions of Imam JA'FAR AS-SADIQ (A.S.)
as follows:

1. JAMIL IBN DARRAJ.
2. ABDULLAH IBN MASKAN.
3. ABDULLAH IBN BUKAYR.
4. HAMMAD IBN UTHMAN.
5. HAMMAD IBN ISA.
6. ABAN IBN UTHMAN AL-AHMAR.

Third Group consists of six companions of Imam MUSA AL-KAZIM (A.S.) and
Imam ALI AR-RIDHA (A.S.) as follows:

1. YUNUS IBN ABDU 'R-RAHMAN YAQTINI.
2. SAFWAN IBN YAHYA AL-SABIRI.
3. ABDULLAH IBN AL-MUGHIRAH.
4. MUHAMMAD IBN ABI 'UMAYR AL-AZDI.
5. AL-HASAN IBN MAHBUB.
6. AHMAD IBN MUHAMMAD IBN ABI NASR.

Some people count HASAN IBN ALI IBN FADDAL in place of HASAN IBN
MAHBUB; others add the name of FADHALA IBN AYYUB or UTHMAN IBN ISA in
this list. Some other famous names are ABU HAMZAH ATH-THUMALI, ABAN IBN
TAGHLIB, JABIR INB YAZID AL-JU'FI, MUHAMMAD IBN QAYS, HISHAM IBN
AL-HAKAM, HISHAM IBN SALIM, ABDULLAH IBN YAHYA AL-KAHILI, ALI IBN RI'AB
AL-KUFI, MANSUR IBN HAZIM, ALI IBN YAQTIN IBN MUSA, ABDULLAH IBN
MUGHIRAH AL-BIJILLI, MU'AWIYAH IBN HUKAYM, ZAKARIYYAH IBN ADAM, ISMA'IL
IBN MIHRAN, ABDU'R-RAHMAN IBN ABI NAJRAN AT-TAMIMI, HUSAYN IBN SA'ID IBN
AL-HAMMAD, ALI IBN MAHAZYAR AL-AHWAZI, FADHL IBN SHADHAN, ABU JA'FAR
AHMAD IBN MUHAMMAD IBN ISA, AYYUB IBN NUH IBN DARRAJ, ALI IBN IMAM
JA'FAR AS-SADIQ (A.S), AHMAD IBN ISHAQ AL-QUMMI.

These are some of those highly respected companions of Imams (a.s) who
collected traditions and wrote many other books, which are mentioned in
their biographical details and in SHI'A bibliographical works. In short,
from the days of Imam Ali (a.s) up to the days of Imam HASAN AL-ASKARI
(A.S.) companions of Imams (a.s) wrote more than 6600 books, most of
them containing the AHADITH of the Holy Prophet (P) and the Imams
(a.s).
