Difference of Opinion Regarding Jesus' Ancestry
===============================================

St Matthew and St Luke have a difference of opinion regarding Jesus’
ancestry according to their respective Books. In the Books of St Mark
and St John, no mention is made of his ancestry.

(1) St Matthew, in 1:16, states that Joseph is the son of Jacob:

**“And Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born
Jesus (P), who is called Christ.”**

St Luke, in 3:23, states that Joseph is the son of Heli:

**“Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his
ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of
Heli,”**

(2) St Matthew relates the ancestors of Jesus (P) back to Solomon, son
of King David, in 1:6:

**"And Jesse the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon,
whose mother had been Uriah's wife."**

St Luke, on the other hand, in 3:31, relates him to Nathan, son of
David, brother of Solomon:

**“…the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of
Nathan, the son of David.”**

(3) St Matthew names 26 fathers between Jesus (P) and Solomon's father,
David. St Luke, on the other hand, names 42! Surely, this contradiction
is enough evidence to prove that these Books cannot be Gospel!

### Contradiction about the Crucifixion

If we look at St Luke 23:46, we find:

**"Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit
my spirit." When he had said this, he breathed his last."**

Compare this to St Matthew's account in 27:46:

 **"About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi,
lema sabachthani?" meaning, "My God, my God, why you forsaken me?"**

I have written out the verses for you, but please go back and look at
the Bible.
