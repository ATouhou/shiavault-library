112. The Absolute Negation.
===========================

It was mentioned earlier that one has to use some form of** لَيسَ** to
negate the Arabic equational sentence. However, Arab grammarians have
also defined a rather "strong" semantic environment where you have to
use**Í**   instead. They called this method** لا النافية للجِنس** .
Check the following examples:

**1.** There is a man in the house.             **في البَيتِ رَجُلٌ.**

**2.** There is no man in the house.**لـَيسَ في البَيتِ رَجُلٌ.**

****3.** There is a no man in the house.   لا رَجُلَ في البَيتِ.**
