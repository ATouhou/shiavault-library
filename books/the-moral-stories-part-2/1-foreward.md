Bahlool is well known in the Islamic history for his readily outspoken
ways of expressing his views on deep questions of Islamic jurisprudence
and ethics.

What makes his life stories even more interesting is the amusing way in
which he behaved and talked, not only to ordinary people but also to
those in high positions.

The way he retorted to and admonished Haroon Rasheed - the Abbaside
Caliph for his oppressive and lavish life-style is indeed remarkable.

To enable students of Islamic history to benefit from the moral lessons
imparted by Bahlool during his life time, I have endeavoured to adapt
and translate his stories from a number of sources, adding short
explanatory notes and relevant quotations from the Holy Qura'n and
ahadith.

Different moral and intellectual topics dealt with and the amusing and
logic styles in which they are presented should also make this booklet a
useful Source for preparing dialogues in schools for the moral training
of young ones.

Readers are requested to accord due respect to this booklet in view of
the sacred quotations in Arabic from the Holy Qura'n. May they also help
us in circulation so as to spread its benefit far and wide.
