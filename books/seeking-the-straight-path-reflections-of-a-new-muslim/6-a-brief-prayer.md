 A Brief Prayer
===============

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.*  
* *  
*Peace be upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.*  
    
 I offer thanks to the Almighty Allah (swt) Who guided me while no one
else around me was guided and Who is the source of every magnificent
bounty I have enjoyed in my life. Allah (swt) is indeed the Beneficent,
the Merciful, and to Him belongs all praise.  
    
 May Allah (swt) grant all readers of this work good health of body,
mind and spirit and aid them in their daily struggles.  
    
 May Allah (swt) guide us all on the straight path and prevent us from
departing it. May He protect us from misguidance and evil temptation,
decreasing the number of our sins and increasing the number of our good
deeds. May He purify for us our intentions, increase our wisdom and
knowledge, and grant us the good from His endless bounty both in this
life and the hereafter. May our remembrance of the One God be constant
and perfect.  
    
 Peace be upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, who have performed
their duties perfectly and preserved the Truth.
