225. Ordinal numbers are nouns that indicate the order of things. For
example: **الولد** **الرابع** (the fourth boy).

226. There are twelve ordinal numbers: **أوَّل** (first), **ثانٍ**
(second), **ثالِث** (third), **رابِع** (fourth), **خامِس** (fifth),
**سادِس** (sixth), **سابِع** (seventh), **ثامِن** (eighth), **تاسِع**
(ninth), **عاشِر** (tenth), **مِئَة** (hundredth), and **ألف**
(thousandth).

227. There are four types of ordinal numbers:

• Single: from first to tenth.

• Compound: from eleventh to nineteenth.

• Decimal: from twentieth to ninetieth and a hundredth and a thousandth.

• Coupled: from twenty-first to ninety-ninth.

228. Ordinal numbers follow the numbered object in gender. For example:
**الرجل** **الرابع** **و** **الفتاة** **الرابعة** (the fourth man and
the fourth girl). The exception to this rule is decimal numbers, they
remain the same regardless of the gender of the numbered object. For
example: **الکاتب** **العشرون** **و** **الکاتبة** **العشرون** (the
twentieth male author and the twentieth female author)

229. All of the ordinal numbers are declinable. The exception to this is
compound numbers, they are indeclinable with a *fathah*.
