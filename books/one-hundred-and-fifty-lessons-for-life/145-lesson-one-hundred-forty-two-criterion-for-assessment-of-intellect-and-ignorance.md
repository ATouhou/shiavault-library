Lesson One Hundred Forty Two: Criterion For Assessment Of Intellect And Ignorance
=================================================================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَللِّسانُ مِعْيارُ اِطاشَةِ الْجَهْلِ وَ اَرْجِحَةِ الْعَقْلِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The tongue is the criterion for assessment of insolence or ignorance and
the scale of intellect and wisdom.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The tongue is the most important window to man’s soul , the key to
understanding his personality, and the best means for assessment of the
degree of his intellect . Through a simple and seemingly unimportant
rotation , this tongue of ours unveils the curtains and reveals the
inner realities of man’s soul.

For this reason, many Islamic instructions are focused on correction of
tongue and we are admonished frequently by our great leaders to be
careful in what we say. It is true that complete correction of tongue is
not possible without correction of soul and mind, but we can avoid a lot
of painful consequences of inappropriate movements of tongue through
silence and self-control in our speech.
