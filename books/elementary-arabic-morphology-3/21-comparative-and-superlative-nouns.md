100. A comparative/superlative noun is a form that indicates a
characteristic of something that is greater than something else, for
example: **یوسفُ أکبرُ من یُونس.**

101. A comparative/superlative noun is formed from triliteral verbs on
the form **أفعَل.** The conditions are that the verb is able to be
conjugated, active, complete, positive, able to be compared, and does
not indicate color, defects, or trickery, for example: **أنتَ أعلَمُ من
أخیکَ.**

102. If one wants to form a comparative/superlative from verbs that have
more than three letters or from verbs that indicate color, defects, or
trickery one must mention its infinitive in the accusative case being a
specificative after **أشدّ و أکثر** or the likes. So it is said: **هو
أکثر احتراماً لأبیه.**
