41. The Prayer Of The Holy Prophet (S) Would Be There In His Favor
==================================================================

It is mentioned in *Ihtijaaj* that the Messenger of Allah (S) after the
mention of the Purified Imams (as) raised up his hands in supplication
and prayed:

“O my Lord, love those who love my caliphs and accept the *Wilayat* of
the Imams of the Ummah after me. And be inimical to those who are
inimical to them and help those who help them and disgrace those who
want to cause disrespect to them…”[^1]

Without any doubt, *Dua* for the Master of the Time (aj) is acceptance
of his *Wilayat* and a kind of helping His Eminence and all the rightful
Imams (as). Other matters derived from this point would also be
mentioned in the coming pages, *Insha Allah Taala*.
