1- Albert Schweitzer, Philosophy of civilization (New York: Macmillan,
1949).

2- The validity, comprehension, applicability, and simplicity of law are
some factors that need to be considered in studying any civilization.

3- For example, ancient agricultural societies are now considered more
civilized than hunter-gatherer societies. Agricultural societies evince
more prudent and systematic thought than hunter-gatherer societies and
forethought is a distinguishing feature of a civilized society. Such
systematic thinking and forethought manifest themselves clearly in the
laws of these ancient civilizations. If humans are left to their
impulses, society will not progress. Furthermore, a civilized act
requires the use of reason to think not only about this life, but also
about the hereafter.

4- For a philosophical and theological introduction to Islam, see
Mashhad Al-Allaf, Mirror of Realization (St. Louis, MO: IIC Classic
Series, 2003).

5- See Mashhad Al-Allaf, Dr. Yāsin Khalīl siratuhu wa falsafatuhu wa
camāluhu cilmiyya [Dr. Yāsin Khalīl: His philosophy and scientific
works], (Baghdad, Iraq: University of Baghdad Press, 1988), pp.
298–[^302]: While Dr. Yāsin Khalīl used this model to clarify the Arabic
sciences; the model being used here represents Islamic civilization.
