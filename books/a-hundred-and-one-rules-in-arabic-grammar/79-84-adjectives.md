84. Adjectives
==============

We learned earlier that adjectives in Arabic are usually placed after
the noun they modify, and therefore, they agree in terms of number,
gender, definiteness/indefiniteness, and case with that noun. The
comparative and superlative degrees of the adjectives are formulated
following the pattern [Af’alu] **(** **أفعَلُ** **)** . They should be
treated as Diptotes (no Nunation & accusative marker for genitive case).

Therefore,** **  **قَريبٌ** --------\>** ** **أقربُ**

and   **جَميلٌ** --------\>** ** **أجملُ**

**a.** With comparative adjectives, you need to use the preposition
(**مِنْ** ) to compare the two nouns, as in:

My house is smaller than hers.  **بَيتي أصغرُ مِنْ بَيتِها**

**b.** In superlative, the most common method is to place the adjective
before the noun, as in:

<p dir="rtl">
**بَيتي أصغرُ بُيتٍ في القريةِ.**
</p>

My house is the smallest (house) in  the village

*Please remember that the comparative and superlative forms of
adjectives are gender blind. Therefore,* **أصغرُ** *can be used for
feminine and masculine nouns as well.*
