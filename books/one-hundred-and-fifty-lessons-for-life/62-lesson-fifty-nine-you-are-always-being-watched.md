Lesson Fifty Nine: You Are Always Being Watched
===============================================

Imam al-Jawad (a.s) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِعْلَمْ أَنَّكَ لَنْ تَخْلُو مِنْ عَيْنِ اللّهِ فَانْظُرْ كَيْفَ
تَكُونُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

You should know that you are never out of God’s sight. Now how shall you
be?[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

The first sign of belief in God, the Almighty, is when one feels being
under His constant and overall control, from never being out of His
sight, and also feeling that His watchmen have surrounded us from all
directions.

The higher degree of belief results in more and deeper feeling for this
control so that man finds himself constantly in His presence. This
feeling is the greatest motivator for correction of faults at the level
of the individual and the society . It is also the most beautiful
manifestation of belief and can rectify some of the most complex social
disorders.
