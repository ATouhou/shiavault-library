Lesson 9: The roots of Religion (I)
===================================

I. Tawheed (Oneness of God)
---------------------------

Tawheed means that Allah is One. He has neither any colleague nor any
partner. He is neither born of any parent nor has He any wife, children
or relatives.

II. Adl (Justice of God)
------------------------

It means that God is Just. He is not a tyrant. Everybody's awards will
depend upon his deeds. He who obeys His commands will be awarded a place
in Paradise and he who disobeys Him will be sent to Hell.  
 In this connection, the Qur’an says:

***“ALLAH affirms that there is no god but He: and so do the angels, and
these endowed with knowledge, He is standing firm in justice”. (3:18)***
