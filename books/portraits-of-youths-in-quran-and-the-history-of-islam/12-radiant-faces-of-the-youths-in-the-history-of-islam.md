Radiant Faces of the Youths in the History of Islam
===================================================

Dear readers!

In this chapter you will find the figures of those youths whose events
are written in gold in human history. They are the shining stars that
appeared on the horizons of the Arabian Peninsula fourteen hundred years
ago. They had brightened the entire world with their wonderful noble
deeds. We have divided this chapter in three parts as under:

First Part: Period of the Holy Prophet and his faithful companions.

Second Chapter: The period of the Holy Imams till Occultation of Imam
Mahdi.

Third Chapter: From occultation till the present times.

Let us begin with the holy life of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.s.).
