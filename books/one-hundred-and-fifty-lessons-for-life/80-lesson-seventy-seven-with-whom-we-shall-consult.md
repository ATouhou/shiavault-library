Lesson Seventy Seven: With Whom We Shall Consult?
=================================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لاتُدْخِلَنَّ فِى مَشْوَرَتِكَ بَخِيلاً يَعْدِلُ عَنِ الْفَضْلِ وَ
يَعِدُكَ الْفَقْرَ وَ لاجَبَاناً يُضْعِفُكَ عن الأُمُورِ وَ لا
حَرِيصاً يُزَّيِّنُ لَكَ الشّرَة بِالْجَوْرِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Do not consult with misers because they prevent you from service to
people and frighten you from poverty, and do not consult with timid
people, because they weaken your will to perform important tasks, and do
not consult with greedy persons, because they beautify injustice to
you.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Consultation is one of the important Islamic instructions, but while
consultation with the right persons helps in improvements and corrective
actions, consulting those with certain weaknesses is harmful. Imam Ali
recommends that we strictly avoid consulting, specially in important
social affairs, with those who are miser or timid or greedy. One of them
prevents man from munificence of divine graces, and the other weakens
his resolve, and the third encourages man to violate rights of others
out of greed.
