Story no. 25: Salaam, good morning
==================================

Mahdi, a three year old small boy got up in the morning.  
 He said “Mamma, salaam”.  
 Mother replied “Alaykum as salaam, my good son. I’m very happy that you
came and greeted me”. Mahdi said “Father told me last night that good
children always say ‘salaam’ to their parents when they wake up in the
morning.

Yes, one of the etiquettes of Islam is to greet with salaam, Bravo to
those parents who teach these rules to their children from childhood
itself.
