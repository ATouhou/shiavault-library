63: Hypocrites (munafiqoon)
===========================

This chapter like the previous one on Friday 62 contains 11 verses from
Madina.

It was revealed after Pilgrimage 22 and before The Pleading Woman 58.
This places it following the battle of Uhud which occurred near Madina
in the third year of the Hijra or 625 A. D. Its description of hypocrisy
is very telling.
