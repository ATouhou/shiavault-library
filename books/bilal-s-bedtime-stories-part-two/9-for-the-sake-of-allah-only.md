For the Sake of Allah Only
==========================

During the time of Hazrat Musa, there was a pious man, who used to pray
day and night on the roof of his house. One day some people came and
told him that there was a garden where a tree was being worshiped by a
group of people. On hearing this, the pious man picked up an axe and
went to the tree with the intention of cutting and uprooting the tree.

Satan (the devil) came to him in the form of an old man and asked "What
are you aiming to do?" The pious man explained what was happening and
his intention to cut the tree. The satan said "what have you to do it?
If God wished the tree to be cut, he would have sent his prophet to do
it"

The pious man did not listen. The two went on arguing and quarelling
till they came to blows. He managed to knock the satan down on the floor
and sat in him, aiming at cutting at his troat. The satan begged him for
his pardon and release saying, "Let me sugest you one thing which would
help you in this world as well as in the next world. I shall pay you two
dinars everyday. You can pay partly to the poor and partly spent on
yourself. Leave this ree uncut till God commanded whether it was right
or wrong to cut it"

The pious man was misled by satan. He thought the sugestion was right
and returned home. On the second day, he saw two dinars under his
pillow. He was delighted with the money and spent some after the poor.

But on the folllowing day he did not see the money again as expected,
so he again took over his axe and came at that tree. Again satan came to
him in the form of an old man and asked him "what do you want to do?" He
said, "I want to cut that tree".

Satan told him that he had no power to do it so it was better he went
home. He did not agree and again they fought. This time the satan
succeded in overpowering the pious man and knocked him down on the
floor.

The pious man was suprised at this and asked satan why it so happened
that he could not overpower him this time. The satan replied: "whoever
does a good deed purely for the pleasure of God, no one can face him but
if he does it with an aim of worldly gain then he looses strength and
stands to fail.

Why did the pious man win on the first day and lose on the second in
his fight against the Satan? Because his first intention to cut the
tree, was to please God and nothing else. But the second day, his good
intention had changed and it had become for the sake of money. So the
God given spiritual strength which he had on the first day had then
disappeared and so he lost.

During the time of Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.), his enemies - ten
thousand strongmen, once planned to attack him. The Muslims were then
but very few. Having received the secret news of what was about to
happen, the Muslims dug a very wide ditch around them for their defence
so that the enemy may not attack them all of a sudden.

From the enemy side, a warrior by name 'Amr Bin Abdiwadd' who was very
famous for his strength, courage and art of fighting, landed in the
midst of these Muslims by jumping over the ditchl The Muslims lacked the
courage to face him. Only the lion of Allah, Hazrat Ali (A.S.) came
forward to challenge the intruder! Both drew their swords and were soon
locked, in a fierce duel to death against each other.

At last, Allah bestowed victory to Hazrat Ali (A.S.) who threw Amr down
on the ground and mounted on his chest ready to kill the arch-enemy of
Islam, but before Hazrat Ali (A.S.) could do this, Amr spat in the face
of our Imam.

Everybody around was certain that as a result of this insult, Amr would
meet his death even faster still. But instead Hazrat Ali (A.S.) moved
from Amr's chest and walked away! People around were too surprised to
see why he left loose such a dangerous enemy after overpowering him. Amr
attacked again and after a short while, Hazrat Ali (A.S.) again got
control over him and this time he killed the enemy of Islam.

After the battle was over, people asked Hazrat Ali (A.S.) about the
reason why he had spared Amr's life when he first got control over him.
Hazrat Ali (A.S.) replied, "I wanted to kill him for the sake of Allah
only. He spat on me and thus made me angry. Had I killed him at that
moment, it would not have been for the sake of Allah only. It would have
also been for the satisfaction of my anger. So I let him free. When I
controlled my anger, I killed him purely for the sake of Allah."

This is how the Ahle-Bait - people of the household of our Holy
Prophet, have set examples of sincere intention. Before any action we
take, we must be clear in our minds that the action is in accordance
with the commands of Allah. That, it is for his sake and pleasure
alone.

To keep away from insincere and impure intentions is indeed difficult
but not impossible. This can be done by constant thinking and true
understanding of the aim of our life. We have to understand what Allah
really wants from us.


**Immamate - Is Guidance We Need**

Basra is a big city and the main port of Iraq. It is situated at the
mouth of river Euphrates. There, in a big mosque, people used to
assemble to discuss various subjects on Islamic rules and laws. A famous
learned Priest of Sunni Sect by name Amr Bin Ubeid was once preaching on
the subject of Immamat. He was surrounded by a big crowd of people who
were asking various questions on the subject.

Suddenly, a young and intelligent student of Islam by name of Hesham,
entered the gathering and sat down in the first row. He addressed the
priest saying that he was a stranger and would like to ask some
questions. On getting the permission to do so, he asked the following:


First, Sir, may I please know if you have eyes?

Young Boy! is this a question to be asked?

Whatever it may be, this is my question to which I shall appreciate
your answer. Alright! you are at liberty to ask, even though it is a
foolish question.

As I have already asked, Sir, may I please know if you have eyes? Yes,
I have.

For what use are they?

With eyes, I can see faces of people and colour of various things. And
you have a nose also?

Yes, I do have one.

What is its function?

I smell the scent and odour by it.

And do you have a mouth?

Yes I do have.

For what use is it?

I can talk to people or taste food and drinks with it.

Do you have ears?

Yes, I have two ears.

What is their function?

I can hear voices by them.

And do you have a mind?

Almighty has bestowed me with that also. What is its use?

With that I am able to distinguish things whatever is felt by the other
senses like hands, eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc. In case of a
difference, I am able to solve with its help. In case doubt, I can
dispel with it and be sure.

So, does it mean that despite being sound and healthy, all these organs
cannot function independently without the help of the mind.

No, No! none of the organs can function independently without the help
of the mind. Why is it so? After all, are the organs perfect and strong
enough to differentiate between things?

Young Boy! when any organ has some doubt about a thing which it smells,
sees or tastes, it brings the matter to the mind and it is the mind
which confirms the truth and removes the doubt.

So, from what you have said, do you want me to understand that God
Almighty has created and designed the mind to guide the organs and
remove doubts. Yes! It is so.

So the mind is a necessity, otherwise the organs could not work
independently. Yes.

Please Sir! proclaim your opinion with fairness and justice on this
point also. If Almighty has not left the organs of mans body without the
guidance of the mind, how is it possible that Almighty God could leave
millions of His creatures without an IMAM to guide and solve their
problems arising out of doubts and conflicts? Should not our common
sense accept this fact?

On hearing this logic argument, and having no answer to give, Amr Bin
Ubeid kept silent and went into deep thinking.

Hesham was a deeply learned person and one of the closest companions of
Imam Jaafer Sadiq (A.S.) from whom he had obtained his knowledge.

'IMAM' is an Arabic word which literally means 'Leader'or 'Guide! Any
leader or guide can be good or bad, true or false. Therefore, it is
essential for every Muslim to know what makes and who is a true and good
Imam. The Holy Prophet has said: "If a man dies without recognising the
Imam of his time, he dies the death of ignorance."

It is of utmost importance that the Imam must be appointed by a Prophet
under the command of God, nobody can be an Imam either by claiming to be
so, by inheritance or by the wealth or power which he may have.

It is essential that an Imam possess certain characteristics and
qualities so that a clear distinction can be made between a true and
false Imam. Some of these are as under:

1. An Imam must be free from every defect -Physical as well as
Mental;
2. He must be born of Legal Marriage;
3. He must be Ma'sum (Infallible-Sinless) like the Prophet - from birth
to death;
4. He must possess all knowledge and be the wisest of all human beings
of his time;
5. He must know all the languages including those of animals also;
6. He must be able to perform miracles;
7. He must be Bold, Brave and Most Courageous;
8. He should be most generous and be able to help needy and weak
persons.
In short, an Imam is the Holiest, most Pious of all - after the Holy
Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.)
