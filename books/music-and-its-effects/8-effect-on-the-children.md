Effect on the Children
======================

It is no secret that songs, music and films depend upon sex-appeal for
their success. The more sexy a song the more its sale and the more
suggestive a music the more its market value. And also it is no secret
that building the character of the children begins from their very
tender age. If they are exposed to obscene songs, sexy music and
suggestive dances in their childhood their entire outlook on the matters
of sex morality and marriage-sanctity will become jaundiced. They will
lose the capacity to distinguish between moral and immoral modesty and
immodesty, chastity and promiscuity.

Some people think that the children do not understand these things! Such
people are wrong.  
 Thus, by listening to the songs and seeing the dance on television, we
ruin the moral uprightness of our children. If we believe that children
are given to us by Allah as a trust and that we are responsible to give
them such a training that they become good Muslims and virtuous servants
of Allah, then we must abstain from songs and music and must keep them
safe from the evil influence of these sinful habits. You will find this
subject adequately explained in the Appendix.
