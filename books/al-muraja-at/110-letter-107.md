Letter 107
==========

When did they Mention the Will?
-------------------------------

**Rabiâ€™ al-Thani 19, 1330**

When did they mention the will to the Imam, and when did they use it in
their argument? I do not think that they mentioned it other than in the
presence of the mother of the believers who denied it, as we explained
before, Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*S*
