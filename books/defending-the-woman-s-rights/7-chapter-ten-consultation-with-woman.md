Chapter Ten : Consultation With Woman
=====================================

Family is a small society. Managing this small society is so hard and
delicate. The father and mother, as the basic axes of the family, cannot
easily manage the family if they do not have the power of understanding
and decision-making.

The family management has various aspects, like economic, cultural,
medical, legal, ethical and educational aspects. These aspects exist in
the husband and wife's relationship, the relationship among the
children, and the children-parents' relations.

The small- and large-scale managements are identical in some respects,
so the managers of small societies, such as family, should follow the
methods of large-scale successful managers in their own small society.

One of the factors in successful management is consultation. In other
words, though the final decision is made by one person, s/he consults
with others before making plans and decisions. This has a two-fold
result.

First, the manager's consultation with other people in a system gives
them self-confidence and self-esteem. The second result is that the
system benefits from the experience, knowledge, and information of all
the people. It is evident that 'Not everyone knows everything' and only
by consultation the helpful information of all individuals is gained.

That is why consultation is considered a criterion for the growth of
cognition and future knowledge and has been too much emphasized in
Islam. The Holy Qur'an says :

(And consult with them in the affair ...) 1

Getting advice from others is also stressed in traditions.

Imam Ali (a.s.) said, "It is an incumbent duty of a wise person to add
the views of prudent men to his own view." 2

The Holy Qur'an has mentioned 'consultation' in three verses. One is
addressed to the Holy Prophet (a.s.) to consult with the Muslim Umma on
important issues, which was mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
This is not the consulting about laws, of course, because the lawmaker
is only Allah in Islam, but in the way of carrying out the laws. The
history of Islam has many cases of the Prophet's consulting with his
disciples, like when the Muslims dug the trench in the al-Khandaq Battle
by the idea of Salman.

Another instance of Qur'anic verses about consultation is this verse
:

(... and their affair is a matter of counsel among themselves) 3

This verse is about the entire Muslim nation. Since the verse begins
with: "And those who respond to their Lord and keep up prayer," it
addresses all the believers. This nation should base their activities on
consultation.

The third instance is about consultation in the family.

2 Al-Hayat, 1/314. For more information c.f. Al-Hayat, Farsi
translation 1/313-322.
3 Qur'an, 42: 38.

(... But if both (parents) desire weaning by mutual consent and
counsel, there is no blame on them.) 1

The word (mutual consultation) in this verse means two-sided
consultation. This may refer to the fact that the husband and wife
should ask each other's views regarding the education of children. In
fact, the joint experience and understanding of two managers directs the
family members.

In Majma' al-Bayan, we read :

'"Mutual counsel' means joint consultation between man and woman in the
family. The agreement of the two parents is necessary for deciding about
children. Since, mother knows things about the children of which the
father is-unaware, not consulting may harm the children." 2

Based on this Islamic principle, man and woman should manage the family
jointly. Though the family tasks should be divided between husband and
wife, its management should be done by their cooperation.

This cooperation of man and woman in the family issues and the
education of children is stated in another verse, too :

(... Then if they (wives) suckle (the children) for you, give them
their recompense and enjoin one another among you to do good; and if you
disagree, another woman shall suckle for him (the child).) 3

For the phrase (enjoin one another among you to do good) three meanings
have been mentioned : 4

1. Accepting each other's opinion if it is a good one; because Allah
has ordered the breastfeeding woman and her

husband to follow Allah's command, and each other's opinion if
logical.

2. Ordering each other about the breastfeeding in a good manner

3. Consulting with each other

A fourth meaning is said by Aminul Islam Tabarsi: "You manage among you
the affairs of the child and the taking care of his mother so that not
to make the child miss his mother's kindness ..." 1

In all the four notions, there are joint concepts that respect woman's
personality, consulting with her, and respecting her opinion in family
and children's concerns. The Holy Qur'an commands: Discuss with each
other, suggest ideas, and accept each other's opinions. This verse in
general denies the superiority of men or fathers. Therefore, the husband
and wife should cooperate and consult with each other regarding the
physical and mental education and growth of children. The husband should
not impose his own opinion and tendency on the others.

**Chapter Eleven : Superiority**

Discussing man's superiority is necessary in defending woman's rights,
since this superiority means the absolute ruling of man in the family
and his managing of his wife and children.

Man's superiority or any other kind of superiority is a relationship
among people based on the individual's needs, desires, and opinions that
are imposed on others paying no attention to others' wants and ideas.

This kind of relationship resembles a tyrant oppressor's relationship,
since there are some hidden criteria in such relations that exist in the
autocratic ruling.

One of the reasons behind superiority is the sense of self-admiration.
It can be present in small- or large-scale social relations, between two
people or one person and a group. Just as a ruler can rule in this way,
a father or a mother can manage the family, imposing their own opinions
on the other family members. Thus, the concepts of 'tyrant' or 'despot'
mentioned in the Holy Qur'an are generalizable to any relationship based
on one side's self-admiration and oppression. It also includes any kind
of disrespecting of other people's positions and opinions.

The one, who considers her/himself better than others, humbles them,
and considers their opinions wrong, is an oppressor and a tyrant in the
Islamic teachings, whether s/he acts this way in the society or in
his/her own family.

Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said, "Anyone, who despises people and unduly imposes
his power on them, is a tyrant." 1

Social or managerial self-admiration is rooted in the personal ethical
vices. Pride is an inner cause of superiority-based relations, just as
humbleness is a moral that respect other people and appreciate their
personalities, achievements, opinions, and intellect.

We read in some tradition sources :

The Prophet (a.s.) said, "Avoid pride, because some slave may still be
proud until Allah the Almighty will say: 'Record my this servant among
the tyrants."' 2

Therefore, a proud person can be a tyrant even in the limited round of
his/her affiliates, such as teacher, student, employee, employer,
husband, wife, or friend.

The Holy Prophet of Islam (a.s.) is quoted to say, "Someone may be
considered an oppressor even if he is in no charge except of his own
family." 3

In fact, even the management of a family may be autocratic. Such
Islamic teachings refer to superiority of one person in the family that
is when man or woman acts autocratically and imposes his/her ideas and
wants on others.

2 Mizan Al-Hikma 8/ 300.
3 Ibid.

Imam Sadiq said, "Be humble before your teachers and not be tyrant
scholars, that your untruth may take away your truth." 1

Scholars and professors can have autocratic relations and behave
superiorly with their students that is unlike the humble nature of
man.

The satanic self-admiring autocratic tendency (and its consequences
that lead to the belittling of others) is something undivine and it
results from the weak faith in Allah. In fact, the one, who knows the
Creator's greatness, accepts Him as the Creator of all the creatures and
the Keeper of all these creatures in the future, does not consider
himself independent of and better than other people.

Imam Ali (a.s.) said, "One, who knows the greatness of Allah, should
not see himself as great." 2

For avoiding any autocratic behavior when in power, one should think of
Allah's infinite Power, so that his ending power does not make him
neglect Allah's ever-lasting Might.

Imam Kadhim (a.s.) said, "When you remember your power over the people,
remember Allah's Power over you tomorrow (on the Day of Judgment)." 3

The inhumane autocracy may happen in the simplest forms of social life
as well as in the most complex forms. We read in some tradition sources
:

The Prophet (a.s.) said, "Beware of pride, because pride may exist in
someone who even if has nothing but a cloak on

him." 1

Imam Sadiq (a.s.) has narrated a story from the Prophet's life, which
shows the conceptual variety of tyranny and oppression.

"Pride may exist in any race and kind of people...The Prophet (a.s.)
was passing in some road in Medina when there was a black woman who was
collecting dung. She was asked to clear the way, but she said, 'The way
is very wide.' Some men wanted to push her away, but the Prophet (a.s.)
said, 'Leave her alone because she is arrogant."' 2

Sheikh Majlisi has explained this last phrase as: "... She is proud and
arrogant." 3

If someone has not trained his/her own soul, he or she may become
arrogant. Neither empty-handedness nor knowledge can prevent this vice.
Of course, it is more limited in weaker people and more extended in
powerful ones. This vice may even exist in some scholars and scientists,
since their social relations are wider and they present their opinions
in vaster managerial circles.

Imam Ali (a.s.) said, "Fear Allah, fear Allah for the bad end of pride;
it is the greatest trap of Satan and his biggest plot that overcomes the
hearts of men like fatal poisons. It does fail or leave no one; neither
a scholar for his knowledge, nor a poor man with his rugged dress ..."
4

So any relationship has a tint autocracy, arrogance, or self-deceit
that lead to the degrading and belittling of people is rejected in
Islam.

4 Nahjol Balagha, 578, Translated by Abdul Muhammad Ayati.

Imam Sadiq (a.s.) narrated from the Prophet Muhammad (a.s.) his saying
:

"I curse seven kinds of people whom Allah and every responded-to
prophet curse ... (one of them is he) who rules with arrogance in order
to honor those whom Allah has degraded, and to degrade those whom Allah
has honored ..." 1

Any kind of management should be away from seeking arrogance and
superiority. Two individuals, regardless of their apparent scientific,
religious, financial, and social differences, should have equal
relations.

Islam has warned the people who think they can gain higher social
positions and more supporters by autocratic methods. In fact, it is
humbleness that raises man's position, gains support for his opinions,
and confirms his social base. Hence, those who want to gain more respect
in their management realms, small or large, should replace autocratic
behavior with humble one. Men, for instance, should avoid superior
behavior in the family.

Imam Ali (a.s.) said, "Humbleness brings you gravity." 2

The Prophet (a.s.) said, "Surely, humbleness brings sublimity, so be
humble that Allah may raise you high" 3.

By being humble and respecting others' thought and character, all
opinions are benefited from and everybody participates in all
activities. This way, all the activities are done collectively and
supported by public power, and thus the public power replaces the
individual power.

2 Mizan Al-Hikma 10/ 508.
3 Al-Kafi, 2/121.

Imam Ali (a.s) stated, "With humbleness all affairs are carried
orderly." 1

By humbleness and avoiding of arrogance and self-admiration, friendship
and love spread among the people of a society (whether small or large),
and the safety and soundness of the society become certain, and
collective relations are stabilized.

Imam Ali (a.s) said, "The fruit of humbleness is love, and the fruit of
pride is curse." 2

Imam Ali (a.s) also said, "Humbleness brings you safety." 3

Imam Ali (a.s) said, "Try to put humbleness on your heads, throw the
appearance of mighty under your feet, and take pride out of your necks
..." 4

Equal, and even humble, relations is the sign of wisdom in Islam,
because only wise people understand the human position well and believe
in human greatness. They evaluate human beings by their humane
characteristics, rather than temporary social, economic, or political
status. Therefore, wise men and women avoid superiority in relations,
which is the outcome of self-admiration. They treat all the people of
all social classes humbly.

Imam Ali (a.s.) said, "A wise man humbles himself and he is raised
high, and an ignorant one raises himself and he is lowered." 5

This is a great lesson of Islam to people that any kind of autocracy
(that leads to superiority) prevents growth of the human wisdom. An
arrogant self-admiring person trusts and relies only on his/her own
mind, not consulting with others, thus s/he is deprived of more
knowledge. This way, an arrogant one is always confused in solving the
life problems. S/he is also deprived of new ways and solutions of wise
people, because no one knows everything.

Imam Kadhim (a.s) said, "Surely, a seed grows in the plain and not in
the hard rocks. So is wisdom; it grows in the heart of a humble person
and does not grow in the heart of an arrogant proud one, because Allah
has made humbleness as the tool of wisdom and made pride as the tool of
ignorance." 1

Materializing the human rights -the base of social relations- is
possible by right relations. Violation of the human rights, on the other
hand, happens because of superiority and autocracy in relations.

Imam Sadiq (a.s) narrated from the Prophet (a.s.) his saying, "The
greatest of pride is the despising of people and ignoring the truth."
The Prophet (a.s.) was asked what the meaning of the despising of people
and the ignoring of the truth was, and he said, "It means ignoring the
truth and criticizing its people ..." 2

Because of the importance of this issue, another statement of the
Prophet (a.s.) is mentioned here :

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 Bihar al-Anwar, 78/ 312.
2 Al-Kafi, 2/ 310.

The Prophet (a.s.) said, "Pride is to desert the truth and seek other
than it, and look at people and see that no one's honor is like your
honor and no one's lineage is like yours." 1

The main reason for despising people and violating their rights is the
disrespecting of the human personality of their persons, as is mentioned
in some Islamic teachings :

Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said, "Pride is the deserting of the truth and the
despising of people." 2

Ignoring the truth and denying it is autocracy. Avoiding pride and
superiority is the main factor of seeking the truth and avoiding the
violation of others' rights, either in a large society or a small
society of family.

The Prophet (a.s.) said, "Be humble so that no one may oppress the
other." 3

When man believes in other people's personalities and positions, he
regards himself less important and sees others better than him.
Therefore, he respects their opinions, actions, and rights. This way,
superiority and autocracy do not appear in the social relations. Such
people believe that everybody has an opinion. Even in a family, everyone
can talk about his/her opinion, so that the family members find out new
solutions and guidelines, and thus they shall have a warm life.

The believing in the human personality and value has also a deep effect
in worshipping Allah. The worship of autocrat and proud people is not
accepted, since pride leads

to the lack of belief in others and removes the essence of the loyalty
to Allah.

Imam Sadiq (a.s) said, "Allah the Almighty has said: 'Surely, I accept
the prayer only of one who is not arrogant and proud towards My
people."' 1

These were instructions for the kind of social relation with all
people. There are special teachings about the quality of relations
between man and woman in the small society of 'family' as well. These
teachings necessitate respect, mutual understanding, and avoidance of
autocracy. They also indicate that neither man nor woman is superior in
the family relations; the true criteria in personal and collective
relations are understanding, consultation, value, insight, and
knowledge. The family management should be based on understanding and
capability.

When some woman asked him what the women's rights over men were, the
Prophet (a.s.) replied, "My brother Gabriel (a.s.) often and always
recommends me about women, until I thought that a husband has no right
to say to his wife even "ugh". (He said to me), 'O Muhammad! Fear Allah
the Almighty as to women, for they are deposits in your hands. You have
taken (married) them by the covenant of Allah the Almighty, and so they
have obligatory rights on you for what you have get lawful of their
bodies and enjoyed their pleasures, and for that they bear your children
in their inners until they suffer bitter labor (of childbirth) because
of that. Therefore, be kind to them and delight their hearts, so that
they continue living with and assist you. Do not force them to do
anything (they hate), do not make them angry,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 Al-Wafi, 26/277.

and do not take back anything from what you have granted to them,
except with their satisfaction and permission ..." 1

Some phrases of the Prophet's statement said by Gabriel deny the
imposition of husbands' opinion upon the wives, such as 'delight their
hearts!' or 'Do not force them to do anything the hate!' The ending
phrase, too, rejects men's superiority over women. Islam orders men to
get permission from women for taking their property, so it is clear that
their opinion, mind, and mood should be taken into account in all other
issues, too.

In sum, these Islamic criteria are incongruous with the least amount of
men's superiority and autocratic behavior.

The 'goodness' principle was also discussed in previous chapters. This
principle rejects any superiority of man in the family, since it is in
contrast with the 'goodness', respect, and the value of woman's
personality.
