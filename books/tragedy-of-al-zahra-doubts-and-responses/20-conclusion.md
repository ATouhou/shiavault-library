Conclusion
==========

It is not easy to change deeply-rooted convictions, whether one reads
one book or a hundred; therefore, we cannot expect all people who read
this book to change their minds about certain figures in Islamic history
who are held by some Muslims in the highest regards, so much so that
whenever their names are mentioned, invocations are pronounced to the
Almighty to be pleased with them. We do not think that the Almighty is
pleased with those who displeased the ones whom He loves the most: His
Prophet and Messenger Muhammed (S) and his immediate family, the Ahl
al-Bayt (as) whom He purified with a perfect purification as we read in
33:33 of His Book, the Holy Qur'an. It is hoped that this book has at
least opened some minds and provided some inquisitive readers, those who
sincerely look for the truth, with the impetus to research its contents
and to distinguish truth from falsehood. If we have achieved this goal,
we have won; if not, at least we tried.
