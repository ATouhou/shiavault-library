Malediction in the Qur’an
=========================

In the Noble Qur’an, God, the Most High has expressed [His] malediction
and [His] imprecation on various groups of individuals and this in
itself is evidence of it being permissible to use this word.

Therefore, although we see that the usage of *cussing* has been
prohibited in the Qur’an, however there are many instances in which
*malediction* has been used.
