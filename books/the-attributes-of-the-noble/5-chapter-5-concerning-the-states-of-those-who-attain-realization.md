Chapter 5 : Concerning the States of Those Who Attain Realization
=================================================================

This chapter consists of six sections:

Section one: on trust (tawakkul)
Section two: on resignation (rida)
Section three: on submission (taslim)
Section four: on tawhid
Section five: on ittihad
Section six: on wahdah.

**Section One: On Tawakkul**

God, the Glorious and the Exalted says:

Put you all your trust in God, if you are believers. (5:23) Tawakkul
means to entrust someone with something. Here tawakkul on behalf of a
servant means his entrusting his affairs to God, the Exalted, with the
conviction that He has greater wisdom and power to determine them
according to His providence, and to be happy and satisfied with that
which He does and determines:

And whoever puts his trust in God, He shall suffice him. Indeed God
attains His purpose. (65:3)

Satisfaction with that which God does and causes to happen is attained
by reflecting on one's past condition, when He brought one into
existence when one knew nothing. Then He fashioned numerous signs of His
wisdom in his creation, so much so that one would not be able to know
one out of a thousand of them in a lifetime.

Then, without any prior request, He brought him up taking care of
everything related to his inward and outward aspects, wherewith he can
survive and grow from deficiency to perfection. [Were one to reflect
upon these facts], he would know that whatever will happen in the future
also will not be without His providence and will.

Thence he would trust Him, the Exalted, and would not worry regarding
the remaining matters, being certain that that which has to be
accomplished will be done by God, the Exalted, whether he feels agitated
or not, because:

When someone puts all his trust in God, God takes care of all his needs
and provides him in a manner that he does not reckon. 24

Tawakkul does not imply refraining from making effort with the excuse
that one has left the matter to God. Rather, it means that one should
have the conviction that everything other than God is from God and that
there are many things that happen in the world that occur in accordance
with their conditions and causes.

That is because when the power and will of Cod, the Exalted, make one
thing rather than some other happen, that is inevitably in accordance
with the conditions and means associated with that which takes place.
Hence one should consider oneself, as well as one's knowledge, power and
will-all of them-to be a part of the conditions and means associated
with the occurrence of some matters that one attributes to oneself.
Hence one should devote greater effort to matters wherein one's will and
effort form a part of the conditions and causes of their
realization-like one through whom a work assigned to him by his Master,
Creator and Beloved, is accomplished.

Such a view reconciles jabr (predestination) and qadar (total freedom),
which arc brought into harmony, for if that work be attributed to the
Creator, it would entail jabr and if ascribed [exclusively] to its
conditions and means that would imply qadar.

But if the matter is viewed correctly, it will be seen that neither
jabr is absolute nor qadar, and one would discover the truth of this
statement:

Neither predestination nor independence of causal efficiency, but a
middle position between the two. 25

Thus one should consider oneself to be effective (mutasarrif) in
actions attributed to oneself, with the efficiency of the means, not the
efficiency of the agent in relation to the means. In fact, these two
considerations-one of which is in relation to the agent and the other in
relation to the means-come together [in a synthesis].

Thus everything derives from the agent without the means abandoning its
mediating character. This point is extremely subtle and cannot be
arrived at except with the exertion of the intellectual faculty. Whoever
arrives at this point will know for certain that the destiny (muqaddar)
of all beings is one: that everything that happens comes into existence
at a particular time through particular means and causes in particular
conditions, and any haste in making it happen or an effort to delay it
beyond its time is ineffectual.

He will know himself to be a part of the conditions and means
[necessary for their occurrence], freeing himself from attachment to the
matters of the world, to concentrate on that which relates specifically
to himself rather than to something else. Thereat he would realize the
real meaning of the statement:

Does not God suffice His servant? (39:36)

And thereupon he would be one of the mutawakkilun (those who put their
trust in God), and it is about him and the like of him that this verse
has been revealed:

... and when thou art resolved, put thy trust in God; surely God loves
those who put their trust [in Him]. (3:159)

**Section Two: On Rida**

God, the Glorious and the Exalted, has said:

... That you may not grieve for what escapes you, nor rejoice in what
has come to you ... (57:23)

Rida is gratification and its fruit is love. It entails the absence of
resentment, outward and inward, in the heart, in speech and action.
Those who are preoccupied with the outward (ahl-e zahir) are eager that
God, the Exalted, be pleased with them, that they may remain secure from
His wrath and punishment.

The seekers of the Truth (ahl-e haqiqat) are eager that they may remain
pleased with God, the Exalted, so that none of such various states as
life and death, survival and annihilation, pain and comfort, felicity
and wretchedness, prosperity and poverty be contrary to their desire,
leading them to prefer one of them to the other, for their knowing that
all of them are from the exalted Creator.

The love of God, the Exalted, is fixed in their nature, and hence they
do not seek anything beyond what He wills and determines and are
well-pleased with whatever befalls them.

It is related of one of the sages who possessed this station that in
seventy years of a lifetime he never said when something happened "Had
it not happened!" nor "Had it happened!" when something didn't.

And a sage when asked concerning the effect of rida he had found within
himself answered, "I do not find any trace of rida within myself. Yet,
if I were to be made into a bridge extending over the hell and all the
creation, from the first to the last, were to pass over me into paradise
and I alone were consigned to hell, it would never occur to me why I
didn't receive what others did."

And when the equality of the different aforementioned states becomes
well-established in one's nature, that which happens accords wish his
real desire. Hence it has been said that Everyone gets what he deserves
and deserves what he gets.' For one who has found the Truth, God's
good-pleasure with a servant is realized when the servant's good
pleasure with God is obtained:

God being well-pleased with them and they well-pleased with Him ....
(5:119)

Hence whenever one has an objection concerning the occurrence of
something, whatsoever that may be, or when there is a probability of its
coming to one's mind, one would be devoid of the station of rida.

One who possesses the station of rida is always in a state of ease, for
he has no preferences or reservations, or rather his preferences accord
with all that happens and doesn't happen:

... and God's good-pleasure is greater .... (9:72)

That is why the angel who is the keeper of the paradise is called
Ridwan and it has been said:

Satisfaction with fate is the greatest door to A11ah, 26

for everyone who attains to rida reaches paradise and whatever he
beholds is seen in the light of Divine mercy, and:

The believer sees with the greatest light of Allah. 27

As God, the Exalted, is the creator of all existents, were He to
dislike something it would be impossible for it to come into existence.
And since He has not disliked anything, [the wayfarer] is well-pleased
with everything [that comes into existence], not regretting anything
that doesn't occur, nor feeling elated by that which does:

Surely that is true constancy. (31:17)

**Section Three: On Taslim**

God, the Glorious and the Exalted, has said:

But no, by thy Lord! they will not believe till they make thee the
judge regarding the disagreements between them and then find in
themselves no impediment touching thy verdict but surrender in full
submission. (4:65)

Taslim means submission, and here it means the wayfarer's surrendering
to God everything that pertains to himself.

This station is higher than that of tawakkul, for in tawakkul the
matter is entrusted to God in a manner something is entrusted to a
trustee (wakil), a state wherein one still considers the matter as
pertaining to oneself. In taslim this attachment is severed so that the
wayfarer considers every matter related to himself as pertaining totally
to Him.

This station is also above rida, for in rida everything that God does
accords with one's inclination, whereas in this station one's
inclination and that which agrees with it or is against it is
surrendered in its totality to Gad, so that one has no more any
inclination whatsoever for anything to agree with it or be against it.
(then find in themselves no impediment touching then verdict') this
pertains to the station of rida, and as to ('but surrender in full
submission') that refers to a station higher than it.

And when the Truth-seeking wayfarer peers into himself with a
truth-finding eye, he does not consider either ride or taslim as his
(ultimate] limit, for in each of these two stations he has placed
himself vis-a-vis God, the Exalted, with Whom he is well-pleased and Who
is well-pleased with him, as if he were the giver and God the receiver.
These distinctions disappear at the station of tawhid.

**Section Four: On Tawhid**

God, the Exalted and the Glorious, says:

And set not up with God another god ... . (17:22) Tawhid means to
consider one' and to make one.' In the first sense tawhid in the sense
of affirming shat God, the Exalted, is One-is a prerequisite of faith,
the starting point of gnosis:

God is only one god. (4:171)

In the second sense, it is the ultimate goal of gnosis, which is
achieved subsequent to faith. That is, when one attains certainty that
there is nothing except God, the Exalted, and His effusion in the realm
of being, and that His effusion, too, has no independent being of
itself, turning away from all plurality he considers ail as one and sees
all as one. Thus making all one, he passes within his soul from the
station of "He is One and there is none that may share with Him in
divinity"). to the station of "He is One and there is none that may
share with Him in Being"

In this station, other than God becomes a veil for him, and attention
to other than God is considered by him to be absolute shirk, and he
proclaims with the tongue of his being:

Lo! I have turned my face towards Him Who created the heavens and the
earth, as one of pure faith, and I am not of the idolaters. (6:79)

**Section Five: On Ittihad**

God, the Exalted and the Glorious says:

Therefore, invoke not with God another god, there is no god except Him
... . (28:88)

Tawhid means making one' and ittihad means becoming one with.' There,
it is "Set not up with God another god," and here, "Invoke not with God
another god," for there is a trace of constraint [in tawhid] which is
absent in ittihad.

Hence when the unity becomes absolute and established within the inner
self, so that there is no attention whatsoever to duality, one would
attain to ittihad.

Ittihad is not what some shortsighted people imagine, that it is the
becoming one of the creature with God, the Exalted Greatly exalted is He
above that!' Rather, it means seeing all as Him, without being
constrained to say that everything other than Him is from Him and so all
are one. Rather, his vision is so illumined with the light of His
manifestation, Exalted is His station, that he does not see other than
Him, there remaining no seer, seen, or sight, and all become one.

The prayer of Mansur, Husayn Hallaj:

Between me and Thee, my Iness' contends with me,

So, with Thy grace, remove my Iness' from in between, 28

was granted and his egohood was removed from in between, until he could
say:

I am the One that I love and the One I love is Me.

At this stage, it is known that the one who declared ( )"I am the
Truth" and the one who said, "Glory be to Me, how great is My majesty,"
did not claim divinity but negated his egohood and affirmed the ipseity
of Someone other than himself, and this is the desired goal.

**Section Six: On Wahdah**

God, the Glorious, said:

Whose is the sovereignty this day? It is God's, the One, the
Omnipotent. (40:16)

Wahdah is unity, and this is above ittihad, for ittihad which means
becoming one-smells of plurality, which is not there in wahdah. There,
movement and rest, contemplation and remembrance, wayfaring and journey,
deficiency and perfection, [the distinctions of] seeking, the seeker and
the sought-all vanish, and:

When the discourse reaches God, stop! 29

**Chapter 6 : On Fana**

God, the Exalted, says:

Everything is to perish except His Face. (28:88)

In wahdah there is no wayfarer or wayfaring, way and destination,
search, seeker, and the sought, and everything perishes except His Face.
This matter has neither an affirmation and its explanation, nor a
negation and its explanation; for affirmation and negation are opposites
and duality is the source of multiplicity. Here there is neither
negation nor affirmation, neither negation of negation nor affirmation
of affirmation, neither negation of affirmation nor affirmation of
negation. And this is called land' (annihilation), for the return of
creation is by land' even as its origin was from adam (non-existence):

As He brought you into being, so shall you return. (7:29)

The term fana' has a meaning that is coextensive with multiplicity:

Everyone that is thereon will perish and there remaineth the Face of
thy Lord, the All-majestic, the All-generous. (55:26-27).

This is not the sense of fana' [meant here], for it is beyond anything
that can be said, imagined, and intellected:

To Him reverts the matter in its entirety. (11:123)

This is what we wished to proffer in this brief discourse, which
concludes here.

(Peace be upon him who follows guidance. Thy Lord, the Lord of Honour,
is above what they ascribe to Him, and peace be upon the Messengers, and
praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and benedictions
be upon our master, Muhammad, and the pure and immaculate ones of his
Household, who (prior to their birth) were carried from pure loins to
pure wombs, and from whom God has kept away all impurity and purified
them with a thorough purification.)
