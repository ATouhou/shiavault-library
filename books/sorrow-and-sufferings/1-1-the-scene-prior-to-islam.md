(1) The Scene Prior To Islam
============================

It was a desolate land: sandy, barren, and unfriendly

The home of the Arabs; wild ferocious and manly

They worshipped the idols; they loved to fight

Life to them was wine, women and might

The number of wives, the cattle they owned,

The number of slaves, one's house adorned,

Was a sign of rank in wealth and might;

It was a society, where Might was Right.

Two qualities they had, which were good

The guests they honored, with best of food

Poetry to them, was an art supremely sublime

They were literary geniuses of their time.

They killed female babes, they buried them alive

They married the widows, their father's wives

Vengeance was a passion, cruel the strife

These sons of desert, such was their life.

Morals they had none; wild was their lust

Women were cattle, treated like dust

Enjoyment of life was their sole goal

Woman, they believed, had no soul.

They had no belief in the life Hereafter

Life to them was all fun and laughter

Prophets had come and prophets had gone

Still, this land was of truth shorn.

Judaism was dead; Christianity was in name

Sickly and forlorn, the world remained

Vengeance, to them, was an article of faith

Blindly, they relished their creed of hate.

The priests were interpreters of heavenly laws

They commanded respect and were held in awe

Things that were unlawful, to them were allowed

A privileged class; they were haughty and proud.

In span of four thousand and odd years

Innumerable religions had been reared

With passage of time, they were polluted

Beyond recognition, each got diluted.

The true religions were only in name

It was virtually a devils reign

Truth was at a discount; honesty had fled

Virtue was scoffed at; goodness was dead.

This land was thus chosen for God's last message

It was the crossroad of international passage

The last of message was thus destined,

To stay forever and cover all mankind.
