Mut'ah (temporary Marriage)
===========================

1158. Contracting a temporary marriage with a woman is in order, even
if it may not be for the sake of any sexual pleasure. But the woman can
not stipulate that the man should not have any sexual pleasure with
her.

1159. The obligatory precaution is that a husband should not avoid
having sexual intercourse for more than four months with a young wife of
temporary marriage.

1160. If a woman with whom temporary marriage is contracted, makes a
condition that her husband will not have sexual intercourse with her,
the marriage as well as the condition imposed by her will be valid, and
the husband can then derive only other pleasures from her. However, if
she agrees to sexual intercourse later, her husband can have sexual
intercourse with her, and this rule applies to permanent marriage as
well.

1161. A woman with whom temporary marriage is contracted, is not
entiled to subsistence even if she becomes pregnant.

1162. A woman with whom temporary marriage is contracted, is not
entitled to any bed remuneration, and does not inherit from him, and the
husband, too, does not inherit from her. However, if one or both lay
down a condition regarding inheriting each other, the validity of such a
stipulation is a matter of Ishkal, but even the precaution should be
exercised by putting it into effect.

1163. If a woman with whom temporary marriage is contracted, did not
know that she was not entitled to any subsistence and bed remuneration,
still her marriage will be valid, and inspite of this lack of knowledge,
she has no right to claim anything from her husband.

1164. It is Halal (allowed) for a wife of temporary marriage to go out
of the house without the permission of her husband, if the right of the
husband is in anyway violated. And if the right of her husband remains
protected, it is a recommended precaution that she should not leave the
house without his premission.
