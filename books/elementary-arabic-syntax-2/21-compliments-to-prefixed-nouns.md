Compliments to Prefixed Nouns
=============================

136. What is a compliment to a prefixed noun?  
 A compliment to a prefixed noun is a noun that is related to the noun
before it. For example:  
**خادم الأمیر** (The commander's servant).

137. What is the rule regarding a prefixed noun if it has the *alif-lām*
suffix?  
 The *alif-lām* suffix is erased from prefixed nouns. For example:
**کتابُ المعلّم** (The teacher's book).

138. What is the rule regarding a prefixed noun if it is has nunation?  
 The nunation is erased from prefixed nouns. For example: **سورُ
المدینة** (The city's wall).

139. What is the rule regarding a prefixed noun if it is in the dual
form or a sound masculine plural?  
 The *nūn* is erased prefixed nouns if it is in the dual or sound
masculine plural forms. For example: **یَدا الرَّجُل** (The man's two
hands).

140. When is it permissible to add the *alif-lām* suffix to a prefixed
noun?  
 It is permissible to add the *alif-lām* suffix to a prefixed noun if it
is an adjective (active participles, passive participles, adjectives
that are similar to verbs, comparatives, and superlatives) in the dual
or sound masculine plural form. For example: **الفاتحا دمشقَ خالدٌ و أبو
عُبیدةَ** (The two conquerors of Damascus are Khālid and Abū ‛Ubaydah.)
Or, if the prefixed noun is an adjective and the compliment to the
prefixed noun is made definite by the *alif-lām* suffix, for example:  
**المتَّبع الحقِّ منصورٌ** (He who follows the truth will be helped.)
