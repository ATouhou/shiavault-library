Some Important Topics: Abdullah Ibn Saba And Shiaism
====================================================

Ahlul Sunnat say that the founder of Shia religion, is Abdullah Ibn
Saba. Thus, Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlavi in his book, Tohfa Ithna Ashar has
also written the same in following Nasrullah Kabuli. In Milal Wan Nihal
of Shahristani, the following is seen: “The Sabiya is the sect of
Abdullah Ibn Saba, which believed in the divinity of Ali (a.s.). Ali
(a.s.) had sent Abdullah Ibn Saba to Madayan and it is thought that
Abdullah Ibn Saba was a Jew who had accepted Islam.

The belief of the Sabiya sect was that Ali (a.s.) is alive. He has not
been killed. And there is a divine part within him. The sounds present
in the cloud and lighting belongs to Ali (a.s.) and lighting is his
rubbish and a short time before Judgment Day, he will come back to the
earth.”

This statement shows that Abdullah Ibn Saba was the founder of
Nusairi[^1] sect. Shia Ithna Asharis do not believe in the divinity of
Ali (a.s.), neither call him God nor they deny his martyrdom. It is
astonishing that Shah Abdul Aziz should write such baseless things! One
has pity on the respected Shah. This writer left the Sunni religion
after reading such books. How can Shia Ithna Asharis be compared to the
followers of Abdullah Ibn Saba? What relation does Abdullah Ibn Saba has
with the founding of Shia religion.
