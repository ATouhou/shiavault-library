H - Hafhaf Ibn Muhanned Alrasibi
================================

A very brave man who was with Imam Ali in his three battles. He was
originally from Al Basra in Iraq. In the battle of Siffeen, Imam Ali
made him the ruler over the tribe of Azd. After Imam Ali passed away, he
stayed with Imam Hasan and then Imam Husayn. When he heard about Imam
Husayn's departure to Karbala, he walked from Al Basra to Karbala, but
the battle was over when he finally reached there, so he took his knife
and attacked â€˜Umar Ibn Sa'ad's people until he was killed.
