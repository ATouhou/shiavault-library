Q80: If Meat Becons Najis?
==========================

It is very difficult for us to know whether the meat or poultry we buy
these days from butchery and other shops is 'Halal' or 'Haram' because
(a) we don't know if the cattle or poultry is slaughtered according to
the Islamic Principle, (b) we know that the scales are used for weighing
pork also.

We know for certain that cattle and poultry is kept in cold storage
together with the meat of other haram animals. Now in such situation,
how can we continue to eat meat and poultry and at the same time ensure
that it is halal. How about imported meat?

How can we be sure that these imported meat (fresh and tinned) are also
halal? Please, we need a clear guidance on this: especially for our
people who are now in Canada, where it is very difficult to know these
things, in this connection, please enlighten us on the tinned fruits,
breads, cakes, vegetables and other Chinese cooked food, fresh and
tinned. How far can we use these?

A. I have been informed that in Tanzania, they follow the Islamic rules
of slaughter. If, after proper slaughter, the meat becomes Najis by
coming into contact with Najis meat or scales, it may be made 'Tahir'
(clean) by water in normal way. If meat is imported from a Muslim
country, you may use without any doubt.

The meat imported from non-Muslim countries is Najis and Haram (unless
you know that this particular meat which you are buying was "slaughtered
according to Islamic rules.)

The only way for a Shia Ithnasheris in Canada etc. is to purchase goat,
for example, in shares, and slaughter it properly.

The imported food, in which meat or animal fat is not used, may be used
(unless you know that this particular food which you are buying is
Najis.)

**Q81: BAKE-N-TAKE SHOPS**

We have so many bake-n-take shops here in U.K., and i have noticed so
many of our brothers buying such items from there and they eat it. The
shop is owned by Christians, and you know that fish, chicken and other
meat which they use there is not halal. Can we buy potatoes, bean-crisps
from that shop and eat it which is also cooked there?

A. The meat of an animal killed by a non-Muslim is Najis. If that meat
is cooked in pot, that pot also becomes Najis because of the Najasat of
the meat. If the potatoes and beans are cooked in that very pot, then
they will be Najis. But, if they are cooked in another pot, then you may
use them according to the Fatwa of Agha-e-Hakeem (r.a.).

**Q82: WHICH FISH ARE HALAL?**

What sort of fish is allowed to be eaten according to our Sheriat?

A. Only the fish having scales is Halal in Shia Sheriat

**Q83: FISH BOUGHT FROM A NON-MUSLIM**

Can we eat fish bought from a Christian?

A. The only condition for a fish (which has scales) to be edible is
that it should die out of water. If it dies in water, it becomes
Haram.

Now, if you, or any other Muslim has seen it dying out of water it is
Halal for you. But if you find it dead, in possession of a non-Muslim
then it is Haram, even if he says that it had died out of water.

**Q84: TINNED MEAT:**

Whether tinned meat of 'Halal' animals and chicken (but not slaughtered
in accordance with our sheriat not halal) is permissible to eat? Does
the rule change if you are not aware whether it was slaughtered in our
way or not?

A. Tinned meat of halal animals and chicken which were not slaughtered
in accordance with our sheriat, is not halal and not permissible to eat.
You must be sure that it was slaughtered in Islamic way.

**Q85: FAT OF SHEEP AND OXEN**

Please explain to me this verse:-

"And unto those who were Jews forbade we every animal having undivided
hoof, and of oxen and sheep forbide We unto them fat of both save what
is upon their backs or the entrails or what is mixed with bones; this We
recompensed them for their rebellion, and verily We are truthful".
(Al-Anaam 1:47).

Does this mean that the above is not to be owed any more, i.e. It was
only for the Jews at the time?

A. Prophet Yakub (a.s.) had abstained from eating camel meat; and this
continued in his clan. When Torah was given to Prophet Musa (as,), it
confirmed this system for Bani Israel: They were allowed to eat
"Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud
among the beasts"

By this definition; camel, ostrich etc. were forbidden to them as the
do not have divided hoof. But in Islam, this restriction was lifted.
This ayat refers to it is you have rightly understood.

**Q86: WHICH BIRDS ARE HALAL?**

What about a feathery hen or bird?

A. The birds having following characteristics are Haram:

a) Birds of prey, like hawk;
b) Birds which keep their wings straight longer than they beat them
like Kits;
c) Birds which do have neither maw nor craw;
d) Birds whose egg is equal in circumference on both side (i.e- no like
hen's egg).

The birds other than mentioned above are halal.

**Q87: WORKING FOR A BREWERY**

Is it not allowed in our religion of Islam to work as a clerk or driver
in EA. Breweries. If no, give reasons from the Qur'an so as to convince
me?

A. Yes, it is strictly forbidden in Islam to work in a brewery in any
capacity. The reason is that all firms, companies and shops depend for
their success on their employees. If they do not get employees, their
business will collapse. So everyone working with a firm which does a
'Haram' business, helps, strengthens and sustains that business.

It is to save Muslims from helping 'Haram' business to flourish that
the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) strictly forbade working in any capacity in
such concerns; and he more specifically mentioned the business of
liquor. He said:

"Allah has done 'Laanat' on liquor, and the man who sows the seed of
grape or grain for this purpose, and the man who makes liquor, and the
man who drinks it, and the man who serves it, and the man who sells it,
and the man who buys it, and the man who transports it, and the man to
whom it is transported".

To give you an example from recent history, Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian
leader, launched a "non-co-operation movement" in 1920's in India. He
called on the Indians not to co- operate or participate in anything
connected with British Government, The students left the Government
Schools, the teachers and civil servants resigned; the lawyers left the
courts, and the traders boycotted the English goods. This movement
continued for a long time.

Of course, it did not at once topple the British rule in India. But in
the long run it helped in getting the British out of India, firstly, by
cultivating a feeling of 'national cause' in Indians, and secondly by
showing the world how much the Indian public was against the British
Rule.

We, the Muslims, are likewise in constant struggle against evil and
Haram things; and, therefore, we are not allowed to help the evil in any
way.

Q88: Making labels for breweries I intend to start a cottage industry
producing labels for the Tanzania Market. In the process of running this
industry, there is likelihood of order coming from Tanzania Breweries
Ltd.

for making their labels. As you already know Tanzania Breweries
dealings are mainly liquor the orders will be for making labels for
their liquor cartons, liquor bottles, etc. ? Can you please advise me
whether such business would be in order without contradicting our
Sheriat?

The question of not accepting orders from them is out of question
because once it is a registered industry and the only such industry in
Tanzania, orders will have to be accepted or there will arise chaos,

A. It is my advice that you should not start this industry if you
cannot refuse such orders.

**Q89: MAKING TRAYS FOR BARMAN**

If a barman wants a tray for use in sales of liquor, how can you refuse
to sell when the article is displayed and price labelled?

A. It is 'haram' to sell anything to a person who, you know, wants to
purchase it for Haram purpose. You may tell the barman frankly that you
are not allowed by your religion to sell anything for the purpose of
liquor.
