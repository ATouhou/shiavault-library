Translatorâ€™s Foreword
=====================

In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. Praise be to Allah,
the Lord of the worlds and benedictions be upon Prophet Muhammad and his
Purified Progeny.

The Important role that translation plays in propagation of religion is
known to all. Since most Islamic texts are in Arabic or Persian, it is
only through translating them into English can we make them popular
among the literate Muslim youth of today. It was with this aim in mind
that we established this bureau and praise be to Allah, we have
completed twenty years serving the Shia Muslim world.

The present book was written by Dr. Muhammad Tijani as-Samawi, the famed
author of *Then I was Guided*. Those who have read other books of this
author will know that he has a special style of writing, which is well
arranged and lucid at the same time.

The subject of this book, as usual is a point of controversy between the
two largest sects of Islam. It concerns an incident at the end of the
life of the Prophet, when he asked for writing materials to dictate a
will, but the people present around him said that he was talking
nonsense. According to Shia people, it was a very serious matter,
whereas the majority of Muslims try to justify such things, as per their
habit.

In this book, you will know who that person was, who had the audacity to
cast such aspersion on the Messenger of Allah (S). It is really a matter
of great astonishment that millions among the Muslim nation consider him
to be a leader of Islam, eligible to be followed by others!

I leave it for the readers to find out for themselves who this person is
and decide if they consider him worthy of any leadership.

I thank Agha Ansariyan of Ansariyan Publications, Qom, for undertaking
to publish and print this important book. As we all know, today,
Ansariyan Publication is the largest publisher of Shia Islamic books in
English and other foreign languages and all credit goes to the director
Agha Muhammad Taqi Ansariyan for undertaking this noble task.

May the Almighty Allah give him more divine opportunity and good sense
(*Taufeeq*) and very long life to serve the faith as much as possible.

I thank the Almighty and His Proofs, especially the Last Proof and the
Twelfth Imam on the eve of whose birthday the translation of this book
was completed.

*Wassalaam*
