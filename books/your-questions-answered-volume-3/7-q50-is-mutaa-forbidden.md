Q50: Is Mutaa Forbidden?
========================

What should a young person do if he finds it difficult to control his
sexual desire while he refrains from sexual immorality and masturbation?
He can't afford to marry, but though he can afford to marry temporary
(Mutaa) for at least 3 days, he cannot perform this Mutaa as it is not
recognised by the Marriage Law of Tanzania.

A. Non-recognition of 'Mut'aa' does not mean that it is a crime. It
just means that if there is any dispute the courts will not recognize
the parties as husband and wife.

**Q51: MUT'AA, ADULTERY AND MAINTENANCE OF WIFE**

(a) Mutaa amounts to nothing but adultery?

(b) If a woman married in Mut'a is in a better finaneied position than
her husband and refuses to accept maintenance from him, is it allowed in
Islam?

(c) In the above case, if the woman is married in permanent marriage,
can she forego her maintenance?

A.

(a) Is not the "marriage" (in all its forms) just a legalized adultery?
All conditions which are necessary for a Permanent Marriage are
necessary in 'Mut'aa" (Temporary) Marriage. Even the word "Permanent
marriage" is misleading, because in Islam no marriage is a"
permanent".

The husband can terminate the marriage by the simple device of Talaq.
So where is the "permanency"?

A Sheriat which recognizes Talaq, cannot ridicule Mut'aa, because
"Marriage + Divorces = Mut'aa.

(b) There is no maintenance in Mut'a marriage; so this question does
not arise.

(c) The wife of permanent marriage is entitled to maintenance. It is
her right. But every right may be waived by the right-holder, and the
wife may, accordingly forego this right if she so desires.

**Q52: HOW TO RELEASE SEXUAL TENSION?**

I am a healthy 27 years old man with normal sexual desires. Due to some
extremely serious unavoidable circumstances, it is virtually impossible
for me to marry at present. In East African environment at present it is
impossible to do "Mut'aa' with a woman.

Now in order to relieve my sexual tension, without involvement with a
prostitute or committing adultery (Zina); is there anything wrong if I
do masturbation? I know Islam forbids masturbation but then in the
circumstances mentioned above, is it not the best solution? If not,
why?

A. You better try to find some woman (even Sunni or Christian will do)
for Mut'a.

**Q53: WHY MASTURBATION IS NOT ALLOWED?**

Why shouldn't sex education be introduced in schools? I was faced once
with a tough question. A person asked me if masturbation was not a good
way to release tension which otherwise would result in a sexual
intercourse with the opposite sex. He showed me an article which
appeared in an American newspaper.

The article says at least twice a week one should masturbate if he
wants to lead a comfortable life without heart attack. The article was
by a Professor in one of the American Universities.

A. Masturbation is Haram in Islam. It is not possible to write on this
subject in a short letter. In a medical encyclopaedia, it is written
that masturbation becomes harmful "only when it exceeds the limit, and
then medical treatment becomes necessary".

Two of the harmful effects of exceeding the limit (which have not been
mentioned in that book) are as follows:-

First, the base of penis becomes thinner compared to the rest of the
organ; the penis becomes curved to the right or left, (if left hand is
used, then to the left, and vice-versa). Secondly, the will-power
gradually weakens, and even if the person concerned wants to leave that
habit, he cannot. It is habit-forming; and in view of this, the pious
admonitions of the psychologists "not to exceed the limit" looses all
its weight.

Many people say that masturbation is "a natural" thing. Why? Because,
some young bulls or other animals have been observed to indulge in it.

If we accept this "logic" as valid, we will have to sanction many other
things also. For example, marriage between brother and sister, between
mother and son. And why marriage at all? Sexual intercourse without any
"religious sanction" has been practised in the animal world since time
immemorial. Therefore, it is "natural" And therefore, it should be
allowed and advocated! What kind of logic is this?

Others go so far as to declare that there is no difference between
masturbation and normal sexual intercourse.

They apparently forget that in the normal sexual intercourse all the
senses contribute to the stimulation and orgasm: Man and Woman see their
partner, touch each other, say endearing words to each other and hear
the stimulating words and sounds; and likewise the senses of smell and
taste are utilized.And penetration of male organ inside the female
ultimately leads to the final excitement and orgasm.

But in masturbation the only source of stimulation is imagination, in
which no other sense takes any part. The whole burden is loaded upon
mind; and, as a result, while the normal sexual intercourse results in
happiness and joy, masturbation creates depression. (I am not talking
about physical fatigue which is a normal thing. The talk is about
emotional and psychological effects).

I hope this short discourse will satisfy your friend that masturbation
is not "a normal and harmless thing".

So far as "sex education" is concerned, Islam expects the elders to
teach the youngsters everything concerning Janabat, monthly course,
child birth etc., and about the Nikah and all that it involves. In the
Indian society, this subject is "taboo"; while in Arabia and other
Isiamic places, women openly ask about the so-called "secret" Masael.

**Q54: HOW TO GET RID OF THE HABIT OF MASTURBATION**

From the age of 13 to the age of 14 I have masturbated almost daily.
Now I am trying to control, but I fail every time. About e months ago, I
had succeeded in stopping to masturbate for two weeks. But nowadays I
seem to fail and have started again.

The result of this is that I have become very thin and weak. And the
worst result is that my beliefs in religion are fading away.

I would be very pleased, if you would find me an alternative to leave
masturbation. I think I can leave masturbation if I visited a prostitute
once in two weeks, though I have not yet visited a prostitute. But I
don't know whether visiting a prostitute once in two weeks is better and
has less sin than masturbating almost daily.

A. The best way to get rid of your habit (which you have mentioned) is
to strengthen your will-power. Unless you firmly decide not to indulge
in this anymore, you will not be able to leave this habit.

Another thing which will help you is not to remain alone at any time.
If you are in company of others you will not get a chance to do it.

The third thing is to concentrate more and more on religious things.

And the fourth is to adopt some hobby, like football, etc. which will
provide you an outlet for energies of your body. But, for God's sake,
never think of going to prostitutes. It will ruin you, not only in
life-hereafter, but in this world also.

Apart from financial ruin, you may get veneral diseases as syphilis and
gonorrhoea which will affect the health of your children for generations
to come; and "zina" (having sexual relations with a woman other than
wife) is more sinful than masturbation.

**Q55: DIVORCE DURING MONTHLY PERIOD**

Is giving divorce to a woman during the period of Haidh and Nifas
allowed if the woman has committed a great fault towards her husband? A.
She cannot be divorced during the period of Haidh (monthly period) or
Nifas (Bleeding after delivery of child).

**Q56: IS SINGING HARAM?**

Is it Haram to listen to songs? Why? I have come to understand that
this is because of music accompanying it. Is it, therefore, haram to
listen to songs without the accompaniment of music? Is singing (without
the aid of music) haram?

A. Music is defined in Shia Shariat as prolongation and vibration of
sound with variations in pitch to such an extent that people may say
that 'he/she is singing'. It is one of the great sins; and is Haram
whether it be vocal or instrumental. To recite (or listen) to the words
of a song, without any music, is permissible, provided it is not obscene
and/or immoral.

**Q57: HADITH ABOUT MUSIC**

I heard many Khojas claiming this verse as hadith. "Al Ghinaao ashaddo
minazzina' which mean. Songs, Music and so on are worse than Zinaa. Is
this right? If it is, explain, with details.

A. The correct hadith is(Music is the magic of fornication). The
so-called 'hadith' mentioned by you is not found in books of Ahadith.

**Q58: WHY DO YOU FORBID GOOD THINGS OF LIFE**

I am an American Shia Muslim. Prior to embracing Islam I was an avid
lover of music. After entering the fold of Islam, I retained -although
to a lesser degree - my love for that art. From some Muslims I have
heard that all forms of music is haram; others told me that only some
forms of it under certain circumstances and conditions are haram.

I have been struggling vainly for the past 4 years to learn of the
Islamic position regarding music. Aren't musical talents of musicians a
gift from Allah to an artist? And didn't Allah say "do not forbid the
beautiful things of this life'?" Will you, please, clarify this matter
and quote sources from the Qur'an, Sunnah of the Prophet and
Ahlul-Bait - permitting or forbidding music.

A. I am sending (by air mail) a book "Music And Its Affects" and the
April, 1974, issue of the Light, from which you will know the view of
the Shia Sheriat.

Now coming to the second part of your question: You know very well that
a greater part of art consists of statues and paintings. But in Islam
painting the likeness of a living thing and/or making its statue is
Haram. And there is no difference of opinion on this subject among the
various sects of Islam. Therefore, your "argument" by quoting the
talents of the artists, I am afraid, has no basis at all.

Allah has not said "do not forbid the beautiful things of this life."
Perhaps you wanted to quote Ayat 87 of Sura Al-Maidah. Its
translation:

"O ye who believe! Forbid not (to yourselves) the good things which
Allah has made lawful for you; and do not transgress the limits. Verily,
Allah loves not the transgressors". And the meaning of the word good
things) is explained in this very Ayat by the words "which Allah has
made lawful for you".

So the question of allowing "the beautiful things of this life" does
not arise at all. What has been allowed by Allah is good; what has been
forbidden by Him is bad. And we have been warned not to transgress the
limits imposed by the sheriat of Allah, because Allah does not love the
transgressors.

**Q59: GOING TO CINEMA**

It is known that it is 'haram' to see Films,Why?

A. The Films is general have following features, any one of which is
enough to make it a "Gunah-e-Kabira": (1) Vocal Music; (2) Instrumental
Music; (3) Obscene Songs; (4) Obscene Scenes; and (5) Dance. Also, as is
now accepted by many social workers, it teaches hooliganism and is a
major factor in the ever-increasing rate of juvenile delinquency.
