Avoiding Suspicion
==================

Allah the Most High said: ***“O you who believe, avoid suspicion, for
surely suspicion in some cases is a sin.”***

The Holy Prophet Muhammad (S) said: *“Do not search the deficiencies of
believers and do not follow their faults; because he who follows his
brother’s faults, his own faults will be sought by Allah; and he whose
faults are sought by Allah will be disgraced, even if he keeps
indoors.”*

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) the Commander of the Faithful said: *“Justify your
brother’s action in the best way unless you know otherwise; and do not
suspect your brother for what he says while you can interpret it as
good.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“Discard suspicion among yourselves; because Allah
has forbidden it.”*

Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (a.s.) said: *“When a believer accuses his brother,
faith in his heart is melted in the same way that salt is melted in
water.”*

Imam ‘Ali al-Rida (a.s.) said: *“The believers are like brothers who
have the same parents. He is cursed, he is cursed, he who accuses his
brother; he is cursed, he is cursed, he who deceives his brother; he is
cursed, he is cursed, he who does not intend good for his brother; he is
cursed, he is cursed, he who hides himself from his brother; he is
cursed, he is cursed, he who backbites his brother.”*
