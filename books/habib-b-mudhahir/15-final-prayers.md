Final Prayers
=============

The fights went on till noon. A companion of Imam Husayn's looked at the
sun. He knew that it was time to pray.

Imam Husayn [a] asked Yazeed's Army to stop fighting to say their
prayers.

Al-Husayn bin Numair said to Imam Husayn [a]

*Husayn, Allah won't accept your prayers!*

Habib bin Mudhahir said stormily:

*Donkey! Will Allah accept your prayers, but won't accept the prayers of
the Prophet's grandson?*
