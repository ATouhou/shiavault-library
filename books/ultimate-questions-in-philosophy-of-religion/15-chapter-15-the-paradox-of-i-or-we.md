Chapter 15: The Paradox of “I or WE”
====================================

Unity of God is the cornerstone of Islam. Yet, we come across many Ayat
in the Holy Quran, which refers to Godhead with a plural pronoun.
Consider the following Ayat:

1) Creation
-----------

“We *have created”*: 22 times

***“And indeed, We created man from dried clay of altered mud”*** **[15:
26]**

***“And We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between
them except with truth”.*** **[15:85]**

***“Or did We create the angels female while they were witnesses?!”***
**[37:150]**

*“**Is it ye who create it, or are We the Creators?**!”* **[56:59]**

(Yusuf Ali translation)

2) Who answers the call?
------------------------

***“We answered his invocation”.*** **[21:76-90]** (4 Times)

3) Who sends the revelation?
----------------------------

“We send”: 31 times ( **و** **نزلناه** **انزلنا،** **انزلناه،**
**نزلنا** )

***Verily,*** ***We*** ***have sent it (the Holy Quran) down in the
night of Al-Qadr*****”. [97:1]**

4) Who save(s)?
---------------

“We save”: more than 30 times **و** **انجينا** **-** **و** **نجينا**
**))**

***“And We saved those who believed and used to fear Allah*****” [41:
18]**

5) Who chooses?
---------------

***“Truly, We chose him in this world”*** **[2:130]**

6) Whom shall we worship?
-------------------------

“Our worshippers” 12 times

***“…and of Us (Alone) they were the worshippers”.*** **[21:73]**
