Principle Six: Delegation of the authority of Imams to the jurists
==================================================================

During the time of the occultation of the Imam Mahdi (A), in which they
have no direct access to the Imam, the Shi'a fuqaha (jurists) inherit
the authority which was originally given by God to the Prophet and then
to the Imams. In what follows, I will first describe the concept of
faqih and then refer to the extent of the authority that a Shi'a faqih
has. Of course, a proper review of the topic needs a thorough discussion
about the institution of marji'iyya and that of*wilayat al-faqih*
(mandate of the jurist), including their requirements and
responsibilities.
