Wahb Ibn Munabbih:
==================

  
  
  

It is stated by the historians that he was of a Persian origin, and that
his grandfather came to Yemen among those dispatched by Chosro for
aiding Yemen against Abyssinia, where they settled down and multiplied
by generation. Then they were known with the term ‘the sons’, i.e. sons
of the Persians, among whom we can refer to Tawus ibn Kaysan, the
well-known Follower.

The religion adopted by the forefathers of Wahb was that of the

Persians (Magianism or Zoroastrianism). When they resided at Yemen among
the Jews, they learnt from them the Jews’ customs and traditions with a
bit of the Christianity. He was able to speak in the Greek language,
with abundant knowledge taken from Ahl al-Kitab, but was inflicted with
insolvency. <span id="_anchor_254"></span>254

He lived contemporaneously with several Companions, and reported hadith
from them. Also from him many Companions used to report, among whom
being Abu Hurayrah, Abd Allah ibn Umar and Ibn Abbas, and others, who
were trustworthy among the Arabs.

Al-Imam Ahmad says that his father Munabbih was a Persian man dispatched
by Chosro toward Yemen, where he embraced Islam, and the son (Wahb) used
to frequent after him to his homeland after its being conquerred.
Following is one of his sayings: “I have read 72 of God’s scriptures!

In Tadhkirat al-huffaz al-Dhahabi said about him: He was the learned of
the people of Yemen. He was born in 34 H. And died in San’a in 110 H. Or
after that with one year or more. It is said that he died in 116 H.
