Preamble
========

Recording the conduct (sirah), morals and standpoints of the Awliya’
(Allah’s friends), is verily considered one of the educationally
effective means, as the biography of prophets, Imams and the upright is
replete with thousands of lessons and examples that lay down for us the
course of noble ethics.

The prophets have truly incarnated the heavens teachings through their
stances and conduct, laying down thus the way of the pure life
expressing humanity aspirations. They are vivid examples for all virtues
and lofty attributes and morals.

The Holy Qur’an has glorified the role of the prophets, calling all
mankind to follow their guide, and take lessons from their stances and
acts.

As Baqir al-’Ulum Research Foundation undertakes to publish this series
of “A Meeting with the Righteous”, it aims for shedding light upon the
life of the ‘ulama’, with introducing their biography and conduct to be
glowing torches illuminating the way for generations.
