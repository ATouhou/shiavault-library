Vowels, Nunation and the Absence of Vowels
==========================================

4. How many vowels are there?

5. Where are the vowels written?

6. What is the absence of vowels?

7. What is nunation?

4. There are three vowels: the *dummah* ُ, the *fathah* َ and the
*kasrah* ِ.

5. The *dummah* and the *fathah* are written on top of the letter and
the *kasrah* is written under it.

6. The absence of vowels is when there is no vowel. The sign of it is a
small circle written above the letter.

7. Nunation (*tanwīn*) is a *nūn* that does not have a vowel sign, added
to the end of a noun verbally; not written. There are three forms of
nunation:

• The nominative nunation: **کِتابٌ** (a book)

• The accusative nunation: **کِتاباً** (a book)

• The genitive nunation: **کِتابٍ** (a book)
