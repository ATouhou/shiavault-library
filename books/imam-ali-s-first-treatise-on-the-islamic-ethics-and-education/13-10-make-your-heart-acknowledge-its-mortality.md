10) Make your heart acknowledge its mortality
=============================================

Although a man may get involved in the remembrance of death, he may not
be serious; neither may he be convinced. In this case, this remembrance
will not be instructive. This is true in the case of those corrupted
people who verbally remember death, but deep inside they are not ready
to embrace death.

For this reason, after his previous command concerning making the heart
submissive, Imam ‘Ali emphasized that we should convince our hearts that
this world is not eternal. This very conviction makes man ready for the
voyage towards the Hereafter.

Imam, concerning this, has said, "Anybody who believes that one day
death will separate him from his friends, that he will be put in the
grave, that he will have to account the Day of Judgment for what he has
done, that the wealth here will not help him out; and that what he has
sent in advance will be of value, should shorten his desires and
lengthen the amount of his work."

This very stage of confession and conviction has made some wonder: How
is it possible for a man to believe in death and the exact accounting
for in the Doomsday and be happy at the same time?

كيفَ يَفْرَح"

“I wonder at one who is certain of death – how does he laugh? I wonder
at one who is certain of the reckoning – how is he joyful?”
