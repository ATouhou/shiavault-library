Ramadan: The Blessed Month
--------------------------

The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) has said: Surely,
the month of Ramadan, the blessed month, has come to you. The month,
whose fasts Allah has made obligatory upon you. In it, the doors of
Paradise are opened up and the Satan's fettered, and in it is the Night
of Qadr, which is more virtuous than a thousand months.*Tahdheeb
al-Ahkam, vol. 4, pg. 152*
