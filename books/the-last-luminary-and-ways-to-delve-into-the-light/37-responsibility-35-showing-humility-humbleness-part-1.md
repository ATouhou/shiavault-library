Responsibility 35: Showing Humility & Humbleness Part 1
=======================================================

Another responsibility of the followers of the Imam is that we must have
humility and humbleness and show concern in our hearts (for the Imam)
when we mention him.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ اللٌّهُ تَعَالـى:  أَلَـْم يَأْنِ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنْ
تَخْشَعَ قُلُوبُهُمْ لِذِكْرِ اللٌّهِ وَ مَا نَزَلَ مِنَ الْحَقِّ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

Allah, the Most High has said (in the Noble Qur\`an):

***“Has not the time come that those who have true faith begin to show
humility in their hearts when Allah and that which He has revealed of
the Truth is mentioned?”***[^1]

Imam Muhammad b. ‘Ali al-Baqir (as) has said that: “Remembering us (the
Ahlul Bayt) and mentioning us is the same as remembering or mentioning
Allah.”[^2]

Therefore, the hearts of the true believers must have humbleness which
can only come about through remembering the name of the Imam, just as
Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad as-Sadiq(as) stated in his supplication for
Friday:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّـي أَتَقَرَّبُ إِلَيْكَ بِقَلْبٍ خَاضِعٍ وَ إِلـىٰ
وَلِيِّكَ بِبَدَنٍ خَاشِعٍ وَ إِلـىٰ الأَئِمَّةِ الرَّاشِدِينَ
بِفُؤَادٍ مُتَوَاضِعٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“O’ Allah! Indeed I seek nearness to you with a submissive heart, and (I
seek nearness) to your representative with a body that is humble and (I
seek nearness) to the rightly guided A\`immah by a heart filled with
humility.”[^3]
