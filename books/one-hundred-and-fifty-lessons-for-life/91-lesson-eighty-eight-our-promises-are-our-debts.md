Lesson Eighty Eight: Our Promises Are Our Debts
===============================================

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنّا أَهْلُ بَيْت نَرَى وَعْدَنا عَلَيْنا دَيْناً كَما صَنَعَ رَسُولُ
اللّهِ(ص)
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

We are the household who consider our promises as our debts; as did the
Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny).[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Debt is not only what man receives from someone as a loan . Those who
make promises to others in fact undertake an obligation and accept a
responsibility and have an undeniable moral duty to make good on the
promise.

fulfilling the promise indicates dignity, belief, greatness, honesty and
truthfulness and strengthens mutual trust and confidence among people.
It revives the spirit of social cooperation. For all these reasons ,
Islam strongly emphasizes the need to fulfill all promises.
