47: Muhammad (muhammad)
=======================

This chapter was revealed after Iron 57 and before Thunder 13, and
following the victory at Badr. It consists of four sections in 38 verses
from Madina except for V.18 (II) which was revealed during the Transfer
or Hijra in the year 622 A. D., and possibly V. 3 which came six years
later during the truce at Hudaybiyya in the year 6 / 623. Its rhythm is
sustained or punctuated by means of assonance.

The chapters in the Qur'an now are becoming noticeably shorter. The name
of the Prophet as a title is found in V.2 (I), while \` fighting" is
mentioned in V.

20 (III); these form the alternate titles to the chapter. The topic
discussed is the problem of conduct during warfare (I).
