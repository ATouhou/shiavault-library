Lesson Eighty: Do Not Listen To All Utterances!
===============================================

Imam al-Jawad (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ أَصْغَى إلى ناطِق فَقَدْ عَبَدَهُ فَاِنْ كَانَ النّاطِقُ عَنِ
اللّهِ فَقَدْ عَبَدَ اللّهَ وَ إنْ كانَ النّاطِقُ يَنْطِقُ عَنْ لِسانِ
إِبْلِيسَ فَقَدْ عَبَدَ إبْلِيْسَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

One who listens to an orator has worshipped him. Thus if the orator
delivers God’s message, he (the listener) has worshipped God, and if he
talks from the tongue of Iblis, he has worshipped Iblis.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Utterance, whatsoever and from whoever it may be, has an effect, and
listening to the utterances is usually accompanied with an impression in
man’s heart. Orators will say what suits their purpose. Some will be on
the side of truth and others will try to inculcate falsehoods.
Submission to each of these two groups is a kind of worship because the
essence of worship is nothing else than submission.

Therefore, one should listen to truthful utterances and become truth
worshippers and avoid purveyors of falsehoods and prevent their dark
utterances from entering one’s ears and reaching the depths of the soul.
