The Battle of Karbala
=====================

Imam Husayn left al-Madina al-Munawwara. He went to Makkah to perform
the Haj. Yazeed bin Mu'awiyah knew about al-Husayn's travel. He sent
some spies to kill him.

So, Imam Husayn decided to leave Makkah. He said:

I don't want them to violate the Holiness of the Ka'aba.

Imam Husayn headed for Kufa. On the way, he heard that Ubaidullah bin
Ziyad's guards killed Muslim bin Aqeel, Hani, Qais bin Mudhir al-Saidawy
and others.

A thousand horsemen surprised Imam Husayn's caravan. They prevented it
from advancing towards Karbala. Then the military battalions came
successively. Their number was four thousand fighters. Seventy persons
came with Imam Husayn. They were his family and his supporters.

When Ubaidullah bin Ziyad's army asked Imam Husayn to surrender and to
pay homage to Yazeed bin Mu'awiyah, he said his famous words:

Abasement is far away from us!

Imam Husayn was ready to die a martyr for Islam.

On the morning of Muharram 10th, the Battle of Karbala took place.
Thousands of fighters launched a savage attack against Imam Husayn and
his companions. They faced the attack bravely. Strong fights took place.
They astonished the enemies. Only seventy fighters were fighting from
the early hours of the morning till afternoon.

All of Imam Husayn's companions passed away. Imam Husayn was alone.
Still he attacked Ubaidullah bin Ziyad's Army. He was fighting bravely.

Ubaidullah bin Ziyad's Army killed Imam Husayn. It beheaded the martyrs,
tied their heads to the spears and burnt the tents. Then it took the
women and children prisoners.
