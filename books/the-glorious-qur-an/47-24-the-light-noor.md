24: the Light (noor)
====================

This chapter forms one of the great treasures of the Qur'an. chiefly
because of the lyrical hymn to Light found in section v. It contains 64
Meccan and Madinese verses arranged in nine sections. The chapter dates
from before pilgrimage 22, while v.64 was revealed after Banishment 29.
NOTE the elevated style and the

frequent use of the adverb abadan or 'never' throughout this chapter.

The beginning contains advice or light" on sex, etiquette and personalÂ 
modesty, and states that marriage is desirable (IV); it also warns
against committing slander and per3ury. The middle portion consists of
the great hymn to "Light" which gives the chapter its title, and from
which much illumination and mysticism arise in Islam. Proof of God
follows (VI). The end concerns etiquette and protocol in connection with
public business, as Islamic society began to need rules to live by and
for its own government. Old maids and eating in public are other topics
which are discussed in VIII.
