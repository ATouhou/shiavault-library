Dedication
==========

To the inspiring mind that has encouraged scientific and intellectual
life on the earth,

To the creative intellect that has initiated revival and creation for
Muslims,

To the great Imam, Ja’far as-Sadiq, peace be upon him,

I offer, with humbleness and reverence, this work, in which I have
received the honor of researching the biography of his grandson Imam
Muhammad al-Jawad, the miracle of intellect and knowledge in Islam,
hoping it will be accepted…
