Story no. 63:Attachment of Aqa Abul Fazl
========================================

Aqa Abul Fazl showed much love towards his 12 year old son, Arif.  
 Arif’s mother asked her husband one day “Why do you love Arif so
much?”  
 He replied “The other children always say one or two lies everyday. But
I have never heard a lie from Arif, be it seriously or joking. This love
of mine is for the truthfulness.”  
 His wife said “Yes, you are right because neither did I hear a lie from
our son”.  
 Bravo to those children who speak the truth with everyone and their
parents.  
 Truthfulness is one of the good qualities of Islam.
