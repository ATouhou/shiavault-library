THE DEVOTED MOTHER
A mother duck and her little ducklings were on their way

to the lake one day. The ducklings were very happy

following their mother and quack-quacking along the way.

All of a sudden the mother duck saw a fox in the distance.

She was frightened and shouted, “Children, hurry to the

lake. There’s a fox!”

The ducklings hurried towards the lake. The mother duck

wondered what to do. She began to walk back and forth dragging one wing
on the ground.

When the fox saw her he became happy. He said to himself, “It seems that

she’s hurt and can’t fly! I can easily catch and eat her!” Then he ran

towards her.

The mother duck ran, leading the fox away from the lake. The fox
followed

her. Now he wouldn’t be able to harm her ducklings. The mother duck

looked towards her ducklings and saw that they had reached the lake. She
was relieved, so she

stopped and took a deep breath.

The fox thought she was tired and he came closer, but the mother duck
quickly spread her wings

and rose up in the air. She landed in the middle of the lake and her
ducklings swam to her.

The fox stared in disbelief at the mother duck and her ducklings. He
could not reach them because

they were in the middle of the lake.

Dear children, some birds drag one of their wings on the ground when an
enemy is

going to attack. In this way they fool their enemies into thinking they
are hurt. When

the enemy follows them this gives their children time to escape.
