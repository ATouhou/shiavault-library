All About Ahlul Bayt
====================

Describing the high standing of Ahlul Bayt Ali said in one of his
sermons:

Allah Almighty has placed His trust in Aali Muhammad (Ahlul Bayt). They
are the citadel where His Commandments receive protection, and from
which the Directives are defined and interpreted. Aali Muhammad are:

\* The fountainheads of knowledge created by Allah,
\* The shelters for Allah's teachings,
\* The haven for the Heavenly Books, and
\* The mighty bastion to defend Allah's religion.

Islam in its beginning was weak and helpless, but Aali Muhammad (pbuh)
came to its service, support, and defense. Islam was jittery of the
infidels around it, but Aali Muhammad (pbuh) made it strong and
powerful.

About 30 years later, Ali's grandson, Al-Sajjad invoked a Du'aa on
behalf of Ahlul Bayt:

"Oh Lord! Bless Thy Ahlul Bayt, whom Thou chose to execute Thine works,
and have made them the reservoir for Thy knowledge, the guardians for
Thy religion, deputies of Thine on earth, and the path toward Thy
Paradise."
