70. The Sick Verbs الافعال المعتلة
==================================

Any verb that has a long vowel as one of the three radicals in its root
is called a “sick verb.” These long vowels will go through a change when
the verb is used in the present tense. Consequently, there are three
types.

a.**Assimilated** , if the first radical of the verb is a long vowel
such as:

** ** **وَصَلَ / يَصِلُ** “to arrive.”

b.**Hollow** , when the second radical position is occupied by a long
vowel such as:

**سارَ / يَسيرُ** “to walk.”

c.**Defective** , when the third radical position is occupied by a long
vowel such as:

** دَعا / يَدعو** “to invite.”

71.  کـَلُّ ، بَعضُ are nouns and when used before another noun they
create an Idaafa (a). If, however, they are used after a noun, they will
be emphatic for that proceeding noun, and will carry its case and its
identical pronoun reference (b).

a**.** **  ** **      تـَعلـَّمنا کـُلَّ جُملِ الدَّرسِ.**

b**.** **تـَعلـَّمنا جُمَلَ الدَّرسِ کـُلـَّها/ کـُلـَّهُ.**
