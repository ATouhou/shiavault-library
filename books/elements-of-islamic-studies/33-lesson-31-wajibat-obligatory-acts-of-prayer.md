Lesson 31: Wajibat (obligatory acts) of prayer
==============================================

There are 11 things *wajib* in the prayers:  
 1. *Niyyah*: Intention to pray for being near to God.  
 2. *Takbirat-ul-Ihram* (Allahu Akbar after *niyyah*).  
 3. *Qiyam*: To stand.  
 4. *Ruku’*.  
 5. Two *Sajdahs*.  
 6. *Qira'at*: to recite Surah al-Hamd and another Surah in first two
*rak’ats* and *Tasbihat al-Arba’ah.*  
 (*Subhanallahi wal-hamdu lillahi wa la ilaha illal-lahu wallahu Akbar*)
or Surah al-Hamd in  
 the 3rd and 4th *rak’ats*.  
 7. *Dhikr*: to recite tasbih in *ruku’* and *sajdah*, as will be
explained later.  
 8. *Tashahhud*.  
 9. *Salaam*.  
 10. *Tartib*: To pray in the sequence prescribed by the *shari’ah*.  
 11. *Muwalaat*: To pray without interruption or gap.

Rukn and Ghayr Rukn
-------------------

Out of the above mentioned *wajib* acts of prayer, 5 are *rukn* and the
others are *ghayr rukn*.  
*Rukn* means such actions which invalidate the prayer if they are left
out or added, though unintentionally.  
 These are (1) *Niyyah*, (2) *Takbiratul-Ihram* (3) *Qiyam* at the time
of *Takbiratul-Ihram* and just before going to *Ruku*, (4) *Ruku* and
(5) Both *sajdahs* together. If any of these are left out, or added
whether intentionally or unintentionally, the Salat will become *batil*
(void).  
*Ghayr rukn* means such *wajib* acts which invalidate the prayer if they
are left out, or added, intentionally. But they do not invalidate the
prayer if they are left or added unintentionally. These are the
remaining *wajib* acts of prayer.
