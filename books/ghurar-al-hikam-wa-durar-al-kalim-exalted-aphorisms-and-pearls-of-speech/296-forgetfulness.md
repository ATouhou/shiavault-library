Forgetfulness
=============

**Forgetfulness-السلوّ والنسيان**

1. Forgetfulness is the reaper of longing [and desire].

> 1ـ اَلسُّلُوُّ حاصِدُ الشَّوْقِ.

2. One who forgets about what has been robbed from him, it is as if he
has not been robbed.

> 2ـ مَنْ سَلا عَنِ المَسْلُوبِ كَأنْ لَمْ يُسْلَبْ.
