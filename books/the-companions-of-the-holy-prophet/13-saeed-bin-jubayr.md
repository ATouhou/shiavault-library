Saeed Bin Jubayr
================

**The Beginning
**
The people in the palace slept. The guards and the soldiers stayed up.
They were walking through the porches. They were carrying torches,
swords and spears.

Two guards stood at the door of a big hall. Al-Hajjaj bin Yousif
al-Thaqafy, the Iraqi ruler, slept in the hall.

The guards said to his friends: I've heard that the prince has become
crazy

The other said: His behaviour shows his madness. He has not slept since
he killed Saeed bin Jubayr. He always wakes and shouts with alarm: "Why
have I killed him?"

I heard him saying to Dr. Tyyadok: "I am always dreaming that I see
Saeed bin Jubayr pulling my neck. I heard him saying: "Allah's enemy,
why have you killed me?"

The Prince has killed over one hundred thousand men and women. There
are fifty thousand men and thirty thousand women in his prisons.

In the meantime, they heard a yell of fear. They heard al-Hajjaj
saying: Why have I killed Saeed bin Jubayr?

The guard said to his friend: I think that Saeed bin Jubayr has
appeared again.

The other asked: Who was that good man?

Saeed bin Jubayr

His name was Saeed bin Jubair. His surname was Abu Abdullah. He came
from al0Habasha. He joined bani-Asad. He lived in Kufa. He was
God-fearing.

He was one of the companions of Imam Zaynul Abideen, Ali bin al-Husayn
[a].

Saeed loves Prayer

Saeed loved nothing but prayer. He lived a good life with his parents.
He obeyed and treated them kindly.

Saeed woke when the rooster crowed. He performed the ritual ablution.
He said his morning prayers. Then he read the Qur'an till the sun
shone.

One day the rooster did not crow. So, Saeed did not say his morning
prayers punctually. He woke after the sunrise. He was sad because he did
not say his prayers at the right time. Meanwhile, he was angry at the
rooster because it did not crow.

When Saeed looked at the rooster, he said angrily: Why didn't you crow?
May Allah not make you crow again!

The rooster had not crowed since then.

Saeed's mother saw the rooster. She said to her son: Saeed, Allah
accepts your prayer. So, don't invoke Him against anyone.

Saeed obeyed his mother. He did not invoke Allah against anyone but one
time. When did he do that? Let's read Saeed's story together!

Abid al-Malik bin Marwan

Abid al-Malik bin Marwan became a Caliph. He closed the Holy Qur'an and
said: I won't read you forever!

Abid al-Malik bin Marwan began practicing a strict policy to continue
his government. He appointed unjust people to rule.

For example, he appointed Khalid bin Abdullah al-Qasry over Kufa. Then
he appointed him over Makkah. And he appointed al-Hajjaj bin Yousif
al-Thaqafy over Hejaz. Then he appointed him over Kufa.

In the meantime, Abid al-Malik bin Marwan ordered his rulers to kill
people.

Al-Hajjaj

Al-Hajjaj got to Kufa. He was masked. He went up the pulpit. He kept
silent for a while. Then he removed the mask and addressed the Muslims:
Iraqis! Disobedient! Hypocrites!

He abused them and said: Abid al Malik bin Marwan has given me a whip
and a sword! The whip has dropped! The sword has remained!

Namely, Abid al-Malik ordered al-Hajjaj to kill and torture the Iraqis!
The whip was used for torturing. The sword was used for killing.

The time of terrorism started. He began killing and imprisoning. He
killed many companions. Kumail bin Ziyad was among them.

Along his rule al-Hajjaj killed one hundred and twenty thousand men and
thirty thousand women. There were children in his prisons, too.

The Mad Man

Al-Hajjaj persecuted people everywhere. The people in the deserts were
afraid of his name.

One day, al-Hajjaj went to a desert. He found a man there.

He said to the man: What do you think about al-Hajjaj?

The man said: He's unjust!

Al-Hajjaj said: What do you think about Caliph Abid al-Malik bin
Marwan?

The man said: He's more unjust than him!

Al-Hajjaj said: Do you know me?

The man said: No, I don't! Who are you?

Al-Hajjaj said: I'm al-Hajjaj.

The man shook with fear and said: Your Highness, the Prince, do you
know me?

Al-Hajjaj said: No! Who are you?

The man said with fear: One of the Bani Thour. I get crazy twice a
year! This is one of them!

Al-Hajjaj smiled and let the man go.

Th man pretended madness. So, al-Hajjaj let him go.

The Revolution

Al-Hajjaj busied the Muslims with fights on the borders. He tried to
occupy the nearby countries and robbed them of their possessions. In the
meantime, he wanted to kill the Muslims to get rid of them. For this
reason, he ordered the Muslims to fight continuously.

One day, al-Hajjaj sent a big army to fight Ratbil, the Turkish King.
Abid al-Rahman bin al-Ashath headed the army.

Abid al-Rahman defeated Ratbil. Then he sent a man to al-Hajjaj. The
man said to him: Abid al-Rahman wants to see the conquered lands. He has
ceased fighting to refresh the fighters.

Still al-Hajjaj sent Abid al-Rahman a letter. In the letter, he
condemned him. And he ordered him to go on fighting.

Abid al-Rahman understood al-Hajjaj's bad aims. So, he told his
fighters about him.

The Muslims hated al-Hajjaj because he was unjust. Besides they hated
Abid al-Malik bin Marwan because he appointed him ruler over them.

Abid al-Rahman revolted against al-Hajjaj. The fighters stood by him.

Abid al-Rahman came back to Iraq to topple the unjust ruler. The
Muslims supported him.

The Qur'an Readers Battalion

The Qur'an Readers were the most knowledgeable at the explanation of
the Qur'an and other Qur'anic sciences. Many of them joined Abid
al-Rahman. So, they formed a special battalion called the Qur'an readers
Battalion. Kumail bin Ziyad headed the battalion.

The revolutionaries freed vast lands from al-Hajjaj's and Abid
al-Malik's persecution. They freed Afghanistan, Kirman and Fars (in
Iran), Basrah and Kufa (in Iraq). Abid al-Rahman's Army took part in
several fights. It won victories at them.

The Battle of Deer al-Jamajum

Abid al-Malik was afraid of that great revolution. He tried to cheat
the Muslims. He said: If the revolutionaries hand over their weapons,
I'll dismiss al-Hajjaj.

Abid al-Malik appointed al-Hajjaj and other unjust rulers. He was the
cause for all those disasters. So, the Muslims refused his suggestion.
And they ordered him to resign. Abid al-Malik sent a big army to help
al-Hajjaj.

The two armies met at a place near Kufa called Deer al-Jamajum. A grim
foght happened between the two armies. Al-Hajjaj won the the fight. Abid
al-Rahman bin al-Ashath escaped to Turkey. Al-Hajjaj's army captured
many revolutionaries and executed them.

Kumayl bin Ziyad, the leader of the Qur'an Readers' Battalion,
disappeared for a time. He heard about about his people's sufferings.
So, he gave himself up to al-Hajjaj. Al-Hajjaj ordered a man to execute
him.

To Makkah

Saeed bin Jubayr escaped to Makkah to live there. He chose a valley
near Makkah so as no one would know him. Al-Hajjaj's spies looked for
him everywhere. Abid al-Malik was even more spiteful than al-Hajjaj with
Saeed. So, he sent his private messanger Khalid bin Abdullah al-Qasry to
Makkah.

Khalid bin Abdullah al-Qasry arrived in Makkah. The ruler of Makkah was
Muhammad bin Salama. Muhammad was addressing the people. Khalid
interrupted him and went up the pulpit. He took out a letter. Abid
al-Malik had sealed the letter.

Khalid read the Makkans Abid al-Malik's letter. The letter was as
follows:

From Abid al-Malik bin Marwan,

To the people of Makkah;

I have appointed Khalid bin Abdullah al-Qasry ruler over you. Hear and
obey him. We'll kill the person who aids Saeed bin Jubayr!

After reading Abid al-Malik's letter, Khalid said stormily: If I see
Saeed in a house, I'll demolish the house. And I'll demolish the nearby
houses!

In the Valley

Saeed knew that Khalid would kill anyone who would help him. So, he did
not ask anyone for help. Therefore, he took his small family and lived
in a valley near Makkah.

One day, a spy knew Saeed's place. The spy hurried to Khalid to tell
him about Saeed. The Ruler of Makkah ordered his guards to capture
Saeed.

Some horsemen with swords set out for the valley. They saw a little
tent among the rocks.

Saeed bin Jubayr was saying his prayers. The horsemen dismounted. They
approached his tent. Saeed's son knew that the horsemen came to arrest
his arrest. The son wept to see his father in that terrible state. The
father said:

Son, why are you weeping and I've lived for seventy five years. This is
a long age.

The father said good-bye to his son. He asked him to be patient. Saeed
advanced bravely towards the horsemen's leader. The leader admired
Saeed's personality. He was sad to see him praying in the desert. He was
sad to see him saying the final good-bye to his son.

The leader said: The Prince has ordered me to arrest you. Escape to any
country you like. I'll go with you.

Saeed asked the horsemen's leader: Have you a family?

The leader answered: Yes.

Saeed said: Aren't you worried about them?

The leader said: Allah will save them!

Saeed refused to escape so that the leader would not punish the
innocent people. So, he went with the soldiers.

The Ka'aba

The Prince of Makkah was sitting by the Holy Ka'aba waiting for the
horsemen's coming.

The horsemen brought Saeed bin Jubayr. Khalid bin Abdullah al-Qasry,
the Prince of Makkah, ordered the guards to tie Saeed's legs to his
neck.

A man from Shaam said: Your Highness, the Prince, release Saeed,
release him. Don't send him to al-Hajjaj. He'll kill him. Saeed is a
good man. May Allah be pleased with you.

The Prince said: If Abid al-Malik ordered me to demolish the Ka'aba
thoroughly, I would do to please him.

Abid al-Malik appointed unjust rulers over the Muslims. They did not
think about Allah's satisfaction. They thought about Abid al-Malik's.

Wasit

Al-Hajjaj built a new town between Kufa and Basrah. The town was Wasit.
He built a big palace in its center. Besides he built he big prison to
torture innocent people.

There were thousands of men, women and children in his prison.

Al-Hajjaj was sitting in his palace. There was a Christian doctor with
him. The doctor's name was Tyyadok. The headsman was standing. He was
waiting for Saeed.

Saeed came into the palace full of the smell of blood.

Al-Hajjaj said: What's your name?

Saeed answered: Saeed bin Jubayr. (Saeed = happy, Jubayr = unbroken)

No! You're Shaqy bin Kusair. (Shaqy = unhappy, Kusair = broken)

My mother knows my and my father's name.

May you and your mother be unhappy!

No one knows the unseen but Allah.

Al-Hajjaj kept silent. Then he clapped. Some bad men came and made
funny movements.

Al-Hajjaj and his guards laughed loudly. Saeed kept silent.

Al-Hajjaj asked him: Why don't you laugh?

Saeed said: There's nothing to laugh at.

Al-Hajjaj said: I laugh!

Thus Allah has created us to be different.

Al-Hajjaj ordered his guards to bring him a big jewel box. Al-Hajjaj
began piling the jewels before Saeed. Then he asked him: What do you
think about those jewels?

To teach him a lesson, Saeed said: They are good if you spend them for
Allah!

Why?

To be safe on the Judgement Day.

Again al-Hajjaj kept silent.

Al-Hajjaj beckoned the headman to kill him. The headsman advanced
towards the great companion.

Saeed turned towards the Ka'aba with a certain heart. He asked the
headsman permission to say two Raka'as. He turned towards the Ka'aba and
said: Surely, I have turned myself, being upright, wholly to Him who
originated the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the polytheists.

Al-Hajjaj shouted: Turn him away from Ka'aba!

The headsman changed his direction. Saeed said: And Allah's is the East
and the West, therefore, whither you turn, thither is Allah's purpose.

Al-Hajjaj shouted: Lay on your belly on the ground!

Saeed said: From it We have originated You. And in it We will bring you
back. And from it We will take you out again.

Al-Hajjaj said with spite: Behead him!

At that moment, Saeed looked at the sky and said: Allah, don't forgive
him for persecuting me! Punish him for my blood! And make me the last
person he kills of Muhammad's nation!

Immediately, the headsman beheaded him. The head fell to the ground and
said: There's no god but Allah!

Al-Hajjaj began looking at the continuous flowing of the blood. He was
astonished to see the plentiful blood. So, he asked Dr. Tyyadok about
the secret.

The doctor said: All those you killed were afraid. Their blood stopped
in their veins. So, there was no bleeding. But Saeed was not afraid. His
heart was beating normally.

Saeed's heart was full of faith. He was not afraid of death. So, he
passed away a martyr.

**Al-Hajjaj's End
**
After that time, al-Hajjaj got crazy. When he slept he saw nightmares.
He woke with alarm and said: Why have I killed Saeed bin Jubayr?

Fifteen days passed after that crime, al-Hajjaj died.

Allah accepted Saeed's prayers. So, he was the last person al-Hajjaj
killed during his life full of crimes and persecution.

When the Muslims opened the door of the prisons, they found fifty
thousand men, women and children. Saeed and al-Hajjaj died in the same
year. Their story became a lesson for generations. History praises Saeed
and dispraises al-Hajjaj!
