*“Know that He in Whose hand are the treasures of the heavens and the
earth has given you the permission for supplication and has guaranteed
the acceptance of your requests. He has commanded you to ask Him so that
He may grant you, and to seek His mercy so that He may have mercy on
you. He has not placed anyone between you and Himself who will veil you
from Him, and He has not entrusted you to one who will mediate for you
before Him. He has not prevented you from repentance, if you sin, and He
has not hastened with punishment to you, and He did not reproach you for
repenting. He did not disgrace you when you* *were worthy of disgrace.
He did not* *treat you with severity in the acceptance of (your)
repentance. He did not take you to task for your sins and did not make
you despair of (His) mercy. Rather, he has appointed your restraint from
sin to be a good deed, and counted each of your evil deeds as one and
each good deed as ten.*
*He has opened for you the door of repentance and the door of* *seeking
a return to His pleasure. Thus, when you call upon Him he hears your
call and when you whisper to Him, He knows your secret talk. You
acquaint Him with your needs and reveal your self to Him, complain to
Him of your sorrows, seek from Him the removal of your afflictions and
ask for His help in your affairs. You ask Him (to grant you) from the
treasuries of His Mercy an increase in lifespan, good health and the
abundance of sustenance that none other than He is able to grant.*

*Then He placed in your hands the keys to His treasures such that He
permitted you to petition Him for them. So whenever you wish, you seek
to open the doors of His blessings through supplication, and ask for the
downpour of His Mercy. Do not let the slowness of His response
dishearten you, for the grant is in accordance with the intention;
sometimes the response has only been delayed for you so that it may be a
greater reward for the petitioner and a more abundant grant for the
hopeful one. Sometimes you ask for a thing and you are not given it, but
you are given something better than it now or later; or it is turned
away from you for what is better for you, because sometimes in the
fulfillment of what you ask for is the destruction of your religion.
Therefore let your request be for that, the beauty of which remains for
you, and the evil consequences of which pass away from you. For wealth
does not remain for you, nor do you remain for it”.*

Commentary
----------

In this part of the letter, Imam ‘Ali (as) puts stress on two points:
Supplication and repentance, both of which are used for the spiritual
reconstruction of man.

Man, due to his over-engagement in current daily affairs, gets
self-centered and indulges in too much of self-reliance, with little
attention for Divine bases, and erroneously assumes that he is mighty
enough to carry on every action. He is not aware that in this world
there are a thousand agents involved in the arrangement of affairs. Man,
through his supplication and his obedience to God, could benefit a lot
in order to surmount complexities of life.

For this reason, in this letter, Imam (as) teaches his son to be aware
of the fact that in this world the worldly affairs are not effected
solely through material and physical agents. Rather, spiritual factors,
such as supplication and worship are also at work. The second point
emphasized in this letter is the fact that if man, through his sins,
temporarily distances himself from God, he can compensate for it through
his repentance to gain, once again, God’s favour.

The Role Of Supplication And The Conditions For Its Fulfillment
---------------------------------------------------------------

In order for man to come close to God, to gain spiritual peace of mind,
to attain ethical values, to stay away from sins, to cleanse mental
disturbances, to avoid Satan’s temptations, to strengthen his
intelligence and cognitive powers, and to satisfy his physical and
mental needs, he needs to worship God. For this very reason, the major
part of the Prophet’s educational programs in general and the Prophet of
Islam’s program in particular consists of teaching people to carry out
prayers.
But in today’s world more than ninety percent of people suffer from
some sort of nervous and mental disturbance. Every day we witness
millions of crimes in the world. A lot of people, due to distresses and
worries and because of their indecisions, resort to narcotics and drugs
and tranquilizers and alcohol and pornographic films. Most of them,
towards the middle part of life, give up their education, jobs and
families to engage in suicides or live a parasitic life. It seems as if
Alexis Carrel’s prediction had come true when he said, "This is the
price we pay for the industrial civilization and for the changes of life
we are receiving."[^1]

At such a time, we even need more prayers and supplication. Dale
Carnegie presents the following statistics for the American community:
"In the United States, in general, every thirty five minutes one person
commits suicide and every two minutes a person goes mad." He then adds:
"If people went after the peace which is contained in religious
supplications, most of these suicides and mental diseases could be
avoided"[^2]

Elsewhere Alexis Carrel is reported to have said, "The greatest power
man can produce is through supplication and worship. Such a power acts
like gravity whose existence is real and touchable. In our medical life
we have come across patients who were not treated through medicines but
were cured through supplication and worship. The secret behind this is
the fact that man uses his meager power and strength and extends it into
an immense power. When we are worshipping or are engaged in supplication
we are connecting ourselves with an eternal power that is in charge of
all creation. We beg that power to look for our needs. Such a pleading
removes our difficulties and magnifies our power"[^3]

It is for this reason that the Prophet (S) has described supplication as
the believer's weapon, the pillar of the religion, the light of the
skies and the earth:

> "الدُّعاءُ سِلاحُ المُؤمِنِ وَعَمُودُ الدِّينِ ونُورُ السَّمواتِ
> والاَرضِ" 490

And Imam ‘Ali (as) calls supplication as the key to victory and
salvation:
In the Du’a Kumayl he introduces supplication as a means for the
strengthening of the body and mind and as an agent to serve both God and
people and a means for a journey towards Heaven.

</blockquote>

*"Strengthen my limbs for Your service and fortify my determination.
Grant me earnestness in fear of You and continuity in attachment to Your
service, until I move towards You in the racing fields of the foremost
ones, hasten to you among those who strive in hastening (towards You),
yearn for* *Your nearness among the ardently desirous, draw near to you
with the nearness of the sincere ones, and fear You with the fear of
those possessed of certainty, and gather in Your Proximity together with
the believers".*[^4]

Persuasion Towards Supplication And Worship
-------------------------------------------

Because of the miraculous effects of supplication and worship, they have
always been emphasized by God, Prophets and God's men. At one point the
Holy Qur’an considers supplication as a means for the value of people:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُلْ مَا يَعْبَأُ بِكُمْ رَبِّي لَوْلَا دُعَاؤُكُمْ "
  </p>
</blockquote>

***"Say: My Lord would not care for you were it not for your
prayer".***[^5]

At another place God orders people to call upon Him and He will answer
them and if they refuse to do so they will go to Hell:

**
**

"وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمْ ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ
يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِي سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَاخِرِينَ "

***“And your Lord says: Call upon Me, I will answer you; surely those
who are too proud for My service shall soon enter hell abased”.***[^6]

The Prophet (S) considers supplication as the best weapon against the
enemy and the best means to get sustenance.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اَلا اَدُلُّكُم عَلى سِلاحٍ يُنجِيكُم مِن اَعدَائِكُم ويُدِرُّ
اَرزَاقَكُم؟ قَالوا بَلى يا رَسُولَ الله قال: تَدعُونَ رَبَّكُم
بِالَليلِ والنَّهار فاِنَّ سِلاحَ المُؤمِن الدُّعاء"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Should I not lead you to have a weapon which could save you from your
enemies and give you abundant sustenance?” They said: “Yes, O Messenger
of Allah”. Then he said: “Pray to your Lord, day and night, because the
weapon of a believer is supplication."*[^7]

Some people assume that the world is solely based on cause and effect
factors. Therefore, they think, there is no room in the Divine destiny
for prayer and supplication. They, however, ignore the fact that
supplication is among cause and effect factors. This assumption is
rejected in numerous traditions including the following. Zurarah
narrated that Imam al-Sadiq (as) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اُدعُ الله عَزَّوجَلَّ ولا تَقُل: اِنَّ الأمرَ قَدْ فُرِغَ مِنهُ قالَ
زُرارَة: اِنَّما يَعنِي لا يَمنَعُكَ اِيمانُكَ بِالقَضاءِ والقَدَرِ
اَن تُبالِغَ بِالدُّعاءِ وتَجتَهِدَ فِيهِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Call on God, and do not say: ‘The matter has been settled’”. Zurarah
said: It only means that your faith in decree and destiny should not
prevent you from doing your utmost to strive in supplication".*[^8]

Abdullah Ibn Sinan says that he heard Imam al-Sadiq (as) saying:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"الدُّعاءُ يَرُدُّ القَضَاءَ بَعدَ مَا اُبْرِمَ اِبْراماً فَاكْثِر
مِنَ الدُّعاءِ فَاِنَّهُ مِفتَاحُ كُلِّ رَحْمَةٍ ونَجاحُ كُلِّ حَاجَةٍ
ولا يُنَالُ مَا عِنْدَ الله عَزَّوجَلَّ اِلاّ بِالدُّعاءِ واِنَّهُ
لَيسَ بَابٌ يَكثُرُ قَرْعُهُ اِلا يُوشَكُ اَن يُفْتَحُ لِصَاحِبِهِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Supplication repels decree after it has been concluded. Therefore,
engage yourself in supplication often, since it is the key to every
mercy and the fulfillment of every need. What is with God is only
attained through supplication. There is no door that a person knocks on
often, but that it soon opens for him".*[^9]

Since the supplication is among the factors of cause and effect,
therefore, you should always call on God.

The Prophet (S) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"يَدخُلِ الجَنَّةَ رَجُلانِ كَانا يَعْمَلانِ عَمَلاً واحِداً فَيَرى
اَحَدَهُمَا صَاحِبَهُ فَوقَه، فَيَقُولُ يا ربِّ بِما اعطيتَهُ وكانَ
عَمَلُنا واحِداً؟ فَيَقُولُ الله تَباركَ وتعالى: سَألَني ولم تَسألني"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Two men whose actions are identical enter paradise, but one of them
sees his companion has a higher status. The man says: My Lord! Why did
You grant him that when our actions were the same? God, the Exalted,
replies: He asked and called on Me, but you did not”.*[^10]

Imam Baqir (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِنَّ الله كَرِهَ اِلحاحَ النَّاسِ بَعضَهُم عَلى بَعْضٍ في المَسألَةِ
وَاحَبَّ ذلِكَ لِنَفسِهِ اِنَّ الله جَلَّ ذِكرُهُ يُحِبُّ اَن يُسألَ
ويُطلَبَ ما عِندَهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“God dislikes people beseeching one another for a request, but He likes
that for Himself. God, the Exalted, likes to be asked and requested for
what is with Him”.*[^11]

He has also said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"واللهِ لا يُلِحُّ عَبْدٌ مُؤمِنٌ عَلى اللهِ عَزَّوجَلَّ في حَاجَتِهِ
اِلاّ قَضاها لَهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“I swear by God, a believer does not beseech God for a need but that He
fulfils it for him”.*[^12]

In this regard, of course, there is no difference between big needs and
small ones. Imam Baqir (as) has also said,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لا تُحَقِّروا صَغِيراً مِن حَوائِجِكُم فاِنَّ احَبَّ المُؤمِنِينَ
اِلى اللهِ اسألَهُم"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Do not belittle your small needs because the believers dearest to God
are those who ask the most.*[^13]

God told Prophet Moses (as):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"سَلْنِي كُلَّ ما تَحتاجُ اِليهِ حَتّى عَلَفَ شاتِكَ ومِلحَ عَجِينِكَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Ask Me for all that you need, even the grass for your sheep and salt
for your dough”.*[^14]

God Will Not Need Anything, Nor Does He Need Any Recommender
------------------------------------------------------------

Since God dominates all creatures and is closer to them even than they
themselves:

> "ونَحنُ اَقرَبُ اِلَيهِ مِن حَبْلِ الوَرِيد ـ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَحُولُ
> بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَقَلْبِهِ" 502

***“…and since We are nearer to him than his life-vein.” "..(And know
that) Allah intervenes between man and his heart".***

Therefore God hears people's supplication and prayers even if they are
offered in a whisper, let alone loudly. He is aware of the intentions of
all. He does not suffer from any kind of jealousy. There is no need for
a servant or mediator to connect people with God. Allah says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِي عَنِّي فَإِنِّي قَرِيبٌ أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ
الدَّاعِي إِذَا دَعَانِي فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا لِي وَلْيُؤْمِنُوا بِي
لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْشُدُونَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And when My servants asks you concerning Me, then surely I am very
near; I answer the prayer of the supplicant when he calls on Me, so they
should answer My call and believe in Me that they may walk in the right
way”.***[^15]

Thus, if God has led us towards ***"means of nearness"***[^16] and has
let the interceder[^17] intercede with Him, it is not because the asking
of the believers will affect God, but it is a sign of the believers'
attainment of perfection.[^18]

The Conditions For The Acceptance Of Supplication And Prayers:
--------------------------------------------------------------

In accordance with God’s promises, God accepts every supplication and
prayers of the believers. But not every supplication is accepted under
any kind of conditions. In some circumstances they are accepted, in
others they are rejected.

### 1. The Physical And Spiritual Readiness

The first condition for the acceptance of supplication and prayers is
the believer’s physical and spiritual readiness; the time and place also
should be appropriately selected: midnight and at the dawn, for
instance.

There is a tradition narrated from Imam al-Sadiq (as) which states that
God has told Moses (as):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"يا بْنَ عِمران هَبْ لِي مِن قَلبِكَ الخُشُوعَ ومِن بَدَنِكَ الخُضُوعَ
ومِن عَينِكَ الدُّمُوعَ وادْعُنِي في ظُلَمِ الَّليلِ فاِنَّكَ
تَجِدُنِي قَرِيباً مُجِيباً"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“O son of Imran, give me from your heart humility, from your body
submissiveness and from your eyes tears, and call on me in the darkness
of the night. You will find Me very near and answering your
supplication."*[^19]
Nawf al-Bikali says: One night I saw Imam ‘Ali (as), had left his bed,
and was looking at the stars. He said: ‘O Nawf, are you awake or
asleep’? I replied I was awake, He then said:
‘O Nawf, Prophet David (as) woke up at such an hour saying: “At this
time any kind of supplication and prayer will be accepted unless the
performer of the supplication is a tax official for a tyrant governor,
or his secret spy or his policeman, or a musical player of tambour or an
entertainer"’.[^20]

#### The Avoidance Of Sins

The other condition for the acceptance of the prayer and supplication is
the being at a distance from sins. It is because most sins are a thick
curtain in the way of the acceptance of prayers. We observe this in the
Du’a Kumayl:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"الّلهُمَّ اغفِر لِيَ الذُنُوبَ الَّتي تَحبِسُ الدُّعاء"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“O God! Forgive me the sins that hold back the supplication”.*

Ayatollah Kalbasi mentions the sins which hinder the supplication and
prayers to be accepted: suspicion, quarrel with brethren, delaying the
performance of prayers, the parents’ dissatisfaction with
children.[^21]
He, then, reports the following poem from Mawlawi:
The smell of haughtiness, of greed, and of excessive need,
In the speech will show themselves like onions;
If you swear that you have not taken onions,
That you have stopped taking onion and garlic;
When you open you mouth to swear,
The smell of these will surely betray you;
Then your prayers will be rejected for the lies you told,
Your tongue is not in harmony with your heart;
That supplication will be rejected,
It will not find acceptance;
If your intention is straight, but your speech not straight,
This distortion of speech is accepted by God;
But if your intention is not straight but your speech is all right,
That sort of intention is worth nothing.

#### The Purity Of Foods

As we know our prayers and actions stem from a power which is based on
foods. If these foods are gained illegally, our prayers are not clean
and as a consequence they are not accepted.
The great Prophet (S) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن احَبَّ اَن يُستَجابَ دُعاؤُهُ فَليُطَيِّب مَطعَمَهُ ومَكسَبَهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Whoever wishes his supplication to be answered, let his food and his
earnings be lawful"*[^22]*.*

In response to somebody who had said he wanted his prayers to be
accepted, the Prophet (S) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"طَهِّر مأكَلَكَ ولا تُدخِل في بَطنِكَ الحرامَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Purify your food (i.e. eat what is lawful) and do not let unlawful
food enter your stomach."*[^23]

He said also:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اطِب كَسبَكَ تُستَجابُ دَعوَتُكَ فاِنَّ الرَجُلَ يَرفَعُ الُّلقمَةَ
اِلى فِيهِ حَراماً فما تُستَجابُ لَهُ اَربَعينَ يَوماً"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"Purify your earnings and your supplication will be accepted. This is
because the supplication of a person who raises a morsel of unlawful
food to his mouth is not answered for forty days".*[^24]

Imam Sadiq (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِذا اَرادَ اَحَدُكُم اَن يُستَجابَ لَهُ فَليُطَيِّب كَسبَه ولِيَخرُج
مِن مَظالِم النّاسِ واِنَّ الله لا يُرفَعُ اِلَيهِ دُعاءُ عَبدٍ وفي
بَطنِهِ حَرامٌ او عِندَهُ مَظلمَةٌ لاحَدٍ مِن خَلقِهِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“If anyone of you wishes his supplication be accepted, let him purify
his earnings and cease defrauding people. This is because the
supplication of a believer is not raised up to Allah while there is
unlawful food in his stomach and he has a due wrongfully taken from one
of His creatures".*[^25]

#### The Possibility And Contingency Of A Deed

Among the conditions set for prayers to be acceptable are the
possibility of the occurrence of the actions and the contingency of the
desired action. Imam ‘Ali (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"يا صَاحَبَ الدُّعاء لا تَسأل مَا لايَكُونُ ولا يَحِلُّ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"O performer of supplication, do not ask for anything unattainable or
unlawful".*[^26]

The Hindrances On The Way Of Accepting Supplication
---------------------------------------------------

Although God is kind towards the believers and hears their overt and
covert prayers and has promised to answer their calls, there are factors
which may cause the prayers not to be accepted. Among these factors are
the following:

### 1. Sins

Indulging in sins may be a factor for the rejection of a prayer. Imam
Sadiq (as) is reported to have said, "Musa b. ‘Imran (as) was passing by
one of his followers who was prostrating. After some time he was still
prostrating. Musa told him: If I could, I would satisfy your needs.
At this moment God revealed to him,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لو سَجَدَ حَتّى يَنقَطِعَ عُنُقُهُ ما قَبِلتُهُ حَتّى يَتَحوَّلَ
عَمّا اَكْرَهُ اِلى ما اُحِبُّ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“I will not accept his prayers even if he engages in prostrating till
his neck breaks. I will accept his prayers if he stops doing what I hate
and turn towards doing things which I like"*[^27]

### 2. Injustice

One of the factors which hinder the acceptance of prayers is the
injustice done to others. In the book Ihtijaj there is a tradition
narrated from Imam Sadiq (as) depicting this truth:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِنَّهُ سُئِلَ اَلَيسَ يَقُولُ الله اُدعُونِي اَستَجِب لَكُم؟ وقد
نَرى المُضطَرَّ يَدعُوهُ ولا يُجابُ لَهُ والمَظلُومَ يَسْتَنْصرُهُ على
عَدوه فَلا يَنصُرُه قال ويحَكَ ما يَدعُوه اَحدٌ اِلاّ استَجابَ لَهُ
امَّا الظَالِم فدُعاؤُهُ مَردُودٌ الى اَن يَتُوبَ وامَّا المُحَقُّ
فاذا دعا استجابَ لَهُ وصَرَفَ عَنهُ البَلاءَ مِن حَيثُ لا يَعلَمُهُ او
ادَّخَرَ لَهُ ثَواباً جَزِيلاً لِيَومِ حاجَتِهِ اِليه واِن لم يَكُن
الامرُ الَّذي سَأَلَ العَبدُ خَيرٌ لهُ اِن اعطاهُ اُمسِكَ عَنهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*‘He was asked: Doesn't God tell the believers:* ***“Call upon Me and I
will answer you” (40:60)**? And this is while we see the distressed call
upon Him and they are not answered, and the wronged seeking help against
the enemy, but they do not receive any help.*

*Imam Sadiq (as) replied: Woe be to you! No one calls Him except that He
answers Him. But a tyrant's prayer is rejected till he repents. When a
rightful person prays, he is answered and affliction is turned away from
him while he is unaware of it, or abundant reward is stored for him*
*for the day of his need. But if the servant asks for something that
would not be good for him if he was granted it, then God holds it back
from him."*[^28]

### 3. When Natural Factors Are Not Considered

According to the Islamic traditions, prayers and supplication are
specific to occasions when man's trials and struggles are of no use.
Imam Sadiq (as) has stated:

*“There are four groups of people whose calls are not answered:*
*A man who sits at home saying: ‘O God, give me daily bread’. He is then
told: ‘Didn’t I command you to seek it?’*
*A man who has a wife and he prays to God against her. It is said to
him: ‘Didn’t I give you the right of divorce?’*
*A man who had wealth, but was extravagant, and then he says: ‘O God,
give me sustenance’. He is told: ‘Didn’t I command you to be moderate in
your expenditure?’*
*And a man had wealth which he lent to another without any receipt. Then
the owner asks God to soften the man’s heart to return to him what he
owes him. It is said to him: ‘Didn’t I command you to have witnesses
when you lend anything to anyone?’”*[^29]

Considering the fact that the world is based on the cause and effect
principle, it is useless to lie under a date-tree and keep your mouth
open in order for the dates to fall in your mouth. You should stand up
and pick the date and chew and then swallow it till the act of digestion
takes place. This is shown in the tradition about the Bani Isra’il
concerning Moses who fell ill but did not take the necessary medicine.
God then said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَعِزَّتي وَجَلالي لا اُبرِؤُكَ حَتّى تَتدَاوى بِمَا ذَكَرُوه لَكَ،
اَرَدْتَ اَن تُبطِلَ حِكْمَتِي بِتَوكُّلِكَ عَلَيَّ فَمَن اَودَعَ
العَقاقِيرَ مَنافِعَ الاَشْياءِ غَيرِي"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"I swear by My Glory and My Majesty, I shall not cure you until you
take the medicine which Bani Israel have brought for you. Do you wish to
annul My Wisdom through your trust in me? Who other than Me has put
these benefits in the herbs?”*[^30]

The Reasons Of Delaying Responding To Supplication
--------------------------------------------------

Sometimes the supplication of a person will not be answered quickly for
the following reasons:
**a)** The qualification for the acceptance of the supplication is still
absent in the person. This qualification is only obtained through the
person’s struggle and perseverance.
Concerning this issue, Imam ‘Ali (as) in the above letter has stated:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"فَلا يُقنِطَنَّكَ اِبطاءُ اِجابَتِهِ فاِنَّ العَطِيَّةَ على قَدَرِ
النِيَّة"
  </p>
</blockquote>

"*Do not let the slowness of His response dishearten you, for the grant
is in accordance with the intention* ".

**b)** If the supplication is not answered immediately, he may try to be
more qualified. In that case he will get more reward for his endeavors.
God has not answered to this person’s call in order that he may try to
be more qualified. Imam ‘Ali (as), in this regard, says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"ورُبَّما اُخِّرَت عَنكَ الاِجَابَةُ لِيَكُونَ ذَلِكَ اَعظَمَ لأجرِ
السَائِلِ وَاجْزَلَ لِعَطاءِ الآمِل وَرُبَما سَألتَ شَيئاً فَلا
تُعطاهُ واوتِيتَ خَيراً مِنهُ عاجِلاً او آجِلاً"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Sometimes the response has only been delayed for you so that it may be
a greater reward for the petitioner and a more abundant grant for the
hopeful one. Sometimes you ask for a thing and you are not given it, but
you are given something better than it now or later”.*

**c)** Sometimes the desired object is not to the benefit of the asking
person both in this world and in the other. Examples are: social
position, wealth, children, and the like. In such cases God will not
answer the call since He is generous towards the person. Regarding this,
Imam ‘Ali (as) states in this letter:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اَو صُرِفَ عَنكَ لِمَا هُوَ خَيرٌ لَكَ فَلَرُبَّ اَمرٍ قَد طَلَبتَهُ
فِيهِ هَلاكُ دِينِكَ لَو اُوتِيتَه"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"..or it is turned away from you for what is better for you, because
sometimes in the fulfillment of what you ask for is the destruction of
your religion.*
*Therefore let your request be for that, the beauty of which remains for
you, and the evil consequences of which pass away from you. For wealth
does not remain for you, nor do you remain for it”.*

The Access To Repentance And Its Role In Correcting The Sinner
--------------------------------------------------------------

Since one of the requirements for the acceptance of our supplication is
the state of being innocent, Imam ‘Ali (as) in this letter emphasizes on
repentance.
He points out the following issues:

### 1. God Did Not Deny Your Right Of Repentance

Because of this animal/angel nature, man may commit sins in his
selection of good-bad affairs. If there were not a way to repent for
man, he would get completely destroyed. In that case, a guilty person
might think since there is no way for him to cleanse himself of his
guilts, he might continue his evil-doing and might tell himself "If I
want to go to hell, let me go there like a man." This kind of attitude
would hinder man to arrive at the perfection which is important in the
philosophy of creation.

For this reason God has opened a door to this group of people to return
to Him through the door which Imam Zayn al-‘Abidin (as) mentions in the
supplication of the repentant (*munajat al-tawwabin*):

> "اِلهِي اَنتَ الَّذِي فَتَحتَ لِعِبَادِكَ بَاباً اِلى عَفْوِكَ
> سَمَّيتَهُ التَوبَةَ فَقُلتَ: تُوبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ تَوْبَةً نَصُوحًا
> 519 فمَا عُذرُ مَن اَغفَلَ دُخُولَ البَابِ بَعدَ فَتحِهِ"

*"O My God! You have opened for Your servants a door to Your Pardon
which You have named repentance, for You have said:* ***“Turn to Allah
with a sincere repentance” (66:8).*** *Then what is the excuse of one
who neglects entering this door after it is opened?"*[^31]

Thus, in Islam, a sinner can repent and there are no heavy conditions
for his repentance and he also is addressed not to despair but to return
to God:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"قُلْ يَا عِبَادِي الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا عَلَى أَنْفُسِهِمْ لَا
تَقْنَطُوا مِنْ رَحْمَةِ اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ
جَمِيعًا إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ وَأَنِيبُوا إِلَى
رَبِّكُمْ وَأَسْلِمُوا لَهُ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يَأْتِيَكُمْ الْعَذَابُ
ثُمَّ لَا تُنْصَرُونَ وَاتَّبِعُوا أَحْسَنَ مَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ
مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يَأْتِيَكُمْ العَذَابُ بَغْتَةً
وَأَنْتُمْ لَا تَشْعُرُونَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Say: O my servants, who have acted extravagantly against their own
souls, do not despair of the mercy of Allah; surely Allah forgives the
faults altogether; surely He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. And return
to your Lord time after time and submit to Him before there comes to you
the punishment, then you shall not be helped. And follow the best that
has been revealed to you from your Lord before there comes to you the
punishment all of a sudden while you do not even perceive.**”*[^32]

And this return is so favorable that we read in one tradition from Imam
Baqir (as):

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِنَّ الله تَعالى اَشَدُّ فَرَحاً بِتَوبَةِ عَبدِهِ مِن رَجُلٍ
اَضَلَّ راحِلَتَهُ وَزَادَهُ في لَيلَةٍ ظَلمَاءَ فَوَجَدهَا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*"God, the Exalted’s rejoicing at the repentance of His servant is far
greater than a person who has lost his horse and provisions in a dark
night and then found them."*

Even despair of being forgiven is enumerated as a major sin.

### 2. There Is Still Time For Repentance

Man should not put off his repentance until he suddenly opens his eyes
and confronts the Angel of Death while his shoulders are weighed down
with sins. His delay might be the result of his ignorance (due to
instincts and untamable desires and their dominance over man's reasoning
and faith) and not to the factor of aggression. In such cases, he has
time to repent and God is not in a hurry to revenge the worldly
wrong-doings here or in the Hereafter.[^33] God says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إِنَّمَا التَّوْبَةُ عَلَى اللَّهِ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ السُّوءَ
بِجَهَالَةٍ ثُمَّ يَتُوبُونَ مِنْ قَرِيبٍ فَأُوْلَئِكَ يَتُوبُ اللَّهُ
عَلَيْهِمْ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Repentance with Allah is only for those who do evil in ignorance,
then turn to Allah soon, so these it is to whom Allah turns mercifully,
and Allah is ever knowing, Wise”.***[^34]

On the other hand, God rejects repentance at the time of death:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَلَيْسَتْ التَّوْبَةُ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ السَّيِّئَاتِ حَتَّى
إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَهُمْ الْمَوْتُ قَالَ إِنِّي تُبْتُ الْآنَ وَلَا
الَّذِينَ يَمُوتُونَ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ أُوْلَئِكَ أَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ
عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And repentance is not for those who go on doing evil deeds, until
when death comes to one of them, he says: Surely now I repent; nor for
those who die while they are unbelievers. These are they for whom we
have prepared a painful chastisement”.***[^35]

In traditions, we read that the Prophet (S) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَن تابَ قَبلَ اَن يُعايَنَ قَبِلَ الله تَوبَتَهُ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Whoever repents before he confronts death, God will accept his
repentance”.*[^36]

The Prophet, on the other hand, has said,

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"اِذَا بَلَغتِ النَّفسُ هَذِهِ ـ وَاهوى بِيَدِهِ اِلى حُنجُرَتِهِ ـ
لَم يَكُن لِلعالِمِ تَوبَةٌ وَكانَت لِلجَاهِلِ تَوبَةٌ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“When the soul arrives here – and he pointed at his throat - there is
no repentance for a scholar, but there is repentance for an ignorant
person”.*[^37]

Thus, the possibility of repentance prior to death is a sign of God's
Kindness and is indicative of the fact that God wishes to save any
sinner from his sin and has left the door of repentance open.

### 3. In Accepting Repentance, God Is Not Strict

Although God is strict towards those who aggressively indulge in
wrong-doings and would not pardon them:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"وَوَجَدُوا مَا عَمِلُوا حَاضِرًا وَلَا يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا “ـ
“وَمَنْ يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَه"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And what they had done they shall find present (there); and your
Lord does not deal unjustly with any one”.***[^38] ***“And he who has
done an atom's weight of evil shall see it”.***[^39]

He will, however, be generous towards those who regret their wrong deeds
and turn towards Him.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إِلَّا مَنْ تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا فَأُوْلَئِكَ
يُبَدِّلُ اللَّهُ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ حَسَنَاتٍ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا
رَحِيمًا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Except him who repents and does a good deed; so these are they of
whom Allah changes the evil deeds to good ones; and Allah is Forgiving,
Merciful”.***[^40]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ وَإِنْ تَكُنْ حَسَنَةً
يُضَاعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِنْ لَدُنْهُ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Surely Allah does not do injustice to the weight of an atom, and if
it is a good deed He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great
reward”.***[^41]

Since repentance is a suitable action, God will carry out His promise:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"مَنْ جَاءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أَمْثَالِهَا وَمَنْ جَاءَ
بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلَا يُجْزَى إِلَّا مِثْلَهَا وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Whoever brings a good deed, he shall have ten like it, and whoever
brings an evil deed, he shall be recompensed only with the like of it,
and they shall not be dealt with unjustly”.***[^42]

This fact shows that God is lenient towards those who repent and rewards
those who stop carrying out sins. This is another way for sinners to be
absolved by God.

The Conditions For The Perfect Repentance
-----------------------------------------

At the end of this discussion, it is necessary to point out one
important issue: As we understand the term repentance involves a
sinner's regret for what is previously done and a decision not to do it
again. Such repentance erases the past record.

But in some other traditions there are some restrictions such as the
payment of what a person owes others. Such a restriction is seen in Nahj
al-Balaghah:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"قالَ اَميرُ المُؤمِنِين عليه السلام لقائِلٍ قال بِحَضرَتِهِ
(استَغفِرُ الله): ثَكَلَتكَ اُمُّكَ، اتَدرِي مَا الاستِغفَارُ؟
الاِستِغفارُ دَرَجَةُ العِلّيينَ، وهُوَ اِسمٌ واقِعٌ على سِتَةُ
مَعانٍ: اوَّلُها النَدَم على ما مَضى، والثاني العَزمُ على تَركِ
العَودِ اِلَيهِ ابَداً، والثالثُ اَن تُؤدِّي الى المَخلُوقِينَ
حُقُوقَهُم حَتّى تَلقَى الله اَملَسَ لَيسَ عَليكَ تَبِعَةٌ، والرابِعُ
اَن تَعْمِدَ الى كُلِّ فَرِيضَةٍ عَلَيكَ ضَيَّعتَها فَتُؤدِّي حَقَّها،
والخامِسُ اَن تَعمِدَ الى اللَّحمِ الَّذي نَبَتَ على السحت فَتُذِيبُهُ
الاحزانُ حَتّى تَلصِقَ الجِلدَ بِالعَظمِ ويَنشَأ بَينَها لَحمٌ
جَدِيدٌ، والسادسُ اَن تُذِيقَ الجِسمَ اَلمَ الطاعَةِ كما اَذقتَهُ
حَلاوَةَ المَعصِيَةِ فَعِندَ ذلِكَ تَقُولُ: استَغفِرُ الله".
  </p>
</blockquote>

*‘Somebody used the expression "Astaghfirullah" (I ask Allah to forgive
me) in front of Imam ‘Ali (as). Imam ‘Ali (as) said: “May your mother
weep on you! Do you realize what Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) means?
Istighfar is the station of the ‘Illiyin and it includes six phases:
First: remorse* *at deeds committed in the past; second: the
determination never to to return to them again; third, returning to
people their dues so that you meet God free of blame, with no claim of
wrongdoing against you; fourth, attending to every obligatory act that
you have neglected and fulfilling its due; fifth, to attend to the flesh
that you have grown through unlawful earnings and to melt it down
through grief until the skin adheres to the bones and new flesh is
formed in between; sixth, to make the body taste the pain of obedience
just as it had tasted the sweetness of disobedience. Then say:
"Astaghfirullah”.*[^43]

Similar statements are observed in traditions which are apparently in
contrast with the ease of repentance that we have been discussing so
far. Thus, our scholars have tried to set forth a kind of compromise
among these apparent contradictions. One of these scholars is al-Majlisi
who after mentioning the tradition from Imam ‘Ali (as) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"ما سِوى الاوَّلَينِ عِندَ جُمهُورِ المُتَكَلِّمِين مِن شَرائِطِ
كَمالِ التَوبَةِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

“For scholars, repenting from the past doings and return from
evil–doings is among the perfect conditions of repentance and not among
the principal conditions”.[^44]

Allamah in his commentary on *Tajrid* says, concerning this:
"Affairs such as compensation for the lost prayers or the payment of
people's rights are among the extra conditions on repentance and are not
included in the essence of repentance. Later on, if the person did not
carry out the lost prayers and did not pay people's rights, these will
be considered as the shunning of one's tasks which entails new
punishments and which is not related to the principle of
repentance".[^45]
