Hari Kumar : Ashura
===================

The chain whips awaken
a hundred eyes on their backs.
Red tears trail the streets
to the gold-domed tomb of Husain.
A golden spider with legs of blood.
Wails shake the sky the minaret props.
But today, for every lash for Husain,
a lash will tear for a warded son.\*

**T. D. Chattani : Vale of Sorrow**

Through the Vale of sorrow does history trace
Two matchless martyrs our Prophet's pets
Who left their hearths with Islamic grace
In hunger and thirst their duty to face.
Severed from home, exhausted on the field
Opposed by enemies who had Satan's shield
They gave their lives that others be freed
From falsehood, tyranny and a Kafir's creed.
Most precious blood flowed from their veins
Battlefield of Karbala has still those stains
From our hearts should rush rivers of blood
Renewing our faith with this vital flood. !\*

**Ameen Khorasanee : Husain of Kerbala**


Men weep for you today in many lands,
And on their breasts in bitter anguish beat,
And in sad, mournful tunes, the tales repeat of how you
lost your family upon the sands.
You nobly spurned the tyrant's base demands and chose 5
Death to prevent your soul's defeat,-
Became a martyr with unflinching feet-
For these well may one weep who understands.
This sorrow at your death, despite the years is still as
fresh,
Which Time has failed to quell.10
In every heart this day new pain appears
And of your sufferings men each other tell.
They see a vision through slow falling tears of that lone
Battle where athirst you fell.\*
\*Lalljee, The Martyrdom of Imam Husain, p. 60.

**Sarojini Naidu : The Night of Martyrdom**

Blackrobed, barefooted, with dim eyes that rain
Wild tears in memory of thy woeful plight,
And hands that in blind, rhythmic anguish smite
Their bloodstained bosoms to sad refrain
From the old haunting legion of thy pain,
Thy votaries mourn thee through the tragic night
With mystic dirge and melancholy rite,
Crying to thee ? Husain! Husain!
Why do thy myriad lovers so lament?
Sweet saint, is not thy matchless martyrhood
The living banner and brave covenant
Of the high creed thy Prophet did proclaim,
Bequeathing for the world's beautitude
Th' enduring loveliness of Allah's name?\*

**Sarojini Naidu : The Imam Bara**

I
Out of the somber shadow,
Over the sunlit grass,
Slow in a sad procession
The shadowy pageants pass
Mournful, majestic, and solemn,
Stricken and pale and dumb,
Crowned in their peerless anguish
The sacred martyrs come.
Hark, from the brooding silence
Breaks the wild cry of pain
Wrung from the heart of the ages
Ali! Hassan! Hussain!
II
Come from this tomb of shadows,
Come from this tragic shrine
That throbs with the deathless sorrow
Of a long-dead martyr line.
Love! Let the living sunlight
Kindle your splendid eyes
Ablaze with the steadfast triumph
Of the spirit that never dies.


So may the hope of new ages Comfort the mystic pain That cries from the
ancient silence Ali! Hassan! Hussain!\*

**W. C. Tailor : An Ode**


Tell me friends what shall you say
On the awful Judgment Day
When Mohammad asks you where
Are those trusted to you care?
Dearer than a thousand lives?
Bound by many a fastening chain
Some in dungeons dark remain,
On Kerbala's barren strand
Others lie, a reaking band.
Torn with wounds and stain'd with mud
Weltering in their own heart's blood.
When before the Judgment seat
You the Holy Prophet meet,
He shall ask. If thus you show
The gratitude you justly owe,
For all the benefits bestow'd
By whom whose bounty freely flow'd.\*

**Anonymous : Vision of Kerbala**


Here's the tale of my nightly trance
The Vision of Karbala in a deathly dance
When a Martyr great faced the lance,
Of shameful Shimr for Islam to enhance,
No war of weapons or battles' sound
Equals this tragedy all world round,
No hero hooked to holiness stood
With such head held high without shelter or food.
His trumpet spake not to an armed throng
But to seventy-two saints, the celestial strong
They all sang their heavenly song
Giving their all to avenge a wrong.
Satanic sceptres arranged with awful eye
This orgy of blood without a sigh
While our Sovereign Lord was passing by
In scorching sand to answer people's cry.
For Islam's unity he surrendered his head
With his darling children he nobly fed
The starving Ummat on its death-bed
Because through sacrifice are nations made!\*
\* Khurshed, ed., Imam Husain, 2nd ed., p. 156.


L. 4. ?Shimr?, full name ?Shimr b. Dh? al-Jawshan?, was the most
notorious figure in the Ashura incident. His real name was Shurahb?l b.
?Amr b. Mu??w?yyah. He symbolizes cruelty and atrocity because he was
reportedly the person who decapitated Imam al-Husain.

He instigated and dispatched his men to attack and plunder the tents on
Imam al-Husain's front. L. 10. Although ?seventy-two saints? refers to
the widely- accepted number of martyrs of the Ashura battle; however,
the number of martyrs listed inside Imam al-Husain's sacred shrine
amounts to some one-hundred martyrs (personal observation).

L. 19. ?Ummat?, var. umma, means ?The Muslim community
