***“In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.” Holy Qur'an
(1:1)***

This phrase is spoken millions of times every day! Is this not amazing?

Not only is this benediction repeated a MINIMUM of 20 times each day by
every Muslim as he says his daily prayers, but it is expressed many more
times each day by Muslims at the beginning of meetings, lectures,
speeches and social gatherings. Consider that there are more than one
billion Muslims in our world today and realize how many times this one
phrase is uttered. That's amazing!

What does it mean? Who is Allah? What does He do that makes us to begin
every task, every thought, every action in His name? How can we know
Him? How can we see His signs? How can we understand what He wants from
us?

This booklet, the first of a series, gives us some answers to these and
many other questions that arise in our hearts everyday about Allah, Most
High.

We pray that this booklet will help our dear readers and that it will
guide them on their journey through life to accomplish their task of
obeying the Will of Allah in every aspect of their behaviour.

With Allah comes success.
