29. Cooperation In Good Deeds
=============================

Praying for early reappearance of His Eminence, Qaim (aj) is cooperation
and helpfulness in good deeds and piety about which the Almighty Allah
has said:

  <p>
وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَىٰ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Help one another in goodness and piety.” (Qur’an, Surah Maidah
5:2)***
