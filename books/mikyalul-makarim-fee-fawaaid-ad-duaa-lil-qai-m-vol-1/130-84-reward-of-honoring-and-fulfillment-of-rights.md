84. Reward of honoring and fulfillment of rights
================================================

It is from the view that *Dua* is paying respect and honor and a kind of
veneration, as mentioned in *Biharul Anwar* from Imam Ja’far Sadiq (as)
that he said:

“One who honors a Muslim jurisprudent would on the Judgment Day meet
Allah, the Mighty and the High while He is pleased with him.”[^1]

Also in the rights of the scholar, Amirul Momineen (as) has said:

“It is necessary that in his presence as well as his absence, his honor
and respect be guarded, and that his rights must be recognized as the
reward of the scholar is more than of the one who fasts during the day,
prays at night and fights in the way of Allah.”[^2]

I say: It is clear that our master, the Master of the Time (aj) fits
this point most perfectly, rather, he is the real scholar, as mentioned
in *Khisaal* from His Eminence, Abu Abdillah Sadiq (as) that he said:

“People are of three types: The scholar, the student and the dust. Thus
we are scholars and our Shias, students; and the rest of the people are
dust.”[^3]

I say: Since praying is guarding of respect of His Eminence in his
presence and absence, it is incumbent on the believer to arrange for it
because His Eminence is out of our sight and present with his Ahle Bayt.
And I have versified in Persian as follows:

O one who is out of sight, come to us

In your anticipation are all the people

My views are not concealed from you

You are present in the group but absent from the gathering.

Before this also we had mentioned some relevant points on this matter.
