Marriage Is the Key to Divine Mercy and a Good Temper
=====================================================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "The doors of Heaven to mercy will be opened
in four situations: when it rains, when a child looks kindly at his
parent's face, when the door of the Ka'bah is opened, and when marriage
(occurs)."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 103, p. 221

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Join your children in marriage (boys or
girls) because, thereby, Allah renders their tempers good, adds to their
sustenance, and increases their sense of honour."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 103, p. 222

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Get married and give your daughters in
marriage, because it is from the good fortune of any Muslim man that he
gives his (matured) daughter (or sister) in marriage."

Al-Kafi, vol. 5, p. 328

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "There is nothing to Allah, Almighty and
Glorious, more beloved than the house which is developed in Islam by
marriage; and there is nothing to Allah, Almighty and Glorious, more
abhorent than the house which is ruined in Islam by separation, viz,
divorce."

Al-Kafi, vol. 5, p. 328
