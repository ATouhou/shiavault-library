About the Author
================

Imam Muhammad Jawad Chirri is Lebanese by birth and a graduate of the
Islamic Institute of Najaf in Iraq. Before reaching the age of 25, he
wrote about Islamic jurisprudence and its basis. The following are some
of his books dealing with this subject:

1. Al-Riyad in the Basis of Jurisprudence
2. Al-Taharah (the purity)
3. Fasting
4. The Book of Prayer
5. The Islamic Wills

When he returned from Najaf to Lebanon, Imam Chirri and the
unforgettable personality, Sheikh Muhammad Jawad Mughniyya, the author
of many valuable books, waged a campaign trying to awaken the people of
southern Lebanon and urging them to rise in order to gain usurped rights
in the Lebanese society.

During that period, the late Imam Abd al-Husayn Sharaf al-Din urged the
author to write a book about the caliphate. The author honored this
righteous request by writing a book called The Caliphate in the Islamic
Constitution.

The book was received in Najaf with a great deal of appreciation and
motivated the members of Muntada Al-Nashr (a religious college) to meet
and discuss the book. The main speaker of that gathering was the
prominent scholar, Sayyid Muhammad Taqi al-Hakim. The book, in spite of
its small size, was considered to be a novelty in Islamic dialogue.

During the year 1949, the author immigrated to the United States of
America in response to an invitation by the Muslims in Detroit,
Michigan. When he arrived in the United States, he found himself in an
uncomfortable position, unable to communicate with the Americans and the
American born Muslims because he did not know English.

Too old to become a student in a regular American school but anxious to
spread the word of Islam, he immersed himself heart and soul into the
language. Within a short time, he taught himself English well enough to
serve the Muslims of the Detroit area. Later he became a well-known
lecturer and scholar on Islam throughout the United States, the Middle
East, and Africa. In addition, he has written several books in English
about Islam. Among them are the following:

1. Muslim Practice
2. The Faith of Islam
3. Inquiries About Islam
4. Imam Hussein, Leader of the Martyrs
5. The pother of the Prophet Muhammad (the Imam Ali). (He also wrote
this book in Arabic and named it Amir al-Mu'minin)
