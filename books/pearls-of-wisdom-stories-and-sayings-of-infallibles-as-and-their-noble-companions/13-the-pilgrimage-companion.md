A man had returned from Hajj. He was relating his adventures to Imaam
Sadiq (as), and his companion. He was most impressed with one of his
companions of Hajj, and was praising him. What a gracious man, we were
so blessed to have him with us, he was busy praying and worshiping all
the time. As we would stop somewhere, he would rush to a corner and
start prayers.

Imam (as): “Then who was attending to his duties? Who was watering and
feeding his animal (ride)?”

Man: “Of course, we had the honor of doing all that for him. He was busy
in his sacred quest, and had nothing to do with such mundane things.”

Imam (as): “Then indeed, you all are better than him.”
