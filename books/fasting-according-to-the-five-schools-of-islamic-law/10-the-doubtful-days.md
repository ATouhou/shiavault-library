The Doubtful Days
=================

There is consensus among the schools that imsak is obligatory upon one
who does not fast on a “doubtful day” (yawm al-shakk) that later turns
out to be a day of Ramadan, and he is liable to its qada' later.

Where one fasts on a doubtful day that is later known to have been a day
of Ramadan, they differ as to whether it suffices without requiring
qada':

• The Shafi’i, Maliki and Hanbali schools observe: This fast will not
suffice and its qada' is wajib upon him.

• In the opinion of the Hanafis, it suffices and does not require qada'.

• Most Imamis state: Its qada' is not wajib upon him, except when he had
fasted with the niyyah of Ramadan.
