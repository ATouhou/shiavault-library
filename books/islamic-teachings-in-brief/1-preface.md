Preface

In the Name of Allah, The All-compassionate, The All-merciful

Praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all being;
the All-compassionate, the All-merciful;
the Master of the Day of Judgement;

Thee only we serve, and to Thee alone we pray for succour;

Guide us in the straight path;
the path of those whom Thou hast blessed,
not of those against whom Thou art wrathful,
nor of those who are astray.

\* \* \* \* \*

O' Allah! send your blessings to the head of
your messengers and the last of
your prophets,
Muhammad and his pure and cleansed progeny.

Also send your blessings to all your
prophets and envoys.

Call unto the way of your Lord with wisdom and good exhortation,
and reason with them in the best way. Lo! your Lord best knows those
who go astray from His path, and He knows best those who are rightly
guided.

(Qur'an, 16:125)

This book, written in a relatively simple language, presents a summary
of the teachings of Islam to provide some information for those who are
not able to examine Islamic matters deeply in a specialized manner.

One of the most valuable styles for the promotion of culture, sciences
and religion is through simple writings. This method has evolved for
general dissemination of human knowledge to unveil uncertainties and
remove difficulties from some specialized branches of science and
technology so as to make them easily understandable for the public. No
matter how technical a branch of science or subject is, it could be
stated and written in such a way that everyone can utilize it and gain a
relative knowledge in proportion to his educational status and in
accordance with the depth and the extent of his thinking.

This style we see in the Qur'an in its best form. In the Qur'an, the
most complicated human affairs, highly metaphysical and humanistic
matters, Ma'ad (Resurrection), the ultimate point of man's life and his
conditions after death, etc have been described in the most simple
language possible. Considerable space is needed to cite a few examples
of such illuminating highlights of the Qur'an; therefore, we are quoting
only one or two examples. Qur'an, although firm and rational in its
reasoning for Ma'ad and the life in the world Hereafter, states simply,
briefly, and in a way that is comprehensible to all.

"...Says he: 'Who will give life to the bones when they are rotten ?'
Say: 'He will give life to them Who brought them into existence at
first, and He is Cognizant of all creation' (36:78-79)."

This is a very strong reasoning and a logical and rational remark. The
Power that brought forth creations from nonexistence into the world of
existence has the power to gather the components once more and give them
life after their disintegration.

It is said that Abu Nasr al-Farabi\*, the Muslim philosopher, wished
that had Aristotle been alive, he would have accepted this logical
reasoning of Qur'an for physical resurrection. As you can see, although
rational, it has a very simple language that can be easily comprehended
if one thinks a little about it. In like manner, many remarks and
reasonings have been presented about the science of the origin, but the
Qur'an states the subject in a simple and balanced manner.

"Does He not know who He created? And He is the Knower of the
subtleties, the Aware (67:14)." With this brief expression, the subject
becomes completely clear. For experts, too, this verse has a strong
argument in itself.

The prophets and Imams [Twelve infallible successors of Prophet
Muhammad (SA)] have also set forth advanced, sophisticated, and more
complicated matters in a simple form but profoundly in accordance with
Allah's Book. It is also stated in the Qur'an:

"And We did not send any messenger but with the language of his people
so that he might explain to them clearly ... (14:4)."

This verse lucidly indicates that the prophets used the criteria of
simple language carefully to clarify and express the truth. This is due
to the fact that the prophets were cognizant of the precise method of
presentation, the mode of speech, and the insights of the people of
their time. They were also well aware of their people's talents and
feelings. The prophets were familiar with the artistic and literary
feelings of their people and presented their subjects and materials in
customary forms acceptable to the public. Although the principles of the
teachings of the prophets were similar and identical, the method of
their presentation and expression has had considerable differences in
various societies.

This principle existed in the prophets' commissions:

"We are commissioned to speak in accordance with people's thoughts.
Islamic matters, therefore, should be presented in such a way that is
understandable by everyone One must adopt a simple and balanced language
filled with artistic and literary aesthetics to acquire a striking
success in its abundant and immediate influence." \*\*

Based on this principle and in accordance with the Qur'an and the
ahadth (Traditions), our religious leaders wrote simple and condensed
books in a simple language. These books were firm and logical and had a
correct, lucid, and condensed form and technique. They had very well
found out that it is always the quality of presenting the subjects and
the manner of expression, language, and writing that can propagate a
subject in the society, a fact that is very much ignored nowadays.

There are two factors that play an essential and vital role in this
cause and in the real fulfilment of this method. Firstly, full knowledge
and information on the subject matter. Secondly, familiarity with the
principles of writing and the literary and artistic criteria for simple
writing. If the author lacks in either of these two principles, they
will not be able to present useful books to the people. Even if they
make such an attempt, they will not succeed.

Thus to prepare small treatises on important, enlightening and valuable
subjects related to human beings is a great, specialized and difficult
task. He, who writes scientific matters for the public, performs a
greater and more specialized task than one who writes for experts.
Therefore, it should not be assumed that simplicity in writing means
that anyone with little knowledge and artistic talent in writing will be
able to present some treatises; rather this task is more burdensome and
difficult than scientific and technical writings. As mentioned earlier,
to embark On such a task entails two kinds of proficiencies.

In relation to the dissemination of religious culture, particularly
that of Islam, such books are of vital significance. As there is no such
opportunity available to the people of our society to spend many years
to gain knowledge about Islam, such treatises must be written to
adequately orient and familiarize them with Islam. The grandeur, depth,
and vastness of Islamic matters should not hinder people's
understanding. A couplet states:

"If the sea's water cannot entirely be drawn, at least so much to
quench the thirst must be taken".

Consequently, researchers, with expertise and skill in various Islamic
matters, should also have expertise and experience in literary and
artistic techniques and the forms and types of presentation, so that
their material could be understood by the present generation which would
then be familiarized with the Islamic culture.

This book is presented to serve the purpose of such a significant task.
The late 'Allamah Tabataba'i, with his vast and deep knowledge on
Islamic matters, both comprehensively and in relation with one another,
coupled with his experience in presenting relatively simple and general
books, aimed at pursuing such a mission. This book and a few others in
this connection can prove advantageous to everyone and can fulfil the
responsibility of theological centres and Islamic theologians.

**RELIGION**

Religion refers to the beliefs and a series of practical and moral
instructions that the prophets have related on behalf of Allah to guide
and lead human beings. Believing in these tenets and performing these
instructions result in man's prosperity and happiness in this world and
in the world Hereafter. So if we abide by religion and follow the orders
of Allah and the Prophet (SA), we will become prosperous not only in
this short life, but also in the everlasting and endless world
Hereafter.

We are aware that a happy and prosperous person is one who has a true
objective in his life and who does not live in misdeed and aberration.
He possesses a good and praiseworthy demeanour and performs good deeds
and has a confident, strong, and peaceful heart in this turbulent
world.

The religion of Allah directs us towards this happiness and prosperity.
Without religion, there would be no prosperity and bliss. Religious
tenets are like secret police in the heart of man and always accompany
him. They keep man away from moral wickedness and force him to be
virtuous.

Belief is the strongest and most solid refuge in which man never
confronts fear and anguish in the ups and downs of life. The worshippers
of Allah never lose their courage in any circumstances and never feel
disdain and inferior, for they see themselves connected to the infinite
might of the Creator of the world and under all circumstances, they
remember Allah and seek refuge with Allah; they possess a confident,
strong, and peaceful heart.

Religion. commands us to have a praiseworthy behaviour and to perform
good and decent deeds as far as we can.

Therefore, religion is divided into three parts:

(1) Beliefs;
(2) Ethics; and
(3) Commandments.

This brief account should be elaborated to be acceptable to the
honourable readers.


**1. BELIEFS**

If we use our commonsense and conscience, we realize that this world of
existence with its wonderful order could not be created by itself and
this astonishing order of the world of creation could not be achieved
without an organizer. Undoubtedly, there is a Creator Who has created
this vast and magnificent world with His infinite capability and
knowledge and who has established the world of creation with exact order
by the invariable and unchangeable rules that He has set up throughout
the world of existence. Nothing has been created uselessly and
extravagantly. No creature falls outside the purview of the laws of
Allah that govern the world.

Can it be believed. that such a compassionate Allah with all the grace
and blessings that He has toward His creatures would leave man, the
masterpiece creation, on his own? And that He would leave human beings
to man's wisdom which is mostly victim of carnal desires and is, as a
result, faced with aberration and misery? The reply to this question is
self-evident.

Consequently, Allah must send instructions to human beings by
prophets - who are free from any kind of sin and error - to lead men to
happiness and prosperity by following them.

We realize that in this world, the signs and valuable benefits of
adherence to religious principles do not become completely evident.
Neither the righteous are rewarded, nor the criminals and oppressors are
punished for their deeds. From this, we understand that another world
must exist where people's deeds are closely investigated, so that if one
has done a charitable act, he would be rewarded or if he has committed
an indecent deed, he would be castigated. Religion encourages people
with these tenets and other rightful beliefs, which will later be
thoroughly discussed in this book, and warns them of paganism and
ignorance.

**2. ETHICS**

Religion decrees that we adopt praiseworthy qualities in life, have a
good nature, and accomplish ourselves with good and commendable
attributes. We must be conscientious, benevolent, philanthropic, kind,
faithful, good-natured, pleasing to meet, and just. We must defend our
own rights. We must !lot transgress our own limits and rights and should
not encroach upon the property, reputation, and lives of people. In
search of knowledge and civility, we must not spare any effort for
self-sacrifice and self-denial whatsoever. Finally, we must have
equality and moderation in all affairs of life.

**3. COMMANDMENTS**

Religion decrees that we perform acts that are beneficial to ourselves
and to our society during our life and refrain from acts that cause
corruption and immorality. It also teaches us to engage in reciting
salat (prayers), observing sawm (fasting), and performing similar other
duties which are signs of servitude and obedience towards Allah.

These are the laws and instructions the religion offers and invites us
to perform. As it is evident, some of them are doctrinal, others
ethical, and some others practical. As mentioned before, acceptance and
performance of these principles is the only means of happiness and
prosperity, for we are aware that man should be nothing but realistic
and should live with good ethics and praiseworthy deeds.
