Background
==========

The Norman conquest of England in 1066 traditionally signifies the
beginning of 200 years of the domination of French in English letters.
French cultural dominance, moreover, was general in Europe at this time.
French language and culture replaced English in polite court society and
had lasting effects on English culture. But the native tradition
survived, although little 13th-century, and even less 12th-century,
vernacular literature is extant, since most of it was transmitted
orally. Anglo-Saxon fragmented into several dialects and gradually
evolved into Middle English, which, despite an admixture of French, is
unquestionably English. By the mid-14th cent., Middle English had become
the literary as well as the spoken language of England.
