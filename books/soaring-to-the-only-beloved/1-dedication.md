*O Allah, I humbly present this short treatise to our beloved guide,
Imam Ali (\`a)- Imam al-Arifin (the doyen of the saints), whose total
attention to the Only Beloved in prayers was not deterred even by the
removal of an arrow that had pierced his blessed foot.*

Qum al-Muqaddasah

In the close Neighborhood of the ever resplendent lady, Fatima, named by
her brother- Imam Ali al-Rida (\`a), as al-Ma'suma (the infallible one)
may Allah imbue our hearts with intense love for her, and may He
emancipate us by her intercession. *Amin*
