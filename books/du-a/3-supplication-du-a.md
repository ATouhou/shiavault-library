Supplication (Du'a)
===================

Defining Supplication
---------------------

The scholars are well aware of the fact that there are different and
numerous ways to describe and explain an ambiguous issue. Each way is
used in certain conditions to cause man to reach his aims. These ways
are briefly the following:

• Verbatim definition: This is when we use a clearer concept in order to
solve an ambiguity;

• Real definition: When the essence of an object is in question, we
describe the category to which it belongs.

• “Sharhol Esmi” definition: This is when we are asked about the
appearance and effects of some thing, and we provide a person with some
features of that object.

• Definition based on the existence of an item: This time a question is
asked concerning the forms of the object. In this case, we must endeavor
to delve into the forms and quality of the object.

• Definition based on samplers: This time, in order to define an item we
can provide the questions with samplers or examples of the event or
object.

Since old times, the provision of defining supplication has always been
available. Here we offer several definitions for supplication.

Definition Based on Meaning
---------------------------

Ibn Faris in his *Mo'jam Maqaiis al-Logha*, under the title of
supplication, says: “supplication means attracting one's attention by
using words”. [^1]

Raghib has written in the section *Mofradat*: “Supplication is the same
as vocative speech except that in vocative speech we use vocative
articles (Ya or Aya)”.

Qualitative Definition
----------------------

If we take the absolute supplication as a genus and if we consider the
kinds of supplication such as “genesis” supplication, “tongue”
supplication, “heart” supplication, creature's supplication, the
Creator's supplication, people's supplication as *Fasl* or a chapter, we
may adjoin the absolute supplication with one of the above features and
call it supplication.
