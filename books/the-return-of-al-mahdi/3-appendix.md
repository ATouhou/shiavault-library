Hadith No. 23)

Ash-Shaykh Abu Muhammad al-Fadl ibn Shadhan ibn Khalil said:

Narrated to us al-Hasan ibn 'Ali ibn Faddal and ibn Abi Najran, from
Hammad ibn 'Isa, from 'Abdullah ibn Muskan, from Aban ibn Taghlib, from
Sulaym ibn Qays al-Hilali, from Salman al-Farsi, that he said:

The Messenger of Allah (Blessings of Allah be on him and his progeny)
said: "Should not I give you, O People! the good news of al-Mahdi?"

They said: "Certainly."

He said: "Then know that Allah, the High, will raise in my ummah a just
ruler and virtuous Imam (who) will fill the earth with justice and
equity as it would be full of oppression and injustice; and he is the
ninth from the children of my son al-Husayn; his name is my name and his
kunya is my kunya.

"Truly there will be no good in the life after him; and his rule will
continue until forty days before the Qiyamat (Resurrection)."[^1]
