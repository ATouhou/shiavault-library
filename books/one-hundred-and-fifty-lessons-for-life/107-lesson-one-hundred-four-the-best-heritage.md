==========================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
خَيْرُ ما وَرَثَ الآباءُ لِلأَبْناءَ الأَدَبَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The best heritage which fathers leave for their children is courtesy.
[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Courtesy refers to proper behavior in all encounters and relationships
and is associated with respect and honor. Courtesy is concerned with
interactions with fellow human beings as well as with God. In both
cases, courteous behavior is one of the most valuable asset one can
possess…it is the key to success in all fields.

On this account, Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) has described courtesy as the highest
heritage which a father leaves for his child. Courtesy is the source of
affection, sincerity, friendship, and unity and an important factor in
effectiveness of speech and progress in social objectives.
