Mu'awiya Dies
=============

Mu'awiya was getting older day by day. At the age of 75, he became
seriously ill. He was nearing death. He lay weak and lifeless as if
something was choking and strangling him. He felt tortured and
tormented, and continuously cried for mercy. He was in terrible pain. He
wanted to die but death would not come close to him.

His conscience tormented him for the calamities that he brought upon the
Islamic Ummah specially Ahlul Bayt. Mu'awiya suffered in agony for many
many days. His suffering continued until he breathed his last. At the
time of his death, the 30 year old**Yazid** was nowhere near him, he had
gone for fun on a hunting trip.

(Please note that Mu'awiya's brother was by the name of**Yazid** , and
he had named his son after his brother.)
