He was the agent of Imām al-Rida and of Imām Abū Ja'far al-Jawād, peace

ascetic and worshipful. A group of the Wāqifa gave him a lot of money,
but he did not respond to them. He was the bosom friend of 'Abd Allah b.
Jundub and 'Ali b. al-Nu'mān. It is reported that they made a covenant
in the Sacred House of Allah that whoever of them died the rest should
pray, fast, and pay the poor-rate on behalf of him. They died and Safwān
remained living, hence prayed every day one hundred and fifty *ruk'as*,
fasted every year three months, and paid the poor-rate three times. With
the exception of what we have mentioned, he donated on behalf of them as
he donated on behalf of his own soul.

hundred thousand (good deeds) for each (word).' So I hated leaving a

His *kunya* is Abū 'Amrū. He was the shaykh and leading figure of the
Wāqifites. He was one of the agents who were singled out for the
properties of Imām Mūsā b. Ja'far, peace be on him. Nasr b. al-Sabāh
reported: "He (Imām al-Ridā), peace be on him, had money at his ('Uthmān
b. 'Īsā's) hand. He ('Uthmān b. 'Īsa) prevented him (al-Ridā from his
money). As a result al-Ridā was displeased with him."

He (Nasr b. al-Sabāh) added: " He ('Uthmān b. 'Īsa) turned to Allah in
repentance and sent the money to al-Ridā. He narrated on the authority
of Ibn Hamza. He dreamt that he would die at al-Hā'ir al-Husayni, so he
abandoned his house in Kūfa and stayed at al-Hā'ir al-Husayni until he
died and was buried there." He wrote books of which is *Kitāb al-Miyāh*
(the Book of Water).

Ibn Shahr Āshūb numbered him as one of the trustworthy (companions) of
Imām al-Kāzim, peace be on him. Imām al-Khū'i said: "Without doubt,
'Uthmān b. 'Īsa deviated from the True Religion, opposed Imām al-Ridā,
peace be on him, did not recognize his Imāmate, regarded as lawful the
properties of the Imām, peace be on him, and did not pay them to him. As
for his repentance and his returning the properties, it has not been
established, for it is the narration of Nasr b. al-Sabāh, who is
nothing.[[1]](#_ftn1155)"

200. 'Ali Bin Idris
-------------------

He was the companions of Imām al-Ridā, peace be on him. Al-Sadūq has
mentioned him in (his book) *al-Mashyakha*. He narrated on the authority
of Imām al-Ridā, peace be on him, and Mohammed b. Sahl reported on his
authority.[[1]](#_ftn1160)

201. 'Ali Bin Asbāt al-Maqari
-----------------------------

b. Sālim, the seller of *al-Zati*.[[2]](#_ftn1161) His *kunya* is Abū
al-Hasan. He is a trustworthy Kūfan. He was an Aftahi. He exchanged
letters with 'Ali b. Mahzyār concerning that (belief). As a result 'Ali
(b. Asbāt) withdrew from his viewpoint and believed in the Imāmate of
Imām al-Jawād, peace be on him. He was the most trustworthy of the
people and most truthful of them in tradition. *Kitāb al-Dalā'il* (the
Book of Proofs) belongs to him.[[3]](#_ftn1162)

202. 'Ali Bin Ja'far
--------------------

b. Mohammed b. 'Ali b. al-Husayn, peace be on them. His *kunya* is Abū
al-Hasan. He had a great position and reliable faith. He was one of
those who narrated the text for the Imāmate of Imām al-Kāzim, peace be
on him, and was one of his trustworthy companions. The narrators have
reported some signs of his faith and clinging to religion. The following
are some of them:

A. 'Ali b. Ja'far related to us and said: [A man whom I regarded as a
Wāqifite asked me:]

"What about your brother Abū al-Hasan (i.e. Imām Mūsā al-Kāzim, peace be
on him)?"

"He died," I replied.

"How did you know that?" he asked.

"His properties have been divided; his wives have been married, and the
spokesman after him has spoken (i.e. the Imām after him has undertaken
the office of the Imāmate), I answered.

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 [[3]](#_F1162) Al-Najāshi.  
  

  

  

"Who is the spokesman after him?" he asked.

"His son Abū Ja'far," I replied.

"You are an old man, have a great position, and your father is Ja'far b.
Mohammed, so why do you say this statement concerning this young man
(Imām al-Ridā)?" he said.

"I see you nothing except Satan," I said to him, "then I seized my beard
and raised it toward the heaven and said: 'What is my strength if Allah
has seen him more appropriate for this (i.e. the Imāmate) and has not
seen this white hair more entitled to it?"

The Imāmate is in the hand of Allah, the Most Exalted. It is He who
chooses for it one of His righteous servants. As for the priority in age
and other than it, it is not important.

B. Abū 'Abd Allah b. al-Husayn b. Imām Mūsā, peace be on him, reported,
saying: [I was with Imām Abū Ja'far (al-Jawād), peace be on him, in
Medina. There was with him 'Ali b. Ja'far and A Medinan Bedouin. The
Bedouin asked me:]

"Who is that young man, pointing to Imām al-Jawād?"

"He is the testamentary trustee of Allah's Apostle, may Allah bless him
and his family," I replied.

The Bedouin admired that and said: "Glory belongs to Allah! Allah's
Messenger died two hundred years ago, in the year so-and-so. This is a
young man. How will he be the testamentary trustee of Allah's Apostle,
may Allah bless him and his family?"

('Abd Allah b.) al-Husayn explained the matter to him, saying: "This is
the testamentary trustee of 'Ali b. Mūsā; 'Ali is the testamentary
trustee of Mūsā b. Ja'far; Mūsā is the  testamentary trustee of Ja'far
b. Mohammed; Ja'far is the  testamentary trustee of Mohammed b. 'Ali;
Mohammed is the  testamentary trustee of 'Ali b. al-Husayn; 'Ali is the 
testamentary trustee of al-Husayn; al-Husayn is the  testamentary
trustee of al-Hasan; al-Hasan is the  testamentary trustee of the
Commander of the faithful 'Ali b. Abū Tālib; and 'Ali b. Abū Tālib is
the  testamentary trustee of Allah's Messenger, may Allah bless him and
his family."

Accordingly, the Bedouin understood that Imām al-Jawād, peace be on him,
was the  testamentary trustee of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
his family.

  

  

  

The Imām had sent for a doctor in order to bleed him, so 'Ali b. Ja'far
stood up and said to him: "Master, let the doctor start with me, that
the sharp iron may cut me before you!"

 ('Abd Allah b.) al-Husayn addressed the Bedouin, saying: "This is the
uncle of his father."

When the doctor had finished the operation, the Imām intended to go out,
but 'Ali b. Ja'far hurried to prepare his sandals, that he may wear
them."

This is evidence for 'Ali b. Ja'far's deep faith in the Imām, his
knowledge of him and of his position with Allah, the Exalted.

C. Mohammed b. al-Hasan b. 'Ammār reported, saying: "I stayed with 'Ali
b. Ja'far in Medina for two years. I wrote on his authority what he had
heard from his brother (i.e. Abū al-Hasan, peace be on him). (One day)
while I was sitting with him, Abū Ja'far Mohammed b. 'Ali al-Ridā, peace
be on him, entered the mosque of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
his family. 'Ali b. Ja'far hurried bare-footed and without a cloak to
kiss his hand and to magnify him, so the Imām said to him: "Uncle, sit
down, may Allah have mercy on you."

'Ali answered him politely and humbly: "Master, how shall I sit while
you are standing?

When 'Ali b. Ja'far returned to his session, his companions scolded him
for his magnifying the Imām, saying: "You are the uncle of his father,
so why did you behave in such a manner?"

They did not understand the reality of the Imāmate, and that Allah, the
Exalted, gave it to Imām al-Jawād. As result 'Ali answered them and
said: "Keep silent! If Allah, the Great and Almighty, has not entitled
this white hair (i.e. his beard) (to the Imāmate) and entitled this
young man (to it) and placed him where He has placed him, then how can I
deny his outstanding merit? I seek refuge in Allah from what you have
said; rather I am his servant.[[1]](#_ftn1163)"

203. 'Ali Bin Hadid
-------------------

b. Hakim al-Madā'ini, al-Azdi, al-Sābāti. Shaykh al-Tūsi numbered him as
one of the companions of Imām al-Ridā, peace be on him.[[1]](#_ftn1164)
Al-Barqi regarded him as one of the companions of Imām al-Ridā and
al-Jawād, peace be on them. Al-Kashi reported on the authority of Abū
'Ali b. Rāshid, on the authority of  Abū Ja'far, peace be on him, that
Abū 'Ali said to the Imām: "May I be your ransom, our companions have
differed in opinion, so shall I pray behind the followers of Hishām b.
al-Hakam?" "Cling to 'Ali b. Haddid," replied the Imām, peace be on him.
"Shall I follow his opinion?" I (i.e. 'Ali b. Haddid) asked him. "Yes,"
he answered. I met 'Ali b. Haddid and asked him: "Shall I pray behind
the followers of Hishām b. al-Hakam?" "No," he replied.

This narration, if correct, is evidence for that the man (i.e. 'Ali b.
Haddid) is trustworthy and praiseworthy.  

204. 'Ali Bin al-Husayn
-----------------------

b. Rubāt al-Bujayli al-Kūfi. He is trustworthy and reliable. He was one
of the companions of Imām al-Ridā, peace be on him. He has a
book.[[2]](#_ftn1165)

-------------------------------------------

Shaykh al-Tūsi numbered him as one of the companions of Imām al-Ridā,
peace be on him, and added that he was trustworthy.[[2]](#_ftn1169)
Al-Kashi narrated that 'Ali b. Swayd wrote a letter to Imām al-Kāzim
when he was in prison,  and that he asked him about his state and the
answers to some questions. The Imām answered him in a letter in which he
mentioned:  "In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Praise belongs to Allah, the Exalted and Almighty, Who through whose
mightiness and light makes the hearts of the believers see, through
whose mightiness and light the ignorant show enmity toward Him, and
through whose mightiness nearness to Him is sought with different deeds
and various religions, hence (men) are: right and wrong, errant and
rightly-guided, hearing and deaf, seeing and blind, and perplexed. So
praise belongs to Allah who made known and described His religion
through Mohammed, may Allah bless him and his family. Now then, you are
the man whom Allah has endowed with special position with the family of
Mohammed, may Allah bless him and his family, showing affection toward
you when He inspired you with your reason, made you perceive the affairs
of your religion through their outstanding qualities, made you refer to
them regarding your affairs, and made you content with what they said."

In another part of this letter, the Imām has mentioned: "Summon to the
path of your Lord through us him whose response you expect. You do not
encompass what we do. Show friendship toward Mohammed's Household. If
something reaches you from us and is attributed to us, do not say: 'This
is false', even though you know something other than it, for you do not
know why we have said it and in which point we have described it. Belive
in what I have told you and do not reveal what I have asked you to
conceal. I want to tell you that the most obligatory right of your
brother against you is that you should not hide from him what benefits
him in this world and the next.[[3]](#_ftn1170)"

position of 'Ali (b. Swayd) and his great rank with the Imām, peace be
on him.

--------------------------

b. al-Husayn b. 'Ali b. al-Husayn, peace be on him. His *kunya* Abū
al-Hasan. He was the most ascetic of the family of Abū Tālib and the
most worshipful of them in his time. He devoted himself to Imām Mūsā
(al-Kāzim) and Imām al-Ridā, peace be on him. He mixed with the Imāmi
(Shi'ites). When Mohammed b. Ibrāhim b. Tabātabā wanted Abū al-Sarāyā to
pledge allegiance to him after him, he refused that and entrusted the
matter to Mohammed b. Mohammed b. Yazid. He has a book on the hajj. He
narrated the whole book on the authority of Imām Mūsā b. Ja'far, peace
be on him.

Al-Kashi narrated, saying: [In the book of Mohammed b. al-Husayn b.
Bandār, in his own handwriting, I have read:] "Mohammed b. Yahyā

authority of Sulaymān b. Ja'far, who said: 'Ali b. 'Ubayd Allah b.
al-Husayn b. 'Ali b. al-Husayn b. 'Ali b. Abū Tālib, peace be on him,
said to me: 'I (i.e. 'Ali Bin 'Ubayd Allah) would like to go in to Abū
al-Hasan al-Ridā in order to greet him.' I (i.e. Sulaymān b. Ja'far)
asked him: 'What has prevented you from that?' 'Because I magnify and
respect him and fear for him.'"

He (Sulaymān b. Ja'far) said: "Abū al-Hasan (al-Ridā), peace be on him,
became slightly sick, and the people visited him. I met 'Ali b. 'Ubayd
Allah and said to him: 'What you want has come to you; Abū al-Hasan,
peace be on him, has fallen slightly ill, and the people visited him. If
you want to visit him, then come today.'"

 He (Sulaymān b. Ja'far) said: " He came to Abū al-Hasan (al-Ridā),
peace be on him, in order to visit him. Abū al-Hasan received him with
honor and magnification, so 'Ali b. 'Ubayd Allah was very pleased with
that. Then 'Ali b. 'Ubayd Allah became ill, hence Abū al-Hasan
(al-Ridā), peace be on him, visited him. I was with him. He sat until
those who were in the house went out. When we went out, a female slave
of mine told me that Umm Salām, 'Ali b. 'Ubayd Allah's wife, was behind
the curtain and looking at him (al-Ridā). When Abū al-Hasan, peace be on
him,  went out, she went out, stooped to the place in which he sat,
kissed it and rubbed (her face) with it."

Sulaymān (b. Ja'far) said: "Then I went in to 'Ali b. 'Ubayd Allah and
he told about what Umm Salama had done. I told Abū al-Hasan (al-Ridā),
peace be on him, (about that), and he said: 'Sulaymān, 'Ali b. 'Ubayd
Allah, his wife, and his children are of the people of the Garden.
Sulaymān, the children of 'Ali and Fātima are not like the rest of the
people because Allah has singled them out for this matter (i.e. the
Imāmate).[[1]](#_ftn1174)'"

213. 'Ali Bin 'Ali Bin Razin al-Khazā'i
---------------------------------------

He was Di'bil's brother. He has a big book on Imām al-Ridā, peace be on
him. Ismā'il narrated on the authority of his father 'Ali, saying: [My
father related to me in the year 272 A. H., saying:] "Abū al-Hasan
al-Ridā, peace be on him, reported to us at Tūs in the year 198 A. H. We
headed for him via Basrah. When we entered Basrah, we found wherein 'Abd
al-Rahmān b. al-Mahdi ill, hence we stayed for some days. Then 'Abd
al-Rahmān died, and we attended his funeral and prayed over him. My
brother Di'bil and I went in to al-Ridā, peace be on him, and stayed
with him to the end of the year 200 A. H. Then we went out to Qum. That
was after al-Ridā had given my brother Di'bil a green, silk shirt, a
ring whose stone was agate, and Radawi dirhams. Then he said to him:
'Di'bil, pass through Qum, for you will make use of it.' And he said to
him: 'Keep this shirt, for I wore it and prayed one thousand *ruk'as* in
one thousand nights and completed reading the Qur'ān one thousand
times.'"

Ismā'il said: "My father was born in the year 172 A. H. He died in the
year 283 A. H. So his age was then 111 years. My uncle Di'bil was born
in the year 148 A. H. That was during the caliphate of al-Mansūr. He saw
Imām Mūsā (al-Kāzim), peace be on him, and met Imām al-Ridā, peace be on

216. 'Ali Bin Mahzyār al-Ahwāzi

His *kunya* was Abū al-Hasan. He was originally from Dawraq. He was one
of the leading scholars and among the great jurists. He narrated on the
authority of Imām al-Ridā, peace be on him, and Imām Abū Ja'far
al-Jawād, peace be on him. He devoted himself to him (Abū Ja'far
al-Jawād) and was his agent. He also devoted himself to Imām al-Hādi,
peace be on him, and was his agent. He was among the pious, worshipful
people. The narrators said: "When the sun rose, he prostrated himself in
prayer and did not raise his head until he prayed for a thousand of his
brothers. There was a callus in his forehead like that of the camel."

### Imām al-Jawād's Letter to him

Imām Abū Ja'far al-Jawād sent him several letters in which he praised,
admired, and respected him. The following are some of them:

A. Imām al-Jawād sent him this letter: "In the name of Allah, the Most
Gracious, the Most Merciful. 'Ali, may Allah reward you well, make you
live in the Garden, protect you from disgrace in this world and the
next, and muster you with us! 'Ali, I tried and tested you in advice,
obedience, service, respect, and carrying out your religious duties. I
hope that I am truthful (when I say that) I have seen none like you. May
Allah reward you the gardens of Paradise! It is not hidden from me that
you worked and served during cold and heat, day and night. I ask Allah
to endow you with mercy with which you are pleased when he will muster
the creatures on the Resurrection Day! Verily, He hears
supplication![[3]](#_ftn1180)"

In this letter the Imām lauded and praised the position of this
righteous scholar, who was at the top of reverential fear,

righteousness, and showing friendship toward the Imāms of guidance,
peace be on them.

B. This is one of the letters which the Imām sent to him: "In the name
of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. I ask Allah to protect
you from before you and behind you and in all your states! Be delighted,
for I hope that Allah will drive away (evil) from you! I ask Allah to
place good in your departure which you will carry out on Sunday! Delay
that to Monday, Allah willing! May Allah accompany you throughout your
travel, replace you among your family, pay your trust on your behalf,
and save you by His power![[1]](#_ftn1181)"

C. Imām al-Jawād, peace be on him, also sent him this letter: "In the
name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. I have received
your letter and understood what you have mentioned in it. Your letter
have pleased me, may Allah please you! I hope that (Allah) the
All-sufficient, the Repeller, will spare you the trickery of every
schemer, Allah, the Exalted, willing![[2]](#_ftn1182)"

These are some of the letters which Imām al-Jawād, peace be on him, sent
to him. The letters indicate 'Ali b. Mahzyār's exalted position and
great importance with the Imām, peace be on him.

on him, replied: "The people of al-Hijāz has an opinion of it, and it is

Exalted, say: *and when they pass by what is vain, they pass by
nobly*.[[1]](#_ftn1205)"

235. Mohammed Bin Abū 'Umayr al-Azdi
------------------------------------

His *kunya* was Abū Ahmed. He was one of the retainers of al-Muhallab b.
Abū Safra. He was originally from Baghdad and lived in it. He met Imām
Abū al-Hasan Mūsā, peace be on him, and heard from him some traditions
in some of which the Imām gave him the *kunya* of Abū Ahmed. He narrated
on the authority of Imām al-Ridā, peace be on him. He was of great
importance and had an exalted position with the Shi'ites and the Sunnis.
Al-Jāhiz has mentioned him in his book *al-Bayān wa al-Tabbin*, saying:
"He was one of the prominent Rafidites (i.e. the Shi'ites)." He was
imprisoned during the days of (Hārūn) al-Rashid. It was said that he
(was imprisoned because he refused) to undertake the judiciary or to
show (the authorities) the places of the Shi'ites and the followers of
Imām Mūsā b. Ja'far, peace be on him.[[2]](#_ftn1206) Al-Kashi narrated
on the authority of al-Fadl b. Shādhān, who said: "I entered Iraq and
saw someone admonish his friend, saying: 'You have a family and they are
in need of your earning. I think that you will be blind because of your
long prostration in prayer.' When he said this (statement) many times,
he said to him: 'Woe unto you! You have said that several times! If
someone became blind out of prostration, then Ibn Abū 'Umayr would be
blind. What is your view of a man who prostrated after the dawn prayer
and did not raise his head until the sun came near to descending (from
its midday zenith)?'"

Al-Fadl said: "One day my father (shaykh) took me hand and took me to
Ibn Abū 'Umayr. We went to him in a room. There were shaykhs around him,
and they magnified and honored him, so I (al-Fadl) asked: 'Who is that
(man)?' 'That is Ibn Abū 'Umayr,' replied me father. 'Is he the
righteous, worshipful man?' I asked. 'Yes,' he replied."

Al-Fadl narrated, saying: "Hārūn (al-Rashid) ordered Ibn Abū 'Umayr to
be whipped one hundred and twenty times. It was al-Sindi b. Shāhik who
whipped him and imprisoned him, for he was a Shi'ite. Ibn Abū 'Umayr
gave (al-Sindi) one hundred and twenty thousand dirhams, and he released
him. 'Was he rich?' I asked. 'Yes,' he answered, 'perhaps he gave him
five hundred thousand dirhams.[[1]](#_ftn1207)'"

Mohammed b. Abū 'Umayr wrote many books. Ibn Batta mentioned that he
compiled ninety-four books of which are the following:

A. Kitāb al-Nawādir (the Book of  Miscellaneous

Traditions). It is a big, good book.

B. Kitāb al-Istitā'a wa al-Af'āl wa al-Radd 'alā Ahl al-

Qadar wa al-Jabr (the Book of Capability, Actions, and

Answers to the Fatalists).

C. Kitāb al-Imāma (the Book of the Imāmate).

D. Kitāb al-Bidā' (the Book of Change in an Earlier

Divine Ruling).

E. Kitāb al-Mutt'a (the Book of Fixed-Term Marriage).

F. Musā'ala lil-Imām al-Ridā (the Book of Questions by

Imām al-Ridā).[[2]](#_ftn1208)

May Allah have mercy on Mohammed b. Abū 'Umayr, for he was among the
leading Shi'ites and defended them.

Mohammed b. Ishāq) asked Abū al-Hasan, the first: 'Do you not lead me to
him from whom I will learn my religion?' 'This is me son 'Ali, he
replied, 'my father took me by the hand and made me enter the grave of
Allah's Apostle, may Allah bless him and his family, and said: 'My
little son, Allah, the Great and Almighty, fulfills his
words.[[2]](#_ftn1211) '"

Al-Shaykh al-Mufid regarded Mohammed b. Ishāq as one of the close
companions of Imām al-Kāzim, peace be on him, among his trustworthy

jurisprudence.[[3]](#_ftn1212)

238. Mohammed Bin Ishāq
-----------------------

Shaykh al-Tūsi regarded him as one of the companions of Imām al-Ridā,
peace be on him.[[4]](#_ftn1213) Al-Kashi reported on the authority of
Yazid b. Ishāq (Mohammed Bin Ishāq's brother), the most exalted of the
people in this matter, who said: "One time, my brother Mohammed disputed
with me, and he was believing. When the speech between him and me took a
long time, I said to him: 'If you leader *(sāhib)* is in such a position
about which you talk, then let him pray to Allah for me, that I may
return to your creed.'"

He (Yazid b. Ishāq) said: [Mohammed said to me:] "So I went in to
al-Ridā, peace be on him, and said to him: 'May I be your ransom, I have
a brother younger than me and he says: 'By your father's life.' I often
debates with him, so he said to me one day: 'If your leader is in such a
position which you have mentioned, then ask him to supplicate

to Allah for me, that I may follow your creed.' I would like you to pray
to Allah for him.'"

He (Mohammed b. Ishāq) said: "Abū al-Hasan (al-Ridā), peace be on him,
turned toward the *qibla* and mentioned what Allah willed him to
mention, and then he said: 'Take his hearing, his seeing, and the whole
his heart until You return him to the True Religion.' He said that while
he was raising his right hand."

He (Yazid b. Ishāq) said: "When he (Mohammed) returned, he told me about
what had happened. By Allah, shortly after that, I believed in the True
Religion.[[1]](#_ftn1214)"
