Responsibility 10: Written Propagation of the Imam
==================================================

Another responsibility is to recite poetry, write books or other such
things in which the merits and virtues of the Imam are mentioned. Such
writings should also contain praise and admiration of the Imam and words
of consolation, solace and lamentation for him (since he is in the major
occultation).

Of course, this should be carried out according to one’s ability and
indeed, this is one way in which we can help the religion and our Imam.
The pure A\`immah (as) used to recommend their followers to extol the
virtues of the Ahlul Bayt (as) through their words and deeds and there
are many traditions in this regard.

For example, Imam ‘Ali b. Musa al-Ridha (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا قَالَ فِينَا مُؤْمِنٌ شِعْراً يَمْدَحُنَا بِهِ إِلاَّ بَنـى
اللٌّهُ لَهُ مَدِينَةً فِي الْجَنَّةِ أَوْسَعَ مِنَ الدُّنْـيَا سَبْعَ
مَرَّاتٍ يَزُورُهُ فِيهَا كُلُّ مَلَكٍ مُقَرَّبٍ وَ كُلُّ نَبِيٍّ
مُرْسَلٍ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“There is not a single believer who recites a poem in our (the Ahlul
Bayt’s) praise except that Allah builds for him a city in Paradise whose
expanse is more than the world seven times over and wherein all the
closest Angels (to Allah) and every appointed Messenger will come to
visit him.”[^1]
