Though the imperative structure is inherently addressed to a second
person, it can also be expressed indirectly. In this case you should
have in mind either (a) first person or (b) third person. You can form
that by prefixing the particles (**لـِ** **)** or (**فـَلـ** **)** to
the Jussive Mood verb.

(a)**لِنأکـُلْ في هذا المَطعَم ِ.**

Let us eat at this restaurant!

(b)**إلی بُيوتِهـِم.**  **فـَليذهبوا**

Let them (m) go to their homes!
