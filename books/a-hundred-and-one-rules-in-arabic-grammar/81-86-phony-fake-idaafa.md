86. Phony/Fake Idaafa.
======================

You might have noticed that the noun which follows the adjective that is
in the superlative form structure is in the genitive case.

<p dir="rtl">
**بَيتي أصغرُ بَيتٍ في القريَةِ.**
</p>

The reason is that this combination creates the Syntactical Environment
for Idaafa. Because the components of this structure are not limited to
the usual nouns (the first term is in fact an adjective) Arab
Grammarians tend to call this Phony/Fake Idaafa.
