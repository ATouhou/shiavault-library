89. The *mīmī* infinitive is that which does not have any meaning other
than that of the non- *mīmī* infinitive. It is formed from all verbs by
adding a *mīm*.

90. The *mīmī* infinitive is formed from triliteral verbs in the form
**مَفعَل,** for example: **مَنظَر.** The exceptions to this are
quasi-sound verbs whose first root letter is erased in the aorist tense,
these will be in the form **مَفعِل,** for example: **مَوعِد.** The
*mīmī* infinitive is formed from verbs with more than three letters by
placing them in the passive voice of the aorist tense and replacing the
aorist letter with a *mīm* which has a *dummah*, for example:
**مُکرَم.**

91. A quasi-infinitive noun is a word which indicates the meaning of an
infinitive and takes a letter away from the verb either literally or
implicitly, for example**:اعطاء** the noun of**الإعطاء** .
