Conclusions &future work
========================

From the results we can conclude that the SVM has better performance in
both time and accuracy. This project could be the base for many other
future work, Other students can use this model to check the effect of
the feature ratio on the performance by studying its effect on both time
and accuracy. It is also beneficial to compare different selection
parameters such as chi2 or information gain to find whether changing the
selection parameter affects and how this effect can be used to enhance
the classifier performance.In addition, deep study of each algorithm can
be conducted by changing its parameters. i.e. in this project we use K=1
for the KNN, so other students can study the effect of increasing this
parameter on the classifier performance.
