Respecting the Righteous Companions
===================================

The Shia devote a great respect for some of the companions of the
Prophet (PBUH&HF) who closely followed Prophet and the Ahlul-Bayt before
and after death of Prophet (PBUH&HF). Among these great companions, are
the following individuals:


**Abu Dhar al-Ghifari**

The Holy Prophet said concerning Abu Dhar al-Ghifari that "Heaven has
not shaded, nor has the earth carried a person more straight forward
than Abu Dhar. He walks on earth with the immaterialistic attitude of
Jesus, the son of Mary."

**Ammar Ibn Yasir**

The Holy Prophet had told Ammar Ibn Yasir along with his parents
that:

"Family of Yasir, be patient, for your destination is paradise," Sunni
Reference: Sahih al-Tirmidhi, v5, p233,

The Holy Prophet also told him that "Ammar be cheerful, the aggressor
party shall kill you."

- Sahih Muslim, English version, v4, chapter MCCV, Traditions \#6968&
\#6970

The English translator of Sahih Muslim (Abdul Hamid Siddiqui) has
written in the footnote of the above traditions that:

This narration is clearly indicative of the fact that in the conflict
between Hadrat Ali and his opponents, Hadrat Ali was on the right as
Ammar Ibn Yasir was killed in the Battle of Siffin fighting in the camp
of Hadrat Ali. (Footnote of Sahih Muslim, English version, v4, p1508).

**al-Miqdad Ibn al-Aswad**

He is among the four men whom the Prophet (PBUH&HF) was commanded to
love, as the Prophet said:

"God commanded me to love four, and He informed me that he loves them.
People asked him: Messenger of God who are they? He said: Ali is from
them ( repeating that three times ). And Abu Tharr and Salman and al-
Miqdad."

Sunni reference: Sunan ibn Majah, v1 p53 Hadith 149

The Messenger of Allah also said:

"Every prophet was given by God seven righteous companions. I was given
fourteen righteous companions". He included in them Ali, al- Hasan,
al-Husain, Hamza, Ja'far, Ammar Ibn Yasir, Abu Dhar, Miqdad, and
Salman.
