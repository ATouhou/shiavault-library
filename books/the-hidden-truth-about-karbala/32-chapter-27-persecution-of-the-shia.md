Chapter 27: Persecution of the Shia
===================================

**This Chapter is dedicated to those Martyrs whose names are lost in
History due to the enormity of their numbers.**

**NOTE**: Part ‘A’ of this chapter deals with the construction of the
shrine and the frequent demolition made by the Umayyads and other
rulers. Part ‘B’ and ‘C’ deal with the persecution of the Shia. The
material of Part ‘A’ is collected primarily from the Urdu translation of
a well-researched book in Arabic under the title ‘Tarikh Karbala
al-Mu’alla wa Ha’ir al-Husayn’ written by Dr. Abdul Jawad Kalidar of
Iraq. The book was translated into Urdu by Muhammad Baqir Naqvi, the
editor of Islah, Khajwa, Bihar.

The material of Part ‘B’ is collected mainly from a book under the title
*‘Masa’ibush Shia’* written by Moulana al-Haj Sadat Husayn Sahib,
printed at Sarfaraz Qaumi Press, Liknow, U.P., in six volumes of about
200 pages each, in the year 1966. Its second edition was brought out in
three volumes. I have followed both editions of this book.
