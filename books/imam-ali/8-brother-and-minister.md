Brother and Minister
====================

( 61 )

5.During the first three years of the Prophethood the Prophet did not
call people publicly to the new faith. The message remained an
unannounced conversation for its announcement would necessarily lead to
a confrontation with the clans of Mecca. The Prophet knew that the
Meccan clans and the Masses of Arabia would not hesitate to use any
violent means against him if he demanded from them to change their
religion.

Yet this confrontation was inevitable and expected to be fraught with
danger. The message was not revealed in order to be kept secret. It came
down to reform mankind and to change the beliefs of the people and the
ways of their lives. This could not be realized except by calling to
them loudly warning them openly and informing them about the message.

For a new religious message or a new ideology to succeed the man of the
message and his followers have to have freedom of speech and practice.
Average individuals do not have the courage to empace a new ideology
when its empacement causes them to confront a society that does not
sanctify the individual's freedom. Such a society by its nature is
inclined to violence and there are not many individuals who are ready to
suffer the loss of position wealth and life for ideals. Just to make the
spread of the new ideology feasible in such a society the freedom of
speech and practice must be protected and secured for the potential
converts. Otherwise they would be too terrified to change their
religion. This means that the new

ideology will have only a limited success if any. Only the heroes of an
unusual courage would rise above fear and these are not many.

As to the man of the message the chance of his success is very slim
when his life and relative freedom are not protected though he may be a
big hero. His rise above fear does not secure success in a violent
society. His death by assassination or other means before establishing
his religion will ping his whole mission to an end.

Thus the first requirement for the success of a new religion in a
non-democratic society is a protective shield around the life of the man
of the message and his relative freedom. He needs strong supporters who
will be ready to give their lives for protecting their leader and his
message.

If such people are not available it would be necessary to have at least
one supporter of an unusual quality who is similar to the Messenger in
sincerity courage and strength.

Such a person would be expected to be found among the relatives of the
man of the message since the relatives are expected to be more
sympathetic to him than others.

The Holy Qur'an informs us that when Moses received the Command of God:
"Go to Pharaoh certainly he has exceeded the limit " he asked his Lord
to strengthen him through a minister from his own family! "He (Moses)
said: O my Lord expand my peast.

Ease my task for me and remove the impediment from my speech. So they
may understand what I say. And give me a minister from my family Aaron
my pother.

Add to my strength through him and make him share my task." ( 1)

Mohammad is the final of the prophets. His message is the conclusion of
all heavenly messages. His message therefore must succeed and stay
forever.

God runs the affairs of the world usually according to the law of cause
and effect and through natural courses.

Therefore He did not order His Messenger Mohammad to

( 1 ) Chapter 20 verses 25-32.

face the whole society at once with the invitation to Islam because
this might lead to the failure of the mission rather than to its
success. Wanting him to go gradually in his invitation He issued to him
a command (after three years from the beginning of his Prophethood) to
begin with his close relatives. From the Holy Qur'an: "And warn thy
nearest kinsmen. And lower thy wing to the believers who follow thee." (
2 )

When this command came down the Messenger of God invited the
descendents of Abdul-Muttalib (they were forty men) to a banquet which
contained little amounts of food and milk. They ate and drank until they
became full.

Then the Messenger spoke saying: "O children of Abdul-Muttalib by God I
do not know any young man from among the Arabs who has ever pought to
his people better than I pought to you. I pought to you the goodness of
this world and of the Hereafter and God has commanded me to invite you
to it. Who is among you willing to be my minister in this mission and he
will be my pother my executor and my successor in you?"

None of them responded but Ali who was the youngest among them. He
stood up and said: "Messenger of God I will be your minister in this
mission."

The Prophet repeated his invitation but none responded except Ali who
repeated his words. The Prophet put his hand on the neck of Ali and
said:

"This is my pother my executor and my successor in you. Listen to him
and obey him."

They laughed saying to Abu Talib: "He ordered you to listen to your son
and to obey him."( 3 ) Thus the Messenger

Al-Atheer Al Kamil Part 2 p. 22.

of God inivited his close relatives to empace Islam but his main
purpose was to find among them a person who would assist him in
spreading the message.

Empacing Islam is very important but more important is to find among
the converts a person who will be willing to pay a high price for its
success. And how many millions of Muslims of today are unwilling to pay
the least for Islam!

**CONFLICTING HADITHS**

The two sheikhs: Al-Bukhari and Muslim did not mention this important
event though it was reported by many historians and hadith-recorders.
Muslim and other hadith-recorders reported an event that took place
after this event.

They reported the appearance of the Messenger on Al-Safa and his call
to the Qureshite clans (the Meccans) and his invitation to them to
believe in the new faith. Muslim and these reporters mentioned this late
event and tied it with the verse of the warning of the closest relative
of the Holy Prophet. Muslim recorded that Abu Huriarah reported the
following: When this verse was revealed: "And warn thy closest relatives
" the Messenger of God called the Qureshites and they came together. He
addressed them in general and in particular. He said: "O children of
Kaab Ibn Lu-ay save yourselves from Hell. O children of Murrah Ibn Kaab
save yourselves from Hell. O children of Hashim save yourselves from
Hell. O Fatima save yourself from Hell.

For I do not possess any protection for you from God except that you
have relations to me which I would like to observe." ( 4)

It is amazing that God commanded His Messenger to

( 4 ) Muslim Sahih Muslim Part 3 pp. 79-80.

warn the closest of his relatives who were the children of
Abdul-Muttalib but the Prophet called upon the children of Kaab Ibn
Lu-ay and the children of Murrah Ibn Kaab who are from the remotest of
his relatives. It is inconceivable that the Messenger of God disobeys
what his Lord commanded him to do .

And what is more amazing is that the messenger called upon his daughter
(Fatima) publicly to save herself from Hell yet she was the purest
Muslim girl whose father and mother were the purest parents .

Fatima at the time of the revelation of the above verse was according
to the historians either two years or eight years old. ( 5 ) It would be
illogical that the Prophet addresses himself to a two year old child or
that he put a pure Muslim girl (who was still a minor not exceeding
eight years of age) on the same level with the pagans of Banu Kaab and
Banu Murrah.

And more curious is the hadith of Ayeshah which Muslim recorded in his
Sahih as follows: "When the verse of warning was revealed the Messenger
of God said: 'O Fatima daughter of Mohammad Safia daughter of
Abdul-Muttalib I have nothing in my power to protect you against God.
Ask me from my wealth whatever you want.' " ( 6 )

This hadith does not agree with the previous one. For this hadith
reported that the Holy Prophet addressed himself to the children of
Abdul-Muttalib alone while the other hadith reported that the Holy
Prophet publicly addressed himself mostly to other than the Prophet's
clan And most curious in this hadith is that the Messenger addressed
himself publicly while on the Safa mainly to his youngest daughter
Fatima while she was living with him where he sees her every hour. It is
also curious that the address which he directed to her and to the other
members of the children of Abdul-Muttalib did not contain any

( 5 ) Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak Part 3 p. 61 reported that she was born
41 years after the birth of her father .
( 6 ) Muslim in his Sahih Part 3 pp. 79-80.

message such as calling upon them to worship God or to avoid
idol-worshipping .

Furthermore Ayeshah was not born at the time of the event. The
Messenger died when she was still eighteen years old.( 7 ) And this
event took place ten years before the Hijrah (twenty years before his
death). Abu Hurairah also was not an eye-witness to the event because he
saw the Messenger for the first time when the Messenger was coming back
from Khaibar. (In the 7th year after the Hijrah).( 8 )

And more curious than all is that Al-Zamkh-Shari reported that Ayeshah
daughter of Abu Bakr and Hafsa daughter of Omar were among the ones whom
the Holy Prophet addressed after the revelation of this verse of warning
(which was revealed before the birth of Ayeshah) . ( 9 ) This clearly
indicates that recorders or the reporters of these hadiths were
seriously confused. They overlooked the fact that the verse commands the
Prophet to warn his closest relatives who were the children of
Abdul-Muttalib and that the Holy Prophet is not expected to disobey the
order of God. What these hadiths reported is opposed to the verse itself
and whatever disagrees with the Holy Qur'an has to be disregarded.

The event which the historians and many hadith re-corders reported of
holding a conference with his immediate relatives is the only logical
course which the Holy Prophet was expected to follow after the
revelation of the verse.

**THE OFFERED REWARD**

The Prophet was about to come to a confrontation with the
idol-worshipers. Therefore he needed a minister who had his courage
sincerity and firmness. Forty men from

( 7 ) Ibn Saad Al-Tabaqat Part 8 p. 61.
( 8 ) Al-Tabaqat Part 4 p. 327.
( 9 ) Ali Ibn Burhanuddeen Al-Halabi Al-Seerat Al-Halayah (Bio- graphy
of the Prophet) Part 1 p. 321.

the children of Abdul-Muttalib would be an important asset for Islam if
they adopted it. But if they were ordinary people they would not be able
to face the masses of Mecca and Arabia.

God will soon command His Messenger to extend his invitation to all of
the Arabs then to other nations as well and they will violently resist
the invitation for years to come.

Forty average persons will be terrified by the hostiles of Mecca and
Arabia; yet one man of high courage will be able to face whatever the
Messenger will face.

For this the Prophet spoke to them about this important goal after a
very short introduction saying:

"Who is among you willing to be my minister in this mission? (Whoever
is willing to be so) will be my pother executor and successor."

How Could the Prophet Make Such a Promise? Suppose all or most of them
had accepted Islam at the meeting and promised him their assistance.
What could he do? It may be conceivable that all of them would become
his pothers but it is very hard to conceive that all of them would be
his executors. And if this is probable it is not conceivable that
everyone of them would be his successor.

With a little analysis one may know the answer .

The Messenger was well aware that the majority of them would not have
the courage to pledge to him a genuine support of Islam. For such a
pledge would put them face to face with the whole society and draw them
into a war which might end with the loss of their lives. A true
assistant of the Messenger must be an unusual person and the majority of
the attendants were just average people .

What happened at the meeting clearly substantiates the truth of what
the Prophet expected. None of them was willing nor had the daring spirit
to pledge to him assistance except one person and the following years
proved that he was the man for the job .

Why These Specific Rewards? The Prophet evidently wanted to follow the
footsteps of Moses. Moses asked his Lord to give him a minister from his
own family and here the Prophet Mohammad gathered his close relatives
seeking from among them a minister. The minister of Moses was his pother
Aaron .

The Prophet Mohammad did not have a pother because he was the only
child of his parents Abdullah and Aminah.

To follow the course of Moses he wanted to make his minister also his
pother.

The same applies to the position of successor. Aaron was the successor
of Moses among his people when Moses went to the mountain to hear the
words of his Lord and secluded himself for forty nights. Before going to
the mountain he said to Aaron according to the Holy Qur'an: "Be my
successor among my people and do good and follow not the path of
mischief makers." ( 10 )

What the Prophet said to Ali many years after this event supports this
understanding and confirms its soundness. Leaving him in Medina when he
took his long journey to Tabouk he said to him:

"Ali will it not satisfy you to be to me like Aaron to Moses except
that there will be no prophet after me?" ( 11)

Giving Ali all the ranks of Aaron with the exception of the Prophethood
means that Ali was like Aaron in the rest of the ranks: The ministry the
potherhood and the succession. The statement of the Prophet at the above
mentioned conference and this statement are consistent with each other
and they aim at one purpose .

**Why Such a Big Reward for a Ministry?**

It may be said: Why should the Holy Prophet give Ali

( 10 ) Chapter 7 verse 142.
( 11 ) Muslim in his Sahih Part 15 p. 175; Al-Bukhari reported it in
his Sahih Part 5.

such a big reward for his ministry? Is not the rank of assistant (or
minister) to the Prophet a high reward by itself? The answer is that the
ministry of Ali is not a reward from the Prophet as much as it is a gift
from Ali. This ministry or assistance is a tremendous sacrifice on the
part of the minister. To make this clear I would like to say that there
are two types of ministry:

1. A Ministry of Administrating the Affairs of an established state.
The man of such a ministry is a counselor to the head of the state by
authorization from his superior or from the congress or from the
people.

2. A Ministry of Founding and Establishing a State.

The minister here would be the assistant of his superior in pinging
into being a state which did not exist yet or in spreading a new faith
which is not yet known to the people. The mission of a minister of this
kind is to carry with his superior the tremendous responsibility of
establishing a faith and a state and to face with him all dangers. He
would be his protective shield constantly ready to sacrifice himself for
the safety of his superior.

A ministry of the first kind is a gift from the head of the state to
his minister and a great honor bestowed on him by elevating him to a
high office.

The ministry of the second kind is not a gift from the superior as much
as it is a gift from the minister. It is a tremendous sacrifice which
the minister offers continuously for the protection of his superior and
for making his mission a success. A minister of this kind faces with his
superior dangers and difficulties which could not be faced hy a human
multitude .

The minister whom the Holy Prophet was seeking from among the members
of his clan was from the second rather than from the first kind. There
was no established state nor was there yet any Muslim community. The
Messenger of God was not (and even after the Islamic State was
established) in need of a counselor to advise him how to spread the
message or to found a state. He was in need of a person of unusual
sincerity and heroism with an absolute obedience to God and His
Messenger .

( 70 ) A person that deserves to be the pother of the Messenger of God
and his successor after his absence from this world must have a soul
that is virtuous enough to be an extension of the soul of the Prophet
himself. He must resemble him to a high degree in knowledge wisdom and
rise above self interest. In other words he must be a replica of the
great Prophet.

Yes the Messenger of God was not in need of a person who advises him
about the wise course he should take. The Messenger was the most
intelligent and the wisest. He only was in need of a minister who would
assist him by his big action sacrifices and heroic work. That minister
would be the recipient of his knowledge and when the need arises he will
be able to represent the Messenger and sit on his chair after him.

**The Prophet Wanted to Have No Excuses**

One should not doubt for a minute that the Messenger of God was aware
of who will be his minister before he spoke to the members of his clan.
He knew that there was none among the group that had the quality of the
needed minister but Ali .

However the Messenger would not choose Ali to the high offices without
leaving no excuse for the rest of his relatives. He would not let the
coming generations say that if he had asked someone other than Ali he
would have found many qualified persons. He would not let us wonder
whether the Messenger had a favoritism towards Ali and distinguished him
without a clear reason. It was necessary to give the rest of the members
of his clan the opportunity to make them show their attitude and to make
the merit of Ali evident.

**THE OUTCOME OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE HOUSE OF THE PROPHET**

The conference to which the Messenger called the children of
Abdul-Muttalib produced a unique pact; history

has never witnessed its like nor has it witnessed its equal in nobility
and high aim. It is a covenant between the final Prophet of God the
Conveyor of the Message of the Heaven and his minister Ali Ibn Abu Talib
who at the time of the covenant was not above the thirteenth year of his
age.

The substance of the covenant was two items:

1. A pledge on the part of Ali to the Prophet to be his minister in
fulfilling his great mission .
2. A promise by the Holy Prophet put in a form of a declaration in
which he told the members of his clan while his hand was on Ali's head:
"This is my pother my executor and my successor in you. Listen to him
and obey him." It is worthy to note that the Messenger fulfilled his
promise immediately at the conference. He did not wait for Ali to
fulfill his pledge. The Prophet put his promise in a form of an
immediate reward to his minister. He declared while he was still at the
conference that Ali was his pother and made him his executor and
successor. He did not wait for Ali to fulfill his pledge because he knew
that Ali's word carried its full meaning and that his word and his deed
were united and never would contradict each other. Ali put himself at
the disposal of the Messenger from the minute he uttered his pledge.
Several years elapsed before the Holy Prophet needed Ali's immediate
assistance .

Ali's father was still alive and strong guarding the life of the
Messenger; and the believers were not yet permitted by God to fight
their adversaries. Also the danger against the Holy Prophet had not
reached its peak.

The dangerous hour came ten years after the conference and after Abu
Talib departed from this world. The Meccan chiefs in their "Nadwa"
(club) conferred and decided to ping to an end the life of the Messenger
by assassination.

The Prophet called upon his minister to start fulfilling his pledge.
Thus the night of redemption came and Ali was the redeemer of the
Messenger and his Trustee.

Ali pronounced his word while he knew the magnitude of the mission in
which he pledged to assist the Prophet.

He was fully aware that due to its magnitude the mission

seemed to be impossible. The mission aimed at changing the beliefs of
the society and its ways of life.

It aimed at making the society empace Heavenly principles that do not
agree with its nature. Ali knew that it would be opposed by all forces
in society. He knew that the success of this mission could not be
achieved unless it prevailed against all adversary forces and that this
required the establishment of an Islamic state based on the foundation
of the newly revealed principles. Such a state would protect those
principles and the freedom of their followers.

Such a mission cannot be accomplished even by a whole nation regardless
of what it may muster of forces. This mission is what the Messenger was
determined to achieve and it is the mission which Ali promised to
support by his assistance and by facing all what the Prophet will face
in its achievement.

As the conference yielded this result it was expected that Ali will
fulfill his huge pledge as it was expected that the Holy Prophet will
declare in the future to all Muslims what he had declared to his
immediate relatives concerning Ali. We shall see in the following pages
that Ali fulfilled what he pledged to the Messenger and that the
Messenger after the birth of the Islamic State had declared to the
Muslims what he declared to the forty men from the children of
Abdul-Muttalib.
