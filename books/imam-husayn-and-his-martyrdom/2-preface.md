Preface
=======

The following pages are based on a report of an Address which I
delivered in London at an Ashura Majlis on Thursday the 28th May, 1931
(Muharram 1350 A.H.), at the Waldorf Hotel. The report was subsequently
corrected and slightly expanded.

The Majlis was a notable gathering, which met at the invitation of Mr.
A. S. M. Anik. Nawab Sir Umar Hayat Khan, Tiwana, presided and members
of all schools of thought in Islam, as well as non-Muslims, joined
reverently in doing honour to the memory of the great Martyr of Islam.

By its inclusion in the Progressive Islam Pamphlets series, it is hoped
to reach a larger public than were able to be present in person.
Perhaps, also, it may help to strengthen the bonds of brotherly love
which unite all who hold sacred the ideals of brotherhood preached by
the Prophet in his last Sermon.
