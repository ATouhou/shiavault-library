Istihadha
=========

Istihadha is a type of blood seen by women where the discharge is
irregular. In order to better understand the rules of istihadha and the
different types of istihadha let us follow the eight simple guidelines
below:

Verification of what kind of blood it is
----------------------------------------

If the blood seen has the following conditions, then it is istihadha.

If the blood seen is not part of the regular menstrual cycle  
 If the blood seen is not Nifas (blood seen after childbirth)  
 If the blood seen is not from a boil or from surgery

Signs of Istihadha
------------------

Blood seen at the time of istihadha usually has its own distinctive
features. It:

Is usually yellowish in color  
 Is not thick  
 Is cold  
 Comes out without force and without burning

However, there are always some exceptions. A woman may see istihadha
blood that is red or dark, thick; warm or that comes out with force and
burning.

Types of Istihadha
------------------

After following steps 1 and 2, that is after one verifies that the blood
seen is istihadha, the next step is to know what type of istihadha it
is, as the rules differ for each type. To determine what type of
istihadha it is, one must place cotton on the surface of the vagina and
see how much blood soaks the cotton. Below are the three different types
of istihadha one will determine after the test:

**Qaleelah** **(Little** **flow):** when tested on a piece of cotton,
blood is on the surface and does not show on the reverse side.

**Mutawasittah (Medium** **flow):** when tested on a piece of cotton,
blood seeps in and maybe seen on the reverse side. Blood does not stain
the underwear.

**Katheera** **(Excessive** **flow):** when tested on a piece of cotton,
blood flows out from the cotton and leaves a stain on the underwear.

**Note:** *The best way to examine the type of istihadha* *is on a piece
of cotton, because on a sanitary pad the blood is absorbed and usually a
sanitary pad has a plastic base to avoid leakage. Hence to determine the
type of istihadha cotton should be used.*
