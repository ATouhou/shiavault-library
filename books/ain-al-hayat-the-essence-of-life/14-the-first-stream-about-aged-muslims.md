The First Stream: About Aged Muslims
====================================

Allah respects the grey haired Muslims. It is an authentic tradition
that one must treat youngsters with affection and the elders with
respect.

Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (as) has said: One who reaches fifty years of age
will have the accounting easier on the Day of Judgement. One who reaches
sixty years of age, even the angels will be friendly towards him. One
who touches seventy, his atonement for sins will be accepted. Allah will
order the angels to record only the good deeds of the person who reached
the age of eighty years. One who reaches ninety years, all his past sins
will be pardoned and even the sins that he might commit later might be
forgiven.He will be listed in the group of Allah’s captives and will
intercede on behalf of his kinsmen on the Day of Judgement.
