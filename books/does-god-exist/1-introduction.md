Introduction
============

We live in a world where millions doubt the existence of God: a world
of science and technology in which people only accept what they can
prove, see, measure, weigh or touch.

Understandably, abstract concepts are accepted with caution. Belief in
the existence of God is, therefore, treated with suspicion, disdain and
oftenwithamusement.Certainlythe sophisticated western mind calls for
more than nebulous unproved theories upon which to base faith.

Nevertheless, were you to visit any country in the world, you would
find that the majority of people believe that a supernatural Being
(we'll call Him God) does exist. In other words, believers in a God of
some sort outnumber unbelievers.

Many people believe that there are thousands of gods, not just one:
though they will readily agree that over and above the lesser gods is
One Almighty God (Allah). Allah is the standard Arabic name for "God."
The term is best known in the west for its use by Muslims as a reference
to God. Arabic speakers of all faiths, including Christians and Jews,
use the word Allah to mean "God." The Muslim and Christian Arabs of
today have no other word for "God" than Allah.

In Islam, Allah (SWT) is the only deity, transcendent creator of the
universe, and the judge of humankind.

Some Islamic scholars feel that "Allah (SWT)" should not be translated,
because they perceive the Arabic word to express the uniqueness of
"Allah (SWT)"more accurately than the word "god" for two reasons:

1.The word "god" can take a plural form "gods", whereas the word "Allah
(SWT)" has no plural form.

2. The word "god" can have gender as male god or female god (called
goddess) whereas the word "Allah (SWT)" does not have gender. (Note:
Subhanahu wa Ta'ala is an Islamic Arabic phrase meaning, "glorious and
exalted is He (Allah)." This phrase often abbreviated to "SWT.")

In this booklet we will try to prove the existence of God with simple
logic and small stories.

One important point we need to understand in the first place is that
the existence of God can not be proved in the same way, as you prove the
existence of a physical object. This is simply because God is not a
physical object.

Any physical object is subject to your five senses. In simple terms,
you can see, hear, smell, touch or taste a physical object. This is not
possible in the case of God, as He is a Transcendental Being [existing
on a level beyond our sensual perception].

There are people who argue that the only form of knowledge available to
humans is experientialknowledgeorexperimental knowledge, gained
primarily by the use of outer senses. This led to the belief that human
beings are constituted in such a way that the knowledge of reality is
always unavailable to them; and so it resulted in a renewal of attention
to the everyday world of appearances.

The knowledge of here and now became the only object of human knowledge
and concern. Thus from this point of view, the project of seeking
knowledge of reality behind appearances must be abandoned, because it is
beyond the scope of human understanding. Now think: Can't there be a way
of "being" [existing] that is not susceptible of being perceived by the
limited capabilities of humans through their defective senses?

I hope that the implications of the two expressions I used above
["limited capabilities" and "defective senses"] are evident to any
thinking person. The claim that something does not exist, because you
haven't seen or heard it is untenable.

When we consider the limitations of our sensual perception and of our
reasoning powers, it is not necessary that we understand everything. We
can speak meaningfully about everything simply on the basis of our
perception. So to speak of "proof" with regard to a Transcendental Being
becomes irrelevant.

What we can do is to point out facts which lead to a constant and
inescapable awareness of the presence of God. It is clear that logically
we can not rule out the possibility of more things existing than can be
perceived by our senses or can be arrived at by our reasoning. As for
Man, there are two dimensions to his existence: One of matter and the
other of spirit.

Reduced merely to the level of material existence, Man becomes a
machine or a mere animal at best. But think of a machine that rebels
against being a machine; or of an animal that refuses to be an animal.

That is what man is! What is it that makes him rebellious, angry,
disappointed, frightened or hopeful? What is his dimension that gives
him his imagination, his artistic genius, his creative urge? Why does he
have nightmares and sweet dreams?

It is not matter that does it; evidently it is his spirit that makes
him so different from animals. So to base our knowledge of the world and
our philosophy of life simply on the material side of our existence to
the complete exclusion of the spiritual dimension is undoubtedly
faulty.

The strength of Islam as a philosophy and as a way of life is that it
does not separate man's material life from spiritual life, and that it
seeks a balance between the two dimensions of human existence.

We should understand that human spirit is a reality incommensurable
with material realities, and that it owes its existence only to God.
Thus dear friends, if we ponder over the phenomena of the world around
us and over the complexities of our own existence, we are bound to
conclude that God is the Reality behind all appearances. The holy Qur'an
says in Surah 2, verse 164 , the meaning of the following:

"Most surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the
alternation of the night and the day, and the ships that run in the sea
with that which profits men, and the water that Allah sends down from
the cloud,

then gives life with it to the earth after its death and spreads in it
all (kinds of) animals, and the changing of the winds and the clouds
made subservient between the heaven and the earth, there are signs for a
people who understand." (2:164 )

That is to say the external signs we see in the universe should
necessarily lead a wise person to the Ultimate Reality behind it all.
And that is how we arrive at the realization that God Almighty is the
Moving Power behind all life and all existence.

What would constitute objective proof of God? Well, consider the
following self-evident and universally recognized truth: Concept and
design necessitate an intelligent designer.

It's simply cause and effect. In our search for proof of God's
existence, let's examine the various scientific and mathematical
realities in our world. Let's look at the evidence now!
