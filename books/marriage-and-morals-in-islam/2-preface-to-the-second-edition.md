Preface to the Second Edition
=============================

The first edition (1990) of this book was very well received by the
readers around the globe. It was reprinted in Iran by a publisher whose
foreign language publications are distributed all over the world. Its
excerpts have been published in magazines in India, South Africa and
also in Norwegian language.

In 1993, Mr. M. H. Assagaf translated *Marriage & Morals in* *Islam*
into Indonesian, a language used, according to him "by the people of
Indonesia (170 million), Malaysia, Brunei and parts of Singapore and
Thailand."

In 1993, I revised and expanded the previous edition. Besides correcting
the spelling mistakes and minor changes and additions to the text and
footnotes, two sub-sections "Whom Can You Marry?" and "The *'Aqd*" were
added in Chapter Three, and the section on "Sources of the *Shari'ah*"
was moved from the Introduction to the end of the book as Appendix I. I
have also added a section on "The Major Ablution: Ghusl Janabat" as
Appendix II.

I hope this edition proves more useful to the seekers of truth. *Wa ma
tawfiqi illa bi 'l-lah.*
