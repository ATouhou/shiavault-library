Bahlool and Haroun
==================

One day Haroun Rashid asked Bahlool, “What is Allah's greatest
blessing?”

“Allah's greatest blessing is the mind. Khawaja Abdullah Ansari says in
his supplication, 'O Allah! Those whom You gave intelligence, what else
did You not give; those whom You didn't give understanding, what did You
give?' In one reliable Hadith, when Allah decided to take back His
blessings from His slaves, first of all He took their intellect away.
Reason is amongst subsistence. It is sorrowful that Allah took this
blessing away from me.”
