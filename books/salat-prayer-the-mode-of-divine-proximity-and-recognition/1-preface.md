Amir al Mu’minin Ali Ibn Abi Talib (‘a) says,

لَوْ يَعْلَمُ الْمُصَلِّيْ مَا يَغْشَاهُ مِنْ جَلاَلِ اللهِ، مَا

“Had the one who prays known how the majesty of Allah encompasses him,
he would never have liked to raise his head from prostration.”[^1]

Respected readers, this booklet in your hands, highlights the reality
and importance of *Salat*, which is based on the booklet of *“Ghayat ul
Muna wa Mi’raj ul Qurb wal liqa”,* **(غاية الْمُنى و معراج القرب
واللّقاء)** compiled by the great scholar and jurist, Ayatullah al-Uzma
Mirza Mahdi Isfahani (d.1365 A.H.) (Allah’s mercy be on him).

Among the main pillars of the Mashshad Religious School
*(Hawz-e-Ilmiyyah)* at Mashshad Muqaddas, Ayatullah Isfahani (Allah’s
mercy be on him) did a great service to the Islamic society by striving
hard to enliven the knowledge and sciences of the Holy Qur’an and Ahlul
Bayt (‘a) and training highly pious and knowledgeable students. May
Allah raise him along with his Prophets (peace be upon them) and the
infallible Imams (‘a).

It is worth mentioning that the original Arabic text of this booklet was
printed along with some other articles, without any editing and proof
reading. Recently, our knowledgeable friend, Mr. Afzal Qahermani
Miyanji, took the trouble of editing and proof reading the original.

We hope that this humble offering is well received by our readers, and
is worthy of acceptance in the service of our beloved master, Imam of
the Time (May Allah hasten his re-appearence).
