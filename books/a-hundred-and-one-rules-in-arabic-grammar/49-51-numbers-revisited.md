51. Numbers (Revisited)
=======================

It was mentioned earlier that numbers that proceed nouns should take the
opposite gender of those nouns. An additional rule which you need to
consider is that unlike English, the noun has to be in plural only
between 3-10. After that the noun has to be singular in the accusative
case. This is another example of**     تمييز**   "accusative of
distinction."
