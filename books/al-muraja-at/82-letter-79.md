Letter 79
=========

Consensus Endorses al-Siddiq's Caliphate
----------------------------------------

**Safar 23, 1330**

If what you have said about the covenant and the will, as well as the
clear texts, is proven accurate, then what can you say about the
nation's consensus to nominate [Abu Bakr] al-Siddiq? Its consensus is an
unequivocal proof that testifies to his statement (pbuh): "My nation's
consensus shall never occur regarding anything wrong," and his
statement, peace be upon him and his progeny, "My nation's word shall
never be misleading;" so, what do you have to say about that?

Sincerely,

*S*
