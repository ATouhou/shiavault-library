***In the Name of God The Merciful, the Compassionate***

The book *Lessons from the Nahjul Balaghah* by the great Islamic
scholar, Sayyid ‘Ali Khamene’i, one of the leading theologians and
politicians of Iran and presently its president and the Friday Ritual
Prayer leader of Tehran, is a precious book presented to the world of
Islam as a brief introduction to the vast phenomenon of prophethood as
it appears in the *Nahjul Balaghah* of the Commander of the Faithful,
‘Ali, peace be upon him. '

The efforts made in translating this book were aimed at providing the
Muslims, and even non-Muslims, outside the country, who communicate in
the English language, with a valuable interpretation of ‘‘Ali’s sayings
concerning the issue of prophethood. It is hoped that this aim has been
achieved with this translation. Readers, however, are kindly asked to
observe the following points;

1. The translator has adopted the method of „blank verse” in rendering
the author's views into English. However, on many occasions, an exact,
word-by-word translation has been employed.

2. In some rare cases, unnecessary or repeated parts of the original
text have been omitted in translation.

3. The source for the translation of the Sermons of the Nahjul Balaghah
has been Sayyid All Radis translation of it (1979, Tehran).

4. The Qur’anic verses have been taken from Marmaduke Pickthall's “*The
Glorious Koran”.*
