Section Six : the Role of Institutions
======================================

**Who is Responsible?**

In the logic of Islam: ' Each of you is a guardian and each of you are
responsible for his guardianship'. 113

Each person has a role and responsibility without which society has no
basis. Since the family is the nucleus of society and the criterion for
its advancement or decline rests with it, then it must have a great role
in this guardianship.

Girls of marriageable age, divorcees, widows, marital disputes, and for
that matter orphans are all subjects which require careful consideration
so that wherever possible their problems may be solved. This may be
achieved through facilitating the marriage of single persons or through
reconciling those parties who have separated. By taking care of orphans
and meeting their material and spiritual needs and giving them a good
practical and intellectual education.

In materialistic societies, which includes, in this age, Islamic
societies, these problems are widespread 114 and individuals do not
receive the attention they deserve.

Hence all those who have faith and hope in Allah and the day of
resurrection, and who contemplate the reform of society should concern
themselves with assisting women and orphans. The emissary of Allah has
said: ' Have mercy on the weak, on women and on orphans'.

Is it not the case that any one of us could be susceptible to these
problems? So if we do not have mercy on those less fortunate than
ourselves we may not be shown mercy when we or our children are in a
similar position and in need. In the Qur'anic verse: ' Let those
(disposing of an estate) have the same fear in their minds as they would
have for their own if they had left a helpless family behind. Let them
fear Allah and speak appropriately '. 115

In the prophetic tradition: ' Have mercy upon those who are on the
Earth and He who is in the heavens will have mercy upon you ' 116

The parents are responsible for themselves and the welfare of their
family. Society, including intellectuals and capitalists, is also
responsible for supporting its elements and families. The greater
responsibility falls on the government and the state 117 as is in the
prophetic tradition. There is also a great deal of reward due to whoever
works towards the marriage of single Muslims.

The prophetic traditions are full of special mentions of motherhood,
childhood and the ill, as well as the fact that it is a requirement of
Allah's words to 'help one another in righteousness and piety' 118, as
well as that of nature and intellect.

Charitable organisations are among the best solutions to numerous
problems relating to the family and society and indeed in any area of
life in that they :

a). Stimulate the activities of individuals or similar organisations
because they tend to be pluralistic and encourage the activities of
others.
b). Can be a source of support for people as the reliance upon a group
is greater than that of an individual.
c). The obstinate individual will find no room therein for
megalomania.
d). Each individual will be heading in the right direction where there
is consultation and a meeting of minds as the most intelligent person is
he who combines his mind with those of others.

e). Wherever there is competition between a single group of
individuals, each one strives to be 'bigger and better' so that things
improve in quality and quantity in a way impossible for a single person
working alone to achieve however perfect and sincere he was. The
exception to this is only in the case of those 'restrained from error'
by Allah.

Hence we find that the prophet, himself impeccable, saying: ' Oh people
consult me in matters' 119. and before that in the Qur'anic verses: '
Consult them in affairs' 120, and '... those who conduct their affairs
by mutual consultation' 121, and '... by mutual consent and consultation
' 122, and so on. Therefore there is a need for charitable organisations
in all areas of life. 123. 124

The root of the problem lies in the substitution by the West and its
agent rulers of the laws of Islam which used to guarantee our vitality
and progress in life. 'He calls you to what will let you live'. 125

Therefore committees to institute change should be set up to bring back
the vital laws of Islam. Otherwise our life will be nothing but strife
and oppression, as in the Qur'anic verse: 'But whosoever turns away from
the remembrance of me shall find a straitened existence'. 126

It is true that the man who says he does not believe in the law of
gravity and throws himself from a high place will still find his bones
broken. Or the man who says he does not believe in Archimedes principle
and throws himself in the sea without knowing how to swim, will still
drink water until he dies. The same goes for the laws of society,
economics, politics, education and the family as Islam confirms.

In so far as salvation lies in the return of these vital laws, then the
remit of the committees for change should be to substitute, law by law,
each of the false laws with the correct laws. In this way, Allah may
look upon Muslims with compassion and rescue them from the backwardness
and confusion they now experience.

Another way of supporting the policies of substitution and facilitation
is to form groups to make use of free media and equal rights to
implement the aforementioned two groups. Similarly help must be sought
from philanthropists and charitable bodies to collect funds to meet
people's needs as far as possible.

All of this is possible if the concern and efforts of reformists and
committed individuals is combined after which Allah may cause something
to happen.

It is clearly possible to benefit from good Muslim businessmen in the
facilitation and substitution operation. Traders were previously the
jewel in the crown in the change that took place in favour of Islam and
Muslims. It is capital, power, and knowledge that direct society towards
the better or God forbid the worse.

It appears in the traditions that: ' Islam was built on three things;
the wealth of Khadijah, the protection of Abu Talib, and the morals of
the Prophet'. It is these three that helped to foment the rise of
Islam.

In another tradition from the Prophet: ' There are two groups in my
nation which if righteous so will my nation be righteous and if corrupt
so will my nation be corrupt. They are the scholars and the leaders.'

If money is not mentioned in this then it is probably due to the fact
that money is secondary to the two other things. As in when Imam Hussein
was killed through the power of Zayad, the edict of Shureih, and the
wealth of the public treasury which had been directed by the powers that
were and the edict towards evil and tyranny.

Muslim traders have the ability to raise the status of Islam and deepen
it and maintain it as a barrier against the vast currents over the ages.
Islamic charitable institutions be they schools, mosques, shrines, or
libraries mostly come from Muslim businessmen. So if they enter the
picture, God willing, the change and substitution will become easier.

The aforementioned committees should also take part in planning the
development operation. Businesses like agriculture, industry, commerce
and heritage may also be able to create those committees in this way.
Naturally all arms, drugs, and trade in other forbidden articles should
be at all costs avoided for Allah is not obeyed through disobedience.
127

There are four sources of funds for the public treasury: The Khums, The
Zakat, The Jizya, The Kharraj each of which are discussed in detail in
the books of jurisprudence. These sources can fulfil the needs of the
people and the state making the need for raising public taxes obsolete
except in very rare occasions like earthquakes, flooding, famine or
drought and this under the supervision of the council of jurists and
scholars.

The secret to the sufficiency of these four taxes is that Islam places
matters in the hands of the people while the responsibility of the state
is the supervision and direction of the finances through a small number
of specialised officials. This is dealt with in greater detail in other
books on the subject.

Use must be made of the great potential energies which should be
rallied to productive work instead of wasting them in needless
bureaucracy where they may be dispensed with. The treasury undertakes to
fulfil the public's needs including the needs of those who wish to marry
but are poor.

In the event of there being no public treasury as is the situation now
in Islamic lands, then the principle of 'that which cannot be fully
realised should not be completely neglected' must be put into effect
through charitable bodies setting up funds to collect donations and
distribute them according to the needs of the public including
youngsters who wish to marry.

128 ,or His words' ... do not take those outside your ranks into your
intimacy: they will not fail to corrupt you. They only desire for you to
suffer'. 129 or His words: ' ... and consult them in the affairs of
moment ...' 130 , or His words: ' ... so that (wealth) does not merely
circulate amongst a rich few ... 131

and so many other verses and traditions? So that now the Muslim stands
between two points; 'bemoaning the state of his religion and his way of
life' 132 . Whereas Imam Kashif Al-Ghata when he visited Iran said in
the prologue to his book 'I did not see one man or woman either weeping
or complaining' (meaning here unnatural weeping or complaining)'.

Similarly I do not recall any of that either in Iraq before the second
world war where Muslims were not yet subject to Eastern and Western
laws.

Today though after having chosen for themselves to be led by the
Western agenda and have become a confirmation of Allah's words: 'But
whosoever turns away from the remembrance of me shall find a straitened
existence' 133

Calamity has struck even the righteous among them according to Allah
Almighty's words: ' ... and fear a trial which may not only affect the
wrongdoers amongst you '... 134

I now offer some examples of the oppression and distress which have
surrounded Afghanistan, Iraq and the Gulf. These are by way of example
only for every Islamic land has been struck by this plague.

A certain party in Afghanistan plants opium for export to neighbouring
countries and with the proceeds buys weapons with which to kill the
people of the country. In this there are at least five criminal acts :

1) Misuse of the blessings of Allah; good land that should be used for
good things is used for evil things.
2) The exploitation of workers and means of production for bad ends
instead of for righteous ends.
3) Wastage of wealth on tools of destruction, bloodletting and
impoverishment instead of being used for building and construction and
the needs of the people.
4) Causing pain to the people and the neighbouring countries that
should be safe from the calamities of a neighbour falling into the trap
of addiction and corruption.

5) Destruction of the country: the natural result of the aforementioned
is the destruction of the country and the humiliation and impoverishment
of the people. This though is only the natural result of the type of
ignorance that we have mentioned and the abandonment of the laws of God.
In the Qur'anic verse : '... and be not like those who have forgotten
God and He made them forget their own souls ...' 135

Then the West puts Saddam in place so he can embezzle more than 800
billion dollars worth of Muslim wealth and do with Iraq and its
neighbours such murder, terrorising, imprisonment, torture, war, famine,
torment, and economic destruction as has not been witnessed in the whole
of history. 136 The crimes of the Mongols, the Tartars and the Hajaj
pale into insignificance compared to the crimes of Saddam and his
party.

The West then makes the Iraqi regime into a tool for terrorising and
corrupting the Gulf states and their other neighbours so that they ask
for military bases on their soil and buy from the West billions of
dollars of arms 137 rather than serving the needs of the people and
improving the lifestyle of the country. In this way the Islamic
community is in the worst possible state of oppression and distress.
138

There is as we previously said no cure to this other than through a
general awareness which is the prelude towards a return to the laws of
Islam. For Islam is what will rescue humanity as that Muslim who went to
conquer Persia said when Rustum asked him 'What do you want' He said '
We have come to bring the people from obeying other people to obeying
Allah and to rescue humanity from the narrowness of the earth to its
wideness.

81 The instance of divorce in the Islamic world has shown an
unprecedented rise. In Kuwait there is one divorce for every three
marriages, 29% of which take place within the first year of marriage,
and 67% take place within the first five years of marriage. In Egypt
there are 4 million divorced women, .The rate of divorce has risen in
recent years to 25%, and the rate of cancelled engagements has risen to
15% while the rate of marriage has fallen to 20%.

**99 There are two theories regarding childbirth :**

The first is the Malthusian theory of Thomas Robert Malthus which
stresses the non-correlation between demographic size and availability
of economic resources since the demographic increase is subject to
technology whilst economic resources are subject to arithmetic therefore
equilibrium cannot be attained except through birth control.

In the aftermath of the industrial revolution, Classicists promoted
this theory to justify the poor distribution of incomes. In the post
second world war period, certain rulers latched on to this theory to
excuse the poverty, unemployment and backwardness that prevailed in
their countries.

The second theory is growth theory supported by the majority of
economists. It says that human behaviour depends upon the social
environment and other social factors like values and traditions, and
upon the extent to which Nature can be controlled, and upon the
advancement of modes of production, and upon the nature of the
prevailing economic system.

These factors interact to influence human demographic behaviour. In
other words, the absence of equilibrium between demographic growth and
the nature of the economic and social system inhibits growth and
prosperity.

This theory believes that the best way to cure population growth is
economic growth and advancement and social justice, the people not being
responsible for their poverty but rather the state being responsible due
to poor distribution of wealth, the failure of growth and the prevalence
of unemployment due to laws which inhibit freedoms.

The Malthusian theory did not meet with any success and its
overwhelming failure was proven in the countries of Europe. Hence voices
have been raised in the West in criticism of the concept of birth
control. Scholars say that people spontaneously are inclined to keep
their numbers to reasonable levels when the standard of living rises and
the economic and cultural way of life changes.

The voices of criticism among Western scholars and intellectuals
convinced the powers that be to bring in laws to increase reproduction
rates. It may be wondered what the hidden factors were which motivated
certain regimes to adopt birth control. In answer we would say that
these regimes are of two types; local and Western.

Local regimes have an interest in birth control as they lay the
responsibility for backwardness at the door of the people and cover up
their own failure to deliver economic and social growth and draw a veil
over their own liabilities from bureaucracy through to corruption which
contribute to the inefficacy of the growth cycle.

Western regimes have an interest in birth control in the third world
making them the big players on the world stage and diminishing the
dependence of the third world on warranted international assistance and
loans and preventing a flood of population from the third world into
their countries.

In addition to these factors, the application of the theory of growth
in the third world means delving into three areas that the Western
states would rather not delve; a).The lessening of consumption in the
West, b).Third world debt, c). Transfer of technology from advanced
nations to other nations. [Adapted from article called 'Two Schools of
Thought in Dealing with the Population Problem' by Fahmy Haueidi].

100 The German government spends millions yearly to encourage
childrearing. Scholars believe that women only become fully matured
after one or two childbirths and that many women who have not given
birth are not as well balanced as mothers. This in addition to the fact
that they become more nervous than the mothers. The well-known French
physician Petard says: Frankly a woman will not achieve good health
unless she becomes a mother.

101 To realise the extent of Western fears about the dwindling of their
populations it is enough to monitor newspapers concerned with social
affairs and attend important conferences on demography in Europe. In
1988 the Danish press announced that the Danish government had imported
1000 Philipino girls for purposes of childrearing on the premise that
Philipino girls are more inclined towards love, procreation and
children.

102 The Islamic world covers approximately 30% of the earth's surface
amounting to 32.7 million square kilometres which equals 3.5 times the
area of the United States and China.

103 Certain people may cling to birth control for the following
reasons: a). The parents may be incapable of bringing up their children.
b). The 'happy life' may be one with few children and dependants. The
answer to the first is that the history of Islam from the flight of the
prophet until now confirms that the parents have the capacity to bring
up their children and indeed upbringing is not confined to the parents
alone but the whole of society takes part in it.

In answer to the second, the truth is quite the opposite - the
preferable life comes from having many children because life progresses
through co-operation and the many necessitate more co-operation in
quality and quantity.

104 The arable land of the Sudan comes to about 300 million fedans
(about1200 million square kilometres) of which only 30 million fedans is
currently cultivated.

million of which were in Basra and giving 650 types of date. This number
