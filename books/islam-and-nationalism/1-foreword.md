Foreword
========

This book was published in 1985 by the Council for the Ten-Day Dawn
Celebrations on the occasion of the 6th Anniversary of the victory of
the Islamic Revolution. It has benefited a large number of readers.

The subject of nationalism has been very vital for exploiters,
oppressors and enemies of Islam. It has been an effective tool in the
hands of Superpowers and non-Muslims in general for shattering the very
mighty unifying force among Muslims generated on the basis of Islamic
principles of the "international" and not the "national" brotherhood.

Horrified by the current Islamic resurgence and a world-wide rising wave
of unity among Muslims, the world oppressive, arrogant and Zionist
forces are engaged day and night in sharpening more and more this tool
of nationalism and using the same very cunningly against Muslims and all
the interests of Islam. Needless to mention that Muslims must beware of
all such designs and be ever prepared to deal with these plots most
effectively.

Keeping in view the importance of this subject for Muslims, the IPO has
decided to publish it again for the benefit, of all the concerned. This
book, written originally in Persian language, has been translated in
various languages including Arabic, English and Spanish. It deals with
the same subject of nationalism explaining that there is no room for
this kind of concept in Islam.
