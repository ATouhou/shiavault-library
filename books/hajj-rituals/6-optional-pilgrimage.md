Optional Pilgrimage
===================

**Rule 130:** It is recommended to perform pilgrimage, if it were
possible, even if one does not have the required means or has already
performed the Hajjatul Islam. It is recommended to do so each year for
those who can afford it.

**Rule 131:** It is recommended that at the time of departure from
Makkah, one makes the intention to return there.

**Rule 132:** It is recommended to send on obligatory pilgrimage someone
who does not have the means to perform it himself. It is also
recommended to take a loan to make the journey, if one was sure they can
make the repayment later. It is recommended to make much expense during
pilgrimage.

**Rule 133:** It is permissible for a person who receives zakah, from
the share of the poor, to spend it on a recommended pilgrimage.

**Rule 134:** It is conditional that a married woman, intending to
perform an optional pilgrimage, obtain the consent of her husband. That
is also the rule for a woman observing a waiting period (iddah) arising
from a revocable divorce but not for a woman of an irrevocable divorce.
A widow, who is still in iddah, can perform a pilgrimage.
