A Word in His Aprreciation
==========================

an-Najashi says: "Amongst our associates, al-Kulayni was the chief and
the most prominent in Ray (Iran). He was the most reliable,30
ac-credited and the weightiest in hƒmad.th (tradition).

al \`Allamah al-Hƒmilli31 has confirmed this and Ibn Dawud32 also did
the same with a very minor change.

atƒz-Tƒlusi ،X the great scholar has regarded him as the most
depend-able and an expert in hƒmad.th (tradition).33 He has also
described him as the man of highest esteem and a scholar in hƒmad.th.34
as-Sayyid Radƒui ad-Din ibn Tƒlawus said, "Muhammad ibn Ya،¥qub
al-Kulayni is universally accepted for his leadership and
reliability."35 He has also said:

"Muhammad ibn Ya،¥qub (al-Kulayni) is the most eloquent and the most
truthful in the knowledge of hƒmad.th.،¨36
Ibn al-Ath.r has regarded him "Amongst the outstanding leaders of the
Sh.،¥ah and their great scholar."37

He has also described him as "A reformer of the Sh.،¦ahs at the end of
the third century, as their leader and as a renowned scholar among
them.،¨38 at-Tƒlayyibi counted him as the reviver of the ummah ،X the
whole Muslim community at the end of that century . . . He was among the
most learned in Islamic Jurisprudence."

Ibn Hƒmajar said, "He was one among the Sh.،¥ah Jurists and an author
of their school."40

He has also added, "Abu Ja،¥far Muhammad ibn Ya،¥qub al-Kulayni was
among the chief scholars of the Sh.،¥ah world in the days of
al-Mugtadir."41 Says ash-Shaykh Hƒmusayn ibn \`Abd asƒw-Sƒlamad
al-Hƒmarithi al-Hƒmamdani, "Muhammad ibn Ya،¥qub al-Kulayni was the
religious chief of his time and an outstanding, noble minded and high
born scholar. He was the most reliable person in the field of tradition,
their best critic and the most conversant in it."42

al-Qadƒui Nurullah ash-Shushtari puts him at the top of the
traditionist and regards him as the Chief and their guardian.49 Muhammad
Taqi al-Majlisi ،X the great scholar says about him, "The truth is that
he is unparalleled amongst all the scholars we have seen. Everyone who
ponders over the traditions he has compiled and also the manner of his
editing and compiling them, will soon recognise him as the one
especially endowed by God Almighty.

"May Allah bestow upon him the highest rewards reserved for the doers
of the good for his services to Islam and the Muslim Com-munity."44 He
also regarded him as "The Shaykh (the chief) asƒw-Sƒlad.q (the most
truthful) and Thiqatu'l-Islam (the most trustworthy in respect of all
about Islam), as one accepted by the people of all classes. He has been
praised both in general and in particular."45 Mirza. \`Abdullah
al-Afandi has said :

"The person generally meant by the title Thiqatu'l-Islam' (the
trustworthy in Islam) is Muhammad ibn Ya،¥qub ibn Ishƒuaq al-Kulayni
ar-Razi, the compiler of the book al-Kafi. He is the oldest religious
chief of the Muslim world by the masses and by the elite alike and the
Mufti ،X the Chief judge for both the groups ،X the Sh.،¦ahs and the
Sunnis."46

**HIS COMPILATIONS**

1. Kitab tafsir ar-ru'ya;47
2. Kitab ar-rijal;48
3. Kitab ar-radd ،¥ala al-Qaramitƒzah;49
4. Kitab ar-rasa'i150 ،X Rasa'il al-a'immah (\`alayhimu's-salam); 51
5. Kitab al-Kafi;52
6. Kitab ma q.la f. al-a'immah ('alayhimu's-salam)- mina'l-shi،¥r.53


**A L ،K A F l**

This book is known after the name of the compiler al-Kulayni54 and also
by the name of al-Kafi.55 While replying to one of his associates,
al-Kulayni himself explained why he compiled this book "al-Kafi."

He wrote:

"You wanted a book to be handy, to be comprehensive and to be inclusive
of all knowledge about your religion (Islam) ،X a book on which a
student of religion could safely rely, to which the seeker of light and
guidance should turn and from which a student seeking the knowledge of
religion should derive full benefit and act on the traditions of the
truthful Imams (p.b.u.t.)." 56

The task of compiling this invaluable work has taken twenty years to
complete.57 It is evident from this quotation that a group of the
Sh.،¥ah community, living in distant cities, requested him to compile a
book which would be sufficient to benefit them for purposes of perusal
reference and recollection of reliable knowledge of the tradition.58

The intellectual stalwarts of his time took down the traditions from
his book verbatim and then used to read aloud to him to get them
verified. They then used to quote the traditions on the basis of its
being duly read and verified by al-Kulayni and also on the basis of his
written permission59 to quote him.

As was by his students like Abu'l-Hƒmusayn Ahmad ibn Ahmad al-K.fi
al-Katib,60 who was in his turn referred to and quoted by a group of
renowned Shiite scholars; Abu \`Abdillah Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn
\`Abdillah asƒw-Sƒlafwani who was a .contemporary of al-Kulayni61 and
Abu \`Abdillah Muhammad ibn Ibrah.m ibn Ja،¥far an Nu،¥mani, Ibn Abi
Zaynab who was also a contemporary of the author.62

The first and the foremost narrators who quoted him (al-Kulayni),
directly or indirectly, on whom the chain of further narrations ends,
are:-

1. Abu'l-Qasim Ja،¥far ibn Muhammad ibn Qulawayh al-Qummi (d.
368/978/979);63
2. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Sulayman ash-Shaybani, Abu
Ghalib az-Zurari (285/872 ،X 368/978/ 979);64
3. Abu Ja\`far Muhammad ibn \`Ali ibn al-Hƒmusayn ibn Babawayh as-Saduq
(305/917 ،X 381/991);65
4. Abu Muhammad Harun ibn M.sa ash-Shayban. at-Talla-،¥ukbari
(d.385/995);66
5. Abu \`Abdillah Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn an-Nu،¥man al-Baghdadi,
ash-Shaykh al-Muf.d (336/947/948 ،X 413/ 1022);67
6. Abu'l-Qasim \`Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Musawi, ash-Shar.f al-Murtadƒua
(355/966 ،X 436/1044);"
7. Abu'l-\`Abbas Ahmad ibn \`Ali an-Najashi (373/982 ،X 450/ 1058);69
8. Abu Ja،¥far Muhammad ibn al-Hƒmasan at-T.si, Shaykh at-Ta'ifah
(385/995 ،X 460/1067);70


**Distinctive Features**

The following are the numerous features of al-Kafi on the basis of
which it has been accorded a place of great honour:

1. The first and the foremost feature is that the compiler of this book
(al-Kulayni) was a contemporary of the four successive representatives
of Imam al-Mahdi (p.b.u.h.). As as-Sayyid ibn Tawus has pointed out,
"All the works and the collections (of the traditions) of ash-Shaykh
Muhammad ibn Ya،¥qub (al-Kulayni) had been completed' during the life
time of the said representatives (of Imam al-Mahdi). Therefore, there is
a ground for us to believe the veracity about his collections and
narrations.71

2. Secondly, the compiler of this book has made it compulsory for
himself except in the case of a few traditions, to give the whole chain
of references through which the tradition has passed between him and the
infallible Imam ،X the real source; although the compiler deletes the
first reference of the traditions.

This is probably because he himself has already got the original book
of the first reference in his possession.72 3. The third distinctive
feature of the compiler, as mentioned by some of our great research
scholars, is that his method of collecting and grading the traditions in
a chapter is according to

The order of the authenticity and the clarity of their meaning. It is
therefore the last traditions of every chapter that are always very
general, brief and cryptic.73

4. The fourth feature of the book is that the compiler generally drops
those traditions which, in any way are contradictory, and con-fines
himself only to the traditions which come under the heading of that
chapter. Perhaps, it indicates his giving the traditions he has
mentioned a preference to the traditions he has dropped and has not
mentioned.74

**SUB-DIVISIONS OF AL-KAFI**

al-Kulayni has sub-divided his book into three parts:-

in two volumes, and in Lucknow (India) in 1302/1885.

**PART III ،X AR-RAWDƒmAH:**

With regard to this part, the author has not exhaustively scrutinized
the arrangement of the subject matter or names. Although he has quoted
many traditions (ahƒmad.th), the chapters are not arranged in alphabetic
manner in terms of narration or narrators of the traditions.

This part in itself is like an encyclopaedia but not properly arranged
where the traditions of the Islamic principles (usƒw.l) and branches of
Islamic Laws (fur.،¥) such as acts of worship, transactions, Islamic
history and the life sketch of Divine Leaders, e.g. the Holy Prophet
(p.b.u.h.a.h.p.) and Imams (p.b.u.t.) as well as the short history of
the enemies of Islam are being dealt without any proper arrangements.
This part is called "ar-Rawdƒuah" (the Garden [of al-Kafi] ), printed in
Tehran in 1303/1886 combined with other books in one volume, but
thereafter, this part was printed separately in Lucknow (India) in
1302/1885.

In 1374/1955 ،X 1377/1958 the book of al-Kafi was reprinted in Tehran
by typographic process in the following arrangements :،XThe first part
in two volumes; The second part in five volumes; and The third part in
one volume.


Hereafter, the book was reprinted repeatedly, and the English
translation of the same is based on this revised edition.
