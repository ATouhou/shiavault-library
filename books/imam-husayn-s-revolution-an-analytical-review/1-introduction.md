Introduction
============

This survey of the unique revolution of Imam Husayn (as) is analytical
in essence, its purpose is to give a qualitative rather than quantative
account.

It has dealt with the causes, policies and results of the eternal
revolution, in the hope of unveiling the startling aspects of the
revolution's message which is often neglected in its traditional
commemoration.

In being confronted with this event, many questions need to be answered;
why did this revolution take place? What were its implications and
procedures? And what were its conclusive results? These answers may
provide a guiding light on which people can formulate their judgments.

The answers to the above questions are by no means easy, because they
involve analysis of the prevailing conditions before and after the
revolution. Indeed comprehensive answers would require a work of many
volumes in order that one may be satisfied. Not to mention the stormy
and turbulent events of the time, which add substantial difficulties in
the way of objective research.

The following account is only a person's viewpoint which is not
necessarily the complete answer, nevertheless, it is based on the most
popular and trustworthy authorities on the subject.

To understand Imam Husayn's personality and the collective culture of
the society, a summary of Islam's view of life is necessary.
