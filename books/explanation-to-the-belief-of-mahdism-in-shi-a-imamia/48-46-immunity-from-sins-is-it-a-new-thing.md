46. Immunity from sins is it a new thing?
=========================================

The writer says this is a thing newly thought upon and newly introduced.
If he means that this issue is being newly argued; it is something else.
In every environment a different tone is spoken. In every time a
different vogue rules the taste. Therefore, we should speak what suits
the language of the writer and at the same time avoid misleading our
readers.

His claim that “‘Ismat” (immunity from any wrongdoing or infallibility)
is a newly made up thing, is completely out of tine. By so saying he has
gone a great deal in repudiating or rejecting the prophet hood of the
apostles and the Imamate of the Imams. The ‘‘Ismat’, the infallibility
of them is supported by reason and attested by the Book of God - The
Holy Quran.

The Allama Hilli, has spoken of one thousand proofs. Nomani has narrated
the tributes, which were narrated earlier to him by the eleventh Imam
Hasan Askari (as). It is well understood and well acknowledged. But what
to do with ignorance? It is man’s arrogance to reject; his reason is his
taste.
