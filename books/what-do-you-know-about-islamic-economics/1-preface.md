**In the Name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful**

People have increasingly been, for quite some time, demanding to get the
series of “The Islamic School” out, and the dear readers have been
insisting that I must issue a new series for them.

I have been reluctant to respond to such requests due to my desire to
focus my efforts on finishing the second volume of *Iqtisaduna* (“Our
Islamic Economics”). The publication of this latter book has been the
reason behind the increasing demand that I should issue a brief series
explaining and simplifying the book’s researches so that they may become
accessible and comprehensible by a larger number of readers.

On this basis, I have written this series, taking special pains to make
it simple, avoiding the level of precision and depth which I retained
while researching “Our Economics.” On numerous occasions, I have
preferred to explain an idea rather than describing its precise form,
since the latter is already available in our detailed books.

While introducing this series to its readers, I shall first try to
summarize its ideas for them and provide them with a table of contents
which ought to help them comprehend it and follow its chapters.

This series includes raising one question and the attempt to answer it.
The question is: “Does an economic doctrine exist in Islam?”

In this series, we shall gradually answer this question in the
affirmative. After we raise the question, we will be busy explaining it
and everything relevant to it. After that, we shall study the answer in
the light of our comprehension of Islam, supporting it with proofs and
discussing any objections to it.
