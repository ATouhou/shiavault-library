Greetings
=========

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "When you meet each other then initiate
greeting (salam) and embrace; and when you separate from each other,
then depart with seeking forgiveness."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 76, p. 4

Imam Husayn-ibn-’Ali (‘a) said: "Seventy rewards is the share of the one
who initiates a 'greeting' and only one reward belongs to the one who
returns the 'greeting'." (When two people see each other, the initiator
of the exchange of greetings receives a greater reward.)

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 78, p. 120

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said that the Messenger of Allah (S) gathered the
children of 'Abd-il-Muttallib and said: "O' children of
'Abd-il-Muttallib! Initiate greetings, have regard for kinship, perform
the night prayers while people are asleep, feed (others) food, and
deliver good speech and thereby you will enter paradise in peace."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 69, p. 393

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "He who initiates a greeting is more beloved
with Allah and His Messenger."
