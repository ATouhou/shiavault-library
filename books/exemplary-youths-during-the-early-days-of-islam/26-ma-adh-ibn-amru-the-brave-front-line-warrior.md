Ma‘ādh ibn ‘Amru, the Brave Front-line Warrior
==============================================

Ma‘ādh ibn ‘Amru ibn Jumūh belonged to the tribe of Banī Salmah and was
one of the Helpers [*Ansār*] of Medina. He was present at ‘Aqabah and
during the Battle of Uhud.

Ma‘ādh himself says, “During the Battle of Uhud, the polytheists had
surrounded Abū Jahl and were teasingly saying, ‘Today, no one can dare
to attack Abū Jahl.’ Hearing this, I started planning to attack Abū Jahl
in order to shame the infidels.

Finally, I found a suitable opportunity and hit him so hard that his
foreleg was cut into two. Instantly, his son, Akramah, struck my
shoulder with his sword with the intention of separating my arm from my
body altogether, but it remained stuck to the skin on my shoulders. The
intensity of the war did not give me the opportunity to think about my
arm. So I continued fighting in this state. Finally, I realized that it
was disturbing me, so I decided to remove it myself. I plucked it off
and continued to fight.”

Ma‘ādh remained alive up to the time of the caliphate of ‘Uthmān and
died in 25 AH.[^1]
