Not the Personalities
=====================

Taken from: *Unto Thee We Grant...*

It was the famous or rather infamous battle of Jamal, where armies of
Muslims arranged themselves against each other. On one side were Talha
and Zubair, the Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him and his
cleansed progeny, at the head was Ummul Mu'mineen Aisha, the Prophet's
wife.

On the other side was an army led by Amir ul Mu'mineen, Imam ‘Ali, peace
be upon him.

The Imam, tried his best to avert the war, but the opposition remained
adamant. They said they were out to avenge the blood of Uthman.

As the battle raged on, a companion who had been watching in detachment
slowly advanced to Imam ‘Ali, peace be upon him, and said:

O ‘Ali, is it possible to believe that men like Talha and Zubair and a
lady like Aisha, the mother of the faithful have all joined hands on the
wrong side?

The Imam, peace be upon him, replied:

You have tangled yourself in a misleading argument. Truth and untruth
are not judged by the personalities. Discern the truth first and then
know its followers. Recognize the untruth and then identify its
adherents.
