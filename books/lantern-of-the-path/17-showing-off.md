Showing Off
===========

   
 Do not show off your actions to someone who neither gives life nor
causes death, and who cannot take away from you your burdens. Showing
off is a tree whose only fruit is hidden association of other gods with
Allah, and its root is hypocrisy. The vain one will be told on the Day
of Judgement; 'Take what you consider to be the reward of your actions
from those you took as your partners with Me. Look to those whom you
worshipped and called on, from whom you entertained hopes and whom you
feared. And know that you cannot conceal anything inside of you from
Allah: you will be deceived by yourself.'  
    
 Allah said,  
  

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يُخَادِعُونَ اللّهَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلاَّ
أَنفُسَهُم وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***They desire to deceive Allah and those who believe, and they deceive
only themselves and they do not perceive.*** (2:9)

   
 Showing off most frequently occurs in the way people glance at others,
speak, eat, drink, arrive somewhere, sit with others, dress, laugh, and
in the way they perform prayers, pilgrimage, jihad, recitation of the
Qur'an, and all outward acts of devotion.  
    
 However, he who is sincere towards Allah, who fears Him in his heart,
and who sees himself as lacking even after he has exerted himself with
every effort, will find that Allah is contented with him as a result,
and he will be among those whom one expects to be free from showing off
and hypocrisy, provided he continues to be in that state.
