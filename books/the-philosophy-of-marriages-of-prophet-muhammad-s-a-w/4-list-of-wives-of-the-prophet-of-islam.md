List of Wives of the Prophet of Islam
=====================================

After the death of his first wife, Khadijah, he married upto twelve
wives in this order:-

(1) Sawdah
(2) \`A'ishah
(3) Umm-Salamah
(4) Hafsah
(5) Zaynab bind-Khuzaymah
( 6) Zaynab bint-Jahsh
(7) Umm-Habibah (Ramla)
( 8) Maymunah
(9) Zaynab bint-\`Umais
(10) Juwayriyah
(11) Safiyah
(12) Khawlah bint-Hakim

Let us examine the circumstances and con- ditions under which these
marriages had taken place.

In principle, it can be stated that the marri- ages were contracted
with one or more of the following objectives:-

(1) For the sake of caring for the orphans and looking after the poor
widows. These were some Muslim women who had earlier enjoyed high
dignity in the Arab society.

But on the death of their husbands, their status and even faith were in
jeopardy, because their tribal chiefs would take them back and compel
them to renounce Islam, thus converting them back to polytheism.

For example, Sawdah had migrated to Abys- sinia where her husband died,
and she became absolutely without helper. It was the time when the
Prophet had lost Khadijah, his first wife; so he married Sawdah.

Likewise, Zaynab daughter of Khuzaymah, was an old-aged widow, who
after the death of her husband was inflicted with poverty, despite her
being amiable and being known as 'Ummul-Masa- kin' ( Mother of the
poor).

The Prophet married her to uphold her dignity and she died of old age
only after two years of that marriage.

(2) For the sake of enacting a new law and eradicating injustice by the
ignorant tribes. For example, Zaynab bint-Jahsh was the daughter of the
Prophet's aunt.

She was married, at the reco- mmendation of the Prophet, to Zayd
ibn-Harithah, the freed slave and adopted son of the Prophet.

This marriage was contracted to eradicate the dis- crimination against
slaves and poor and to empha- size the Islamic equality and brotherhood,
as Zay- nab was from the family of \`Abd al-Muttalib, the grandfather of
the Holy Prophet and the Chief of Quraysh, whereas Zayd was a slave who
was freed by the Prophet.

Unfortunately, Zaynab due to her family pride, did not get along well
with Zayd despite Prophet's persuations. The rift between the two
culminated into divorce.

Meanwhile, the system of adoption of children was expressly forbidden
by Allah. So, when Zayd divorced Zaynab, the Pro- phet of Islam,

at the express command of God, married Zaynab; and, thus, put an end to
the then prevalent belief that adopted sons were like real sons and that
wives or widows of adopted sons were like daughters-in-laws.

(3) For the sake of freeing prisoners and slaves. For example,
'Juwayriyah' was from a pro- minent tribe of Banul-Mustalaq. In a war
against Islam this tribe was defeated; and Juwayriyah, the daughter of
their Chief, was held in captivity.

The Prophet married her to set an example of protection and good
treatment to prisoners of war. On seeing that the prisoners had become
relatives of the Holy Prophet by marriage, the Muslims released all the
prisoners of war held by them. According to Ibne Hisham, over one
hundred families of Banul-Mustalaq were freed from cap- tivity as a
result of this marriage.

(4) For the sake of uniting some prominent Arab tribes who often were
at logger heads with each other and to safeguard the internal political
status of Islam.

The Prophet married \`Aishah daughter of Abu Bakr from the tribe of
Bani Tim, Hafsah daughter of \`Umar ibn AI-Khattab from the tribe of
Adi, Umm-Habibah daughter of Abu Sufyan from the tribe of Umayyah,
Safiyah daughter of Huaiy bin Akhtab of the Jewish tribe of Bani
an-Nadir, and Maymunah from the tribe of Bani Makhzum.

Umm-Habibah (i.e. Ramla) was daughter of Abu Sufyan of Bani Umayyah who
was the bitte- rest enemy of the Prophet and had repeatedly fought
against him.

She, as a Muslim, was in great distress since she was divorced from her
original husband (who had become a Christian in Abyssi- nia) and her
father was a great enemy of Islam.

Seeing her deprived of every help from parent and divorced from
husband, the Prophet married her in sympathy. This marriage also gave a
chance to the people of Bani Umayyah to soften their hearts for Islam.

Safiyah was widowed daughter of Huaiy bin Akhtab, one of the chiefs of
Jewish tribe of Bani an-Nadir.

When the prisoners of this tribe were released by the Muslims, the
Prophet married her in order to safeguard her status; and, thus, also
linking himself with one of the great Jewish tri- bes of that time, and
paving the way for , them to come nearer to Islam.

Maymdnah was 51 years of age and from a prominent tribe of Bani Makhzum
whom the Prophet married in the year 7 after Hijrah. The above marital
history of the Prophet clearly shows the ndble aim and objectives for
which he married a number of wives.

It i s not diffi cult to see that none of these marriages was for
personal satisfaction of sexual desires as unjusti- fiably accused by
the Christian writers.

Also, it is important to remember that all of these marriages, except
that with \`Aishah, were contracted with women who were widowed not only
once, but often twice or thrice.
