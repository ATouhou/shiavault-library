Q 70: Why Pray One Salah Soon After the Other?
==============================================

The Muslims have to pray five times a day. But it has been conventional
in the Shi'a world to pray 3 times a day, i.e., in the morning,
afternoon (Zuhr + Asr); and at night (Maghrib & Isha) Why is this so?

A. It is better (and it earns more thawab) to say the five prayers
separately; but it is also allowed to pray 'Asr soon after Zuhr and
'Isha soon after Maghrib. The Shi'as generally takes advantage of this
permission,

**Q71: PRAYER OF A MAN WHO ATE "NAJIS" FOOD**

Eating Najis food has a penalty of 40 days prayers, isn't it? For a man
who is to live in boarding house where there is a common mess, what will
happen? Is it that he will be penalised 3 (least number of meals a day)
x 40 penalties (for each food) X2 (No. of years he is supposed to be
there) X 365 (No. of days in a year), i.e. 3 x 40 x 365 x 2 days
penalty. (One of the traditions says "Go even upto China in search of
knowledge") A. For your information, this tradition is about the
knowledge of religion only.

So far as the eating of Najis food is concerned, it has its own
penalty. But it does not mean that you should neglect your prayer for so
many days. It is one thing to say, "Your prayers will not be rewarded";
and quite another to say, "you did not pray".

Because if you did not pray then you would be liable to punishment for
"not praying", which is one of the most serious sins in Islam. On the
other hand, if you prayed but your prayers were "not accepted" (i.e. not
rewarded) at least you would be immune from the punishment of "not
having said your prayers".

**Q72: HOW TO THANK ALLAH?**

Please show me some ways of expressing thanks to Allah, that is if
there is any particular way of prayer or reading, Du'a for shukr
(Thanking Allah)?

A. The easiest way of thanking Allah is to say "Al-Hamdu Lillah". Also;
you may do Sajdah of "Shukr" or recite 2 Rak'ah prayer of "Shukr". If
Allah has given you something, then the best way of thanking Him is to
share it with His servants with open heart i.e. not for making a show
but only for the Love of Allah.

If white colour cotton is not available, can we use any other colour in
cotton, like cream, or

**Q75: KAFAN IMPORTED FROM KARBALA**

It is said that we should not use Karbala's Kafan, because there is a
possibility of its becoming Najis after some days in the grave, and
there are so many "Ayats" written on the "Kafan". Is this correct?

A. Yes, you should not use that cloth as Kafan, because of the
difficulty mentioned in your question. But you may put that "Kafan" on
the chest of "Mayyit" above the usual Kafan.

**Q 76: ONE KAFAN AND TWO MAYYITS**

I have one person's kafan, and there are two deaths in house, mother's
and wife's. Now to whom should I give kafan first, and why?

A. Kafan of a wife is wajib (obligatory) on the husband. Other people's
Kafan is wajib from the inheritance left by them. Therefore, in the
situation mentioned in the question, that Kafan would be given to the
wife. So far as the mother is concerned, if she has left money or a
thing sufficient for the Kafan, then the Kafan would be provided from
it. Otherwise, the same clothes she had at the time of death should be
used as Kafan for her.

Of course, it is an act of highest thawab to give Kafan to a believer.
That is doubly emphasized in the case of relatives. Therefore, you
should obtain her Kafan even if you have to take loan. Otherwise, other
believers should give her Kafan.

**Q77: WHY POUR WATER ON GRAVE?**

What does it mean to pour water, or to plant flowers or plants, on the
graves? A. To pour water on the grave after burial is Sunnah. According
to some Ahadith, it is Sunnah to do so upto 40 days. It has one
pragmatic and one spiritual significance. Water strengthens the grave;
and also it is a symbol of the Mercy of Allah. Planting flowers or
plants has no basis in Shari'ah. It is an innovation which should be
avoided.

**Q 78: CEMENTED GRAVE**

Why do we build graves with cement etc.? Is it not a loss of cement and
bricks which we can use for building say, a school?

A. In Islam to build graves in such a way is frowned upon (Makruh). Of
course the earth should be filled in the grave firmly. So that there is
no danger of incursion from animals etc.; but building it with bricks,
cement etc. is disliked.

When a grave begins to cave in it is 'Makruh' to repair it. Nature
should be left to take its course. (Of course, if any part of the dead
body is still intact, then the grave should be refilled with earth). The
graves of the prophets. Imams, martyrs etc. do not come under this rule.
They should be repaired.

**Q79: IS FATEHA KHWANI AN ISLAMIC CUSTOM?**

Is fateha Khani" an Islamic custom? A poor man has to arrange a decent
tea for all those who come to console on the sad demise of his relative.
Is this fair? Further, can we celebrate the 20th, 30th or 40th of the
death anniversary of a person or even of an Imam? A. Fateha Khwani means
reciting Sura-e-Fatiha (and the Holy Qur'an) for the thawab of the
deceased.

It is not only allowed but also is very highly recommended. And it can
be performed on any day. If someone offers tea etc., to the
participants, it is his own generosity. If he does not have money to
offer any refreshment it, he should not take loan and should not burden
himself in any way.
