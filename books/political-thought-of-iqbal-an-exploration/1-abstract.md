Abstract:
=========

Allama Muhammad Iqbal is a celebrated philosopher, mystic, theologian,
politician, and a wisdom poet of modern Muslim world. He struggled for
the academic enhancement, moral development, political independence,
solidarity, freedom, and sovereignty of the Muslim world. He put his
emphasis on philosophy and science i.e. along with revelation. Although
Iqbal has derived his political vision from the teachings of Quran but
he enriched it with all treasuries of knowledge of the East and the West
specifically with the vision of Syed Jamal al Din Afghani. He admired
Afghani as the genius of modern Muslim world. According to Quran,
politics and affairs of state are a section of the multidimensional
teachings of Islam. To fulfill the will of God, to govern the system of
state, to provide equal opportunities to all beings with all justice,
and to maintain peace, harmony, and discipline in this world, Islam
provides a political guidance. Iqbal tried to reevaluate it according to
the needs of time.
