Introduction
============

Western concepts of God have ranged from the detached transcendent
demiurge of Aristotle to the pantheism of Spinoza.

Nevertheless, much of western thought about God has fallen within some
broad form of theism.

Theism is the view that God is unlimited with regard to knowledge
(omniscience), power (omnipotence), extension (omnipresence), and moral
perfection; and is the creator and sustainer of the universe.

Though regarded as sexless, God has traditionally been referred to by
the masculine pronoun.

Concepts of God in philosophy are entwined with concepts of God in
religion.

This is most obvious in figures like Augustine and Aquinas, who sought
to bring more rigor and consistency to concepts found in religion.

Others, like Leibniz and Hegel, interacted constructively and deeply
with religious concepts.

Even those like Hume and Nietzsche, who criticized the concept of God,
dealt with religious concepts.

While Western philosophy has interfaced most obviously with
Christianity, Judaism and Islam have had some influence.

The orthodox forms of all three religions have embraced theism, though
each religion has also yielded a wide array of other views.

Philosophy has shown a similar variety.

For example, with regard to the initiating cause of the world, Plato
and Aristotle held God to be the crafter of uncreated matter.

Plotinus regarded matter as emanating from God.

Spinoza, departing from his judaistic roots, held God to be identical
with the universe, while Hegel came to a similar view by reinterpreting
Christianity.

Issues related to Western concepts of God include the nature of divine
attributes and how they can be known, if or how that knowledge can be
communicated, the relation between such knowledge and logic, the nature
of divine causality, and the relation between the divine and the human
will.


**A. Sources of Western Concepts of God**

Sources of western concepts of the divine have been threefold:
experience, revelation, and reason.

Reported experiences of God are remarkably varied and have produced
equally varied concepts of the divine being.

Experiences can be occasioned by something external and universally
available, such as the starry sky, or by something external and private,
such as a burning bush.

Experiences can be internal and effable, such as a vision, or internal
and ineffable, as is claimed by some mystics.

Revelation can be linked to religious experience or a type of it, both
for the person originally receiving it and the one merely accepting it
as authoritative.

Those who accept its authority typically regard it as a source of
concepts of the divine that are more detailed and more accurate than
could be obtained by other means.

Increasingly, the modern focus has been on the complexities of the
process of interpretation (philosophical hermeneutics) and the extent to
which it is necessarily subjective.

Revelation can be intentionally unconnected to reason such that it is
accepted on bare faith (fideism; cf. Kierkegaard), or at the other
extreme, can be grounded in reason in that it is accepted because and
only insofar as it is reasonable (cf. , Locke). Reason has been taken as
ancillary to religious experience and revelation, or on other accounts,
as independent and the sole reliable source of concepts of God.

Each of the three sources of concepts of God has had those who regard
it as the sole reliable basis of our idea of the divine.

By contrast, others have regarded two or three of the sources as
interdependent and mutually reinforcing.

Regardless of these differing approaches, theism broadly construed has
been a dominant theme for much of the history of Western thought.


**B. Historical Overview**

**1. Greeks**

At the dawn of philosophy, the Ionian Greeks sought to understand the
true nature of the cosmos and its manifestations of both change and
permanence.

To Heraclitus, all was change and nothing endured, whereas to
Parmenedes, all change was apparent.

The Pythagorians found order and permanence in mathematics, giving it
religious significance as ultimate being.

The Stoics identified order with divine reason.

To Plato, God is transcendent-the highest and most perfect being-and
one who uses eternal forms, or archetypes, to fashion a universe that is
eternal and uncreated.

The order and purpose he gives the universe is limited by the
imperfections inherent in material.

Flaws are therefore real and exist in the universe; they are not merely
higher divine purposes misunderstood by humans.

God is not the author of everything because some things are evil.

We can infer that God is the author of the punishments of the wicked
because those punishments benefit the wicked.

God, being good, is also unchangeable since any change would be for the
worse.

For Plato, this does not mean (as some later Christian thought held)
that God is the ground of moral goodness; rather, whatever is good is
good in an of itself.

God must be a first cause and a self-moved mover otherwise there will
be an infinite regress to causes of causes.

Plato is not committed to monotheism, but suggests for example that
since planetary motion is uniform and circular, and since such motion is
the motion of reason, then a planet must be driven by a rational soul.

These souls that drive the planets could be called gods.

Aristotle made God passively responsible for change in the world in the
sense that all things seek divine perfection.

God imbues all things with order and purpose, both of which can be
discovered and point to his (or its) divine existence.

From those contingent things we come to know universals, whereas God
knows universals prior to their existence in things.

God, the highest being (though not a loving being), engages in perfect
contemplation of the most worthy object, which is himself.

He is thus unaware of the world and cares nothing for it, being an
unmoved mover.

God as pure form is wholly immaterial, and as perfect he is unchanging
since he cannot become more perfect.

This perfect and immutable God is therefore the apex of being and
knowledge.

God must be eternal.

That is because time is eternal, and since there can be no time without
change, change must be eternal.

And for change to be eternal the cause of change-the unmoved mover-must
also be eternal.

To be eternal God must also be immaterial since only immaterial things
are immune from change.

Additionally, as an immaterial being, God is not extended in space.

The Neo-Platonic God of Plotinus (204/5-270 A. D). is the source of the
universe, which is the inevitable overflow of divinity.

In that overflow, the universe comes out of God (ex deo) in a timeless
process.

It does not come by creation because that would entail consciousness
and will, which Plotinus claimed would limit God.

The first emanation out of God (nous) is the highest, successive
emanations being less and less real.

Finally, evil is matter with no form at all, and as such has no
positive existence.

God is an impersonal It who can be described only in terms of what he
is not.

This negative way of describing God (the via negativa) survived well
into the middle ages.

Though God is beyond description, Plotinus (perhaps paradoxically)
asserted a number of things, such as that virtue and truth inhere in
God.

Because for Plotinus God cannot be reached intellectually, union with
the divine is ecstatic and mystical.

His thought influenced a number of Christian mystics, such as Meister
Eckhart (1260-1327).

**2. Early Christian Thought**

Early Christians regarded Greek religion as holding views unworthy of
God, but they were divided as to Greek philosophy.

Christian philosopher Justin Martyr (c. 100-c. 165) saw Christianity as
compatible with the highest and best Greek thought, whereas Tertullian
(c. 160-c. 225) dismissed philosophy, saying that Jerusalem (faith)
could have nothing to do with Athens (philosophy).

Having been born out of Judaism, Christianity was unambiguously
monotheistic and affirmed that God created the material of the universe
out of nothing (ex nihilo). But it also affirmed the Trinity as
multiplicity within unity, a view it regarded as implicit in Judaism.

Consistent with theism, Augustine (354-430) regarded God as omniscient,
omnipotent, omnipresent, morally good, the creator (ex nihilo) and
sustainer of the universe.

Despite these multiple descriptors, God is uniquely simple.

Being entirely free, he did not have to create, but did so as an act of
love.

As his creation, it reflects his mind.

Time and space began at creation, and everything in creation is good.

Evil is uncreated, being a lack of good and without positive
existence.

Though God is not responsible for evil even it has a purpose: to show
forth what is good, especially what is good within God.

Augustine developed a theme found as early as Plato, Aristotle, and
Zeno of Citium, that God is a perfect being.

After enumerating a hierarchy of excellencies (things to be
"preferred") Augustine affirms that God "lives in the highest sense" and
is "the most powerful, most righteous, most beautiful, most good, most
blessed" (On the Trinity, XV, 4). When we think of God, we "attempt to
conceive something than which nothing more excellent or sublime exists"
(Christian Doctrine, I, 7, 7).

But where Aristotle concluded that the greatest being must be aware
only of himself, Augustine emphasized an opposite and distinctly
Christian theme: God loves creatures supremely to the point of becoming
incarnate in Christ in order to be revealed to them and to reconcile
them to himself.

Moreover, God is providentially active in history, from an individual
level (Confessions) on up to dealings with entire nations (City of God).
So as to the important subject of God's relationship to the world,
Christian thought could not be more opposite Aristotle's view of a Being
who contemplates only himself.

John Scotus Erigena (c. 810-c. 877) had stronger affinities for
Neo-Platonic thought.

God created the universe according to eternal patterns in his mind and
it is an expression of his thought, however incomplete an expression the
cosmos may be.

Erigena's pantheistic tendencies can be seen in his notion that God
creates out of himself and "God is in all things.

" Creation is not in time but is eternal.

In the process God used universals and made them particulars (e.g.,
humanity became individual persons). Immortality is the reverse process
of particulars going back to universals.

In Erigena's terms, division is the process of differentiating
universals into particulars; analysis is the reverse, a return to unity
and thus to God.

These are not mere mental activities but mirror reality and God's
relationship to the world.

God is ultimately unknowable, being beyond all language and
categories.

Aristotle's predicates and categories cannot apply to God because they
assume some type of substance.

Nevertheless God can be described, albeit inadequately, using both
positive and negative statements.

Positive statements are only approximate but can be made more exact by
adding negative statements.

For example, it can be said that God is good (positive), but also that
he is not good (negative) in that he is above goodness.

These can be combined in the statement that he is "supergood.

" In spite of these approximations, God must be reached by mystical
experience.

**3. Medieval Thought**

Islamic Neoplatonist al-Farabi (875-950) held that universals are in
things and have no existence apart from particulars.

Objects are contingent in that they may or may not exist; they do not
have to exist.

Therefore there must be something that has to exist-that exists
necessarily-to ground the existence of all other (contingent) things.

This being is God.

The world evolves by emanation, and matter is a phase of that
process.

The potential in matter is made actual, and over time God brings out
its form.

Thought is one emanation from God, and through it knowledge arises in
humans.

The actualized human intellect becomes an immortal substance.

Avicenna (Ibn Sina; 980-1037), a Muslim, also distinguished between God
as the one necessary being and all other things, which are contingent.

The world is an emanation from God as the outworking of his
self-knowledge.

As such it is eternal and necessary.

God must be eternal and simple, existing without multiplicity.

In their essence, things do not contain anything that accounts for
their existence.

They are hierarchically arranged such that the existence of each thing
is accounted for by something ontologically higher.

At the top is the one being whose existence is necessary.

From contingent things we come to know universals, whereas God knows
universals prior to their existence in things.

Al-Ghazali (1058-1111) challenged any joining of theology and
philosophy, holding that because the mind and senses are subject to
error, truth must come by divine grace.

Rather than the world existing necessarily in a Neoplatonic sense, it
exists by the will of God alone.

It is in no way autonomous, and even causal relationships are
non-necessary.

He rejected as un-Islamic Avicenna's view that things like souls or
intellects could be eternal.

Anselm (1033-1109), archbishop of Canterbury, raised the perfect being
concept to a new level by making it the foundation of his celebrated
ontological argument.

He accepted that God is the highest level of being under which there
are, by degrees, lesser and lesser beings.

Similar to Plato, Anselm assumes the realist view that entities which
share an attribution, such as "good," also share in being.

And somewhere there must be a perfection of that being (e.g., perfect
goodness). That perfection is God.

Though a Muslim and an Aristotelian, Averroes (Ibn Rushd; 1126-1198)
added to the growing concept of emanation by claiming that the universal
mind is an emanation from God.

Humans participate in this universal mind and only it, not the soul, is
immortal.

The mind of the common person understands religious symbols in a
literal way, whereas the philosopher interprets them allegorically.

Consequently, something understood as true philosophically may be
untrue theologically, and vice versa.

Working from Judaism, Maimonides (1135-1204) accepted creation rather
than an eternal universe.

He drew from philosophic traditions to formulate three proofs based on
the nature of God, and these were developed further by Aquinas.

Following Aristotle Maimonides demonstrated the existence of a Prime
Mover, and with some inspiration from Avicenna, the existence of a
necessary being.

He also showed God to be a primary cause.

Though he considered God's existence demonstrable, he held that nothing
positive could be said about God.

Bonaventura (John of Fidanza, c. 1221-1274) argued that the Aristotlean
denial of Platonic ideas would entail that God knows himself but not the
world.

As such God could not be its creator.

Furthermore, because some change in the universe is cyclic and
therefore unexplainable by chance, change would have to be
deterministic.

But this would deny God's providence as well as human moral
responsibility.

So a proper concept of God must include Platonic ideas.

Reason can prove God as creator since an eternal universe entails both
that the amount of time of its existence is infinite and that it is
increasing.

Yet there cannot be both an infinite and a larger infinite (a view not
held in modern times).

Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) accepted both Aristotle and Christian
revelation.

He accepted both reason and revelation as sources of knowledge of
God.

Over the neo-Platonic notion of a hierarchy of reality in which lower
existences are less real and a mere shadow of the divine, Aquinas
accepted gradations of form and matter.

Atop the hierarchy is God as pure form and no matter.

As pure actuality and no potentiality, he is perfect and therefore
changeless.

He is also pure intelligence and pure activity.

To these Aristotelian concepts Aquinas added Christian convictions that
God is loving, providential, and ruler of the universe.

Reason and revelation are in harmony because they have the same divine
source, and revelation is not unreasonable.

Perception is also in harmony because the world's origins are divine.

This being the case, God as cause can be known through the world as
effect.

For this reason empirical facts ground Aquinas's theistic proofs.

The God that can be known in part from the universe is fundamentally
different from it.

Only God is identical to his essence, being neither more nor less than
it.

By contrast, a being such as Socrates is transcended by humanity
because there are other people.

On the other hand, Socrates has qualities ("accidents") that are not
part of his essence; for example, he may be sitting.

So unlike God, Socrates is both greater than and less than his
essence.

There is nothing that transcends God so nothing is greater than his
essence.

And there are no accidents in God because accidents are caused by
something else (just as part of the cause of Socrates sitting is a
chair).

God is not (completely) knowable because he is not material, whereas
our knowledge is normally dependent on our senses.

Furthermore, we normally know things by knowing their genus and
species, yet God is unique and so cannot be known in that way.

We can know something of God the negative way (via negativa) by
removing limits, concluding for example, that God is unmoved, and
unlimited by space.

What we can know of God positively is neither exactly like our
knowledge of temporal things (univocal) nor entirely different
(equivocal). Rather, it is analogical, being in some ways the same and
in other ways different.

God knows x in a way that is both like and unlike the way in which
Socrates knows x.

God knows, but in a way that is, among other things, complete,
immediate, and timeless.

That God created is evident (though not provable) because a material
universe cannot emanate from an immaterial being.

The universe exists to manifest God, who created the fullest possible
range of beings because in them he can be revealed to the fullest
extent.

Beings range from angels, who are immaterial; to humans, who are
material and immaterial; to animals, who are purely material (and both
eat and move); to plants, to inanimate objects.

God as primary cause works through such created things as secondary
causes.

Nevertheless, creatures with a will remain free and responsible.

God can also work apart from secondary causes in what we call
miracles.

Being good, God created the best possible world in the sense that it
has the best kinds of things.

Evil is a privation or lack of good and as such God did not cause it
the way he causes other things.

So we cannot ask why God brought about evil, but we can ask why he did
not bring about more good.

He did not bring about more good in order that he could be revealed
through the greatest range of things, and as well, to allow for certain
types of good (such as compassion, which can exist only where there is
some suffering).

Aquinas and others grounded the scholastic synthesis of knowledge in
the view that truth, morality, and God himself could be known by reason
because the divine will itself is guided by reason.

What is reasonable is therefore what is true and right.

But John Duns Scotus (1265-1308) claimed that in humans and in God it
is the will--not the intellect--that is primary.

Evidence of this is that a being must will what to think about, thus
something must act on the intellect; whereas nothing need act on the
will.

The view entails that there is no reason why God acts or wills as he
does.

This makes truth and morality essentially arbitrary and thereby
unknowable through reason.

God could have willed different moral standards.

Scotus's view makes our knowledge of God a matter of revelation and
faith, not of reason.

Another concept about God's will further destabilized the medieval
world view.

William of Ockham (1285-1347) held that omnipotence means God can do
literally anything.

Accordingly, a person could perceive something by sheer act of divine
will, without the object being there at all.

On his view, faith and reason can be contradictory.

Ockham's "razor" sought to cut from explanations those entities that
are unverifiable thereby making simpler explanations preferred.

This was later used to cut out of world views such things as divine
purposes, which had been central to explanations since the Greeks.

Eventually, even concepts of a divine being would be optional--or even
unnecessary--to explanations and world views.

The connection between reason and God was further undermined by Meister
Eckhart's (1260-1327/28) view that God is "above being" and that human
unity with the divine must be suprarational.

Knowledge is a matter of proceeding from particulars to unity, beyond
which is a unity with the divine surpassing all differences, "a silent
desert.

" The divine being is therefore inexpressible.

God knows all things in their unity, timelessly; but on our temporal
level it makes sense to differentiate time as well as events.
