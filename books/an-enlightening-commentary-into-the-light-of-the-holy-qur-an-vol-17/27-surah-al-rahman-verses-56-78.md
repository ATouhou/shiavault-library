Surah al-Rahman - Verses 56-57
------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

***56. In both Gardens of Paradise shall be chaste females restraining
their glances, desiring none except their husbands with whom no man or
jinni has had intercourse.***  
***57. Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?***

Five Divine Blessings of the twain Gardens in Paradise were enumerated
in the preceding blessed Verses and the blessed Verse 56 treats of the
six Blessing – chaste spouses in Paradise. The blessed Verse is saying
that there shall be women in those palaces in Paradise who restraining
their glances solely look at their husbands and love no one but them and
no jinni or man has ever touched them. Thus, they shall be virgin and
undefiled in any respect.

It is narrated on the authority of Abudhar Ghaffari that the woman in
Paradise shall say unto her husband:

*"By the Glory of my Lord! I find nothing better than you in Paradise.
Praise be to God Almighty Who married me unto you."*[^1]

The Arabic word tarf denotes "eyelid" and since eyelids move while
glancing, it figuratively connotes "glance." Thus, the expression
qasirat al-tarf denotes "[females] restraining [their] glances"
connoting that they love their husbands.

It is one of the best merits of a woman to solely think of her husband
and only love him. The Arabic verbal form yatmithhunna ("they
menstruate") deriving from t-m-th ("menstruate, deflorate") ad hoc
connotes that females in Paradise shall be virgin.

The blessed Verse 57, addressed to jinn and men, poses the question
anew:

***"Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both deny?"***

Surah al-Rahman - Verses 58-59

***58. They are like rubies and coral.***  
***59. Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?***

The blessed Verse 58 further depicts spouses in Paradise saying that
they are like rubies in terms of rosiness and purity and like coral in
terms of whiteness and beauty. When the colors of rubies and coral,
namely red and white, intermingle, a very beauteous color will be
produced.

Ruby is a mineral which is usually red in color. Coral is a marine
animal like branches and twigs of trees whose colors include white and
red, but the white kind is seemingly intended herein.

The blessed Verse 59 again asks the question:

***"Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?"***

Surah al-Rahman - Verses 60-61

***60. Is there any reward for good other than good?***  
***61. Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?***

By the word good (ihsan) mentioned herein, doing righteous good deeds
and doing good to others are intended.[^2]

Imam Sadiq (as) said:

*"The blessed Verse*

***'Is there any reward for good other than good'***

*applies to believers and disbelievers, since whoever does good to
another, the latter is supposed to return the good done to him."*[^3]

Imam ‘Ali narrates from the Messenger of Allah (S) that God Almighty
said:

*"Is the reward of the one to whom I have bestowed Favor is other than
Paradise?"*[^4]

In short the blessed Verse in question is saying that those who have
done righteous good deeds in this world shall be granted Divine Rewards.

The blessed Verse 61 repeats the question:

***"Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?"***

Surah al-Rahman - Verses 62-63

***62. And besides these two Gardens, there are two other Gardens.***  
***63. Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?***

Resuming the discussion the two Gardens in Paradise in store for the God
fearing and the enumeration of Divine Blessings, the blessed Verse 62
makes mention of two Gardens in Paradise located on a lower level
reserved naturally for those who are on a lower level of belief in and
fearing God Almighty.

In other words, there is a hierarchy in terms of belief in God Almighty
and doing righteous good deeds. Thus, the blessed Verse in question is
saying that two other Gardens are to be found on a level lower than that
of the aforementioned Gardens. There are two interpretations for the
blessed Verse one of which was already mentioned.

According to the other interpretation, the phrase:

***"besides these two"***

(min dunihima) connotes that there are two other Gardens for the same
believers who may enjoy themselves in those two Gardens as well, since
man seeks diversity by nature and is delighted by the same. Nonetheless,
taking into account the contextual meaning and the traditions narrated
regarding the interpretation of the blessed Verse in question, the
former interpretation is seemingly more consistent.

Thus, according to a tradition narrated from Imam Sadiq (as):[^5]

*"Do not say that Paradise is one since God Almighty says that besides
those two Paradises, there are two others. Do not say either that there
is solely one level, since God Almighty says some levels are higher than
others and the difference in levels is a matter of degrees."*

In this vein, there is a Prophetic tradition according to which

*"Two Paradises are from gold for those near to God Almighty and two
Paradises for the people of the Right Hand."*

The blessed Verse 63 poses the oft-repeated rhetorical question:

***"Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?"***

***64. [The two Gardens appear] dark green [in color owing to the
density of trees].***  
***65. Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?***

The Arabic word madhamma deriving from d-h-m is cognate with idhimam
denoting raven black color herein connoting a garden seeming black due
to the density of its trees. Since such color reflects utmost freshness
of plants and trees, the expression designates utmost verdure of the
twain Paradises.

According to a number of traditions, water, verdure, and beauty engender
happiness and delight.[^6]

The blessed Verse 65 further asks:

***"Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?"***

Surah al-Rahman - Verses 66-67

***66. In the two Gardens shall be two springs gushing forth.***  
***67. Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?***

The Arabic word nadhdhakh denotes:

***"gushing forth."***

Thus, the blessed Verse 67 is saying that in those two Gardens, two
springs shall be gushing forth. It goes without saying that looking at
natural landscapes is the best delight. Water is a Blessing and its
gushing forth is another Blessing.

The blessed Verse 67 further poses the rhetorical question:

***"Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?"***

Surah al-Rahman - Verses 68-69

***68. In the two Gardens there shall be fruits and date-palms and
pomegranates.***  
***69. Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?***

Regarding the fruits of Paradise, the blessed Verse 68 is saying that
there is abundance of fruits and those like dates and pomegranates in
the two Gardens. The Arabic word fakiha is certainly quite broad in its
range of senses encompassing all kinds of fruit, but the significance of
dates and pomegranates are mentioned owing to their significance.

Some Qur’anic exegetes falsely maintain that semantically speaking, the
Arabic word fakiha excludes dates and pomegranates. Lexicographers
disagree with this baseless view. Basically, specific in lieu of general
in cases of expressing privileges and merits is quite common. In short,
dates and pomegranates have their prime of place among fruits in
Paradise, since they are rich in vitamins.[^7]

The blessed Verse 69 repeats the rhetorical question:

***"Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?"***

***70. There shall be women of fair face and good character in those
Gardens.***  
***71. Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?***

The blessed Verse 70 further treats of other Divine Blessings, saying
that there shall be women fair of face and good of character in these
two Paradises. The Arabic word khayr generally connotes spiritual and
immaterial good and beauty and the word husn generally designates beauty
of looks and appearance.

A tradition narrated regarding the exegesis of the blessed Verse in
question enumerates many good characteristics for women in Paradise
which may allude to those of women in this world and serve as a model
for all women.

Such characteristics include: kindness in speech, cleanliness and
purity, restraining from inflicting harms on others, and turning away
their glances from those outside the circle of kinship. In short, all
the physical and non-physical beauties expected in a desirable spouse
may be found in them.

Likewise the blessed Qur’anic Verse expresses such good characteristics
in a terse phrase:

***"of fair face and good characters"***

(khayrat hisan).

According to a Prophetic tradition:

*"Women in Paradise have fair faces and good characters."*[^8]

It is also mentioned in narrations that:

***"of fair face and good characters"***

refers to righteous good women in this world who shall be fairer than
wide-eyed huri's in Paradise.[^9]

The blessed Verse 71 repeats the question:

***"Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?"***

Surah al-Rahman - Verses 72-73

***72. Wide-eyed huri's of Paradise guarded in pavilions.***  
***73. Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?***

Further depicting the women in Paradise, the blessed Verse 72 is saying
that they are huris guarded in pavilions in Paradise. The word hur is
the plural of hawra’ denoting a woman the pupils whose eyes are raven
black and the whiteness is quite transparent. It is also applied to
women of fair complexion. The word maqsurat connotes that they only
belong to their husbands and they are well guarded from others.

The Arabic word khiyam is the plural of khayma denoting:

*"pavilion."*

According to Islamic traditions, pavilions in Paradise are unlike those
of this world in terms of vastness and beauty. It also worthy of note
that according to lexicographers and lexicologists, the Arabic word
khayma, besides denoting pavilion and tent, is also applied to wooden or
any round dwelling place.

It is also said that the Arabic word designates dwelling places which
are made of stones and the like.[^10]

The blessed Verse 74 reiterates the rhetorical question:

***"Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?"***

Surah al-Rahman - Verses 74-75
------------------------------

</blockquote>

***74. Whom no man or jinni has touched before people of Paradise.***  
***75. Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?***

The blessed Verse 74 enumerates another characteristic of huris in
Paradise, saying that they have been touched neither by any jinni nor by
any man. In other words, they are virgin.

Thus, by:

***"women of fair face and good characters"***

good and righteous women of this world are intended who have solely
intercourse with their husbands.

However,

***"untouched"***

(lam yatmithhunna) is the attribute of huris in Paradise.

According to other Qur’anic Verses, men and women who are married to
each other and are amongst the believers and the people of Paradise
shall join each other in Paradise and shall enjoy their lives in the
best manner there. According to traditions, owing to their invocations
and righteous good deeds, such women are more exalted than huris in
Paradise.[^11]

The blessed Verse 75 poses the oft-repeated question:

***"Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?"***

***76. Reclining on couches covered by the best and the most beautiful
green fabrics.***  
***77. Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?***

The blessed Verse 76 provides the last depiction of the Blessings in
Paradise, saying that the inhabitants of the twain Paradises recline on
couches covered by the best and the fairest green fabrics.

The Arabic word rafraf originally denotes spread tree leaves, but it is
figuratively applied to beautiful and colorful fabrics which are similar
to garden landscapes. The word ‘abqari originally denotes any rare or
unrivalled person or thing.

Thus, the word is applied to scholars rare amongst people. It is also
said that ‘Abqar was the name of a city in which silk fabrics were
made.[^12] The original sense is obsolete and the Arabic word ‘abqari
refers to an ingenious person who is hard to find. The Arabic word hisan
is the plural form of hasan denoting "good, beautiful."

In short, all these expressions reflect that all things in Paradise,
including fruits, food, palaces, mansions, carpets, and couches are all
the best and unrivaled in terms of quality. However, it is worthy of
note that such expressions may not fully express such great and unique
concepts but they solely reflect shadows of them same.

The blessed Verse 77 poses the oft-repeated rhetorical question for the
last time:

***"Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and
men] deny?"***

It is saying that immaterial or even material Blessings in this world or
Blessings of Paradise have encompassed you, but at times, owing to
vanity and neglect, you consign them to oblivion and forget the One Who
bestows all these Blessings and also those which you expect to fall into
your share in future. Which of these Blessings do you deny?

Surah al-Rahman - Verse 78
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
تَبَارَكَ اسْمُ رَبِّكَ ذِی الْـجَلَآلِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***78. Blessed is the Name of your Lord, the Owner of Majesty and
Honor.***

All Blessings, beauties, rewards, and recompenses are manifestations of
Divine Lordship. Thus, the last blessed Verse of the Chapter in question
is saying that the Name of your Lord Who is Majestic and Glorious is
Blessed and Intransient. The Arabic word tabarak is cognate with bark
denoting "camel breast."

Since camels lie down somewhere without moving and their breasts touch
the earth, the word connotes constancy and intransience. As remaining
capital engenders many a benefit, useful things are referred to as
mubarak, the worthiest being for such designation is the Pure Divine
Essence, the Source of all Good and Blessings.

Thus, the blessed Verse in question is saying that Great and Glorious is
the Name of your Lord Who is the Absolute Owner of Glory, Greatness,
Magnanimity, Graciousness, and Bountifulness. The blessed Chapter opened
with the Divine Attribute "the Most Gracious" (Rahman) denoting the
Vastness of Bounties and Graciousness of the One Lord, following which
different kinds of His Bounties and Blessings are enumerated.

The blessed Chapter ends in the Name of the Owner of Glory and
Greatness, connoting that what He bestows springs solely from His
Greatness and reflects His Glory and Magnanimity.

It is saying that you are supposed to glorify the Origin of Bounties by
praising His Attributes of Glory and Greatness.

Some Qur’anic exegetes say that His Name alludes to all His Attributes
and His Attributes are in His Pure Essence and the expression:

***"Owner of Majesty and Glory"***

makes a reference to all His Most Beautiful and Glorious Attributes.

***"Owner of Majesty"***

alludes to His Negative Attributes and "Owner of Glory" refers to His
Positive Attributes.

It would be of interest to read a few traditions in this vein.

It is narrated from the Noble Prophet of Islam (S) that someone invoked
God Almighty in his presence, saying:

***"O Owner of Majesty and Glory!"***

The Noble Prophet (S) said:

*"Now that you invoked God Almighty by this Attribute, your prayer shall
be answered. You ask Him to grant you anything you desire."*[^13]

According to a Prophetic tradition, the Noble Prophet of Islam (S)
noticed that a man was standing while establishing prayers. Following
genuflexion (ruku‘), prostration (sujud), salam, and tashahHud, he
invoked God Almighty and called Him by His Attributes, Owner of Majesty,
Owner of Glory, the Living (Hayy), the Ever Standing (or Self-Existent;
Qayyum), the Noble Prophet (S) said:

*"This man called Allah by a Great Name that whenever one calls Him by
that Attribute, He shall answer his prayers."*[^14]

A tradition is narrated from Imam Baqir (as) regarding the exegesis of
the blessed Verse in question according to which he said:

*"We are Divine Majesty and Glory as He cherishes us by making his
servants obey us."*[^15]

It goes without saying that the family of the Prophet (S) solely calls
people unto God Almighty and obedience to Him. They are like guides and
beacons and life boats in the agitated sea of this mundane life. Thus,
they are the instances of Divine Bounties bestowed by the Owner of
Majesty and Glory, since God Almighty provides people with Guidance
through His friends.

*O Lord! You are the Owner of Majesty and Glory.* *By Your Majesty and
Glory! Do not deprive us from Bounties and Blessings of Paradise. O
Lord! We deny none of your Blessings, but consider ourselves encompassed
by them. Grant us Your Blessings at all times. Amen O Lord of the
worlds!*

in dates. Furthermore, some parts of date palms are rich in medicinal
ingredients. Regarding pomegranates, according to a number of Islamic
traditions, they are the best of fruits (sayyid al-fakiha; Bihar
al-Anwar, vol. 6, p. 63). Nutrition experts enumerate many qualities for
pomegranates, including refining the blood, richness in Vitamin C. Other
good qualities have also been mentioned for sweet and sour pomegranates,
including: strengthening the stomach, gums, the eyes, treatment of
choleric fevers, jaundice, scabies, chronic ulcers, and diarrhea.
According to a tradition narrated from Imam Sadiq (as): "Let your
children eat pomegranates as they lead to their faster growth" (Bihar
al-Anwar, vol. 66, p. 164). According to another tradition, "Eating
pomegranates by children makes them speak earlier" (Bihar al-Anwar, vol.
66, p. 165). It is also narrated from Imam Baqir (as) and Imam Sadiq
(as): "Pomegranates were the Messenger of Allah's (S) most favorite
fruit.” (Usul Kafi, vol .6, p. 352).
