Chapter 5 : Hadith Al-thaqalayn
===============================

Ahmad bin Hanbal says:

Aswad bin ‘Amir has related from Abi- Isra-’i-l, i.e. Isma-‘i-l bin
Abi- Isha-q Malaie, from ‘Atiyyah from Abi- Sa‘i-d who quotes the
Prophet as saying:

“Inni- ta-rikun fi-kum al-thaqalayn, ahaduhuma- akbaru min al-akhar,
Kitaballa-h hablun mamdudun min al-sama-’-i ila- al-arz wa ‘itrati-
Ahl-i Bayti-, wa annahuma- lan yaftaraqa- hatta- yarida- ‘alayya
al-hawz” (I am leaving among you two precious things, one of which is
greater than the other. The Book of Allah which is the rope extending
from the sky to the earth and my progeny my Ahl al-Bayt. And the two
will never part with each other until they return to me at the pool (of
kawthar in paradise).[^33]
