Chapter Xxiv : Mu’awiya Violates the Stipulations of the Peacemaking Part 2
===========================================================================

If the Kufans had prevented the Umayyad authorities from killing Hijr
and his companions, the Umayyads would not have been able to kill their
free, good ones. But, they were satisfied with inactivity and abasement
and they disliked the death in the way of Allah, so their affair was low
and they became humble, and the Umayyads did to them what they wanted
such as subjugating them to abasement and humiliation. Al-Rabee‘
remained astonished and weak. Sorrow tore his heart. On Friday he led
the people in Friday Prayer. After he had finished the prayer, he
addressed the people, saying: “O people, I am tired of life. I am going
to supplicate, so say: amen!” Allah responded to his supplication. He
died before he left the assembly.[^1]

**Al-Hasan al-Basri**

Al-Hasan al-Basri regarded the murder of Hijr as one of the four major
sins Mu’awiya had committed. He said regarding Hijr: “Woe unto him
(Mu’awiya) from Hijr and his companions.” He said that twice.[^2]

**Abdullah Bin Umar** Abdullah bin ‘Umar was terrified when he heard of
the murder of Hijr. He was told about his murder when he was in the
market. He was sitting. He got up and went away weeping with
bitterly.[^3]

Mu’awiya Bin Khudayj

Mu’awiya bin Khudayj[^4] , who was in the army in Africa, heard of the
painful news. He said to his people from Kinda who were with him: “Do
you not see that we fight on behalf of Quraysh and sacrifice our lives
to make firm their authority while they attack and kill our cousins?”
Indeed the murder of Hijr was among the grave incidents, a crack in
Islam, and an affliction against all the Arabs. Mu’awiya himself had no
doubt about that. He regarded him as a fearful person. He mentioned him
frequently during his privacy. He remembered him very much during his
illness of which

[^2] We have fully mentioned his speech along with his biography in the
chapters of the book.
[^3] Al-Isaba, vol. 1, p. 314.
[^4] His full name is Mo’awiya bin Khudayj bin Jaffna al-Sukuni. It was
said that (his surname) was al-Kindi. It was he who killed the
righteous, good servant (of Allah), Muhammed bin Abi Bakr, according to
the command of (‘Amr) bin al-‘Aas. He invaded Africa three times. This
has been mentioned in (the book) al-Isti‘ab, vol. 3, p. 389.

he died. He said: “Woe unto me because of you, O Hijr!” And he said:
“(I will face) a long day (because of) Ibn al-Addbar (Hijr).” He said
that three times.[^1] Yes, Mu’awiya will face a long day (before Allah)
because of his killing Hijr and the like of Hijr from among the
righteous believers whose blood he shed because of nothing except their
love for Ahl al-Bayt. With this we end our speech about the murder of
Hijr and his companions, that we may meet his other companions.

Rasheed al-Hijri

Rasheed al-Hijri is regarded as on top of the men of Islam in piety,
fear of Allah, knowledge, and excellence. He was a pupil in the school
of Imam Ali (a.s). He acquired a great deal of his knowledge and
sciences. Imam Ali (a.s) named him Rasheed al-Balaya (Rasheed of the
tribulations). Rasheed’s daughter, Qanu, narrated: “I heard my father
say: ‘(Imam Ali), the Commander of the faithful, said to me: ‘O Rasheed,
how will your endurance be when the bastard of the Umayyads (Ziyad) will
send for you and cut off your hands, your feet, and your tongue?’ ‘O
Commander of the faithful, will (I go to the) Garden at the end of
that?’ asked Rasheed. ‘O Rasheed, you are with me in this world and the
next world,’ retorted Imam Ali.”

Rasheed went with Imam Ali (a.s), to a garden. They sat in the shadow
of a date palm. The owner of the garden ascended a date palm. He took
some dates from the date palm and offered them to Imam Ali (a.s). The
Imam ate some of them. Rasheed turned to the Imam and said to him: “How
delicious these dates are!”

“You will be crucified on its trunk,” said the Imam. After this speech
Rasheed took care of the date palm of whose dates he ate. He gave it
water and served Allah beside it. One day he passed by it and saw that
its leaves had been cut off, so he felt that his appointed time was
close at hand. He passed by it again and saw that a half of it was put
over a small river, that the people might sit on it and take water. He
was sure that his inevitable appointed time approached.[^2] During that
terrible period of time, (Ziyad), son of Sumayya, sent for him. Rasheed
stood before Ziyad, and he said to him:

-What did your bosom friend (Imam Ali) say as to that we would do to
you?

-(He said that) you would cut off my hands and my feet, and that you
would crucify me.

[^1] Al-Tabari, Tarikh, vol. 6, p. 156.
[^2] Al-Ta‘liqat ‘alaa Minhajj al-Maqal, p. 140.

-By Allah, I will confute his statement. Set him free.

The police set Rasheed free. When he went out, Ziyad said to his
policemen: “Bring him back!” They brought him back to him. Ziyad turned
to him and said: “We can find for you nothing better than what your
leader (Imam Ali) said. You will bring about evil to us if you remain
alive. Cut off his hands and his feet.” The police cut off Rasheed’s
hands and feet. However Rasheed went on speaking. His speech enraged
Ziyad, and he said to his policemen: “Crucify him until death!” Rasheed
said to them: “I have something with you. I can see that you have not
done it -he meant that they did not cut out his tongue.” So (Ziyad), son
of Sumayya, ordered his tongue to be cut out. When they wanted to cut
out his tongue, he said to them: “Give me a time that I may say a
statement.” They gave him time, and he said: “By Allah, this is the
confirmation of the prediction of the Commander of the faithful (Imam
Ali), peace be on him. He told me that you would cut out my tongue.”
Then the policemen cut out his tongue.[^1]

What a sin did this great worshiper commit that he might deserve this
punishment and this horrible maiming? However (Ziyad), son of Sumayya,
and Mu’awiya wanted through that to destroy the Shia and to put an end
to Shiism.

Amr Bin al-Hamaq al-Khuza‘iy

Amr bin al-Hamaq had living, strong, religious feelings. He was among
the good companions (of the Prophet) in piety and fear of Allah. It was
he who gave the Prophet yogurt to drink. So the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and his family, invoked Allah for him to make him enjoy his youth.
Allah responded to the supplication of His Prophet. Amr became eighty
years old but none saw even a white hair in his beard.[^2]

Amr was among the choice, loyal companions of Imam Ali (a.s). Imam Ali
(a.s) invoked Allah for him, saying: “O Allah, enlighten his heart with
piety and guide him to Your straight path!”[^3] He (a.s) respected,
magnified, and preferred him to others. He said to him: “Would that I
had a hundred (fighters) like you among my troops!” Amr expressed his
obedience and loyalty to Imam Ali (a.s), saying: “O Commander of the
faithful, by Allah, I [^1] Safinat al-Bihar, vol. 1, p. 522. Al-Hafiz
al-Dhahabi has said: “Ziyad killed Rasheed al-Hijri, cut out his tongue,
and crucified him because he was a Shi‘ite (a follower of Imam Ali).”
[^2] Al-Isaba, vol. 2, p. 526.
[^3] Safinat al-Bihar, vol. 2, p. 360.

have not loved you for the life in this world nor for a position I have
in it. Rather I have loved you because of five qualities: You are the
first to believe (in Allah). You are the cousin of Allah’s Apostle, may
Allah bless him and his family. You are the greatest of the Muhajireen
and the Ansar. You are the husband of the mistress of the women of the
world (Fatima), peace be on her. And you are the father of the survival
progeny of Allah’s Apostle, may Allah bless him and his family. If I
covered the firm mountains and crossed the seas full of water to
undermine your enemy and make successful your proof, I would see that
this was little in comparison with your great right on me.”[^1]

His speech indicates his creed, faith, and great obedience to Imam Ali,
peace be on him. Through his speech he sought Allah’s pleasure and the
hereafter.

When Ziyad (bin Abeeh) became a governor over Kufa and pursued the Shia
(Imam Ali’s followers), Amr bin al-Hamaq al-Khuza‘iy was afraid of his
oppressive authority. So he and Rifa‘a bin Shaddad fled to al-Mada’in.
They stayed their for a period of time. Then they fled to Musil. Before
they reached it, they had stayed in a mountain to rest. Balta‘a bin Abi
Abdullah, Mu’awiya’s governor, heard that two men had hidden themselves
in a mountain. He condemned their affair. He and a group of his
companions went to them. When they reached the mountain, Amr and Rifa‘a
went out to them. As for Amr, he was ill, for he had been given poison
to drink. So he had no ability to save himself from them. For this
reason he stopped and did not escape. As for Rifa‘a, he was a young man.
He rode his horse. He turned to Amr and said to him: “I will fight on
behalf of you!”

Amr prohibited him from that, saying: “That you fight (on my behalf)
does not benefit me. Save yourself if you can.”

Rifa‘a attacked the people, and they withdrew from him. Then the people
went out to search for him. They were unable to arrest him because he
was an archer. Then they took Amr as a captive. They asked him to
introduce himself, but he refused and said to them: “I am the one whom
if you left, it would be safer to you, and if you killed, it would be
more harmful to you.”

They insisted on him to introduce himself, but he refused. Accordingly,
they doubted his affair and sent him guarded to Abdurrahman bin Abdullah
al-Thaqafi, the governor of Musil. When Abdurrahman saw him, he
recognized him and immediately sent Mu’awiya a letter in which he
informed him of the affair. Mu’awiya answered Abdurrahman, saying: “He
(Amr) claimed that he stabbed ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan nine times with the
spearheads he had. We do not
[^1] Al-Ta‘liqat, p. 246.

want to aggress against him. Therefore, stab him nine times just as he
stabbed ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan.”

Accordingly, Abdurrahman ordered Amr to be taken out and be stabbed
nine times. Amr was stabbed, and he died during the first or the second
stab.[^1] Then Abdurrahman ordered his head to be cut off and be sent to
Mu’awiya. Mu’awiya ordered the head to be taken from place to another,
so it was the first head to be taken from one place to another in
Islam.[^2] Then Mu’awiya ordered the head to be sent to Amr’s wife,
Amina, daughter of al-Shareed. Amina was in one of Mu’awiya’s prisons.
The head was brought and put into her lap while she was inattentive and
had no information about her husband’s affair. When she saw the head,
she became disordered, to the extent that she was about to die. Then she
said while her tears were flowing down her face: “Oh! I will mourn over
his abasement in the abode of humiliation and narrowness due to the
oppression of the Sultan! He banished him from me for a long time! You
have sent him to me while he is killed! Welcome today to him whom I did
not hate and whom I do not forget!”

Then she turned to the guard and said to him: “Take the head back to
Mu’awiya and do not wrap it (when you put it) before him. Say to him:
‘May Allah orphan your children, make your family feel lonely (for
losing you), and may He not forgive you your sin!”

The messenger returned to Mu’awiya and told him what she said. Mu’awiya
became angry, and her speech enraged him. So he ordered her to be
brought to him in his assembly. She was brought to him, and he asked
her: “Are you, O enemy of Allah, the owner of the speech I have heard?”
She answered without paying attention to him or showing fear of his
authority, saying: “Yes. I will not refrain from it (the speech) nor do
I apologize (to you) for it nor do I deny it. By my life, I am diligent
in invoking (Allah against you) if diligence benefited (me). And that
Allah is behind the servants. You have obtained nothing of your reward,
and that Allah will punish you!”

Iyas bin Hisl turned to Mu’awiya and said: “Shall I kill this (woman),
O Commander of the faithful? By Allah, her husband was not worthier of
killing than her!”

She said to him: “Fie on you! Woe unto you! There is (something) like
the body of a frog between your beard! Then you are asking him to kill
me as he
[^1] Al-Tabari, Tarikh.
[^2] Al-Isti‘ab, vol. 2, p. 517.

killed my husband yesterday! You desire nothing but that you should be
a tyrant in the land, and you do not desire to be of those who act
aright.” Mu’awiya smiled and said with astonishment: “How good you are!
Go out! Then I do not want to hear you (say) anything in Sham!” She said
to him: “I am going to leave Sham. Then you will not hear that I am in
any part of Sham. I do not love Sham nor do I have a bosom friend in it.
It is not my homeland nor do I yearn for a residence in it. My religion
has become great in it but I am not delighted in it. I will not come to
you in it nor will I praise you wherever I am.”

Her speech was difficult to Mu’awiya, so he indicated to her with his
own finger to go out. She went out while she was saying: “I wonder at
Mu’awiya! He withheld his tongue from me and indicated to me with his
own finger to go out! By Allah, Amr will oppose him with a confirmed,
strong speech more painful than the piercing swords; otherwise, I am not
the daughter of al-Shareed!” Then she left his assembly.[^1]

Indeed the murder of Amr was among the dangerous incidents in Islam.
That is because he was among the companions of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and his family. Mu’awiya intentionally shed his blood, so,
through that, he opposed what Allah commanded as to that it was
forbidden to shed the blood of the Muslims but with justice. The murder
of Amr did not satisfy Mu’awiya’s thirst (for revenge). For this reason
he ordered his head to be taken from one place to another. Then he
ordered the head to be sent to Amr’s wife, who was about to die because
of the painful misfortune. From Yathrib Imam al-Husayn (a.s) sent
Mu’awiya a letter in which he condemned him for his committing this
dangerous crime. This is the text of the letter: “Are you not the one
who killed Amr bin al-Hamaq, the companion of Allah’s Apostle, may Allah
bless him and his family, the righteous servant (of Allah)? Worship
exhausted him, and so his body became weak and his face yellow. That was
after you had given him security, and given to him some of Allah’s
promises and covenants, to the extent that if you gave them to a bird,
it would come to you from a peak of a mountain. Then you killed him
showing audacity to your Lord and making light of that covenant.”[^2]

Imam al-Husayn lauded Amr’s excellence. He mentioned that Amr was the
companion of Allah’s Apostle, may Allah bless him and his family, and
that prayer exhausted his body. He also mentioned that Mu’awiya
concluded as to
[^1] A‘lam al-Nisa’, vol. 1, p. 4.
[^2] Al-Ta‘liqat, p. 246.
his affair a covenant that included giving security to him and
refraining from aggressing him. However Mu’awiya violated his covenant
and did not fulfill it.
Awfa Bin Hisn

Awfa bin Hisn was among those who condemned the Umayyad policy and one
of those who criticized the Umayyads for their dictatorship. He spread
the Umayyads’ shortcomings among the Kufans. Ziyad heard of that and
sent for Awfa. The latter disappeared. Ziyad reviewed the people. Awfa
passed by Ziyad, and he doubted his affair, so he asked those with
him:

-Who is that?
-Awfa bin Hisn.
-Bring him to me.
Awfa was brought to Ziyad, and he haughtily said: “The fool’s legs have
brought him to you!” Then he turned to him and asked him:

-What do you think of ‘Uthman?
-He is the son-in-law of Allah’s Apostle, may Allah bless him and his
family. -What do you think of Mu’awiya? -He is generous and
clement. -What do you think of me? -I have heard that you said in Basra:
“By Allah, I will punish the sound because of the sick, those who come
because of those who turn away.” -I have said that. -You said it at
random. -The blower is not the wickedest of the group.

Then Ziyad ordered Awfa to be killed.[^1] Awfa criticized Ziyad for his
policy during that critical condition. That was the greatest of the
deeds he performed and the best kind of jihad that the Prophet (a.s)
meant when he said: “The best kind of jihad is a word of truth in the
presence of a tyrannical sultan. The best of martyrs is Hamza bin ‘Abd
al-Muttalib, and a man who talks in the presence of a tyrannical sultan,
and he ordered him to be killed.”[^2]
[^1] Al-Kamil, vol. 3, p. 183.
[^2] Al-Nasaa’ih al-Kafiya, p. 60.

Juwayriyya Bin Mus’hir al-Abdi

Juwayriyya was one of the sincere companions of Imam Ali (a.s). He
narrated his traditions, and was close to him. One day Imam Ali looked
at Juwayriyya and said: “O Juwayriyya follow me. When I see you, I like
you.” Then he told him about some secrets of the Imamate. He said to
him: “O Juwayriyya, love those who love us. If they detest us, then
detest them. Detest those who detest us. If they love us, then love
them.”[^1]

One day Imam Ali (a.s), was sleeping. Juwayriyya came in to him and
said: “You who are sleeping, wake up! A blow will be struck on your head
from which your beard will be colored with blood.” Imam Ali (a.s) (a.s)
smiled at him. Then he told him about what he would meet from the
tyrannical governors, saying: “O Juwayriyya, I will tell you about your
affair. By Him in Whose hand is my soul, you will be pulled before a
rough, harsh man. He will cut off your hand and leg. Then you will be
crucified below the short trunk (of a date palm).”

Time passed after that until when in the days of Mu’awiya, Ziyad, son
of Sumayya, became a governor. He summoned Juwayriyya. He ordered his
hand and leg to be cut off. Then he ordered him to be crucified on a
short trunk.[^2] Hisham bin Muhammad al-Sa’ib has written a book about
the tragedy of Juwayriyya, Rasheed, and Maytham al-Tammar. [^3]

Abdullah Bin Yahya al-Hadhrami

Abdullah bin Yahya was among the choice companions of Imam Ali (a.s).
He was among the police of al-Khamees[^4] . Imam Ali (a.s) said to him at
the Battle of al-Jamal: “O Abdullah, receive good news of that you and
your father will be of al-Khamees Police. Indeed Allah’s Apostle, may
Allah bless him and his family, told me that your name and that of your
father would be among al-Khamees Police.”[^5]

[^1] Ibn Abi al-Hadeed, Sharh Nahj al-Balagha. A narration similar to
this narration has been mentioned in al-Ta‘liqat, p. 366.
[^2] Ibn Abi al-Hadeed, Sharh Nahj al-Balagha.
[^3] Al-Ta‘liqat, p. 366.
[^4] Al-Khamees was a name of the army. The Army was named so because it
was divided into five parts that were the vanguard, the right wing, the
left wing, the center, and the rearguards. It was said that it was named
so because a one fifth was taken of the booty taken by it. This has been
mentioned in Ibn al-Athir’s al-Nihaya. Some sources have mentioned that
the police of al-Khamees were so trustworthy and just that the witness
of each one of them was equal to a witness of two men
[^5] Al-Ta‘liqat, p. 214.

When Imam Ali (a.s) (a.s) was martyred, Abdullah showed exhausting
sadness at his death. He left Kufa and built a cell. He and his
believing companions served Allah in that cell. When Mu’awiya came to
know of their impatience and sadness at the death of Imam Ali (a.s), he
ordered them to be brought to him. When they were brought to him, he
ordered them to be killed, and they were unjustly killed.[^1] In the
protection of Allah are these righteous, good people. Their blood was
shed and their limbs were cut off. They committed no sin and made no
incident in Islam except their following Imam Ali (a.s). They yielded to
Allah’s Apostle, may Allah bless him and his family, who made it
incumbent on Muslims to show love for Imam Ali (a.s), saying: “O Allah,
befriend whoever befriends him, and be hostile to whoever opposes
him.”

Mu’awiya not only showed enmity toward the Shia through killing their
leaders but also made dangerous things of which are the following:

Demolishing the Shia’s Houses

Mu’awiya spared no effort to destroy the followers of Imam Ali (a.s).
He commanded his governors to demolish their houses. So his police
demolished their houses[^2] and made them without shelters to which they
returned. Mu’awiya did that to put an end to Shiism and to efface the
name of the Prophet’s Household, peace be on them.

The Shia’s Witness is not accepted

Mu’awiya did his best to abase and exhaust the Shia. He wrote to all
his governors and commanded them not to accept the witness of the
followers of Imam Ali (a.s), and that of his household.[^3] The governors
yielded to his command. They did not accept the testimony of the Shia
while they were trustworthy, just, and good Muslims.
