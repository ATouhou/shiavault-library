The Year of the Elephant
========================

In 570 AD, the Abyssinian armies under the leadership of Abraha attacked
Makkah to demolish the Ka'aba.

Abdul Muttalib, our Master Muhammad's [s] grandfather, the Master of
Makkah, went round the Ka'aba praying to Allah, the Almighty, to prevent
the invaders from demolishing the House which Ibrahim, al-Khalil, and
his son Ismael built for people to worship Allah only.

Allah, the Almighty, accepted Abdul Muttalib's prayer. So, when the
elephants and the soldiers advanced to demolish the Ka'aba, Ababil birds
carrying stones in their beaks appeared in the horizon. They began
dropping the stones. So, the invaders around the Ka'aba were defeated.

Consequently, Allah's power and Abdul Muttalib's importance appeared!
That year was named the Year of the Elephant.

Our Master Muhammad [s] was born in that year. Abu-Talib was thirty
years of age.

Allah, the Almighty, has mentioned this event in the Holy Qur'an:

In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful.

Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the possessors of the
elephant?

Did He not cause their war to end in confusion.

And send down (to prey) upon them birds in flocks, casting them against
stones of baked clay.

So, he rendered them like straw eaten up?
