32. Fragrance of Paradise
=========================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ رَسُولُ اللٌّهِ (ص) فِي كَلاَمٍ لَهُ: إِيَّاكُمْ وَ عُقُوقَ
الْوَالِدَيْنِ فَإِنَّ رِيحَ الْجَنَّةِ تُوجَدُ مِنْ مَسِيرَةِ أَلْفِ
عَامٍ وَ لاَ يَجِدُهَا عَاقٌّ وَ لاَ قَاطِعُ رَحِمٍ‏.
  </p>
</blockquote>

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his family) has said:
“Beware of become disowned by your parents, for verily the fragrance of
paradise which can be smelt from a distance of a thousand years, shall
never reach the nostrils of one who has been disowned by his parents and
one who has severed the bonds of kinship (with his relatives).”
