Lending and Borrowing
=====================

Lending of something means that someone gives his own property to
another person so that he may make use of it, and in exchange, one gets
nothing back; for example, a person gives his bike to another person, so
that the person may go to his house and return.

Issue 417: Someone who lends something to another person can take it
back whenever he wants to, and the person who has borrowed the item can
give it back to its owner whenever he wishes to.

Issue 418: If that which was lent out becomes lost or damaged, then in
the event that in the protection of the item care was shown, or in its
use, excessive care was shown, then one is not responsible (for the
item). However, if one was negligent in taking care of the item, or in
its use excessive care was not shown, then compensation must be paid.

Issue 419: If it was previously specified, that if anything happens to
the property being borrowed then the person borrowing the item would be
responsible for it, then if anything happens to that property, one must
compensate for it.
