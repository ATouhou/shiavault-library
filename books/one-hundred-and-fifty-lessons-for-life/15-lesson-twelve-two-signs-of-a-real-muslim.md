Lesson Twelve: Two Signs of a Real Muslim
=========================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"لاَ تَنْظُرُوا إلى كَثْرةِ صَلاتِهِمْ و صَوْمِهِمْ وَ كَثْرَةِ
الْحَجِّ و الْمَعْرُوفِ و طَنْطَنَتِهمْ بِالليْلِ وَلكِنْ اُنْظُرُوا
إلى صِدْق الْحَدِيْثِ وَ أَداءِ الأَمانَةِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Do not respect only the excessives prayer, fasting, pilgrimage,
righteousness with others and vigil of some people (although they are
important in their own right). Rather, consider their “honesty” and
“trustworthiness”![^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

A quick study of Islam clearly establishes the fact that the two
decisive signs of a real Muslim are that he is honest and trustworthy.
Performance of prayers, fasting and pilgrimage are certainly important
and carry a high educational value but they are not a conclusive proof
of a true Muslim. To complete the picture, a true Muslim must possess
honesty and trustworthiness.
