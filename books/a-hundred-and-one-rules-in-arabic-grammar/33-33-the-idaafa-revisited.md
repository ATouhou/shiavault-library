33. The Idaafa (revisited).
===========================

Arabic grammar does not allow anything to be placed between the first
and second term of Idaafa except for a demonstrative pronoun. Therefore,

(a) the student’s book               **کتابُ الطالبةِ**

is correct and

(b) this student’s book      **کتابُ هذهِ الطالبةِ**

is also correct.  But,

(c)**کتابُها الطالبة** ِ

is incorrect due to the fact that the possessive pronoun (**ـها** ) is
inserted between the first and second terms of Idaafa.
