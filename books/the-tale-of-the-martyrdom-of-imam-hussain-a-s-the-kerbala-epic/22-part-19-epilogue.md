*    Eternity will, his name preserve,*

*    A place of honour reserve (conserve)*

*    In radiance, divine, glows his name,*

*    Kindles the universe, the eternal flame.*

*    Devilry tide, vehemently, surged.*

*    To Hussain we owe, our piety do*

*    Adore and love his chivalry too*

*    perpetual, endless, boundless, same,*

*    Glorious, for ever, prevail his fame.*

*    Tempests, storms and gales, did blow,*

*    This taper retained its divine glow,*

*    Howled tornadoes, did hurricanes rush,*

*    This eternal bloom they could not crush,*

*    Forward, forward, on and on,*

*    Kept on the move Hussain's caravan.*

*    Hussain did achieve his basic aim,*

*    (an eternal triumph, he could claim)*

*    For the faith's (tomorrow), his (today) he gave,*

*    Laid down his life, Islam did save.*

*    With pride and love, his name we quote*

*    Who, with his own blood, history wrote.*

*    His deeds will (neglect) never meet.*

*    Oblivion, his name will not greet.*

*    This tale of endurance, hardihood*

*    has the test of time well stood*

**TRUTH**

*    (An Eternal Message From Kerbala)*

*    No brutal force 'gainst truth can work*

*    Truth will conquer, will not shirk.*

*    'Tis the greatest dike, to hold back sin*

*    The silencer, of the mundane din.*

*    The spiritual health, it will restore*

*    For moral wounds; 'tis a surest sure.*

*    Truth will strengthen sickly souls*

*    Plug, in the conscience, gaping holes.*

*    Truth, is not an elusive ghost*

*    'Tis, to the righteous, a constant host.*

*    Truth, in its exalted mood*

*    Is clearest mind's amplitude.*

*    "Infinite" is there in every man*

*    Immortalise "finite" it can.*

*    Truth, doesn't perish at death*

*    It does outlive the human breath.*

*    Redeemed, through truth, all can be*

*    XYZ and you and me.*

*    Truth, being infinitely great*

*    Both kings and beggars, upon it wait.*

*    Truth, individuals and Nations, makes*

*    An infinite joy in the task it takes*

*    Glows the universe, with its beams*

*    Sun and moon, are truth it seems.*

*    if the human perception's doors are clean*

*    In every beauty truth is seen*

*    Truth is proud, to know so much*

*    Its every move has wisdom's touch.*
