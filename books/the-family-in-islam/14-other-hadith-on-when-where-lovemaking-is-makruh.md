Other Hadith On When/where Lovemaking Is Makruh
===============================================

Imam Ja’ffar al-Saadiq (AS) said “Do not have sexual intercourse on the
first, middle, and the last day of the (lunar) month, for if one does
that he should expect the miscarriage of the child, and if not, it is
feared that the child would be mad. Do you not see that the mad person
mostly suffers from fits on the first, middle, and last day of the
(lunar) month?”

Imam Ja’ffar al-Saadiq (AS) also said “Do not have sexual intercourse
on the eve of Wednesday.” In another narration from al-Imam al-Saadiq
(AS): “Do not make love with your wife, if there is a child in the house
who can see you or hear you. For if you do that, that child would be
adulterous, and so too the child that is then conceived (as a result of
that lovemaking).”

Rasulollah (S) is reported as saying:

“If one makes love with his wife, and there is someone in the house
that can hear their voice or their breathing, the child that is
conceived would not be pious, but s/he would adulterous.” Rasulollah (S)
is reported as saying:

“If one has sexual intercourse with his wife while she is going through
her monthly menstruation period, and a child is conceived who happens to
have leprosy, he should blame none other than himself.” Someone asked
Imam Muhammad al-Baaqir (AS) is there any time that is Makruh to have
sexual intercourse even though it is Halaal? The Imam replied:

“Yes. (These are:)

1. The duration from Fajr (break of dawn) to sunrise,
2. The duration from sunset to Maghreb (the disappearance of
twilight),
3. The day in which the sun is eclipsed,
4. The night in which the moon is eclipsed,
5. The day or night in which there is the black wind, the red wind, or
the yellow wind,
6. The day or night in which earthquake occurs.”

Imam Saadiq (AS) also said:

“Do not have sexual intercourse on board a boat, and do not have sexual
intercourse whilst facing the Qiblah or with your back to it.”

**Sexual Satisfaction**

It is reported from Imam al-Saadiq (AS): “One of you may have sex with
his wife and satisfy his desires, (but without her reaching the climax
of sexual excitement and satisfaction). (This could leave her in a state
that) if she comes across even a slave she would cling to him (to
satisfy her sexual need). Therefore if you were to make love with your
wife, make sure there is mutual foreplay, for it is better and more
pleasant for this matter (lovemaking).” Notes:

1. In Islamic terminology a ‘day’ ends with the sunset and at the same
time the following ‘day’ begins. As opposed to the system that has
currently become known and dominant where a ‘day’ starts at 00:00, i.e.
midnight. So under this current system a ‘day’ consists of a dark part
–from midnight 00:00 to sunrise, the daylight part – from sunrise to
sunset, and the second dark part from sunset to midnight 00:00.

In the Islamic terminology a ‘day’ consists of two parts – the dark
part and daylight part. The ‘day’ starts with the dark part – eve or
night – which is from Maghreb to Fajr, and the daylight part, which is
from Fajr to Maghreb. So the Eve of Friday starts when the sun sets on
Thursday. In other words Thursday ends when the sun sets, while at the
same time Friday begins, starting with its eve.

2. In the above hadith and quotations when the month is referred to, it
is meant the lunar month in the Islamic calendar – Muharram, Safar,
Rajab, Ramadahn, etc. and not in any other calendar such as the
Gregorian.

fabricate lies against God do not bring forward any book or any
traditions but that they have been played around with. Had it not been
for God’s protection of the Qur’an from corruption and substitution then
talking about it today would be like talking about the books of the
other religions. God though has made sure that his light is complete and
his word protected whether the unbelievers like it or not.

22 Even the Gospels that exist today confirm this fact. In one of them
appear the words: 'Do not think that I am here to nullify the words of
the divine law and the prophets. I have not come to cancel but to
perfect. I tell you the truth: Not one iota nor one full stop will
disappear from the divine law.

after Christ (Peace be upon him), continued to observe all the
prohibitions found in the Torah. Subsequently however, they limited them
to four namely adultery, the eating of animals killed by strangling, the
eating of blood, and the eating of animals slaughtered in the name of
idols.

64 Psychological studies have shown that the child who is fed at the
breast of his/her mother is usually less susceptible to psychological
problems. The sense of security, warmth and affection which the baby
feels at the mother's breast increase his/her attachment to her in the
future. Also, as doctors would confirm, all attempts to find a synthetic
substitute to mother's milk have failed. Mother's milk provides the
complete requirements for the health of the infant and its physical and
mental growth. (Our children, their growth, nutrition and their
problems. 'Ali Hasan. p.70.). Also among the benefits of breastfeeding
for the mother is the fact that it lessens the risk of her contracting
breast cancer and helps to return the womb to its natural state and also
works to dispel spots and blemishes from the face of the mother.

72 There are many traditions which condemn the envy and jealousy of
women. These include the sayings of Imam 'Ali: 'The jealousy of a man is
faith but the jealousy of a woman is enmity' (The Pearls of Wisdom).,
also ' The jealousy of a woman amounts to disbelief but the jealousy of
a man is faith'(The Summit of Eloquence: Article 124). From the sayings
of Imam Al-Baqir: ' The jealousy of women is envy, which is the root of
unbelief. Women if they are jealous become angry and if they become
angry they fall into disbelief except those who are true Muslims. (The
Complete Branches of Religion; Volume 5; Page 505).

there are 4 million divorced women, .The rate of divorce has risen in
recent years to 25%, and the rate of cancelled engagements has risen to
15% while the rate of marriage has fallen to 20%.

98 As in the Umayyad, 'Abbasid, or Ottoman states.
99 There are two theories regarding childbirth:

The first is the Malthusian theory of Thomas Robert Malthus which
stresses the non-correlation between demographic size and availability
of economic resources since the demographic increase is subject to
technology whilst economic resources are subject to arithmetic therefore
equilibrium cannot be attained except through birth control. In the
aftermath of the industrial revolution, Classicists promoted this theory
to justify the poor distribution of incomes. In the post second world
war period, certain rulers latched on to this theory to excuse the
poverty, unemployment and backwardness that prevailed in their
countries.

The second theory is growth theory supported by the majority of
economists. It says that human behaviour depends upon the social
environment and other social factors like values and traditions, and
upon the extent to which Nature can be controlled, and upon the
advancement of modes of production, and upon the nature of the
prevailing economic system. These factors interact to influence human
demographic behaviour. In other words, the absence of equilibrium
between demographic growth and the nature of the economic and social
system inhibits growth and prosperity. This theory believes that the
best way to cure population growth is economic growth and advancement
and social justice, the people not being responsible for their poverty
but rather the state being responsible due to poor distribution of
wealth, the failure of growth and the prevalence of unemployment due to
laws which inhibit freedoms.

The Malthusian theory did not meet with any success and its
overwhelming failure was proven in the countries of Europe. Hence voices
have been raised in the West in criticism of the concept of birth
control. Scholars say that people spontaneously are inclined to keep
their numbers to reasonable levels when the standard of living rises and
the economic and cultural way of life changes. The voices of criticism
among Western scholars and intellectuals convinced the powers that be to
bring in laws to increase reproduction rates. It may be wondered what
the hidden factors were which motivated certain regimes to adopt birth
control. In answer we would say that these regimes are of two types;
local and Western. Local regimes have an interest in birth control as
they lay the responsibility for backwardness at the door of the people
and cover up their own failure to deliver economic and social growth and
draw a veil over their own liabilities from bureaucracy through to
corruption which contribute to the inefficacy of the growth cycle.
Western regimes have an interest in birth control in the third world
making them the big players on the world stage and diminishing the
dependence of the third world on warranted international assistance and
loans and preventing a flood of population from the third world into
their countries. In addition to these factors, the application of the
theory of growth in the third world means delving into three areas that
the Western states would rather not delve; a).The lessening of
consumption in the West, b).Third world debt, c).

Transfer of technology from advanced nations to other nations. [Adapted
from article called 'Two Schools of Thought in Dealing with the
Population Problem' by Fahmy Haueidi].

100 The German government spends millions yearly to encourage
childrearing. Scholars believe that women only become fully matured
after one or two childbirths and that many women who have not given
birth are not as well balanced as mothers. This in addition to the fact
that they become more nervous than the mothers. The well-known French
physician Petard says: Frankly a woman will not achieve good health
unless she becomes a mother. 101 To realise the extent of Western fears
about the dwindling of their populations it is enough to monitor
newspapers concerned with social affairs and attend important
conferences on demography in Europe. In 1988 the Danish press announced
that the Danish government had imported 1000 Filipino girls for purposes
of childrearing on the premise that Filipino girls are more inclined
towards love, procreation and children.

102 The Islamic world covers approximately 30% of the earth's surface
amounting to 32.7 million square kilometres that equals 3.5 times the
area of the United States and China.

103 Certain people may cling to birth control for the following
reasons: a). The parents may be incapable of bringing up their children.
b). The 'happy life' may be one with few children and dependants. The
answer to the first is that the history of Islam from the flight of the
prophet until now confirms that the parents have the capacity to bring
up their children and indeed upbringing is not confined to the parents
alone but the whole of society takes part in it. In answer to the
second, the truth is quite the opposite - the preferable life comes from
having many children because life progresses through co-operation and
the many necessitate more cooperation in quality and quantity.

104 The arable land of the Sudan comes to about 300 million acres
(about1200 million square kilometres) of which only 30 million acres is
currently cultivated.

million of which were in Basra and giving 650 types of date. This number
