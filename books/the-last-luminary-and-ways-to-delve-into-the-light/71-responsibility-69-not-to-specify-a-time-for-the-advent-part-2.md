Responsibility 69: Not To Specify a Time for the Advent Part 2
==============================================================

Another responsibility which lies on the shoulders of the believers is
that if a person tries to set a specific time for the return of the
Imam, he must be called a liar, he must be introduced to the community
at large as a liar and one who commits fraud and deceit! In this
regards, Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad as-Sadiq (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ أَخْـبَرَكَ عَنَّا تَوْقِيتاً بِوَقْتٍ لاَ تَهَابَنَّ أَنْ
تُكَذِّبَهُ فَإِنَّا لاَ نُوَقِّتُ لِأَحَدٍ وَقْتاً
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Whoever reports to you from us regarding a specified time (for the
advent of the Imam), do not hesitate to belie him, for we have never
specified the time (of the advent) to anyone!”[^1]
