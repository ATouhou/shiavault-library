Generosity
==========

Generosity is a virtue and niggardliness is a bad quality which brings
degradation, destroys dignity and honour and deprives the needy of their
due rights.

Allah the Most High said: ***“And let not those deem, who are niggardly
in giving away that which Allah has granted them out of His grace, that
it is good for them; nay, it is worse for them.”***

He also said; ***“Behold! you are those who are called upon to spend in
Allah’s way, but among you are those who are niggardly, and whoever is
niggardly is niggardly against his soul; and Allah is Self-sufficient
and you have need (of him).”***

He also said: ***“Surely Allah does not love him who is proud, boastful.
Those who are niggardly and bid people to be niggardly and hide what
Allah has given them of His grace; and We have prepared for the
unbelievers a disgraceful chastisement.”***

The Holy Prophet Muhammad (S) said: *“Beware of being niggardly; because
it has always been the main cause of destruction for those who were
before you. This vice ordered them to tell lies, and they obeyed; it
ordered them to oppress others, and they obeyed; and it ordered them to
ignore family ties, and they obeyed.”*

Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (a.s.) said: *“A believer can not be cowardly,
covetous or niggardly.”*

Imam Ali al-Rida (a.s.) said: *“The generous are near to Allah, near to
people, and near to paradise. The niggardly are far from Allah, far from
people, and far from paradise.”*
