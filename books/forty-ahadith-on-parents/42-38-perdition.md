Imam as-Sadiq (peace be upon him) relates: “Once, the Messenger of Allah
(peace be upon him and his family) approached a youth who was on the
verge of dying, and said to him:  “Say ‘There is no God except Allah.’
But the youth’s tongue appeared to be tied and he was unable utter the
words. When this took place several times, the Prophet said to a lady
standing near the youth’s head: “Does this youth have a mother?”  The
lady replied: “Yes, I am his mother.”  The Prophet asked her: “Are you
angry with him?”  She confessed: “Yes.  I have not spoken to him for the
last six years.”  Hearing this, he said to her: “Be pleased with him.” 
She agreed and said: “O’ Prophet of Allah!  For the sake of your
pleasure, may Allah be pleased with him.”  (Then, turning to the youth)
he said: “Say ‘There is no God, except Allah’).  (This time) the youth
was able to recite the words and shortly afterwards, his soul departed
his body.”
