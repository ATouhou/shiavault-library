Section 11: Christian nearness to Islam
=======================================

The Israelites cursed by David and Jesus for their disobedience and
exceeding the limits - Jews' enmity and the Christian friendship of the
Muslims -The pious ones among the Christian priests and monks

Surah Al-Ma'idah, Verse 78
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لُعِنَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَى لِسَانِ
دَاوُودَ وَعِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ ذَلِكَ بِمَا عَصَوا وَّكَانُواْ
يَعْتَدُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**78.** ***"Those who disbelieved from among the Children of Israel were
cursed by the tongue of David, and of Jesus, son of Mary, that was
because they disobeyed and used to transgress."***

Hadrat David (as) cursed the Israelites for their offence and violation
regarding to holiday on Saturday.

And Hadrat Jesus (as) cursed them, too, for the reason that the Children
of Israel, in order to assure their hearts, asked for heavenly food,
which was descended by *Allah* as a result of Jesus' supplication. They
ate it but they disbelieved again. Therefore, they incurred the wrath
and punishment of *Allah.* The holy verse says:

***"Those who disbelieved from among the Children of Israel were cursed
by the tongue of David, and of Jesus, son of Mary, that was because they
disobeyed and used to transgress."***

Surah Al-Ma'idah, Verse 79
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كَانُواْ لاَ يَتَنَاهَوْنَ عَن مُّنكَرٍ فَعَلُوهُ لَبِئْسَ مَا
كَانُواْ يَفْعَلُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**79.** ***"They used not to restrain each other from any dishonour they
committed. Certainly evil was that which they were doing! "***

The curses of David (as) and Jesus (as) unto the Children of Israel were
for the reason that they disobeyed and transgressed. It was also
because:

***"They used not to restrain each other from any dishonour they
committed. Certainly evil was that which they were doing!"***

It is narrated from Imam Sadiq (as) who said: "They (the good people of
the Children of Israel) did not take part in the (sinful) activities and
meetings, but when they saw them (the sinners) they met them with smile
to their faces, and association."[^1]

So, the person who is careless toward corruption is cursed by the
prophets.

The deed of 'forbidding from doing evil' is not allocated to the
religion of Islam, but it had existed in all divine religions.

In the community of the Israelites, mischief had commonly been
committed. Then, they were cursed by *Allah (s.w.t.)* and the Messenger
of *Allah* (S).

Surah Al-Ma'idah, Verse 80
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
تَرَى كَثِيراً مِّنْهُمْ يَتَوَلَّوْنَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَبِئْسَ
مَا قَدَّمَتْ لَهُمْ أَنفُسُهُمْ أَن سَخِطَ اللّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَفِي
الْعَذَابِ هُمْ خَالِدُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**80.** ***"You see many of them making friends with those who
disbelieve. Surely evil is that which their selves send before for them
(as their storage in the Hereafter), and Allah's wrath is on them, and
in the chastisement shall they abide."***

In this verse, another evidence upon the behaviour of the Israelites is
suggested as a cause that they were cursed for. The Children of Israel
make friends and master ship with the disbelievers.

So, the acceptance of the master ship of infidels is a cause for
bringing forth the wrath of *Allah (s.w.t.).*

The verse says:

***"You see many of them making friends with those who disbelieve.
Surely evil is that which their selves send before for them (as their
storage in the Hereafter), and Allah's wrath is on them, and in the
chastisement shall they abide."***

Surah Al-Ma'idah, Verse 81
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلَوْ كَانُوا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالله والنَّبِيِّ وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِ
مَا اتَّخَذُوهُمْ أَوْلِيَاء وَلَـكِنَّ كَثِيراً مِّنْهُمْ فَاسِقُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**81.** ***"And if they had believed in Allah and the Prophet and what
was sent down to him, they would not have taken them for friends, but,
most of them are evil-doers."***

There may be several extensions for the content of this verse. Among
them are the followings:

A. If the Jews had really believed in Moses (as) and his Torah, they
would never have appointed pagans as their masters. (Tafsir 'Alusi)

B. If infidels and polytheists became Muslims; the Jews would not
cooperate with them. (Tafsir-i-Al-Mizan)

C. If the People of the Book, or the hypocrites, or the Muslims believed
truly in *Allah* and the Messenger, they would not appoint pagans as
their masters. The reason of it is that Faith does not adapt to
infidelity. It is corruption and disbelief that cause them to accept the
domination of pagans.

And, generally, whoever violates the bounds of *Allah* will be a prey of
Taghuts (deities) and disbelievers.

The verse says:

***"And if they had believed in Allah and the Prophet and what was sent
down to him, they would not have taken them for friends, but most of
them are evil-doers."***

Surah Al-Ma'idah, Verse 82
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَتَجِدَنَّ أَشَدَّ النَّاسِ عَدَاوَةً لِّلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ الْيَهُودَ
وَالَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ وَلَتَجِدَنَّ أَقْرَبَهُمْ مَّوَدَّةً
لِّلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ الَّذِينَ قَالُوَاْ إِنَّا نَصَارَى ذَلِكَ
بِأَنَّ مِنْهُمْ قِسِّيسِينَ وَرُهْبَانًا وَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ
يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**82.** ***"Certainly you will find the most hostile of people to those
who believe are the Jews and pagans; and you will certainly find the
nearest of them in affection to those who believe are those who say: 'We
are Christians.' That is because there are among them priests and monks
and because they do not behave proudly."***

The good treatment of Najashi, the king of Abyssinia, and the Christians
of that country unto the emigrated Muslims has been cited upon the
occasion of revelation of this verse.

In the fifth year after the appointment of the Prophet (S) to his
mission, a group of Muslims under the management of
Ja'far-ibn-'Abi-talib emigrated from Mecca to Abyssinia and became
secured from the harm and hurt of the pagans of Mecca with the support
of Najashi.

They were secured from the harm of the agents of the pagans there, too.
The Jews, even with seeing those abundant miracles and also the good
temper of the Prophet (S), did not believe in Islam. They participated
in plots against Muslims.

They did breach promises and made mischief, while some Christian bishops
in Abyssinia shed tears when they heard the verses of Surah Maryam and
adhered those Muslims who were there.

Thus, the Jews are the most obstinate enemies of Islam, and their
hostility against Muslims has an ancient and deep root.

But, the Christians, although wrongly believe in trinity, a deviated
creed, are more receptive to accept the truth because of the sounder
mind they have. They are not of the people of plotting, especially the
intellectualities and the preachers among them.

The verse says:

***"Certainly you will find the most hostile of people to those who
believe are, the Jews and pagans; and you will certainly find the
nearest of them in affection to those who believe are those who say: 'We
are Christians.' That is because there are among them priests and monk
and because they do not behave proudly."***

**The End of Part Six**

Surah Al-Ma'idah, Verse 83
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَإِذَا سَمِعُواْ مَا أُنزِلَ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ تَرَى أَعْيُنَهُمْ
تَفِيضُ مِنَ الدَّمْعِ مِمَّا عَرَفُواْ مِنَ الْحَقِّ يَقُولُونَ
رَبَّنَا آمَنَّا فَاكْتُبْنَا مَعَ الشَّاهِدِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**83.** ***"And when they hear what has been sent down to the Messenger,
you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they recognize
of the Truth. They say: 'Our Lord! we believe, so write us down with the
witnesses (of Truth)."***

One of the examples of the Christians' shedding tears is when
Ja'far-ibn-'Abi-Talib recited the verses of Surah Maryam for Najashi in
Abyssinia. Another example is also when a group of the Christians,
accompanying with Ja'far, came into Medina and heard the holy verses of
Surah yasin.

***"And when they hear what has been sent down to the Messenger, you see
their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they recognize of the
Truth. They say: ' Our Lord! we believe, so write us down with the
witnesses (of Truth)."***

Therefore, as soon as the heartily receptive persons hear the Truth,
they will be touched at heart, but the blockhead ones do not move even
by seeing it.

The spirit and nature of man is charmed by the Truth. Then, when he
reaches his beloved, he sheds the tears of joy.

However, believers should offer a petition for the continuation of their
belief and having a good end.

Surah Al-Ma'idah, Verses 84 - 86
--------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَا لَنَا لاَ نُؤْمِنُ بِاللّهِ وَمَا جَاءنَا مِنَ الْحَقِّ
وَنَطْمَعُ أَن يُدْخِلَنَا رَبَّنَا مَعَ الْقَوْمِ الصَّالِحِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَأَثَابَهُمُ اللّهُ بِمَا قَالُواْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا
الأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَذَلِكَ جَزَاء الْمُحْسِنِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا أُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَابُ
الْجَحِيمِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**84.** ***"And what (reason) have we that we should not believe in
Allah and in the Truth that has come to us, while we long for our Lord
should cause us to enter (the Heaven) with the righteous ones."***

**85.** ***"Therefore Allah has rewarded them for what they
said -Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein shall they abide
forever, and that is the reward of the doers of good."***

**86.** ***"And (as for) those who disbelieve and deny Our Signs, these
are the inhabitants of the Hell."***

Those who, after recognizing the right, bravely and explicitly confess
it with truthfulness in action, and do not fear of the atmosphere and
co-religionists, are among the best righteous ones. The reason of it is
that they have done good t themselves and have saved themselves from the
chastisement of Hell Fire, and, by their confession, they have paved the
path for others both.

Thus, the reward of Faith is Heaven, and the retribution of disbelief
and rejection is Hell.

In the meantime, the objective meaning of the Arabic word /al-haqq/ (the
Truth), mentioned in the verse, is: the Qur'an, Islam, and the holy
personality of the Prophet (S).
