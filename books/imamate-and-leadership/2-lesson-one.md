The Place of Leadership[(\*)](#p0) in Islam
-------------------------------------------

The Imam is with respect to the masses composing the ummali the leader
and exemplar from whose intellectual power and  
 insight those travelling toward God benefit whose conduct  
 and mode of life they imitate and to whose commands they  
 submit.

Imamate has a broad and comprehensive sense that  
 includes both intellectual authority and political leadership.

After the death of the Prophet the Imam was entrusted with  
 the guardianship of his accomplishments and the continuation  
 of his leadership in order to teach men the truths of the  
 Qur'an and religion and ordinances concerning society; in  
 short he was to guide them in all dimensions of their existence.

Such leadership exercised in its true and proper form is  
 nothing other than the realization of the goals of Islam and the  
 implementation of its precepts precepts established by the  
 Messenger of God; it bestows objective existence on the ideal  
 of forming a community and codifying a law for its gover-  
 nance. Imamate and leadership are sometimes understood  
 in a restricted sense to refer to the person who is entrusted  
 with exclusively social or political leadership. However the  
 spiritual dimension of man is connected intimately with the  
 mission of religion and the true and veritable Imam is that  
  

**( 12 )**

exalted person who combines in himself intellectual authority  
 and political leadership; who stands at the head of Islamic  
 society being enabled thereby both of convey to men the  
 divine laws that exist in every sphere and to implement them;  
 and who preserves the collective identity and the human  
 dignity of the Muslims from decline and corruption. In  
 addition the Imam is one whose personality already in this  
 world has a divine aspect; his dealings with God and man his  
 implementation of all the devotional ethical and social  
 precepts of God's religion furnish a complete pattern and  
 model for imitation. It is the Imam who guides the movement  
 of men toward perfection. It is therefore incumbent on all  
 believers to follow him in all matters for lie is a living exemplar  
 for the development of the self and of society and his mode of  
 life is the best specimen of virtue for the Islamic community.

Most Sunni scholars are of the opinion that Caliphate  
 (khilafah) and Imamate (imamah) are synonymous both  
 signifying the heavy social and political responsibility  
 bestowed on the caliph who attains his position of  
 guardianship for the affairs of the Muslims by election. The  
 caliph both solves the religious problems of the people and  
 assures public security and guards the frontiers of the country  
 through the exercise of military power. The caliph (or Imam) is  
 therefore at one and the same time a leader of conventional  
 type and a ruler concerned with the welfare of society whose  
 ultimate aim is the establishment of justice and guarding the  
 frontiers of the country it is for the sake of these aims that he is  
 elected.

According to this concept the qualifications for leadership  
 are governmental competence and capacity for rule. On the one  
 hand the leader must punish errant and corrupt individuals by  
 implementing the penalties God has decreed; hold in check  
 those who would transgress against the rights of others; and  
 repress rebellious and anarchic ruffians. On the other hand by  
 acquiring the necessary military equipment and organizing a  
 powerful army he must both protect the frontiers of the Islamic  
 state against all aggression and also confront with jihad and  

**( 13 )**

armed struggle various forms of shirk and corruption and  
 factors of ignorance and unbelief if they prevent the progress  
 or the implementation of true religion and the dissemination of  
 tawhid by way of propagation and guidance powers proves  
 impossible.

In this view of things it does not present a major problem  
 if the leader or ruler has no background of erudition with  
 respect to God's ordinances or even if he has strayed beyond  
 the boundaries of piety and polluted himself with sin. Anyone  
 can lay claim to the title of successor (khalifah) to the Prophet  
 who undertakes the tasks he used to fulfil. It is not offensive if  
 some oppressive tyrant establishes his dominance over Islamic  
 society by trampling the rights of the people shedding their  
 blood and exercising military force calling himself the leader of  
 the Muslims; or if some two-faced politician assumes the office  
 of successor to the Prophet and then proceeds to rule over  
 people despite his lack of spiritual and moral qualities  
 cancelling all notion of justice and equity. Indeed not only is it  
 impermissible to oppose him; it is necessary to obey him.

It is on the basis of this view of the matter that one of the  
 great Sunni scholars expressed himself as follows concerning  
 the caliph:

"The caliph cannot be removed from office on account of  
 contravening God's laws and commands transgressing against  
 the property of individuals or killing them or suspending the  
 laws God has decreed. In such a case it is the duty of the  
 Islamic community to set his misdeeds aright and to draw him  
 onto the path of true guidance."[( 1 )](#p1)

However if such an atmosphere predominates in the  
 institution of the caliphate with the caliph having no sense of  
 responsibility based on his own religiosity toward Muslim  
 society how can those who wish to reform the situation  
 constantly watch over the deeds of a corrupt leadership evince  
 the appropriate reaction on every occasion and purge Islam of  
 deviation? Can rulers be persuaded by mere advice to change  
 their ways?

If God had wished to entrust the destinies of the  

**( 14 )**

community to unworthy rulers to impious and selfish  
 oppressors it would not have been necessary for him to bestow  
 messenger hood on the Prophet or to reveal the ordinances  
 needed for the stability of society. Did those caring  
 self-sacrificing and noble souls who throughout the centuries  
 rebelled against evil and oppressive rulers act contrary to God's  
 will?

Dr. 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Duri a Sunni scholar writes as  
 follows:

"At the time the sovereignty of the caliphate was being  
 established the political theory of the Sunnis with respect to  
 this institution was not based simply on Qur'an and hadith.

Rather it rested on the principle that Qur'an and hadith must  
 be understood and explicated in accordance with whatever  
 events subsequently occurred. Thus every generation left its  
 mark on the theory of the caliphate because that theory  
 assumed a new shape with each new occurrence and was  
 colored by it. An obvious example is the case of Qadi Abu  
 'l-Hasan al-Mawardi who served as chief judge under the  
 caliph. When writing his book al-Ahkam al-Sultaniyyah he kept  
 the concerns of the caliph in mind at a time when the caliphate  
 was at its most degenerate. He employed all his mental powers  
 to reconcile the views of earlier jurists with the situation  
 existing in his own time and the developments that were  
 occurring then. His sole talent was in eschewing any kind of  
 free and original thought. He wrote:

"'It is permissible for an unfit individual to be the leader  
 even if a fit individual is also to be found. Once someone has  
 been chosen he cannot be removed simply because there is  
 someone better and more fitted available.'

"He admits and vindicates this principle in order to justify  
 rule by numerous unfit caliphs. It is possible too that he  
 wished to refute Sh-1'i views on the subject. The theological  
 and credal view he puts forth serves no other purpose for the  
 Sunnis but to justify the political developments of the day. The  
 only aim was to justify whatever might be grouped under the  
 heading of ijma' (consensus)."[( 2 )](#p2)

**( 15 )**

Such are the intellectual foundations of those who regard  
 themselves as followers of the Sunnah of the Prophet and the  
 guardians of religion and the shari'ah. They denounce as  
 rejecters and traitors to the Sun nah of God's Messenger a whole  
 host of Islamic thinkers and social reformers followers of the  
 Imams of justice the proofs of God and the guides of mankind.

If rulers who are strangers to the spirit of Islam and  
 trample underfoot the laws of God have the right to rule over  
 the believers; and if the ummah of Islam is obliged to obey such  
 rulers being forbidden to take them to task in order to reform  
 the caliphate or to disobey their orders - what then becomes of  
 the religion of God?

Can the Islamic conscience accept this as a proper form of  
 loyalty to the shari'ah of the Prophet? Is not the inevitable  
 result of this mode of thought the granting of unlimited rights  
 to the powerful and oppressive tyrants that have ruled  
 throughout history?

By contrast the Imamate in the view of the Shi'ah is a  
 form of divine governance an office depending on  
 appointment just like prophethood something God bestows on  
 exalted persons. The difference is that the Prophet is the  
 founder of the religion and the school of thought that proceeds  
 from it whereas the Imam has the function of guarding and  
 protecting God's religion in the sense that people have the  
 duty of following in all dimensions of their life the spiritual  
 values and mode of conduct of the Imams.

After the Messenger of God the Islamic ummah stood in  
 need of a worthy personage who would be endowed with the  
 knowledge derived from revelation exempt from sin and  
 impurity and capable of perpetuating the path of the founder  
 of the shari'ah. Only such a personage would be able not only  
 to watch over the political developments of the time and to  
 protect society from its deviant elements but also to provide  
 people with the extensive religious knowledge which spring  
 from the fountainhead of revelation and derive from the  
 general principles of the shari'ah. The laws derived from  
 revelation would thus be preserved and the torch of truth and  

**( 16 )**

justice held high.

Imamate and caliphate are inseparable in lust the same  
 way that the governmental functions of the Messenger of God  
 cannot be separated from his prophetic office. Spiritual Islam  
 and political Islam are two parts of a single whole. However in  
 the course of Islamic history political power did become  
 separated from the spiritual Imamate and the political  
 dimension of religion was separated from its spiritual  
 dimension.

If Islamic society is not headed by a worthy lust  
 God fearing person one unsullied by moral impurity whose  
 deeds and words serve as a model for people; if on the  
 contrary the ruler of society himself violates the law and turns  
 his back on the principles of justice - there will be no  
 environment capable of receiving justice and it will not be  
 possible neither for virtue and piety to grow and ascend nor  
 for the aim of Islamic government to be accomplished which is  
 none other than orienting men to the Supreme Principle and  
 creating a sound environment for the dissemination of spiritual  
 values and the implementation of a law based on divine  
 revelation. The moral conduct of the ruler and the role of  
 government have so profound and powerful an effect on  
 society that 'Ali the Commander of the Faithful peace be  
 upon him regarded it as more influential than the educative  
 role of the father within the household. He thus said: "With  
 respect to their morals people resemble their rulers more than  
 they resemble their fathers."[( 3 )](#p3)

Since there is a particular connection and affinity between  
 the aims of a given government and the attributes and  
 characteristics of its leader attaining the ideals of Islamic  
 government is dependent on the existence of a leader in whom  
 are crystallized the special qualities of a perfected human  
 being.

In addition the need of a society moving forward toward  
 its own perfection for leadership and governance is a natural  
 and innate need and in just the same way that Islam has made  
 provision for the individual and collective needs of man  
 material and moral by codifying and ordering a coherent  
  

**( 17 )**

system of law it must also pay heed to the natural need for  
 leadership in a fashion that accords with man's essential  
 disposition.

God has provided every existent being with all the tools  
 and instruments it needs to transcend the limitations of  
 weakness and lack and advance toward its own perfection. Is it  
 then possible that man who is also nurtured in the embrace of  
 nature would somehow be excepted from the operation of this  
 inviolable rule and be deprived of the means of spiritual ascent?

Could it be said that a Creator Who has lavished  
 generosity on man for the sake of his bodily development  
 might deprive him of the most basic means needed for his  
 spiritual elevation that He might grudge him this bounty?

At the time of the death of the Messenger of God the  
 Islamic nation had not reached the cultural or intellectual level  
 that would have permitted it do continue its development  
 toward perfection without guardianship and oversight. The  
 program that Islam had established for the development and  
 elevation of man would have remained soulless and incomplete  
 unless the principle of Imamate had been joined to it; Islam  
 would have been unable to play its precious role in the  
 liberation of man and the blossoming of his talents.

Fundamental Islamic texts proclaim that if the principle of  
 Imam ate is subtracted from Islam the spirit of the laws of Islam  
 and the progressive monothe'ishc society based on them would  
 be lost; nothing would remain but a lifeless form.

The Prophet of Islam peace and blessings be upon him  
 and his family said: "Whosoever dies without recognizing the  
 Imam of his time dies the death of the Jahiliyyah."[( 4 )](#p4)

The reason for this is that during the Jahiliyyah -  
 pre-Islamic era of ignorance - the people were polytheists;  
 they knew nothing of either monotheism or of prophethood.

This categorical declaration by the Prophet peace and blessings be upon
him and his family shows the importance that he assigned to the Imamate
to the degree that if someone fails to  
 place his spiritual life beneath the protective cover of a  
 perfected ruler he is equivalent to one whose whole life was  

**( 18 )**

spent in the Jahiliyyah and then went unredeemed to his death.
