43: Laxury (zukhruf)
====================

This chapter was revealed in sequence after the previous one on
consultation 42 and before the next one on smoke 44. It consists of 89
late Meccan verses arranged in seven section; only V. 54 (in section V)
dates from Madina.

The chapter leads off with a description of God in His roles as Creator
(I) and the Mercy-giving (II-IV); then it tells about Moses (V), and
ends with an explanation of Jesus' place as a prophet (VI). God has no
son, we are assured, nor doe. He need any associates (VII).

The title is found in verse 35 (III), where luxurious houses are
described, and at the beginning of section VII where we also find a
picture of Paradise. The word zukhruf can be variously translated as
'glitter\`, 'ornament(s)', 'gilding' or 'glamor'.
