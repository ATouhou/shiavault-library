Is It Shirk To Believe That Rasul'allah[saww] Can Also Benefit/help Us, Along With Allah?
=========================================================================================

Unfortunately, the disease of Literalism has compelled our Salafi
friends to make a lot of amendments in Islamic Sharia by declaring a lot
of things Haram.

For example, we believe that Rasool Allah [saww] can also benefit us
(Muslims) along with Allah (by His permission).. But for our Salafi
friends, all this is nothing than worshipping Rasool Allah [saww] by
making him a partner of Allah in His attributes.

<p dir="rtl">
قُل' أَنَد'عُو مِن دُونِ اللّهِ مَا لاَ يَنفَعُنَا وَلاَ يَضُرُّنَا
</p>

[Yusufali 6:71] Say: Shall we call on that besides Allah, which does
not benefit us nor harm us.

Mr. Khidr from Ansar.org represents this belief of Salafi in the
following words:

Ansar.org states:"It should be borne in mind that mankind, can neither
inflict anybody with harm nor confer benefit to him whatever their ranks
and prestige may be in the sight of God Almighty. For Only God Almighty
can cause harm or bring benefit to us."

And Abu Aminah Bilal Philips (one of the most respected Salafi 'ulama)
represents this belief of Salafi in the name of "Tauheedul Ebadah" in
the following words:

Bilal Philips states:"The confirmation of Tawheed al-'Ebaadah
conversely necessitates the denial of all forms of intercession or
association of partners with Allaah ..And, Allaah, Most Great and
Glorious, said:

<p dir="rtl">
قَالَ أَفَتَع'بُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنفَعُكُم' شَي'ئًا
وَلَا يَضُرُّكُم'
</p>

[Yusufali 21:66] (Abraham) said, "Do ye then worship, besides Allah,
things that can neither be of any good (benefit) to you nor do you
harm?" Please note that above mentioned verse is only meant for Kuffar
and their idols. But Salafi want to apply all these types of verses to
Muslims and Rasool Allah [saww] .

There are other verses of Qur'an and several Ahadith, which confirm
that Rasool Allah [saww] has been given the power to benefit the
Muslims. But Salafi, in order to defend their doctrine, completely
neglect those parts of the Qur'an and Sunnah. Let us seek more guidance
from Qur'an and Sunnah in this regard.

Ummul Momineen Aisha and Asma bint Abu Bakr used to seek cure against
diseases through Shirt/(jubba/robe) of Rasool Allah[saww] Sahih Muslim,
1st Chapter of book of Clothing:

Abd Allah, the freed slave of Asma' the daughter of Abu Bakr, the
maternal uncle of the son of Ata', said: . She (Asma bint Abu Bakr)
said: "Here is the cloak (jubba) of Allah's Messenger," and she brought
out to me that cloak made of Persian cloth with a hem of (silk) brocade,
and its sleeves bordered with (silk) brocade, and said:

"This was Allah's Messenger's cloak with A'isha until she died, then I
got possession of it. The Apostle of Allah used to wear it, and we
washed it for the sick so that they could seek cure thereby."

Can anyone still deny the witnesses of Ummul Momineen Ayesha and her
sister Asma bint Abu Bakr that even the jubba of Rasool Allah [saww] was
also able to benefit and cure the sick?

Did Ummul Momineen Hadhrat Ayesha and her sister Sahabia Asma bint Abu
Bakr made that jubba of Rasool Allah [saww], a partner to Allah by
seeking benefit through it?

Why didn't they asked Allah DIRECTLY for the cure from sicknesses?

Did they really sought help from that jubba in a Literal Sense that it
had Absolute power to benefit them. Or they actually sought help from
Allah, but from seeking help from jubba, they only meant that Barakah of
Rasool Allah [saww] also includes in their request to Allah?

Very Important Rule Literal Approach vs. Hidden Intention Even if the
name of Allah was not mentioned by Aisha and Asma bint Abu Bakr, when
they sought help from jubba of Rasool Allah [saww], but still all
(including Salafi) believe that they didn't commit Shirk.

There are 2 ways to understand these kind of actions:

Literal Approach, which shows the Apparent (Dhahir) meaning, i.e. help
was sought by the jubba. Hidden Intention, which tells that asking of
help by jubba was only in allegorical sense. But in reality, they were
seeking help from Allah. And hidden intention is a thing, which always
have to be given preference over literal approach. Salafi Double
Standards: Even our Salafi friends suffer with the disease of
Literalism, but still they are able to understand the Hidden Intentions
of Ayesha and Asma bint Abi Bakr in this case.

But when it comes to our asking for help from Rasool Allah [saww] in
allegorical sense (and in reality, we are asking from Allah), they are
simply denying the existence of any such "Hidden Intention". And they
start coming up with all the verses of Qur'an which are actually
referring to Kuffar and their idols.

And if they think that they are the Truthful Ones, then why don't they
paste their favourite verse upon Aisha and her sister Isma bint Abu
Bakr:

<p dir="rtl">
إِيَّاكَ نَع'بُدُ وإِيَّاكَ نَس'تَعِينُ
</p>

1:5 "You alone do we worship and from You alone do we seek help" And
why don't they paste all the verses of Qur'an in which Allah says that
beside Allah, no one can benefit or harm them:

<p dir="rtl">
قَالَ أَفَتَع'بُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنفَعُكُم' شَي'ئًا
وَلَا يَضُرُّكُم'
</p>

[Yusufali 21:66] (Abraham) said, "Do ye then worship, besides Allah,
things that can neither be of any good (benefit) to you nor do you
harm?" Is this not a double standard?!


**According to Qur'an, Even the Shirts of Prophets (as) can benefit /
help us**

Allah testifies in Qur'an that even the Shirt of Prophet Yousuf (as)
was able to benefit the others, and had the power of giving sights to
the blind.

<p dir="rtl">
اذ'هَبُوا' بِقَمِيصِي هَـذَا فَأَل'قُوهُ عَلَى وَج'هِ أَبِي يَأ'تِ
بَصِيرًا وَأ'تُونِي بِأَه'لِكُم' أَج'مَعِينَ
</p>

[Yusufali 12:93-96] "Go with this my shirt, and cast it over the face
of my father: he will come to see (clearly).Then when the bearer of the
good news came, He cast (the shirt) over his face, and he forthwith
regained clear sight.

With this verse in mind we would like to pose some questions to the
Salafi:

Can anybody still deny the witness of Qur'an and say that it is
associating partners to Allah, when we say that the shirt of Yusuf (as)
also got the power to benefit others?

Did Prophet Yaqoob (as) commit shirk by seeking the benefit/help from
the Shirt of Yusuf (as), instead of asking it DIRECTLY from Allah?

If simply the shirt of 'a' Nabi (a material possession 'non-living')
has the power to restore one's eyesight, then by the same token why is
it Bidahto seek blessings / cure by touching the grave of Rasulullah (s)
who was after all the Chief of all Prophet's?

Would touching a shirt have greater healing powers than touching the
grave of Rasulullah (s)? If the Salafi claim that Rasulullah (s) is
DEAD, then what about a Shirt is that a living organism?

Umm Salama used to seek help / benefit from Hairs of Rasool Allah
[saww] against Diseases and against the Evil Eye Bukhari narrates in his
Sahih in the Book of Clothing, under the chapter entitled "What is
mentioned about gray hair:

Uthman bin Abd Allah ibn Mawhab said, "My people sent me with a bowl of
water to Umm Salama." Isra'il approximated three fingers indicating the
small size of the container in which there was some hair of the Prophet.
Uthman added, "If any person suffered from evil eye or some other
disease, he would send a vessel (containing water) to Umm Salama (and
she would dip the Prophet's hair into it and it would be drunk). I
looked into the container (that held the hair of the Prophet) and saw a
few reddish hairs in it."

Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 72, Number 784

**Can anyone still deny that Rasool Allah [saww] can benefit us?**

**Did Umm Salama become a Mushrik for not asking Allah DIRECTLY for
health against disease and protection against evil eye?**
Can anyone deny the existence of this rule? (Salafi don't deny it in
case of Umm Salama and don't label her a Mushrika, but do deny it in our
case and issue the fatwa of shirk against us)

Anas said: "When the Prophet shaved his head (after pilgrimage), Abu
Talha was the first one to take of his hair." Sahih Muslim Book 007,
Number 2991

Anas also said: "The Prophet threw stones at al-Jamra, then sacrificed,
then told the barber to shave his head right side first, then began to
give the hair away to the people."

Sahih Muslim Book 007, Number 2992 Anas said: "Talha was the one
distributing it."


Sahih Muslim Book 007, Number 2993

Rasool Allah [saww] used to benefit the newborns by reading upon them
and by giving his [saww] blessed breath and saliva in the mouth of
newborns The Prophet had everyone in Madina bring their newborn, whom he
would read upon and into whose mouth he would do nafth and tifl (breath
mixed with saliva). He would instruct their mother not to suckle them
that day until nightfall. He did the same later in Mecca. Bukhari Volume
5, Book 58, Number 248

The names of over 100 of the Ansar and Muhajirin who received this
particular blessing have been transmitted with isnads, and are found in
the main books of biographies.

Can anyone still deny that Rasool Allah [saww] has been given with no
power to benefit us, and can anyone believe that we worship him by
seeking Benefit from him?

Tabarrukat of Aale Musa and Aale Haroon benefited Bani Israel Allah
says in Qur'an:

<p dir="rtl">
وَقَالَ لَهُم' نِبِيُّهُم' إِنَّ آيَةَ مُل'ك ِهِ أَن يَأ'تِيَكُمُ
التَّابُوتُ فِيهِ سَكِينَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُم' وَبَقِيَّةٌ مِّمَّا تَرَكَ
آلُ مُوسَى وَآلُ هَارُونَ تَح'مِلُهُ ال'مَلآئِكَةُ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ
لآيَةً لَّكُم' إِن كُنتُم مُّؤ'مِنِينَ
</p>

[Pickthal 2:248] And their Prophet said unto them: Lo! the token of his
kingdom is that there shall come unto you the ark wherein is peace of
reassurance from your Lord, and a remnant of that which the house of
Moses and the house of Aaron left behind, the angels bearing it. Lo!
herein shall be a token for you if (in truth) ye are believers.

Ibne Kathir says in his Tafseer, that in that ark, there were
Tabarukkat of Musa (as) and Haroon (as), like their shoes, turbans and
other things. Bani Israel were ordered to put an arch in front of them
during the wars. And due to the barakah of that arch, they defeated
their enemies. Now question is why didn't Allah (swt) place the "SAKINA"
(i.e. comfort / tranquillity / peace of reassurance) directly into the
hearts of Bani Israel Rather than do this He (swt) placed it into that
Arc (which contained the Tabarukkat of Aale Musa and Aale Haroon).

But for Salafi, it is still worshipping and Shirk to believe that
Rasool Allah [saww] can benefit us along with Allah (by his permission).
Rasool Allah [saww] thought that his [saww] Shirt, Breath and Saliva
could benefit the people Narrated Jabir:

The Prophet came to (the grave of) 'Abdullah bin Ubai after his body
was buried. The body was brought out and then the Prophet put his saliva
over the body and clothed it in his shirt.

Bukhari, Volume 2, Book 23, Number 360 Is the witness of Rasool Allah
[saww] not enough that even his [saww] Shirt, Breath and Saliva can also
benefit the others from the punishment of grave?

Did Rasool Allah [saww] really commit shirk by believing that there are
some things (other than Allah) that can confer benefit?
