Lesson One Hundred Thirteen: The Only Way Of Proximity To Allah
===============================================================

Imam Al-Baqir (a.s.) said to Jaber Jofi:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بَلِّغْ شَيْعَتى عَنّى السَّلامَ وَ أَعْلِمهُمْ أَنَّهُ لا قَرابَةَ
بَيْنَنا و بَيْنَ اللّهِ عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ وَ لا يُتَقَرَّبُ إِلَيْهِ
اِلاّ بِالطّاعَةِ لَهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Convey my greetings to my Shias and be it known that there is no kinship
(family relationship) between us and Allah and the only way of proximity
to Him is by submission to His commands.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

There are those who think that claiming to be a shia and a friend of the
household of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) is
sufficient for their salvation and prosperity. As if such claims would
entitle them to inclusion among the relatives of the Imams and thus they
too would have a special relationship with God , and everything would be
well arranged through recommendation and mediation. The truth of the
matter is that the only relation of consequence in the relations of
creatures to their Creator is their obedience and fulfillment of duties.

Whosoever submits to His command is the closest to Him , and whosoever
disobeys is the farthest, whoever he may be.
