Story no. 60: Hoori in the wedding ceremony.
============================================

When the family was invited for the wedding ceremony, they only took
their 5 year old daughter Hoori with them.  
 On the way, Hoori’s mother told her “Sit quietly with me and do not go
and start eating the fruits or sweets unless other people do so and I
tell you. Whatever you want quietly mention it to me”. But when they
went there, Hoori did not obey her mother, and whilst other children
were quietly sitting with their mothers watching the bride, Hoori went
and started eating the sweets and fruits.  
 Her mother was very ashamed.  
 When they reached home her mother said “Hoori, why did you disobey me
and went to eat the sweets and fruits? Didn’t you notice how the other
children sat quietly with their mothers?
