6. Nunation.
============

When a noun or an adjective is indefinite it carries Nunation, which is
any of the short vowels plus /n/ sound.

(a)** ** **-ٌٌ** indicates Nominative case as in **استاذةٌ**

(b) **-ً** ** ** indicates Accusative case as in **استاذةً**

(c)**-ٍ ** ** ** indicates Genitive case as in  ** ** **استاذةٍ**

Please notice that the accusative Nunation **-ً**   is always written on
(**ا** **)** as in**بيتاً** . An exception to that is when the final
consonant is either the feminine marker, Taa' MarbuTa**طالبة ً** , or
Hamza,**سماءً**
