Hating Covetousness
===================

Covetousness also brings abjectness and sin.

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) the Commander of the Faithful said: *“The best affairs
are those which are far from covetousness.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“Restraint strengthens faith and covetousness
destroys it.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“The abjectness of men is in their covetousness.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“Beware of the deception of covetousness, for if
brings you hardship.”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“Anyone who does not purify his soul from the
abjectness of covetousness abases himself, and in the hereafter his
abasement is more and worse.”*

Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (a.s.) said: *“What a bad person is he who has a
covetousness which incites him!”*

He (a.s.) also said: *“Seek for the survival of your honour through the
killing of covetousness.”*
