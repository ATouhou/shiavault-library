99. The preposition  مُنذ
=========================

Which means "since," is generally used with words that express time
concepts such as **ساعَة ٌ ، يَومٌ ، اُسبوعٌ ، شهرٌ ، سَنَة ٌ** etc.

<p dir="rtl">
**ذَهَبَ إلی البَيتِ مُنذ ُ ساعَةٍ.**
</p>

He went home since an hour.

It can also be used with verbs and, therefore, changes its
semantic/syntactic functions to an adverb of time.

<p dir="rtl">
**ما قابَلتـُها مُنذ ُ افتـَرَقنا.**
</p>

I have not met her since we separated.
