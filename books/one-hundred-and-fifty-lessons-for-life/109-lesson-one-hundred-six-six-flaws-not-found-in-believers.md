Lesson One Hundred Six: Six Flaws Not Found In Believers
========================================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
سِتَّةٌ لا تَكُونُ فِى مُؤْمِن: اَلْعُسْرُ وَ النَّكْدُ وَ الْحَسَدُ
وَ الْلَّجاجَةُ وَ الْكِذْبُ وَ الْبَغْىُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

There are six things which do not exist in the believers: strictness,
peevishness, envy, stubbornness, lies and injustice.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Those who are satisfied with being believers in name only are not real
believers. The six ugly attributes specified above should not exist in a
true believer. It is interesting to note that all these attributes are
concerned with mutual relations and social interactions among the
people. True believers are good natured , benevolent, truthful and just
and it does not behoove those lacking such character to call themselves
believers .
