36. Helping Vowels
==================

Helping Vowels replace the Zero Vowel when the following word starts
with Hamza. Therefore, an environment for using a helping vowel will be
created every time one uses a definite article. The purpose of this
Phonological Rule is to provide a smooth transition from one word to the
next. Generally speaking, this transition is governed by the following
rules.

a. If the proceeding vowel is FatHa the helping vowel is Kasra.

**Is the book new?    (هَلْ ) هَل ِ الکتابُ جديدٌ؟**

b. If the proceeding vowel is Kasra, the helping vowel is FatHa.

**This pencil is from the office.     مِنَ المکتَبِ.    هذا القلمُ
(مِنْ)**

c. If the proceeding vowel is Dhamma, the helping vowel is Dhamma.

**لماذا (قابَلتـُمْ) قابَلتـُمُ
المديرَةَ؟                                      **

Why did you (m, pl) meet the director (f)?
