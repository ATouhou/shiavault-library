Third Level:
============

This is the level of one who sees himself as demanding his right from
Allāh on account of his conviction, or merits, or deeds which he sees as
worthy of rewards, obligating Allāh Almighty to strengthen him in the
life of this world and get him to reach the stations in the Hereafter.
He believes he is a sincere believer.

When the believers are reminded of the unknown, he sticks his head out
among others, imagining he is worthy of rewards even if Allāh, Praise to
Him, treats him with justice. Rather, he increases the ugliness of his
rudeness, so he speaks out this false statement. If he is afflicted and
something wrong happens to him, he objects to Allāh in his heart,
wondering about the actions of the Just Almighty, how He afflicts the
pure believer and sustains the hypocritical sinner. He, hence, is angry
at heart with the Truthful One, the Almighty, because of his own
estimates.

He feigns acceptance, demonstrating [in reality] his anger with the One
Who bestows the blessings on him, pretending to others that he accepts
destiny. If he hears that Allāh, Praise to Him, afflicts the believers
in the life of this world, he solaces his heart with such a thought, not
knowing that the hypocrites who are tested in this life are numerous,
and not everyone who is afflicted is a believer.
