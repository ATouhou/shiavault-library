One of the aims of this Mission has been to disseminate knowledge of
Islamic principles, history and moral teachings in the form of stories
so as to make their reading more interesting and appealing to young and
old. The First Part of this book published in 1975 was enthusiastically
received and there have been inquiries for the following parts.

The Mission now is happy to be able to publish herewith the Second
Part.

Grateful thanks are due to S. Saeed Akhtar Rizvi as well as to Mulla
Abdulrasul H.M. Khaki for their valuable suggestions. Thanks are also to
M/s. Raza Datoo, Ramzan Parvana and Haider H.A. Jaffer for checking the
language of the stories.

It is hoped this book will also prove interesting and serve the purpose
of its publication.
