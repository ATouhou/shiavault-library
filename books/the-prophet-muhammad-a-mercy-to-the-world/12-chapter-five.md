Chapter Five
============

I have been sent to perfect the finest of morals.

The Prophet Muhammad Selected Sayings of Prophet Muhammad

The teachings and the saying of an individual to a great extent reveal,
just as his actions do, the true character and real nature of the
individual. And it is to the majesty of the words of the Prophet - which
is but a drop from the ocean of knowledge and wisdom of the Messenger of
Allah, and his morality and the essence of his character that these
words and thousands like them have remained eternal since they were
first spoken by the Prophet, and will continue to do so forever.

Therefore the Muslims, who number more than one and a half billion,
together with many others look upon these words and teachings as sources
of aspirations, examples of wisdom and laws of vitality in all aspects
of life. These masses are proud of adhering to some of them and
endeavour and hope to implement those they have not yet succeeded to
do.

**On Supplication**

The Apostle of God once said: 'Shall I show you a weapon which will
save you from your enemies and cause God's providence to flow upon you?'
Those who were present said: 'Yes!'

He said: 'To call upon your Lord day and night, for the weapon of the
believer is supplication.'168 He was once asked about the greatest name
of God. He said: 'Each of the names of God is the greatest, so empty
your heart of all but Him and call upon Him by any name you wish.'169
The Apostle of God said: 'Supplication is the essence of worship.'170

He also said: 'Supplication is the weapon of the believer and the
pillar of the faith and the light of heavens and earth.'171 He also
said: 'A person will gain one of three things from supplication: either
a sin will be forgiven, or a benefaction will be hastened to him, or a
benefaction will be stored up for him.'172

He also said: 'Ask God of His bounty for He loves to be asked. The best
of worship is to await the end of suffering.'173

[By the "end of suffering" it is meant the suffering of mankind as a
whole due to the widespread oppression that dominates the globe. This
will end by

the appearance of the awaited saviour the twelfth Imam from the
descendent of the prophet Muhammad - Imam Mahdi peace be upon him. To
await the appearance of Imam Mahdi is to ensure harmony with his
teachings, which are the teachings of Islam. Thus this awaiting is the
best worship for it involves full compliance with the commands of
Almighty Allah.]

**On Familial Bonds**

It is related from Im"m Ja!far Â£"diq that: 'A man came to the Prophet
and said: 'O Apostle of God, whom should I honour?'

He said: 'Your mother.'
The man said: 'And then whom?' He said: 'Your mother.'
The man said: 'And then whom?' The Prophet said: 'Your mother.' The man
said: 'And then whom?' The Prophet said: 'Your father.'174
The Apostle of God used to say: 'The angel Gabriel did not stop
enjoining upon me respect for women until I thought that even divorce
was not permissible except in the case of proven adultery.'175

He also said: 'I advise those present from my nation and those absent,
and those who are in the loins of men and the wombs of women, until the
Day of Resurrection, to maintain the bonds of kinship even if it means
travelling for a whole year, for that is a part of the religion.'176

A man once came to the Prophet and said: 'I have never ever kissed one
of my children.' When he had left the Prophet said: 'This is a man who
in my opinion deserves to go to Hell.'177

175 !uddat al-d"!:; p 91
176 ibid. p 90
177 ibid. p 89

Once, the Apostle of God saw a man with two sons who kissed one of them
and neglected the other. He said: 'Why have you not treated them both
equally?'178

A man asked the Apostle of God: 'What rights should a father expect
from his child?' He said: 'He should not call his father by his name,
and he should not walk in front of his father, and he should not sit
down before his father does.'179 A man said: 'O Apostle of God, what are
the rights of this son of mine?'

He said: 'You should give him a good name and a good education and
enable him to gain good skills [for good means of earning].'180


**On Good Morals and Conducts**

The Prophet said: 'He whose ethics are good will be given by God the
degree of one who continuously fasts and keeps vigil.'181 He also said:
'Nothing better than good ethics can be put in the balance scales of a
person on the Day of Resurrection.'182 He said: 'The most beloved of you
to me and the one who will sit closest to me on the Day of Resurrection
is the best of you in ethics and the most humble of you.'183

182 ibid. p 374, 9ad:th 2.
183 ibid. p 385, 9ad:th 26.

He said: 'Conducts are gifts from Almighty God. If God loves one of his
servants He will give to him fine morals and conducts, but if he
dislikes one of His servants he will give him foul manners.'184
Commenting on the outcome of one's conducts and ethics the Prophet
declared: 'Adopt fine ethics, for it is inevitable that good morals will
end up in Paradise. Avoid bad conducts for it is inevitable that bad
ethics will end up in Hellfire.'185

He said: 'With good ethics and conduct, a person will reach the
greatest of degrees and the noblest of stations in the Afterlife even if
his worship was somewhat weak.'186

He then said: 'With foul conduct and behaviour a person will reach the
lowest reaches of Hell.'187 In the now famous and well known speech of
Prophet Muhammad that summarises his entire mission and puts it in
perspective, he declared: 'Verily, I have been sent to perfect the
finest of morals.'188

Once he was told: 'There is a woman who fasts all day and keeps vigil
at night but she is ill mannered and annoys her neighbours.' He said:
'There is nothing good about her, she is destined for Hellfire.'189

189 ibid. vol. 68, chap.92, p 394

The Prophet said: 'Shall I tell you which of you from amongst you is
most like me?' They said: 'Yes, O Apostle of God.' He said: 'The best of
you in morals, and the most pliant of you, and the one who honours his
relatives the most, and the one who has the strongest love for his
brothers in faith, and the one who is most patient in the way of the
truth, and he who is most in control of his anger, and is most
forgiving, and he who is most just to himself in contentment and in
anger.'190

He said: 'The best of you are those whose morals are best, whose houses
receive frequent visitors, who socialise by inviting and accepting
invitations [of others], and whose furniture is worn out [by having
frequent visitors and guests].'191

He said: 'If you meet with one another then meet with a greeting of
'peace' and a handshake. And when you disperse then disperse asking for
forgiveness [for each other].'192

He said: ' . . .You will never encompass the people with your wealth so
greet them with a good countenance and a good smile.'193 The Prophet
said: 'I urge you to adopt the finest of morals for Almighty God has
sent me with them. Amongst the fine morals are that a man forgive those
who have wronged him, and give to those that have withheld from him, and
maintain

ties with those who have cut off from him, and visit those who do not
visit him.'194

He also said: 'Shall I show you the best morals of this world and the
next? . . . That you maintain bonds with those who cut off from you, and
give to those who withhold from you, and forgive those who have wronged
you.'195

He used to encourage: 'Be a good companion to those who accompany you
and you will be a [good] Muslim.'196 He used to stress this matter to
his followers in question form: 'Shall I show you the best morals of
this world and the next? They eagerly responded, "Yes O Messenger of
Allah!" So the Prophet replied: By spreading peace in the world.'197

Aswad ibn ANram relates: 'I said to the Apostle of God:

'Advise me.' He said: 'Do you own your hand?' I said: 'Yes.' He said:
'Do you own your tongue?' I said: 'Yes.' He said:

'Then do not extend your hand except to do good and do not say with
your tongue anything that is not appropriate.'198

It is related that the Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali said: 'A man
asked to see the Apostle of God and said to him: 'O Apostle of God,
advise me!' He said: 'I advise you to associate no partners with God
even if you are cut into pieces and incinerated by fire, and do not
dishonour your father and

mother, and do not insult the people, and if you meet your Muslim
brother then meet him with a nice smile ...'199

**On Clemency**

The Prophet said: 'The most clement of the people is he who flees from
the ignorant people.'200 He also said: 'There are three things which if
not found in a person that person's actions will not be complete:
abstinence which protects him from disobedience to God, morals with
which he interacts with the people, and clemency with which he repels
the ignorance of the ignorant.'201 One day the Prophet asked his
companions: 'Who amongst you is considered to be a champion?'

They said: 'The severe and powerful person who never compromises.'

The Prophet replied: 'On the contrary, the true champion is a man who
is struck by Satan in his heart until his anger intensifies and his
blood boils but then he remembers God and by his clemency defeats his
anger.'202 On another occasion the Apostle of God said to his
companions: 'Shall I inform you of the one amongst you who is most like
me?' They said: 'Yes, O Apostle of God.'

202 tu9af al-!uqYl; p.33.

He said: ' . . . the most patient of you in the way of the truth and
the one most in control of his anger.'203 The Prophet used to say:
'There are two draughts which are two of the most beloved ways to
Almighty God: a draught of anger which is repelled by clemency and a
draught of calamity which is repelled by patience.'204

It is related that Imam Ali said: 'The Apostle of God said:

'My Lord has ordered me to act civilly with the people just as he has
ordered me to perform the obligatory prayers.'205

He also said: 'I have been sent as a centre for clemency and as a mine
for knowledge and as an abode for patience.'206 Once a young man came to
the Apostle of God and said to him: 'Do you give me permission to
fornicate?' The Apostle of God's companions rebuked him and were rough
with him; but the Prophet brought him near and said: 'Would you like it
if others fornicated with your mother and your sisters and your aunts?'
He said: 'No, O Apostle of God.' He said to him:

'All people feel the same way.' Then he put his blessed hand on his
chest and said: 'O God, forgive his sin and purify his heart and protect
his private parts.'207 He also said: 'God favoured the prophets over the
rest of his creation due to their extensive affability towards the
enemies

of the religion of God and for their excellent prudence for the sake of
their brothers in God.'208 On Being Conscious of Almighty God The
Apostle of God said: 'Whoever fears God will live as a powerful person
and may travel in the land of his enemy in safety.'209

He also said: 'Act according to what God has made obligatory and you
will be the most God-conscious of the people.'210 The Commander of the
Faithful, Imam Ali, related: 'The Apostle of God said: 'The most pious
of the people is he who speaks the truth whether it be in his favour or
to his detriment.'211

The Apostle of God also said: 'Whoever wishes to be the most pious of
people then let him rely upon God.'212

He also said: 'There are ten parts to worship nine of which are in
lawful means of earning.'213

He also said: 'Looking to your brother who you love for the sake of God
is an act of worship.'214

It is related that Im"m Ja!far al-Â£"diq said: 'Whenever the Apostle of
God awoke from sleep he would fall down and prostrate to God.'215 In a
tradition it is said that the Prophet when praying it was as if he was a
discarded robe.'216 The Prophet for ten years stood [in prayer] on his
tiptoes until his feet became raw and bloodied. His face became yellow
from keeping vigil at night until he was chided for doing so when God
said: e ?"h", We did not send down the Qur'an upon you so that you may
become distressed. f217 218

In the advice of the Prophet to AbY Dharr he said: 'I enjoin upon you
consciousness of God for it is the summit of all of your affairs.'219 He
also said: 'There is a trait which if adopted by a person the whole of
this world and the next will obey him and he will profit by attaining
Paradise.' He was asked: 'And what is that O Apostle of God?' He said:
'God consciousness (taqw"), for whoever wishes to be the mightiest of
people then let him develop consciousness of God.' Then he recited God's
words: eAnd whoever fears God, He will make for him a solution and will
provide for him from where he does not expect.f
