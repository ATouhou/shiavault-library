Commentary : Verse 76
=====================

(76) فَلَمَّا جاءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ عِنْدِنا قالُوا إِنَّ هذا لَسِحْرٌ
مُبينٌ

76. " So when the truth came to them from Us, they said: 'Verily, this
is a manifest sorcery. '"

**Commentary :**

The Essence of Allah, the prophets, the divine laws, miracles and
whatever is attributed to Him are all true and real.

People do not always go after the truth. The adherents of the truth
must sometimes go after the people.

The Prophets entertain a direct link with the Lord and their miracles
as well as their program have their origins in the Divine nature.

However, accusing someone to be a magician is the shrewdest, simplest
and the most prevalent of the accusations leveled against the prophets.
It is for this reason that Moses(a.s.)was personally accused of being a
sorcerer.

The verse says:

" So when the truth came to them from Us, they said: 'Verily, this is a
manifest sorcery.'"


**Commentary : Verse 77**

(77) قالَ مُوسى‏ أَ تَقُولُونَ لِلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جاءَكُمْ أَ سِحْرٌ هذا
وَ لا يُفْلِحُ السَّاحِرُونَ

77. " Said Moses: 'Do you say(this)about the Truth when it hath
actually reached you Is this sorcery But sorcerers do not prosper. '"


**Commentary :**

Moses asked the disbelievers why it was that when the Signs of truth
reached them they kept claiming it was sorcery. Moses rejects the
allegations that the Signs accompanying him were the products of
sorcery, for sorcery is not like this, these were Signs of the Truth and
independent investigation could vouch for that. The verse says:

" Said Moses: 'Do you say(this)about the Truth when it hath actually
reached you Is this sorcery ? ..."

However, they did not want to submit to the Truth, even if this truth
had reached them from Allah. They claimed that the proofs that Moses
brought was sorcery and simple- hearted people did not discriminate
between sorcery and prophecy since both involved elements contrary to
nature and habit. It was for this reason that they became confused,
mixing the two which led many astray.

In such a case, people must be armed with knowledge so as to be able to
distinguish miracle from magic and not to be so dominated by the
confusion that sorcerers cause and reject the issue of prophecy. However
this is a fact that sorcerers do not succeed. The verse says:

"... But sorcerers do not prosper. '"


**Commentary : Verse 78**

(78) قالُوا أَ جِئْتَنا لِتَلْفِتَنا عَمَّا وَجَدْنا عَلَيْهِ آباءَنا
وَ تَكُونَ لَكُمَا الْكِبْرِياءُ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَ ما نَحْنُ لَكُما
بِمُؤْمِنينَ

78. " They said: '(O' Moses)have you come to turn us away from what we
found our fathers upon, and that the greatness in the land may be for
you two ?But we shall not believe you two. "

**Commentary :**

The people of Pharaoh continued their accusations against Moses,
explicitly accusing him and Aaron of wanting them to abandon the ways of
their ancestors.

They brought up the issues of ancestral traditions, and their fabulous
glory to influence public opinion against Moses and Aaron, implying that
they wanted to belittle and ridicule the sacred objects and symbols of
their society and country.

They maintained then that Moses' call to Allah's religion and divinely
inspired way was nothing but a lie. They claimed all of them were simply
part of a stratagem of Moses and Aaron to seize power over the land and
to put the reins of domination in their hands.

In fact, as they themselves made every effort to rule the earth
oppressively, using all kinds of underhanded ways of seizing power, they
ended up thinking of others as they thought of themselves, which
included the struggles of the reformists and prophets. The verse says:

" They said: '(O' Moses)have you come to turn us away from what we
found our fathers upon, and that the greatness in the land may be for
you two ?


For this reason they said that they were never going to believe in
Moses for they thought his message and proofs were only but the act of
sorcery in the service of a wider scheme for political aggrandizement.
This was the first stage of their struggle against Moses(a.s.). The
verse continues saying:

"... But we shall not believe you two. "


**Commentary : Verse 79**

(79) وَ قالَ فِرْعَوْنُ ائْتُوني‏ بِكُلِّ ساحِرٍ عَليمٍ

79. " And Pharaoh said: 'Bring unto me every knowing(expert)sorcerer'.
"

**Commentary :**

In witnessing the miracles of Moses(a.s.), he had been rendered
wretched and helpless in trying to find a way to remove them, Pharaoh,
addressing his people, put the call out that all the best sorcerers in
the land should come to him in order to get them to help him nullify
Moses' miracles. The verse says:

" And Pharaoh said: 'Bring unto me every knowing(expert)sorcerer'. "

Of course, Pharaoh did so in order that the sorcerers could help him in
dismissing the achievement of Moses(a.s.), and thus he called on all of
them because he did not want any craft of magic or sorcery to remain
hidden from him which might be of potential use in combating what he
perceived to be the powerful sorcery of Moses, little knowing that the
Signs that Moses manifested were not the effects of sorcery and magic
but miracles originating from Allah.


**Commentary : Verse 80**

(80) فَلَمَّا جاءَ السَّحَرَةُ قالَ لَهُمْ مُوسى‏ أَلْقُوا ما أَنْتُمْ
مُلْقُونَ

80. " When the sorcerers came, Moses said to them: 'Throw what you have
to throw! '"

**Commentary :**

Pharaoh wanted to render the divine movement of Moses inactive with the
help of those expert sorcerers. They carried instruments and devices
like ropes, wood etc, which by being mixed with some particular
materials moved when the sunshine affected them.

On the day when it was appointed for this historical challenge and a
common invitation had also issued, a great crowd gathered. Then Moses
addressed the sorcerers and told them to cast what they could cast. The
verse says:

" When the sorcerers came, Moses said to them: 'Throw what you have to
throw! '"


**Commentary : Verse 81.82**

(81) فَلَمَّا أَلْقَوْا قالَ مُوسى‏ ما جِئْتُمْ بِهِ السِّحْرُ إِنَّ
اللَّهَ سَيُبْطِلُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لا يُصْلِحُ عَمَلَ الْمُفْسِدينَ

(82) وَ يُحِقُّ اللَّهُ الْحَقَّ بِكَلِماتِهِ وَ لَوْ كَرِهَ
الْمُجْرِمُونَ

81. " So when they had thrown, Moses said: 'What you have brought is
sorcery. Allah will surely make it naught, verily Allah does not set
right the work of mischief makers. " 82. " And Allah proves the Truth by
His Words though the sinners be averse(to it). "

**Commentary :**

Falsehood may have a parade and flaunt for a short time, but, at last,
it is condemned to extinction. Allah does not support and improve the
affairs of the mischief- makers. A sorcerer is a mischief- maker, and
sorcery is a corruption. Therefore, it must be opposed with. The verse
says:

" So when they had thrown, Moses said: 'What you have brought is
sorcery. Allah will surely make it naught, verily Allah does not set
right the work of mischief makers. "

Then Allah proclaims in the verse that Moses told them that he would
definitely triumph in that quarrel and combat, for Allah had promised to
unveil the truth and, through decisive logic and the astounding miracles
of His prophets, He would expose the scandals of those who incite
corruption even though some of the evil- doers, such as Pharaoh and his
supporters, would dislike that.

The verse says:

" And Allah proves the Truth by His Words though the sinners be
averse(to it). "
