Jesus Is Not the Son of Allah
=============================

{The Jews call Ezra a son of Allah, and the Christians call Christ the
son of Allah. That is a saying from their mouth; (in this) they but
imitate what the Unbelievers of old used to say. Allah's curse be on
them: how they are deluded away from the Truth!}77

{It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a
son. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it,
“Be,” and it is.}78

**Jesus is Allah's Word and a Spirit from Him**

{O People of the Book! Commit no excesses in your religion: nor say of
Allah aught but the truth. Christ Jesus the son of Mary was (no more
than) A Messenger of Allah, and His Word, which He bestowed on Mary, and
a Spirit proceeding from Him: so believe in Allah and His Messengers.
Say not “Trinity”: desist: it will be better for you: for Allah is One
God: glory be to Him: (far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him
belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is Allah as a
Disposer of affairs.}79

Jesus and his mother are salves and servants of Allah Jesus is a slave
and servant to Allah {The similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of
Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him “Be”: and he was.}80

{. . . In fact he (Jesus) is not more than a servant: We granted Our
favour to him, and We made him an example to the Children of Israel.}81
{Christ disdains not to serve and worship Allah, nor do the angels,
those nearest (to Allah): those who disdain His worship and are
arrogant; He will gather them all together unto Himself to (answer).}82
{He (Jesus) said: “I am indeed a servant of Allah: He hath given me
revelation and made me a prophet}83

{(then Jesus said:) “It is Allah Who is my Lord and your Lord; then
worship Him. This is a Way that is straight.”}84

**Jesus is a human being chosen by Allah**

{Christ, the son of Mary, was no more than a Messenger; many were the
Messengers that passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth.
They had both to eat their (daily) food. See how Allah does make His
Signs clear to them; yet see in what ways they are deluded away from the
truth!}85

Jesus is not but a Messenger of Allah {Christ, the son of Mary, was no
more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before
him.}86 {We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of
Messengers; We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, Clear (Signs) and

strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. Is it that whenever there comes
to you a Messenger with what ye yourselves desire not, ye are puffed up
with pride? Some ye called impostors, and others ye slay!}87

{Say ye: “We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to
Abraham, Ismael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses
and Jesus, and that given to (all) Prophets from their Lord: we make no
difference between one and another of them: and we bow to Allah (in
Islam).”}88

We have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers
after him: We sent inspiration to Abraham, Ismael, Isaac, Jacob, and the
Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave
the Psalms.}89

{That was the reasoning about Us, which We gave to Abraham (to use)
against his people: We raise whom We will, degree after degree: for thy
Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge.

We gave him Isaac and Jacob: all (three) We guided: and before him, We
guided Noah, and among his progeny, David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses
and Aaron: thus do We reward those who do good:

And Zechariah and John, and Jesus and Elias: all in the ranks of the
Righteous:

And Ismael and Elisha, and Jonah, and Lot: and to all We gave favour
above the nations.}90

**Jesus is a Messenger to the Children of Israel**

{And (appoint him) a messenger to the Children of Israel, (with this
message): “I have come to you, with a Sign from your Lord, . . . (I have
come to you), to attest the Law which was before me. And to make lawful
to you part of what was (before) forbidden to you; I have come to you
with a Sign from your Lord. So fear Allah, and obey me.”}91

Jesus confirms the Torah and brings the Engeel

{And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary, confirming the
Law that had come before him: We sent him the Engeel: therein was
guidance and light, and confirmation of the Law that had come before
him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah.}93 {And Allah
will teach him the Book and Wisdom, the Law and the Engeel}94

{Then, in their wake, We followed them up with (others of) Our
Messengers: We sent after them Jesus the son of Mary, and bestowed on
him the Engeel}95

**The Miracles of Jesus**

The Miracles point to the Divine Support Not to the Divine Nature.

revelation and made me a prophet.”}97 {Then will Allah say: “O Jesus the
son of Mary! Recount My favour to thee and to thy mother. Behold! I
strengthened thee with the Holy Spirit, so that thou did speak to the
people in childhood and in maturity.”}98

know that thou has indeed told us the truth; and that we ourselves may
be witnesses to the miracle.”

resisteth faith, I will punish him with a penalty such as I have not
inflicted on any one among all the peoples.”} 106

Jesus never died Allah Rescues Jesus from the Jews {. . . That they
(the Jews) said (in boast), “We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the
Messenger of Allah”; but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so

Moses): “My servants, the righteous, shall inherit the earth.”}111 {They
will say: “Praise be to Allah, Who has truly fulfilled His promise to

**The Author**

Ayatollah al-Udhma Imam Muhammad Shirazi is undoubtedly the most
eminent Marje‘ or Religious Authority of Muslim world. A charismatic
leader who is known for his high moral values, modesty and spirituality,
Imam Shirazi is a mentor and a source of aspiration to millions of
Muslims; and the means of access to authentic knowledge and teachings of
Islam. He has tirelessly devoted himself, and his entire life, to the
cause of Islam and Muslims in particular, and to that of mankind in
general. He has made extensive contributions in various fields of
learning ranging from Jurisprudence and Theology to Government,
Politics, Economics, Law, Sociology and Human Rights.

Born in Najaf, Iraq, in 1347 AH, 1928 AD, the young Shirazi continued
his studies of different branches of learning under the guidance of
various eminent scholars and specialists, as well as his father, the
renowned Marje‘ of the time, Ayatollah al-Udhma Mirza Mahdi Shirazi. In
the course of his training he showed an outstanding talent and a
remarkable appetite for learning as well as a tireless commitment to his
work and the cause he believed in. His extraordinary ability, and
effort, earned him the recognition at the age of 25, by the Maraje‘ and
scholars of the time, of being a Mujtahid, a fully qualified religious
scholar and lawmaker in the sciences of Islamic jurisprudence and law.
He was subsequently able to assume the office of the Marje‘ at the early
age of 33 in 1380 AH, 1961. Imam Shirazi is distinguished for his
intellectual ability and holistic vision. He has written various
specialized studies that are considered to be among the most important
references in the relevant fields. He has enriched the world with his
staggering contribution of more than 1000 104

books, treatise and studies on various branches of learning. His works
range from introductory works for the youth to literary and scientific
masterpieces. Deeply rooted in the Holy Qur’an and the teachings of the
Prophet of Islam, his vision and theories cover such areas as
Legislation, Management, Environment, Sociology, Theology, Philosophy,
History Human Rights, Law and Islamic beliefs or doctrine. His work on
Islamic Jurisprudence (the al-Fiqh series) for example constitutes 150
volumes, which run into more than 70,000 pages. Through his original
thoughts and ideas he has championed the causes of issues such as the
family, human rights, freedom of expression, political pluralism,
non-violence, and Shura or consultative system of leadership.

Throughout his life, because of his total dedication to the Teachings
of Islam, and because of his views on various issues, which are based on
those teachings, he came under sustained pressure from the authorities
in Iraq as well as in Iran. His views on, and his call for issues such
as freedom of expression, party political pluralism, peace and
non-violence brought about the wrath of the authorities in Iran. His
uncompromising stance on implementing the teachings of Islam in all
aspects of government including such vital matters as leadership by
consensus or Showral-Foqaha’-al-Maraje‘ (religious authorities’ council
of leadership) attracted the fury of those at the helm.

He was therefore forced into house arrest for more than twenty years.
His staff, followers, and family members were subjected to continued
harassment, arbitrary arrest and torture.

Having spent the entire of his adult life striving for the greater
enlightenment of the Muslims and mankind, Imam Shirazi died in
suspicious circumstances in the holy city of Qum, Iran, on Monday the
2nd Shawwal 1422 AH, 17th December 2001. More than half a million people
attended his funeral procession the following day.

Imam Shirazi believed in the fundamental and elementary nature of
freedom in mankind. He used to call for freedom of expression, political
plurality, debate and discussion, tolerance and forgiveness. He strongly
believed in the consultative system of leadership and calls for the
establishment of the leadership council of religious authorities. He
continuously called for the establishment of the universal Islamic
government to encompass all the Muslim countries. These and other ideas
are discussed in detail in his books of more than 1000.

1. What is Islam? Beliefs, principles, and a way of life Few would dare
to attempt to summarize the Islamic faith in a book of this size but
this is the aim of the late Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Shirazi, one of the
most eminent Islamic authorities of modern times. Eschewing complicated
jargon and deliberately using succinct and lucid language within a
"question and answer" format, he has sought to convey the richness and
profound spirituality of the Islamic message in all its aspects to the
widest possible audience. There are necessarily some Arabic and
technical terms but these have been kept to a minimum. The late Imam
Shirazi covers all the main aspects of Islam, from the fundamental
beliefs such as the Oneness of God, His justice, and prophethood to
topics like ablutions, praying, fasting, and performing the Hajj. He
also deals with such diverse subjects as Islamic law, economics,
politics, the Islamic view of society, the issue of freedom in Islam,
and so on. This is a book which will not only be useful for Muslims who
want to find out more about their religion, but it will also be
interesting for non-Muslims who seek a concise introduction to what
Islam is all about.

**2. Fundamentals of Islam**

In this book the author outlines the five fundamental principles of
Islam, namely Tawheed (the Indivisible Oneness of God), Adl (Divine
Justice), Nubowwah (Prophethood), Imamah (Leadership of mankind), and
Me’ad (Resurrection). For each principle, the author presents a brief,
and to the point, discussion on the significance of the issue concerned.
The book could serve as a good introduction to Islamic beliefs.

**3. The Family**

In this book the author highlights the problems he sees both in Islamic
societies and in west societies today that arise from the phenomenon of
unmarried young men and women, through to birth control and
contraception. He surveys the idea of marriage in various religions and
schools of thought, and discusses polygamy from the Islamic perspective.
As well as being a call to the Muslim world to revert to the true
teachings of Islam, this book can also be of use as an introduction to
others who seek some answers to the social problems of today. This is
because Islam provides detailed teachings that promise success in every
area of human 106

life on individual and societal levels, and furthermore the
practicality and success of those teachings have been proven in the
course of history. 4. The Qur’an: When was it compiled?

In this book the author addresses the issues of when the Holy Qur’an
was compiled, on what and whose instructions was this task carried out,
and who accomplished its compilation in the form that it is available
today. In this work the author presents undisputable evidence as to
address these crucial questions. Through historical, methodical and
logical analyses, the author establishes how and when the compilation of
the Holy Qur’an was achieved. In the latter half of the book the author
cites many Prophetic traditions (hadith) on the significance of the
learning and recitation of Holy Qur’an. It is a must read for every
Muslim, and any non-Muslim who follows Islamic issues.

**5. If Islam were to be established**

This book can serve as the Muslim's guide to the Islamic government. If
an Islamist opposition group has a plan for an Islamic government, this
book would help to check various aspects of the plan. In the absence of
such a plan, this book would present one. To the non-Muslims, the book
presents a glimpse of a typical Islamic system of government. The book
would also serve as a yardstick for anyone to check the practices of any
government that claims to have implemented an Islamic system of
government.

**6. War, Peace and Non-violence: An Islamic Perspective**

In this work the author addresses three controversial issues, which
have come to be associated with Islam. Through his extensive knowledge
of the teachings of Islam, the author presents the Islamic stand on war,
peace and non-violence, as found in the traditions and teachings of the
Prophet of Islam, which could serve as exemplary models for the Mankind.
Detailed accounts of the traditions of Prophet in his dealings with his
foes during war or peace times are presented in this book, which gives
the reader a clear insight into the way and the basis upon which the
Prophet of Islam used to conduct his affairs in this respect.

**7. The Islamic System of Government**

In this introductory book the author outlines the basic principles of a
government based on the teachings of Islam. The author begins with the
aim and objectives of the government according to Islam and the extent
of 107

its authority in that framework. He then addresses, from the Islamic
viewpoint, the significance and fundamental nature of such issues as
consultative system of government, judicial system, freedoms, party
political pluralism, social justice, human rights, foreign policy, etc.
The author also outlines the policies of a government on issues such as
education, welfare, health, crime, services, etc. as well as such
matters as the government's income, and authority.

**8. Islamic Beliefs for All**

In this book the author discusses the five fundamental principles of
Islam. These principles are Tawheed or the Indivisible Oneness of God,
Adl or Divine Justice, Prophethood, Imamah or the Leadership of mankind
after the prophet, and Resurrection. What distinguish this book are the
author's subtle approach in addressing the issues concerned and the
simple examples given to illustrate the discussion. This authoritative
work is not only important to Muslims, but it would also be of interest
to those non- Muslims who seek to explore Islam and its doctrine. This
easy to read book would be a valuable reference for Religious
Education.

**9. Husayn - The Sacrifice for Mankind**

This is a collection of articles about a totally unique individual who,
through his remarkable sacrifices, managed to change the course of
history and the direction that mankind was heading for. He is none other
than Husayn, the grandson of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, and the
second son of Fatima and Ali, peace be upon them. Imam Husayn peace be
upon him stood up to tyranny and oppression and gave everything he had,
including his life and the lives of his most beloved sons and brothers
as well as those of his closest allies, in order to awaken the masses,
reform society and rectify the distortion that has been inflicted on
Islam.

The articles in this work cover some aspects of the aims and objectives
of Imam Husayn’s movement, the difference between his strategy and that
of his brother Imam Hasan in facing tyranny and despotism, the examples
he set, and the lessons that are learnt from the events that lead up to
Karbala fourteen centuries ago. Besides the benefits of his movement,
the personality of Imam Husayn peace be upon him as reflected by the
many hadith and teachings of Prophet Muhammad is also discussed. Also
included in this work are a number of questions and answers about the
commemoration ceremonies observed by the Muslims around the world on the
occasion of Ashura.

**10. The rights of prisoners according to Islamic teachings**

In general, Islam considers imprisonment as a case of last resort in
many circumstances, however, according to Islamic teachings there are
only a few offences that would lead to imprisonment. Under non-Islamic
system, of course the offender should be reprimanded, but any
chastisement prescribed by Islamic teachings may only be implemented if
all the relevant criteria and the preconditions prescribed are also met.
If the criteria are not met, then the prescribed punishment may not be
executed. In this book the author addresses such issues as the
fundamental nature of freedom, the rights of prisoner, and the harmful
effects of imprisonment on the individual concerned as well as on
society, and the kind of offences that would lead to imprisonment under
an Islamic system. The author also cites a few cases to demonstrate the
attitude the Islamic ruler should take towards offence; to try to find
reasons to waive the punishments in any particular case. The author also
addresses the issue of torture in general, and mental and physical ill
treatment that is carried out under the guise of interrogation and
extracting confession from a detainee or a suspect.

**11. Aspects of the political theory of Imam Shirazi**

Muhammad G. Ayub is a well-known Islamist political activist within the
Iraqi circle who has established a long history of political struggle
over the past three decades. He was attracted by the views of the Imam
Muhammad Shirazi in the fields of social and political sciences. This
prompted the author to write this book to introduce the reader to these
views that have remained relatively unknown amongst Muslim activists and
reformists. It covers such aspects on politics as freedom of expression,
party-political pluralism and organisation, social justice, peace and
non-violence, human rights, consultation system of government, etc.
