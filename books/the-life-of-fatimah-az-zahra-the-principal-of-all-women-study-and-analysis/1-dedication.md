Dedication
==========

To the builder of the Human Civilization and the emitter of spirit and
knowledge in generations,

To the Last of the Prophets and the Master of messengers Muhammad
(blessing and peace be on him);

I offer to his exalted standing this study on the highest woman Allah
has ever created in the earth;

The part of the Prophet (S), and the principal of the women of the
worlds; Fatimah az-Zahraâ€™ (peace be on her), hoping that it will be
accepted, and this is my expectation when I shall meet Allah the
Almighty.
