Final Note
==========

It is necessary to mention that this Hadith (tradition) is \`Mutawatir'
(i.e. narrated by so many people that no doubt can be entertained about
its authenticity); and the late Allama Amini in a number of volumes of
his celebrated book \`Al Ghadir' (of which eleven volumes have been
published so far) has given with full references the names of 110 famous
companions of the Holy Prophet; who have narrated this Hadith. Just to
give an example, I am enumerating the names given under letter 'Alif'.

2) Abu Zainab bin Awf Ansari;

3) Abu Fudhala Ansari (38 A.H.);

4) Abu Qudama Ansari;

14) Ummu Hani bint Abi Talib;

15) Abu Hamza Anas bin Malik Ansari;

If a Hadith is \`Mutawatir', there is no need to look at individual
\`Asnad' (documents) at all. Still to show the hollowness of this
charge, I would like to give here opinions of some of the famous
traditionalist.

A) Hafidh Abu Isa Tirmidhi has said in his \`Sahih' (one of Sihah Sitta)
that a Hasan and Sand, (correct) Hadith".

"This is

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>

  </p>
</blockquote>

B) Hafidh Abu Ja'afar Tahawi has said in 'Mushkil-ul-Athar:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فهذا الحديث صحيح الإسناد و لا طعن لأحد في رواته
  </p>

"So, this Hadith is Sahih (correct) according to 'Asnad' and no one has
said anything against its narrators"

C) Abu Abdillah Hakim Neshapuri has narrated this Hadith from several
chains in \`Mustadrak' and has said that this Hadith is Sahih (correct).

Abu Muhammad Ahmad bin Muhammad Asimi has said in 'Zainul Fata':
