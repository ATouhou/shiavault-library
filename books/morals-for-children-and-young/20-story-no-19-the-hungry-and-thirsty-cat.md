Story no. 19: The hungry and thirsty cat
========================================

Outside the house, the cat said “Mew Mew”.  
 The children of the house, Amin and Fizza said “I think the cat is
hungry and thirsty.”  
 With their mother’s permission they took a piece of meat and a
container of water and kept it in the garden.  
 The cat saw that and came slowly to the food and finished it off.  
 Their mother said “Bravo, my good children”.  
 I have heard that once the prophet Muhammad (saw) had given away his
ablution water to a cat and therefore quenched the thirst of all
animals.
