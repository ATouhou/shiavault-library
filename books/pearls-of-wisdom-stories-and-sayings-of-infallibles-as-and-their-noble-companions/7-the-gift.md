The Gift
========

Whenever they reaped their first harvest, they brought early, fresh
fruits to the Prophet, peace be upon him. Then he would distribute them
among those who sat around him. This morning, a poor man brought one
fruit from his small farm and gave it to the Prophet, peace be upon him.

He accepted the gift, tasted it and then went on eating it alone while
the companions watched. One of those present meekly said: O Prophet of
Allah, you have over looked the right of those who watch while you eat?

The Prophet, peace be upon him, smiled and waited till the man who had
brought the fruit had gone. He said:

I tasted the fruit and it was not yet ripe. Had I allowed you to have
some of it, someone would have definitely shown his distaste, thus
disappointing the poor man who had brought the gift. Rather than make
him feel bitter, my palate accepted the bitterness.

From *Unto Thee I Grant...*
