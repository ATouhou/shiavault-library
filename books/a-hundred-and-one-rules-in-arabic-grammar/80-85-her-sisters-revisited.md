85.  کانَ& her Sisters (Revisited).
===================================

We said earlier that**کانَ** & her Sisters are used with equational
sentences. However, they can tolerate the use of verbs after them. That
verb has to be in the present indicative form, as in:

<p dir="rtl">
**کانـَتْ تـَعملُ في مَکتـَبـِها.**
</p>

She was working in her office.

If the subject is expressed, it should be placed between**کانَ** & her
sisters and the verb.

<p dir="rtl">
**کانـَتِ الأستاذةُ تـَعملُ في مَکتـَبـِها.**
</p>

The professor was working in her office.

An exception to this rule is when you want to topicalize the subject,
and that simply means that you want to emphasize it.

<p dir="rtl">
**الأستاذة ُ کانـَتْ تـَعملُ في مَکتـَبـِها.**
</p>
