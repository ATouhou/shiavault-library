Story no. 80: Loss of over-eating.
==================================

Adeeb, wehenever sat at the table, used to eat more than the other
children, and after meals, did not avoid eating different types of
fruits, chocolates and ice creams.  
 One day Mujtaba said to him “Brother, don’t you know that over-eating
is ill-favoures in islam?”  
 But Adeeb never lent an ear.  
 Till he fell ill.  
 When he went to the doctor, he said that the loss that you are
suffering is just because of over-eating.  
 Another brother of his called Sharif said “We have heard that the Holy
Prophet has said “Do not eat till you are hungry and leave food before
you are full”.  
 And if we avoid over-eating we won’t fall ill.
