On Lowering the Gaze
====================

There is nothing more gainful than lowering one's gaze, for the sight
is not lowered from things, which Allah has forbidden unless the
witnessing of majesty and glory has already come to the heart.

The Commander of the Faithful was asked what could help in lowering
one's gaze. He said, 'Submission to the power of Him Who is aware of
your secret. The eye is the spy of the hearts and the messenger of the
intellect; therefore lower your gaze from whatever is not appropriate to
your faith, from whatever your heart dislikes and from whatever your
intellect finds repugnant.'

The Holy Prophet said, 'Lower your eyes and you will see wonders.'

Allah said,


<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَغُضُّوا مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِمْ وَيَحْفَظُوا
فُرُوجَهُمْ ذَلِكَ أَزْكَى لَهُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا
يَصْنَعُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***Say to the believing men that they cast down their looks and guard
their private parts***. (24:30)

‘Isa (‘a) said to the disciples, 'Beware of looking at forbidden
things, for that is the seed of desire and leads to deviant
behaviour.'

Yahya (‘a) said, 'I would prefer death to a glance which is
unnecessary.'

'Abdallah ibn Mas'ud said to a man who had visited a woman while she
was ill, 'It would have been better for you to lose your eyes than to
have visited your sick person.'

Whenever the eye looks at something forbidden, a knot of desire is tied
in the person's heart, and that knot will only be untied by one of two
conditions: either by weeping out of grief and regret in true
repentance, or by taking possession of what one desired and looked at.
And if a person takes possession unjustly, without repentance, then that
will take him to the Fire.

As for the one who repents of it with grief and regret, his abode is
the Garden and his destiny is Allah's favour.
