Responsibility 26: Getting Spiritually Closer to the Imam Part 2
================================================================

During times of difficulty, misfortunes, sickness and other such things
even in the times of confusion and spiritual difficulties which can
wreak havoc on the belief system and faith of a person one should hold
tight to Imam al-Zaman (ajtf) and seek help and support from him. During
such a time, one must cry out for help to the Imam.

Allah has said in the Qur\`an:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 وَ لِلٌّهِ الأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنـى فَادْعُوهُ بِهَا 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And to Allah belong the most beautiful names so call upon Him by
them.”***[^1]

In relation to this verse, it has been narrated from Imam Ja’far b.
Muhammad as-Sadiq  that:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
نَحنُ وَ اللٌّهِ الأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنـى
  </p>
</blockquote>

“We (the Ahlul Bayt) are, by Allah, the most beautiful names (of
Allah).”[^2]  
 In addition, Imam ‘Ali b. Musa al-Rida (as) has said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِذَا نَزَلَتْ بِكُمْ شِدَّةٌ فَاسْتَعِينُوا بِنَا عَلـى اللٌّهِ عَزَّ
وَجَلَّ وَ هُوَ قُوْلُهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ:  وَ لِلٌّهِ الأَسْمَاءُ
الْحُــسْنىٌ فَادْعُوهُ بِهَا 
  </p>
</blockquote>

“When difficulties come upon you, then seek assistance through us (the
Ahlul Bayt) as intermediaries with Allah, the Noble and Grand, and this
is the meaning of His words, the Noble and Grand, And to Allah belong
the most beautiful names so call upon Him by them.”[^3]

Indeed, the believers must refer to their Imam and seek assistance from
him because if they do not do so, then they will remain in troubles and
will not be protected from disgrace and humiliation.
