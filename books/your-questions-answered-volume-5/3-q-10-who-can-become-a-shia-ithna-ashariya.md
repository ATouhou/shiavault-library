Q. 10: Who Can Become a Shia Ithna-'ashariya?
=============================================

Who can become a Shi'a Ithna'ashariya?

A. Any person, irrespective of his race, origin, colour or language,
can become a Shi'a Ithna-'ashari, if he sincerely believes in our tenets
and faithfully acts upon them.

**Q. 11: MAIN FEATURES OF ISLAM**

Will you explain to me the main features of Islam in short?

A. Islam consists of three parts.

1. Matters concerning belief which are called Roots of Religion.

2. Rules of Shari'ah which govern every aspect of our lives; they are
called Branches of religion.

3. Islamic Ethics and Morality.

**Q. 12: ROOTS OF RELIGION?**

What are the roots of Religion?

A. There are five Roots of Religion: They are called:

1. Tawheed : Oneness of God
2. Adl : Justice of God
3. Nubuwwat: Prophethood
4. Imamat : Vicegerency of the Prophet
5. Qiyamat: Day of Judgement.

**Q. 13: ONENESS OF GOD**

What does Tawheed mean?

A. It means that there is only one God - Eternal, Self-sufficient; He
has no beginning or end; He is Omnipotent, has power ever everything and
every affair. He is Omniscient, knows everything, nothing is ever a
secret from Him. He has His own discretion in all affairs, does not do
anything under compulsion. He is All-perceiving, All-hearing, All-seeing
and Omnipresent. He sees and hears everything though He has neither eye
nor ear.

He has no partner or colleague, nor has He any son, daughter or wife.
He is neither made nor composed of any material substance. He has no
body nor is He confined to a place. He is not afflicted by anything
related to body; He is not governed by time, space, change or things
like that. He is not visible.

He has not been seen, and will never be seen either in this world or
the hereafter. His attributes are not separate from His person.

**Q. 14: MORE ABOUT ONENESS OF GOD**

Will you throw some more light on the belief in oneness of God? A. The
belief in the Unity of God is the foundation stone of Islam. This belief
governs the religious faith, designs the social patterns and gives life
to the moral codes. The first sentence of the Islamic Kalimah, i.e.,
"There is no god except Allah", leads a Muslim throughout his life not
only in religious matters but in social behaviour also. "There is no
god" shows a Muslim that nothing in the universe is superior to him.

It is observed in the Qur'an that "He it is Who has created for you all
that is in the earth." So a Muslim knows that nothing in this world is
to be worshipped. Neither stone nor trees; neither animals nor
human-beings; neither the Sun nor the Moon nor the Stars can be
worshipped; because everything is created, and created for his
benefit.

When a Muslim, thus, has rejected every falsehood and every idea of
nature-worship, idol-worship or human-worship, he is ready to believe in
the positive truth of the Unity of God. Believing in a Supreme being
gives an aim to our life and provides a purpose for our actions.

Had a man been left with the wrong impression that there was no God at
all, his life would have been aimless, and an aimless life is dangerous.
So it is added that there is no god "except Allah". This sentence has a
negative as well as a positive aspect. Both are instrumental in creating
the belief that every man is equal to every other person. When nobody is
superior, nobody is inferior.

Thus, the belief in the Unity of God promotes the sense of brotherhood,
equality and equity which is another feature of Islam.

**Q15: RESPECT FOR THE NAME OF ALLAH**

If I have written the Arabic name of God on a piece of paper, can I
throw it away? Suppose this is in English, does the same rule apply?
What about the names of the Ahlul-Bait? A.

It is haram to throw away the names of Allah or Ma'sumeen. Such
writings should either be buried, put in river or ocean or re-cycled. It
makes no difference whether it is written in Arabic or in any other
script. (Be careful about the stamps of Iran. Some stamps have Qur'anic
verses written on them).

**Q. 16: SIGNIFICANCE OF 'ADI**

What is the significance of 'Adi? A. 'Adi means that Allah is just; He
does not do injustice to any one. He has ordered us to do justice to our
fellow creatures - but He Himself treats us not only with justice but
with grace. He created us for His worship, in order that we may attain
spiritual perfection through it. That spiritual perfection enables us to
reach nearer to Allah.

For this purpose, He has given us freedom of will and choice. When we
choose, by our own free will, the Straight Path (prescribed by Allah) we
are assured in the next world of everlasting happiness and glory by
Grace of Allah.

**Q. 17: MAN'S FREE WILL**

In the above reply, you say that we, by our own free will, choose the
path we proceed upon. But I have been told that the Muslims believe in
predestination - that our all good and bad actions are predestined by
Allah. Please explain the reality to me.

A. We know by our instinct that there are some matters over which we
have no authority, concerning which we have no choice, like birth,
death, happiness, unhappiness, affluence, poverty; etc. Such matters
(which we may call our conditions) are totally in God's hands, although
man has to fulfil his duties in that area too, at least in preliminary
stages. Also there are our "actions" which we instinctively know are
done with our own will and choice, like speaking truth or lie, helping
someone or refusing him help, etc.

Some Muslims think that man has no authority on this matter too. Others
believe that man is totally independent in his actions and Allah has
nothing to do with it.

But we, the Shi'a Ithna-'ashariyah, believe that man, in his actions,
is neither compelled by Allah nor independent of Allah's control; the
reality lies in between these two extremes. To explain it fully, I would
like to give you an example written by our present Mujtahid, Ayatullah
as-Sayyid Abul Qasim al-Khoui. Suppose there is a man whose hand is
totally paralyzed; he by himself cannot move even a finger.

A doctor has fitted a device on his hand which, when activated by a
remote-control, restores the hand to normal condition and allowing the
man the use of hand in whatever way he likes. The doctor has kept the
remote-control in his custody.

He has switched that control on, and it is the man who decides whether
to use his newly-found power and strength for good cause or evil; the
doctor does not Interfere, although if he wanted he coufd switch it off.
Now, the good or bad actions done by that person are not done by the
doctor's will and choice; but at the same time they are not totally
independent of the doctor In the same way, we do whatever we do by our
own free will and choice but the power to do so Is given us by Allah who
may "switch it off" any time he pleases.

**Q. 18: MEANING OF NUBUWWAT**

What is the meaning of Nubuwwat And what is Nubuwwat?

A. To show us the Straight Path, Allah has been sending His
representatives to the mankind. They are called nabii (Prophet) and
rasul (Messenger). The rank of the Messengers was higher than the
Prophets. Every Messenger was also a Prophet but not vice versa.

**Q. 19: NUMBER OF PROPHETS:**

How many Prophets came into the world?

A. There came in all 124,000 Prophets, 313 of which were Messengers.
The Prophethood started with the first man, Adam, and ended with
Muhammad, the Holy Prophet of Islam.

All the Prophets and Messengers brought the same religion which
nowadays is called Islam. It was but natural. As all of them were sent
by the same God, naturally the message could not be more than one. The
beliefs and morals taught by them were always the same, although the
rules of shari'ah were changed from time to time according to the
condition of the society.

Some messengers had a still higher position and are called Ulul-'azm.
