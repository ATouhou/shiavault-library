Letter 45

Resorting to Interpretation, Following in the Footsteps of the Predecessors, is Unavoidable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Muharram 6, 1330**

Had it not been for the caliphate of the Righteous Caliphs, which is
correct beyond any doubt, we would not have had any choice other than
accepting your view and interpreting this verse and others according to
your own judgement, but to cast doubts about the soundness of their
caliphate, may Allah be pleased with them, is out of the question.
Resorting to interpretation, then, is unavoidable, since we have
believed in them as well as in those who swore the oath of allegiance to
them, Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*S*
