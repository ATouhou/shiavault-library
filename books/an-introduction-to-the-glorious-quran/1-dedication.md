**To**

**My beloved mother**

**Homa Samii**

**My life is barren without your love**

*Enlighten your homes by recitation of the Glorious Qur'an...Goodness
prevails and blessing spreads in a house where the Noble Qur’an is read
very often. Such a house illuminates for the celestial inhabitants as
the stars shine for the terrestrial beings.* [^1]

*A house in which the Glorious Qur’an is recited and the name of God the
Exalted is frequently mentioned shall be a very blessed home. Angels
will be present in it and satans shall be far from it. Such houses
radiate for the divine residents as stars shine for the inhabitants of
the earth. And the house in which the Noble Qur’an is not read and the
name and remembrance of the Almighty God is not uttered, is desecrated.
Angels keep away from and satans keep presence in these homes.*[^2]
