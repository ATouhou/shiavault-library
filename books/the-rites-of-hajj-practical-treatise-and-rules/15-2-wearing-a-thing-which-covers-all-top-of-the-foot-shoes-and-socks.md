2.Wearing a thing which covers all top of the foot (shoes and socks)
====================================================================

Article 95
----------

Wearing shoes, which covers both the top of the feet like boots and also
wearing socks in the state of Ihram is not permitted, even if they cover
the shank or not. But if they cover a part of top of the feet, like
straps of sandals and shoes (that a part of the top of the feet are
shown by wearing them) are permitted. This ruling is exclusive for men
and wearing socks and shoes has no problem for women.

Article 96
----------

If the towel of Ihram is long and covers the top of the foot, or the
pilgrim for example puts a hot towel on the foot for reducing the pain,
then these have no problem.

Article 97
----------

Whenever a man wears socks or shoes in the case of necessity or
deliberately, this act has no atonement and obligatory precaution is to
shear the topside of the shoe if the pilgrim forced to wear socks or
shoes.
