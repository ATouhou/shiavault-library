Preface
=======

The Noble Prophet (prayers of Allah be upon him and his family) has
said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ حَفِظَ عَـلـى أُمَّتِـي أَرْبَعِينَ حَدِيثًا يَـنْتَفِعُونَ بِهَا
بَعَـثَهُ اللهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَقِيهاً عَالِـماً.
  </p>
</blockquote>

   
*“The person from my nation who memorizes forty traditions pertaining to
those issues of religion which he is in need of, will be resurrected by
Allah on the Day of Judgement as a person with deep insight into the
faith and as a scholar.”*  
    
 In following the above hadith, The Islamic Education Board of The World
Federation of KSIMC (IEB ‑ WF) has decided to publish a series of
booklets of 40 Ahadith on different subjects. The Ahadith which have
been selected from various sources, are short and simple and therefore
easy to understand and memorize. It is envisaged that the booklets will
not only be useful for Zakireen, Madrasah teachers and students, but
will be of benefit to the Ummah at large.  
    
 The collection of the Ahadith and introduction of this present work was
done by Mahmud Mahdipur [as found on the Internet at
<http://www.hawzah.net/Per/K/Ah-Haj/Index.htm>], while the translation
in English was carried out by Shaykh Saleem Bhimji.  IEB ‑ WF would like
to thank Shaykh Saleem for his efforts in the translation of this work. 
May Allah (Glory and Greatness be to Him) accept this work as a further
attempt by IEB ‑ WF to propagate Islam.
