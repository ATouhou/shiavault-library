106: Quraysh
============

These 4 Meccan verses were revealed after The Figtree 95. An alternate
title is Winter, taken from v.2. This message shows us that God is the
Source of our relative security and commercial prosperity.

The Quraysh were the Prophet's own clan, who at first opposed his
mission and felt they were the only aristocrats fit to live in Mecca.
Later members of this family became his successors or caliphs in the
great cities of Damascus and Baghdad.
