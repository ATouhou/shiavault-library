Dedication
==========

   
 I present this humble effort to my father and mother, who brought me up
when I was little, gave me a good name, taught me writing and religious
principles, and married me as soon as I became an adult. They have
completed their duties towards me; in fact, they have done to me more
than I deserved.  
    
 I pray to Allah the Almighty to make me successful in achieving my
duties towards them as long as I live and to gather me with them in
Paradise near Prophet Muhammad (S) and his pure progeny (a.s.).  
    
 I hope with this dedication to give a reward to the soul of my dear
father and to be dutiful to my dear mother (May Allah keep her safe and
sound).  
    
 O Allah, accept my effort and guide my children to do better than I
have done!
