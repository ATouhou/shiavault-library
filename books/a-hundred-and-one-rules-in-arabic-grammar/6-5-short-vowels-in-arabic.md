5. Short Vowels in Arabic
=========================

The notation of the short vowels was a complicated problem. Abu Al-Aswad
Al-Du'ali is credited with introduction of the system of colored dots in
the writing system, and the terminology, "FatHa**-َ** , Dhamma**-ُ** ,
Kasra**-ِ** .". But, a substantial improvement in the system of short
vowels notation is usually attributed to the first lexicographer of the
Arabic language, Al-Khalil Ibn Ahmed. He replaced the colored dots with
specific shapes for the short vowels and the Shadda. With Al-Khalil's
reform, the system of Arabic orthography was almost the same ever since.

**When used at the end of a definite noun or adjective they indicate
case.**

(a)**-ُ** indicates Nominative case as in**الکتابُ**

(b)**-َ** indicates Accusative case as in**الکتابَ**

(c)**-ِ**  indicates Genitive case as in      **الکتابِ**

As you might have noticed, Siibawaih did not include the short vowels.
Neither did he talk about the diphthongs which are created every time
you have a short vowel proceeding the long vowels ** و** and **ي** as
in**يَوم ** ** ** **،** ** بَيت**
