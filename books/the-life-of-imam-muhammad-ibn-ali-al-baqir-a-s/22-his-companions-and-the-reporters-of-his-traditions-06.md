on him, about the question. I asked him about thirty thousand tradition.
Moreover, I asked Abu\` ‘Abd Allah (al-Sa\`diq), peace be on him, about
sixteen thousand traditions.”[^2]

### Honoring and Glorification

###

A large group of traditions was narrated on the authority of the Ima\`ms
of the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them. In the
traditions, the Ima\`ms praised and lauded Mohammed b. Moslem. The
following is some of the traditions:

1. Al-Kashi reported on the authority of ‘Abd Allah b. Ya‘fu\`r, who
said: “I said to Abu\` ‘Abd Allah (al-Sa\`diq), peace be on him, I
cannot meet you or come to you every hour. My companions usually come
and question me. I am unable to answer all what they ask. So, the
Ima\`m, peace be on him, said: ‘What prevents you from (resorting to)
Mohammed b. Moslem al-Thaqafi? For he heard from my father, and my
father glorified him.’”[^3] This tradition shows that Mohammed
outstanding scientific abilities and talents. So, the Moslems resorted
to him to take religious opinions.

2. Al-Kashi reported on the authority of Mohammed b. Kha\`lid
al-Tayalisi, who said: “Mohammed b. Moslem was from the people of
Ku\`fa. He came to Abu\` Ja‘far (al-Ba\`qir), peace be on him. So, Abu\`
Ja‘far said to him: ‘Give good news to the humble about the
garden.’”[^4] This tradition shows that Mohammed is among the close
friends of Allah.

3. Jamïl b. Darra\`jj reported. He said: [I heard Abu\` ‘Abd Allah
(al-Sa\`diq), peace be on him, say:] “Give good news to the humble about
the garden. They are Barïd b. Mu‘a\`wiya al-‘Ajali, Abu\` Basïr (layth
b. al-Bakhtari al-Mura\`di), Mohammed b. Moslem, and Zara\`ra. They are
four highborn persons. They are the trustees of Allah over His lawful
and unlawful. Were it not for them, the traditions of the Prophet would
be obliterated.”[^5]

4. Ima\`m Abu\` ‘Abd Allah (al-Sa\`diq), peace be on him, said: “Four
persons are the most lovable of all people with us, whether they are
dead or living. They are Barïd b. Mu‘a\`wiya al-‘Ajali, Zara\`ra b.
A‘yun, Mohammed b. Moslem, and Abu\` Ja‘far al-Ahwal.[^6] Other
traditions praise Mohammed’s outstanding merits. They show that he had a
great position with the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on
them.

### His Scientific Rank

###

Mohammed b. Moslem was one of the most brilliant scholars of his time in
outstanding merits, jurisprudence, and knowledge of the precepts of the

religion. In “al-Risa\`la al-Adadiya”, Shaykh al-Mufïd numbered him as
one of the main figures and jurists, from whom (the people) took the
lawful, the unlawful, religious opinions, and legal precepts, whom no
one slanders and dispraises. Ima\`m Abu\` ‘Abd Allah al-Sa\`diq, peace
be on him, asked the Moslem scholars to resort to Mohammed b. Moslem.
Mohammed asked Abu\` Ja‘far (al-Ba\`qir), peace be on him, about thirty
thousand tradition. Moreover, he asked Abu\` ‘Abd Allah (al-Sa\`diq),
peace be on him, about sixteen thousand traditions.

### Mohammed before Shurayk, the Judge

###

The historians said: “Mohammed b. Moslem and Abu\` Kurayba al-Azdi
testified before Shurayk, the judge, who deviated from the members of
the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on them. Shurayk looked at their faces
carefully. Then, he said: “You are two Ja\`faris Fatimis. I do not
accept your testimony.” When they heard that, they wept. Shurayk was
astonished at them, so he asked them: “What has made you weep?”

They replied: “You have attributed us to people. The people do not
accept us to be among their brothers when they see our foolishness. You
have ascribed us to a man. The man (i. e., Ima\`m al-Sa\`diq, peace be
on him) who does not accept us to be among his Shi‘ites. If he accepted
us, we would be grateful to him.”

Shurayk admired them, so he said: “People should be like you.” Then he
accepted their testimony.

Mohammed b. Moslem and Abu\` Kurayba made the pilgrimage to the Sacred
House of Allah. Then they met Ima\`m al-Sa\`diq, peace be on him. They
told him about the conversation that occurred between them and Shurayk.
The Ima\`m, peace be on him, was displeased with Shurayk. So, he said:
“Shurayk will have nothing on the Day of Judgment except a share of
fire.”[^7]

### Mohammed bin Moslem sold dates

###

Mohammed b. Moslem was one of the rich in Ku\`fa. Ima\`m Abu\` Ja‘far
(al-Ba\`qir), peace be on him, asked him to sell dates to save his life
from the Umayyads, who illegally shed the blood of the Shi‘ites. Thus,
Mohammed took dates and scales, and then he sat at the door of the
mosque of Ku\`fa. Some people came and said to him: “You have exposed
us!” “My master, Abu\` Ja‘far (al-Ba\`qir, peace be on him) asked me to
do that. So, I have obeyed his order,” he said to them. They said to
him: “If you insist on buying and selling, then sit with millers.” He
responded to them. So, he bought a hand mill and sat with the millers.
With this he could save his life.[^8]

al-Husayn, peace be on him, until I saw his son, Mohammed b. ‘Ali. I
wanted to advise him but he advised me.”

“My companions asked me: ‘What did he warn you of?’ I told them: I went
out to one of the suburbs of Medina at a time when it was hot. There I
met Mohammed b. ‘Ali, peace be on him. He was a well-built man and he
was leaning on two servants boys. Either they were black slaves of his
or they were retainers of his. I said to myself: Here is a venerable
leader (shaykh) of Quraysh out at this time and in these circumstances
seeking worldly (advantage). I must warn him. So, I approached him and
greeted him. He returned my greetings with anger. The sweat was pouring
down him.”

I said: “May Allah remove you, a venerable leader of Quraysh, out at
this time and in these circumstances seeking worldly (advantage). If
death came upon you while you were in this condition (what would you
do?)”

He made the two servant-boys let go of his hand and held himself up.
Then he said: “By Allah, if death came upon me while I was in this
condition, it would come upon me while I am (fulfilling) an act of
obedience to Allah, by which I make myself withdraw from you and from
the (rest of the) people. I would only fear death if it came upon me
while I was performing an act of disobedience against Allah.”

you, I wanted to warn and you have warned me.”[^12]

Shi‘ite.

With this, we will end our talk about the companions of Ima\`m Abu\`
Ja‘far (al-Ba\`qir), peace be on him, and the narrators of his
traditions. We do not say that we have mentioned them all. However, we
have mentioned some of them. Besides, we have not mentioned their
biographies in detail. Rather, we have mentioned an index for their
names. Moreover, we have mentioned brief outlines about some of their
affairs. For our references have not mentioned other details.

However, among this large group of the companions of Ima\`m al-Ba\`qir
and the narrators of his traditions is a group of the greatest scholars
and jurists. Among them are Mohammed b. Moslem, Zara\`ra b. A‘yun, Abu\`
Basïr, and the like. They played a central role in founding the
jurisprudence of the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt), peace be on
them. They recorded their traditions to which jurists resort to conclude
religious opinions. Thus, they preserved the most important intellectual
scientific Islamic wealth.
