Exhumation of Grave
===================

**Q49: Is it permissible to excavate the grave of the deceased if it
does not entail disrespect for the deceased?**

A: It is not permissible except for special purposes that have been
explained in the books of *fiqh*, such as cases of dire necessity. (FM,
p. 420)

**Q50: In a previous question (Q26), we informed your eminence about the
differences among the Muslims regarding the direction of the**
***qiblah*****. What is the ruling on one who was buried facing a
direction adopted at the time of burial and then (the direction) was
changed after the burial, given that exhumation and identification of
those buried in the previous direction or the new direction would entail
great hardship?**

A: In response to the question, it is not obligatory to execute the
change. (MMS, p. 11, Q2)
