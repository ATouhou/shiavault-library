Editor's Note
=============

This book is the second in its league. It is yet another contribution of
the author, as-Sayyid Abdul Hadi al-Hakim, after the publication of the
translation of his book alfatawal muyessarah - Jurisprudence Made Easy,
to the effort of making the body of fiqh (jurisprudence) easier for the
layman to come to grips with.

Translating such work is a challenging task. Yet the translator,
as-Sayyid Mohammad Rizvi, has done a great job. However, where I saw the
reader's interest is better served, I have made some changes. The title
of the book now reads, A Code of Practice for Muslims in the West. To
avoid repetition, I decided to collate the translator's footnotes,
dealing with clarifying the meanings of the Arabic terms, as well as
some other "Frequently Used Terms" under one title, i.e. "Glossary".

I must stress, though, that throughout the process of making these
changes, and others for that matter, I was in close consultation with
both the author and the publishers, Imam Ali Foundation, UK, London.

I pray to Allah, the Exalted to forgive any inadvertent mistake or error
of judgment I may have made in the course of editing the book. I also
implore Him to make this work of mine a step towards attaining His
approval, that He accepts it favourably and make it of use.
