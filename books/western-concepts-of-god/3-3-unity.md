3. Unity
========

Monotheism maintains that there is one God.

To this Christianity adds that there is a threefold distinction within
one God.

Stated roughly, God is one substance in three persons.

Aquinas argued that there cannot be two gods because neither would be
absolutely perfect since one would have a quality that the other lacked
(Summa Theologica Ia, 11, 3). Richard Swinburne says that theism is a
simpler hypothesis than polytheism, the latter positing more beings with
various capabilities and relations.

Theism is therefore more likely since simpler hypotheses turn out to be
true more often.

Moreover, the universe exhibits a unity, in its universal natural laws
for example.

This unity argues for one deity as its originator (The Existence of
God, 1991, pp. 141-2).

**4. Eternity**

Biblical authors spoke of God remembering the past, knowing the future,
and acting in the present.

According to early Christian thought, God exists forever, without
beginning or end.

For him events are past, present, and future.

Later Christian thought, under the influence of Platonism it is said,
held that God exists not inside time, but outside it.

God is atemporal in that for him everything is simultaneous, there
being no past, present, or future.

This later view was held by Augustine, Anselm, and Aquinas; and
classically expressed by Boethius, "Eternity is the complete and total
possession of unending life all at once" (Consolation of Philosophy, V,
vi). Boethius regarded a timeless being as superior because it does not
lack a past and future; its entire existence is in a timeless present.

In modern times the timeless view has been defended by E. L.

Mascall, Norman Kretzmann, Eleanor Stump, Paul Helm, and Brian
Leftow.

Arguments in favor include: it makes God more transcendent, it
simplifies foreknowledge, it proposes the same divine relationship to
time as to space--God is outside it; furthermore it allows for the
creation of time along with matter.

Arguments for the earlier view, that God is eternal but exists within
time, include: personhood requires existence in time because only in
time can there be intending, acting, knowing, remembering, and the like;
it is difficult to explain how a timeless God can know or respond to
events; and the notion of timeless eternity is incoherent.

**5. Immutability**

Those who accept the view that God is outside time are able to argue
that God cannot change because any change would have to take place
inside time.

The view that God is an absolutely perfect being can also lead to the
conclusion that he cannot change: if he is perfect he could change
neither for the better nor for the worse.

Simplicity can be grounds for accepting divine immutability since the
only things subject to change are things with parts.

Immutability has been taken in a strong sense to mean that if a
predicate p applies to God at any time then it must apply at every
time.

But this is so broad that it brings into the discussion of immutability
things that, while changing, are in no way changing within God.

For example, "Smith believes in God" could be false yesterday and true
today, yet nothing within God has changed.

God is immutable in a weaker and less problematic sense if it is
required only that he does not change in his character and purpose.

The weaker sense fits well with the view that God exists in time, since
he could be considered immutable yet begin an action, forgive a person,
and so on.

Thus, predicates like, "God is protecting r from harm" could be the
case at one time but not another and God would still be immutable.

The stronger sense of immutability fits well with a God outside of
time.

**6. Omnipotence**

The claim that God can do anything has been the subject of a number of
qualifications.

First, many affirm the biblical view that God cannot do what is morally
contrary to his nature.

Similar to Anselm (Proslogion 7), Aquinas says that God cannot sin
because he is omnipotent, since sin is a falling short of perfection
(Summa Theologica, Ia.

25.3). Nelson Pike says that it is logically possible for God to sin
but he would not do what is against his nature.

Aquinas also says that God cannot do other things that corporeal beings
can do.

And, he cannot do what is logically impossible, such as make a square
circle.

Descartes is one of the few to hold the contrary view, that the laws of
mathematics and logic are subject to the will of God (Descartes'
Conversation with Burman, 22, 90). Perhaps the most significant
challenge to omnipotence involves the existence of evil.

It seems evil would not exist if God is both good and omnipotent.

Process theology denies omnipotence, Christian Science denies the
ultimate reality of evil, and some post-Holocaust thinking seems to
question the goodness of God.

Augustine defends the orthodox Christian concept of God on grounds that
he did what was good in creating free beings yet they used their freedom
to do evil.

Some suffering is the just consequence of sin.

Furthermore, where evil is a lack of good we cannot ask why God created
it since it is merely the absence of something.

Aquinas, Leibniz and others recognize that some good things exist only
in the presence of certain types of evil.

For example, forgiveness exists only where there is sin.

In the light of these secondary goods, Leibniz argues that out of all
the possible worlds God created the one with the best possible balance
of good and evil.

Some thinkers appeal to a future life to settle apparent discrepancies
in the balance of good over evil.

God's future blessing, it is said, can more than make up for suffering
in this world.

William Alston develops the idea that as limited beings we are
incapable of discerning-and therefore questioning-whether God has
sufficient reasons for allowing the evil that exists.

**7. Omniscience**

While a few like Avicenna and Averroes seem to have held that a God who
lacks certain types of knowledge would be more perfect, most have
claimed that God knows everything.

This is sometimes refined, for example, to the claim that God knows
everything that is logically possible to know.

An area of concern going back to Aristotle (On Interpretation 9) is the
claim that propositions about future contingent events (i. e. , those
whose causes are not determined by past events) have no truth value.

If so they are unknowable, even by an omniscient being (a view held in
modern times by so called Open Theism). Some have claimed that even if
future events have a truth value, they are logically unknowable.

Of special concern is the relationship between omniscience and human
free will: if yesterday God knew infallibly that I would do x today, it
seems I have no alternative but to do x today--a conclusion that seems
to violate free will.

To solve this, Boethius and Aquinas appealed to the concept of God's
timelessness, which entails that none of God's knowledge is past or
future.

Aquinas also said that God determines all events and determines that
they will be done freely.

De Molina objected that this amounts to removing free will.

He constructed his own view, which said that God's knowledge is
logically prior to his decree of what will be.

God knows what an individual will do in all possible circumstances (a
capacity called middle knowledge), and he decrees those circumstances in
which a person freely cooperates with the divine plan.

Thus foreknowledge is compatible with free will.

Others have conceded that foreknowledge is incompatible with free will
but claim that God voluntarily limits his knowledge of future events so
that there can still be freedom.

This makes omniscience a matter of having an ability to know rather
than having specific knowledge.

Another solution to the problem of omniscience and freedom challenges
the idea that God's knowledge limits future free actions in any way.

While God knows necessarily that I will do x tomorrow that does not
entail that it is necessary I do x.

What God knows is what I will freely choose to do.

So God knows today that I will do x tomorrow because tomorrow I will
freely choose to do x.

But if tomorrow I choose to do y, then today God knows that tomorrow I
will do y.

This view is consistent with what we know about less than infallible
knowledge of future events.

I may know that a person will choose steak over bologna though I in no
way influenced their choice.

**8. Impassibility**

Various views have been held as to whether God can be affected by
outside influences.

Because Aristotle regarded change as inconsistent with perfection, he
concluded that God could not be affected by anything outside himself.

Furthermore, God engages not in feeling, but thinking, and he himself
is the object of his contemplation.

God is thus unaffected by the world in any way.

The Stoics ruled out divine passibility because they regarded
imperturbability as a virtue, and God must be the supreme example of
it.

John of Damascus agreed that God is imperturbable, but stressed it is
because he is sovereign, not because he is uncaring.

Aquinas accepted Aristotle's view that God cannot change and is
impassible.

He can act, but nothing can act upon him.

So emotions that proceed from God, such as love and joy, are in God;
but other emotions such as anger and sadness can be ascribed to him only
metaphorically.

Early, medieval, and Reformation Christianity generally affirmed that
because God could not suffer, Christ suffered in his humanity but not in
his divine nature.

However, the idea that God is unaffected by the world is being
rethought in modern times.

Moltmann, who was for a time a German prisoner of war, and Kitamori, a
Japanese thinker, both witnessed World War II and its aftermath.

They concluded that God must be moved by suffering.

Richard Creel defends impassibility as being uncontrolled by outside
influences.

He says, among other things, that: God has emotions but they are not
controlled by anything outside himself, he takes into account the
ultimate good that will come from suffering, suffering does not make
love more admirable, a God who suffers would be more appropriately an
object of pity than of worship, justice does not require passibility
because it need not be based on emotion; and omniscience does not
require passibility because God need know only that a person has an
emotion, he does not need to experience it.

A mediating position would allow emotion in God but not control of him
in any way by creatures.

God would be affected by the world but only in the way and to the
extent he allows.

**9. Goodness**

Whereas classical Greek religion ascribed to the gods very human
foibles, theism from Plato onward has affirmed that God is purely good
and could not be the author of anything evil (Republic). In Judaism
divine goodness is thought to be manifested especially in the giving of
the law (Torah). In Islam it is thought to be manifested in divine
revelation of truth through the prophets, especially as revealed in the
Qur'an.

And in Christianity it is manifested in the gracious granting of Christ
as the way of salvation.

While goodness encompasses all moral perfection (e.g., truth telling,
justice), benevolence is that particular aspect of goodness that wills
the benefit of another.

The Reformers, and Protestantism generally, stressed that God's desire
for the benefit of creatures is dependent not on their merits but purely
on divine love.

Divine love is not only irrespective of merit but it is shown most
clearly where it is entirely unmerited, as in grace shown to fallen
humanity.

Therefore divine forgiveness and redemption are taken as the highest
expressions of benevolence.

Benevolence intersects with omnipotence in providence, wherein God
orders events for good ends.

It also raises the possibility of a clash between the divine and human
wills, as when a person spurns God's action in the world.

Divine goodness raises the question of whether God wills x because it
is good, or x is good because God wills it.

The former seems to weaken divine sovereignty, but the latter seems to
make goodness arbitrary.

The arbitrariness may be somewhat relieved if God's will is understood
as bounded by his unchanging character.

God would not, for example, decide to make torturing for enjoyment
right since his nature forever condemns it.

The issue has implications for divine command ethics, according to
which acts are right or wrong because God commands or forbids them (as
opposed to, for example, a competing view that acts are right or wrong
according to whether they promote the greatest happiness).

As to our knowledge of divine goodness, Aquinas separates the order of
being from the order of knowing: all goodness derives from God but we
understand divine goodness by extrapolating from the goodness of
creatures.

For Aquinas, this requires an analogical (as opposed to an equivocal)
relationship between divine and human goodness.

For Kant, divine goodness is known as a postulate of pure practical
reason: God must be there to reward virtue and punish evil.

The greatest challenge to belief in divine goodness has been the fact
that evil exists, or more recently, the amount and type of evil rather
than the mere fact of it.

The problem is lessened if it is acknowledged that divine goodness does
not require that each creature always be made to experience as much
happiness as it is capable of experiencing.

Reasons may include, for example, that: it is impossible that all
creatures collectively experience maximal happiness (e.g., because the
maximal happiness of one precludes the maximal happiness of another), or
that there is some higher good than the happiness of all creatures
(e.g., John Hick's view that maturity is that higher good, and acquiring
it may entail some displeasure), or that some forms of good are
manifested only when certain types of evil exist (for example,
forgiveness requires wrongdoing; mentioned in "6," above); or because
God's favor is undeserved and not given in response to merit, it cannot
be owed and God cannot be faulted for not giving it.
