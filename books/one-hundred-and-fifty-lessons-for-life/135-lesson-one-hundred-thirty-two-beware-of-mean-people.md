=====================================================

Imam ‘Ali Ibn Muhammad At-Taqi (a.s.) said:

مَنْ هانَتْ عَلَيْهِ نَفْسُهُ فَلا تَأْمَنْ شَرَّهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Beware of malady of one who does not assume a dignity for himself! [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

In fact, one of the most important factors preventing corruption and
malevolence is dignity or at least a feeling of dignity. Dignified
people or those who assume a dignity for themselves even though others
do not consider them dignified, tend to avoid evils and bad deeds in
order to preserve their status . But those who feel that they do not
have any reputation, respect and dignity, would heed nothing. Hence the
need to be wary of such people!

For this reason, one of the important goals of education especially for
children is to inculcate in them the awareness of dignity and a feeling
that they possess a special dignity.
