The Revenge
===========

Mukhtar ordered his followers to make fires. The fires were a sign of
the revolution.

At midnight, the Kufians woke. They heard the revolutionaries repeating
slogans. The revolutionaries went to Mukhtar 's house.

Street clashes took place in Kufa. The Ruler's soldiers and the police
surrendered. Then the Ruler himself escaped to al-Hejaz.
