Lesson Nine: Source of Arrogance
================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"ما مِنْ رَجُل تَجَبَّرَ أَوْ تَكَبَّرَ إلاّ لِذِلَّة يَجِدُها فِى
نَفْسِهِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

No one boasts to others unless he harbors a feeling of inferiority in
himself![^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Recent psychological and psychoanalytic research has proved that
arrogance and boasting is nothing more than an inferiority complex.
Those who suffer from it resort to the practice of magnifying themselves
artificially to compensate for their deficiencies. By doing so, they
only add to their inferiority and dislike in the eyes of their
community.

So clearly evident is this from the Imam’s saying . The faithful people
are always modest before others due to their internal dignity.
