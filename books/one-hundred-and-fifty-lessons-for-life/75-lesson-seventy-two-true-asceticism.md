Lesson Seventy Two: True Asceticism
===================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلزُّهدُ فى الدُّنْيا قَصْرُ الأَمَلِ وَ شُكْرُ كُلُّ نِعْمَة وَ
الوَرَعُ عَنْ كُلِّ مآ حَرَّمَ اللّهُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Asceticism in this world is based on three things: curtailment of
desires, thanksgiving for blessings, and avoiding the prohibited things.
[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Most people misunderstand the concept of Islamic asceticism and consider
it as isolation and separation from material and social life. They
define ascetics as those who practice seclusion from society and
abstention from all material pleasures of social life.

True asceticism is in fact based on a corrective social concept as
stipulated in the above tradition.

It includes protection of rights of others , keeping away from
illegitimate and unlawful wealth, and using one’s resources for worthy
and humanitarian purposes (which is the real concept of thanksgiving) as
well as minimizing one’s desires for material things which , if
unchecked, can lead man to dissociate from everything other than the
pursuit of money, position and lust.
