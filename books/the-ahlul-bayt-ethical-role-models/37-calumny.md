Calumny
=======

As a completion of talebearing, we provide calumny, which implies
informing against people for the purpose of destroying them. On that
account, calumny is regarded as the most hideous form of talebearing. In
most cases, the victims of calumny are the celebrities and the high-
ranking whom are envied for their virtues. As the envious cannot find
any way to quench their thirst, they direct to informing against them
before the authorities. In most cases, the efforts of such individuals
become ineffective to cause them humility and punishment.

The Prophet (S) said: “The evilest people are the tri- destructive. They
are those who inform the authorities of ill things against their
friends; hence, they destroy themselves, their friends, and the
authorities[^1].”

al-Imama wat Tabsira).
