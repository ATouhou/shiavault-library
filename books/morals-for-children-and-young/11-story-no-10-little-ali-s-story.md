Story no. 10: Little Ali’s story
================================

Every day, Ali went to play in the street with his friends there. One
day he found out that the door of his house was locked.  
 He said “Mother, open the door”.  
 His mother replied “I won’t ”.  
 Ali, with tearful eyes said “Why?”  
 His mother said “Because I heard that you used abusive language with
your friends yesterday. I won’t give you the permission leave the
house”.  
 “Mother open the door, I won’t be abusive anymore”.

Bravo to the mother who pays attention to the indecency of her own child
which are things that are against the morals of Islam.
