38. The word ما
===============

The word ما has different meanings, depending on the context. It could
mean "what," and in this case you are expected to have a demonstarative
pronoun or a definite noun following it.

What is this?          **ما هذا؟**

What is his job?                     **ما عملـُهُ؟**

When the question word ** ما** is followed by a verb in the past tense,
it changes its own function to a negation particle.

I did not eat at this restaurant. **ما أکلتُ في هذا المطعم.**
