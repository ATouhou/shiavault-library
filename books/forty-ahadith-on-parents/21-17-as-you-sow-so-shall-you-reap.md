عَنْ رَسُولِ اللٌّهِ (ص): بِرُّوا آبَاءَكُمْ يَـبِرُّكُمْ
أَبْنَاءُكُمْ. عِفُّوا عَنْ نِسَاءِ النٌّاسِ تُعَفُّ نِسَاءُكُمْ.

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his family) has said: “Be
good towards your parents and your children will be good towards you. 
(And) Look upon the womenfolk of others with purity (in conduct and
intention) and your womenfolk will be looked upon with purity.”
