10: Jonah (yunus)
=================

This chapter was revealed after Eventide 103 and before Hud [the
Messenger] 11 which immediately follows it. It is the first of a group
of five chapters which all begin with the initials A. L. R. "(10, 11,12,
14 15), just as the second and third chapters and the 29th to the 32nd
inclusive begin with A. L. M. " Chapter 13 has the combination A. L. M.
R. This consists of 109 late Meccan verses arranged in eleven sections
except for VV 40, 49, 59 and 96 which date from Madina. It begins with a
description of how the world was created. The prophet Jonah is mentioned
only in section x; a fuller story of the prophet Jonah is actually given
in 37:V, and he is mentioned again in 21:VI and 68:11. There is a close
connection with the previous chapter 9, because this one rounds off its
contents and shows how God's mercy predominates.

The sin of Association is taken up in Sections II, III and XI; rain from
Heaven in iii: the Qur'an in IV; personal responsibility, and the
different nations in v; and freewill and tolerance in X. The chapter
also is concerned with Truth (III, IV, VIII, XI). At the end of Section
VII we are told emphatically that God has no son. Noah and Moses are
other prophets who are discussed in VIII.
