Transliteration
===============

The method of transliteration is based mainly on the one employed by
Ghulam Sarwar, with some minor modifications regarding the
representation of dipthongs and the *shaddah*. We have also chosen to
ignore the initial *hamzah*. The practice of placing diacritical marks
on English words of Arabic origin to ensure their proper pronunciation
is taken from Ghulam Sarwar and Ian Netton, among other scholars of
Arabic and Islām.

While it is customary to say *subhānahu* *wa ta‘ālā* after the name
Allāh, *‘alayhi al-salām* after the name of the Prophet, and *radiyya
Allāhu ‘anhu* after the names of the Companions, we have chosen to drop
them, to maintain the flow of the English. While these phrases are not
included, they are intended, and readers are free to use them.
