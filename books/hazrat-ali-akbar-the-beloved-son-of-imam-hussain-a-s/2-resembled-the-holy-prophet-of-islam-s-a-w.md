Resembled the Holy Prophet of Islam(S.A.W.)
===========================================

It was rumoured that Hussain was leaving Medina to arrange the marriage
of his son Ali Akbar with some, some lady of a noble stocks I it in some
distant land. Could this rumour be correct? They all knew that there was
not a young lad of marriage able age in Arabia who could be said to be
fit to hold a candle before him. His handsome looks were matched by his
handsome deeds. His nobility of character, his sense of duty, his
generosity, his chivalry, his geniality, his love of justice and
fairplay had endeared him to every soul. It was a well-known fact
amongst the Arabs throughout Hejaz that Ali Akbar was bearing a
remarkable resemblance to the Holy Prophet(S.A.W.). In looks, in voice,
in mannerism, in gait and in every way, he resembled the Holy
Prophet(S.A.W.). The resemblance was so marked that people from far and
wide were coming to see him, to be reminded of the Holy Prophet(S.A.W.)
whom they were missing so much. Those who had not had the good fortune
to see the Prophet were told by their elders that Ali Akbar was the very
image of Muhammad(S.A.W.). There could, therefore, be no room for doubt
that the noblest families of Arabia would consider it a signal honour if
this scion of the Holy Prophet's family were to ask for their daughter
in marriage.
