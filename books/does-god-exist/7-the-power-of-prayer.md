The Power of Prayer
===================

Muniba, a young Muslim university student, was home for the summer. She
had gone to visit some sisters one evening and the time passed quickly
as each shared their various experiences of the past year.

She ended up staying longer than she had planned.

Evening came and Muniba had to walk home alone, but she wasn't afraid
because it was a small town and she lived only a few blocks away. As she
walked along under the tall elm trees, Muniba asked "God" to keep her
safe from harm and danger. When she reached the alley, which was a short
cut to her house, she decided to take it.

However, halfway down the alley, she noticed a man standing at the end,
as though he was waiting for her. She became uneasy and began to pray,
asking for "God's" protection.

Instantly a comforting feeling of quietness and security wrapped around
her; she felt as though someone was walking with her. When she reached
the end of the alley, she walked right past the man and arrived home
safely.

The following day, she read in the paper that a young girl had been
assaulted in the same alley, just twenty minutes after she had been
there.

Feeling overwhelmed by this tragedy and the fact that it could have
been her, she began to weep. Thanking God for her safety and to help
this young woman, she decided to go to the police station. She felt she
could recognize the man, so she told them her story. The police asked
her if she would be willing to look at a line up to see if she could
identify him.

She agreed and immediately pointed out the man she had seen in the
alley the night before. When the man was told he had been identified, he
immediately broke down and confessed.

The officer thanked Muniba for her bravery and asked if there was
anything they could do for her, she asked if they would ask the man one
question.

Muniba was curious as to why he had not attacked her? When the
policeman asked him he answered, "Because she wasn't alone. She had two
tall men walking on either side of her." Subhan Allah (Glory be to
God)!

Never Underestimate The Power of Prayer!

He, who loses money, loses much
He, who loses a friend, loses much more
He, who loses FAITH, loses ALL
(B) Dua Is a Weapon:

It is essential that a man recites Dua at all times, especially in this
era. The need for Dua is greater today, because we are living in
dangerous conditions. In the face of all this difficulties, we must
recite Dua constantly.

Of course, we must act too. In Hadith - "A prayer of supplicant without
action is same as a bow without a string". But action without God's help
is also of no use.

Dua plus action shall help us. Dua not only can uplift us spiritually,
but is gives us strength as well. As The holy Prophet (p.b.u.h.) said:
"Dua is a faithful people's weapon".


**The Rope: Prayer without Action**

Another fictional story, to understand prayer without complete faith
and action! The night fell heavy in the heights of the mountains and the
man could not see anything.

All was black. Zero visibility, and the moon and the stars were covered
by the clouds. As he was climbing only a few feet away from the top of
the mountain, he slipped and fell in to the air, falling at great speed.
He could only see black spots as he went down, and the terrible
sensation of being sucked by gravity.

He kept falling and in the moments of great fear, it came to his mind
all the good and bad episodes of his life. He was thinking now about how
close death was getting, when all of a sudden he felt the rope tied to
his waist pull him very hard. His body was hanging in the air.

Only the rope was holding him and in that moment of stillness he had no
other choice other to scream: "Help me God". All of a sudden a deep
voice coming from the sky answered, "What do you want me to do?"

"Save me God".

"Do you really think I can save you?"

"Of course I believe You can." "Then cut the rope tied to your waist."
There was a moment of silence and the man decided to hold on to the rope
with all his strength. The rescue team tells that the next day a climber
was found dead and frozen his body hanging from a rope. His hands
holding tight to it, only one foot away from the ground!

Hence, a prayer without sincere action and full trust is no use. How
attached we are to our rope will we let go? Don't ever doubt about the
words of God. We should never say that He has forgotten us or abandoned
us.

The holy Qur'an says, "Allah is the Protector of those who have faith:
from the depths of darkness He will lead them forth into light. Of those
who reject faith the patrons are the evil ones: from light they will
lead them forth into the depths of darkness. They will be companions of
the fire, to dwell therein (Forever)." (2:257 )

**Prayer without Belief**

A tale is told about a small town that had historically been "dry," (no
alcohol sold) but then a local businessman decided to build a tavern. A
group of Christians from a local church were concerned and planned an
all-night prayer meeting to ask God to intervene.

It just so happened that shortly thereafter lightning struck the bar
and it burned to the ground. The owner of the bar sued the church,
claiming that the prayers of the congregation were responsible, but the
church hired a lawyer to argue in court that they were not
responsible.

The presiding judge, after his initial review of the case, stated that
"No matter how this case comes out, one thing is clear. The tavern owner
believes in prayer and the Christians do not."

(C) Beseech Allah for Everything and on Every Time:

One other observation is that we should beseech Allah's help to all our
serious and trivial problems. It is true that a man should ask Allah for
everything, even for the salt of his table, but important things come
first.

Our Prophets asked for victory, asked for truth to win. The followers
of Prophet Moses (p.b.u.h.) used to ask for steadfastness, and patience
against troubles. Everybody should ask for Islam's victory.

Dua should go with the time, and many scholars say that Dua is not that
which is written in books only, but a man is allowed to pray the way he
wants.

Dua is a contact with Almighty God, so make the contact the way you
feel best. Of course, the Duas of our Imams (p.b.u.t.) are more
comprehensive and effective, but making contact yourself with your own
words and thoughts is allowed too.

Express your inner feelings to Almighty God. Our Imams (p.b.u.t.) use
to pray for social conditions and political conditions that they lived
in.

Imam Ali (p.b.u.h.) would pray against Moawiya and Amr Ibn Aas. Imam
Hussain (p.b.u.h.) prayed against the army of Bani Umayya on the day of
Ashura.

If the Dua in books doesn't express what you feel, go ahead and express
your feelings from the bottom of your heart, with choking voice with all
devotion and concentration.
