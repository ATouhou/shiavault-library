Raising Doubts about the Hadith's Authenticity
----------------------------------------------

**Thul-Hijjah 10, 1329**

Your debater strongly doubts the credibility of this hadith. For one
thing, both Shaykhs have not included it in their *sahih* books, nor
have the authors of other *sahih* books. I do not think that this hadith
has been narrated by any reliable Sunni traditionist, and I do not think
that you yourself consider it authentic, and peace be with you.

Sincerley,

*S*
