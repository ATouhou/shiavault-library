Preface
=======

"0 People! I have been commanded to proclaim this affair (Le. the
Wilayat of Amir -ul- Momenin p.b.u.h.) so that the arguments are
completed for all the people; present or absent, and whether born or
will be born. Verily, those who are present should convey this message
to the absent ones and the fathers to their sons until the Day of
Judgment. "

This is the Prophet's (p.b.u.h.) prophetic message which on Ghadir day
attracted the believers. Those who heard these Divine words by hear,
constantly tried hard to deliver them to others. In this way, the bare
reality that originated from that brilliant pool was made to flow in the
dry desert- the life of human beings- ang they quenched the life of
those who were thirsty of seeking the truth.

Thus, they mode use of their tongue and pen on this way and wrote
hundreds and thousands of books and essays on Ghadir. They left after
entrusting this trust to their next generation.

In pursuance of achieving its cultural objectives, Naba Cultural
Organization invited interested writers in 1423 A.H. (2003) to use their
pen in the service of Imam Amir - ul- Momenin (p.b.u.h.), and once again
enliven the event of Ghadir.

From those writings, the best were selected and this collection
appeared on the basis of those articles.

The main aim behind this invitation and publication of the selected
articles is to encourage the writers of Ghadir to strive on this path.

As such one can witness differences in description, repeat of some
points, detailed and brief explanation in few cases and reference to
second hand sources in these articles. But one can find a heart that
beats in remembrance of the master of Ghadir.

While thanking our dear ones for writing articles, we recommend the
following points to them:

1- Not to leave their study and research on this subject.
2- To ponder over their readings and analyze them.
3- To reflect over innovations in their writings and refrain from
repeats found in Ghadir writings.
4- The spirit of acceptance of criticism not only for new writers but
also for the experienced ones will go a long way in improving their
works.

One should not neglect this secret of success.

Selection, compilation, arrangement and edit of the essays have been
undertaken by Mr. Hamid Farnagh and the current work is the outcome of
his effort. We thank him for his endeavors.

We pray to God to grant us success in taking constant steps and actions
in remembrance of Ghadir, and increasing our knowledge and the concern
of our readers to this Divine Message.

While awaiting the promised one of Ghadir, Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.sh.) let
us fill the spirit of Ghadir \\jthin ourselves, and in our society so
that on the day of Imam's advent, we witness the prayers of holy Prophet
(p.b.u.h.) as saying: "0 God! Love the admirers of Ali and behold his
enemies as your enemies. Hold dear those who Ali is dear for them. Be
angry with those who make him angry. Assist his helpers and abandon
those who abandon him. Make him the standard and equilibrium of truth.
