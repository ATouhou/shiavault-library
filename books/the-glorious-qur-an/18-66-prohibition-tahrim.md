66: Prohibition (tahrim)
========================

This chapter containing 12 more verses from Madina was revealed after
The [Inner] Apartments 49 and before Haggling 64. It forms the last of
twelve Madinese chapters that are found in this portion of the Qur'an.

The subject matter concerns the Prophet's own family life and disputes
with his wives Hafsa and \`A'isha over Mary the Egyptian (I), the mother
of his short lived son Ibra!hion or Abraham. The light given to
believers is pictured in section II: and then a parable on both Bad and
Good Wives , which includes a final statement on Mary. Jesus' saintly
mother.
