Dedication
==========

All praise belongs to the Lord Who created us and commissioned His noble
messengers to guide us to felicity in this world and the next. I
dedicate this book to my daughter, Shirin and my son, Shahab, and invoke
Allah, the Almighty to lead and keep all youths, including my children,
on the straight path of truth and protect them from Satan and satanic
temptations throughout their lives.

I present the reward of my translation to the soul of my late aunt, and
beseech God to give me more success in this way.

I appreciate the valuable assistance of Mr. Sayed Athar who reviewed and
edited this book.  
 On Him we trust, and He is Sufficient for us. He is the Best Supporter.
