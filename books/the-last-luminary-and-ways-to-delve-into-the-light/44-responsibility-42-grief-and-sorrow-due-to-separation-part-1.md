Responsibility 42: Grief and Sorrow Due to Separation Part 1
============================================================

Another responsibility of a true believer is that one must feel grief
and sorrow due to one’s separation from the Imam and not being able to
see him. This state of grief should be a continuous feeling for a
believer and should not be limited to merely a few days during the year.

If a true believer is only able to be in spiritual contact with the Imam
for certain hours or parts of the day, then at least in those time
periods, one must express grief at being separated from the Imam and the
delay in his advent.

There is a section in Du’a al-Nudbah which explains the sorrow one feels
at being separated from his Imam:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
هَلْ مِنْ مُعِينٍ فَأُطِيلَ مَعَهُ العَوِيلَ وَ الْبُكَاءَ؟
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Is there any assistant that will be alongside me in prolonging my grief
and tears (at being separated from you, O’ Imam?)”[^1]
