Maladies
========

**Maladies- الأسْقام**

1. It is from the [good] health of the bodies that maladies
originate.[^1]

> 1ـ مِنْ صِحَّةِ الأجْسامِ تَوَلُّدُ الأسْقامِ.

2. There is no affliction greater than the unrelenting physical ailment.

> 2ـ لا رَزِيَّةَ أعْظَمُ مِنْ دَوامِ سُقْمِ الجَسَدِ.

3. There is no escape for bodies from maladies.

> 3ـ لَيْسَ لِلأَجْسامِ نَجاةٌ مِنَ الأسْقامِ.

[^1]: Because when one is healthy, he tends to forget that he can fall
sick and does or consumes things that make him sick.
