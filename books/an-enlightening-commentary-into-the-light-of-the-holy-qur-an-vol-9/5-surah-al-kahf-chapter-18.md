***In the Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful***

This Surah contains one hundred and ten verses, all of which were
revealed in Mecca, except verse 28. In this holy Surah, the story of the
Companions of the Cave (Kahf), the story of Moses and Khidr (a.s), the
story of Zulqarnayn, and some awakening materials about Origin and End
have been discussed.

The pagans of Quraysh sent some persons from Mecca to Medina to ask the
reality of the event of the advent of Hadrat Muhammad Mustaf a (S) and
the signs of his truthfulness from the scholars of the Jews who were
living there.

The Jewish scholars told those persons, who were sent by the pagans,
that they would ask him (S) about three subjects. The Jewish scholars
said if Muhammad (S) answered two subjects and restrained from answering
the third one, he would be True. Those subjects were about: the
Companions of the Cave, Zulqarnayn, and the Soul.

They said: *if Muhammad (S) could answer the questions of ‘the
Companions of the Cave’ and ‘Zulqarnayn’, but he did not answer the
question about the Soul, he was a Divine Prophet.*[^1]
