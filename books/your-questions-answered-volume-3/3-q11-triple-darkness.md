Q11: Triple Darkness
====================

"He created you from one being, then from that (being) He made its
mate; and He hath provided for you of cattle eight kinds. He created you
in the wombs of your mothers creation after creation, in a triple
darkness........" (Qur'an, 39:6) What is meant by: (1) a triple
darkness? (2) of cattle eight kinds?

A.

(1) "Triple darkness": according to the 'Ahadith of Masumeen it means
"the three veils of darkness which cover the unborn child, i.e. the caul
or membrane, the womb and the hollow (or stomach) in which the womb is
enclosed."

(2) In Surah 6, Ayats 143-4, four kinds of cattle are mentioned in
pairs in connection with certain Arab superstitions which are condemned
by Allah, the same four pairs are mentioned here as representatives of
domesticated cattle given by Allah to man for his benefit. These are
sheep, goats, camels and oxen.

**Q12: GRADES OF THE PROPHETS**

How can we say that our Prophet (s.a.w.) is the highest in rank and
greatest of all the prophets, when Allah says in the Qur'an that we
should not make any difference between His prophets. See Ayat 285 of
Sura Al-Baqarah:-

"....... all believe in Allah and in His angels and in His Messenger;
(they say) we make no difference between His messengers...."

A. Compare this Ayat with Ayat 253 of the same Surah and you will find
that there WAS grade and RANK among the Prophets and Messengers of
Allah. That Ayat says:-

"These messengers, We have exalted some of them above the
others......."

Then what is the meaning of the Ayat 285?

Its meaning is that we have to believe in all the Messengers of Allah,
We should not be like Jews who do not believe in Hadhrat Isa (a.s.) and
Hadhrat Muhammad Mustafa (s.a.w.), nor like Christians who do not
believe in Hadhrat Muhammad Mustafa (s.a.w.).

**Q13: SINLESSNESS OF THE PROPHETS**

We believe in the sinlessness of prophets; but these sentences from a
dua (Aamal-e- Arafa) show that they were not sinless:

(1) "WA-BISMIKAL-AZEEMI-LLADHI DA'AK BIHI DAWOODO WA KHARRALAKA SAAJIDA
FAGHAFARATA LAHU DHAN-BAH"

(And by Thy Great name by which Dawood prayed to Thee and prostrated
before Thee in Sajdah, so that Thou pardoned his Dhanb' i.e. Sin)

(2) "WABISMIKAL-LADHI DA'AKA BIHI ADAMO FAGHAFARATA LAHU DHANBAH." (And
by Thy name by which Adam prayed to Thee, so that Thou pardoned his
"Dhanb' i.e. sin)

A. The word "DHANB" (Sin) when used for the prophets, means Tark-e-Awla
(leaving a better course for a lawful but unpreferred one), and not sin
in usual sense. Q14: WAS ISA (AS.) BORN ON 25th DECEMBER?

Was Nabii Isa (a.s.) born on 25th December, according to our history?
A.Hazrat Isa (a.s.) was not born in December; he was not born even in
winter. It is no question of "our" or "their" history. It is an accepted
fact.

25th December was the day when the Romans (worshippers of Mitra) used
to celebrate birth of Sun-God. 23rd December, is the shortest day in
Northern hemisphere; so, the next day sees the beginning of the
elongation of day-time. But the Romans miscalculated and thought that
the day starts to become longer from 25th December; hence their
festival.

When the Roman emperor Constantine left Mitraism to become a Christian,
the Christian priests took a lot of myths from Mitraism and made them a
part of Christianity to please him and accommodate the Romans' practices
within the Christianity. The belief in sonship of God, the atonement,
the Mass, Easter, Christmas, all fall in this category.

**Q15: RELIGIOUS GUIDE BEFORE OUR HOLY PROPHET**

Who was the Prophet in the world before Hazrat Muhammad (s.a.w.)? If it
were Nabi Isa (a.s.) then how many years after his being taken up by
Allah came Hazrat Muhammad (s.a.w.)? Was it that the world was without
any prophet for a long period, and then came Hazrat Muhammad (s.a.w) I
hope you will explain to me with full necessary details.

A. The world cannot remain without a religious guide appointed by
Allah. That guide may be a prophet or a successor of the prophet
(without himself being a prophet). Between Hazrat Isa (a.s.) and Hazrat
Muhammad Mustafa (s.a.w.) there was a gap of about 6 centuries. During
this period, there were 3 chains of religious guides:

(a) The successors of Hazrat Isa (a.s.), last of whom was Hazrat Salman
Farsi who became a follower of our Holy Prophet.

(b) The Successors of Hazrat Ismail (a.s.), last of whom was Hazrat Abu
Talib (a.s). He also became a follower of our Holy Prophet. These guides
in these two chains were not prophets themselves.

(c) Also, there came a few prophets in various places, and name of one
or two of them is mentioned in the traditions.

**Q16: THE FIRST AYAT REVEALED**

On what date and place was the first ayat revealed to the Prophet
(s.a.w.)? And which ayat?

A. The prophet of Islam was in the cave of the mountain "Hira" (3 miles
from Mecca) when the following 5 Ayats were revealed:

"Proclaim! (or Read!) in the name of they Lord and Cherisher, Who
created; created man, out of a (mere) clot of congealed blood: Proclaim!
And thy Lord is Most Bountiful, He who taught (the use of) the pen,
taught man that which he knew not."

**Q1 7: IS 'BISMILLAH' WORD OF ALLAH?**

The whole of the holy Qur'an is true word of Allah. The verse
"Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir- Raheem" is at hundreds of places in this holy
book. Is this also the word of Allah? A. Yes. Just as a teacher trains
the students in writing an application addressed to himself, Allah
teaches His creatures the necessary ways to show their submission to
Him. And, by the way, it is mentioned 114 times, not "hundreds".

**Q18: LIGHT OF ALLAH?**

It is said that Allah produced from His own Sublime Light the Light of
Muhammad and from the splendour of that Light created the world 14,000
years before the creation of Adam. Now, the question is:

(a) Is Allah constituted of Light?
(b) What does it actually mean by the word "Light" here?
(c) Does it mean that Adam was created after 14,000 years o the
creation of the earth?

A. Allah is not a light; the phrase "Light of Allah" means a "Light"
having special honour before Allah, just as the "soul" of Adam (a.s.)
was termed by Allah as "My Soul".

'Nur' (Light) is also used in the meaning of "One which is self-evident
and illuminates (shows) other things". It is in this sense that Allah is
called 'Light', for example, the Ayat, "Allah is the light of the
heavens and earth" (Qur'an, 24:35). It means that Allah is self-
existent and has created the heavens and earth.

The number, 14,000 years, could have been used in literal sense; but
usually such phrases mean a long period.

**Q19: THE MOTHER OF THE HOLY PROPHET**

Did the Holy Prophet Muhammad's mother have any relationship with
Madina? Was she born there?

A.No. She was a Quraishite, and her father was "Wahab s/o Abd Manaf,
s/o Zuhra s/o Kilab". Her genealogy meets that of Abdullah in Kilab;
Abdullah's genealogy is: Abdullah s/o Abdul-Muttalib s/o Hashim s/o Abd
Manaf s/o Qusai s/o Kilab.

But the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) was related to the clan of Bani Najjar of
Madina, because his great-grandmother was from that tribe and
city.Hashim had married Salmah d/o Amr of Bani Najjar in Yathrib
(Madina) who was the mother of Abdul-Muttalib.

**Q20: MOON IS CLEFT ASUNDER**

"The hour drew nigh and the moon was rent in twain" (54:1) what does
this verse mean? A. The correct translation is, "and the moon is cleft
(or rent) asunder". It mentions the miracle of the Holy Prophet, when
one night the moon was cleft asunder in the valley of Mecca within sight
of the Holy Prophet, his companions and the unbelievers.

The next Ayat says: "And if they see a sign, they turn away and say
(that it is) a sorcery continued". It clearly shows that unbelievers had
seen that miracle and still refused to accept it, by pretending that it
was a sorcery. Surely there had happened some thing which made the
unbelievers use the word "sorcery".
