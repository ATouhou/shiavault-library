description: |
  This book is an extension and elaboration of four lectures from fall
  1987 in the hall of the Contemporary Arts Museum. The book is aimed to
  provide the main backgrounds of Shi‘ite and Sunni political thought, how
  they were formed, what factors influenced them, how they have reacted
  and finally making this book possible for the two parties to have a
  clearer picture of the other, to know the theological and
  jurisprudential limitations and obligations, the historical experiences
  and doctrinal structure of the other and their mutual expectations in
  coordination with these principles, foundations and capacities.
