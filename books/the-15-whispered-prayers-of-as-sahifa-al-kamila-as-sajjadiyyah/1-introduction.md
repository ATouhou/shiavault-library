Introduction
============

The supplication (*dua*) is one of the best worship through which one
may attain self-perfection and God's Nearness. Because, of this reason
God-Almighty has invited his servants to offer supplications.
God-Almighty says in Holy Quran:

***Call on your Lord humbly and secretly; surely He does not love those
who exceed the limits. (7:55)***

The Whispered prayers, is a collection of 15 Intimate conversations with
GOD extracted from the book Sahifa Sajjadiya*, k*nown famously as the
Psalms of Islam.

This book is a compilation of heart-rending supplications to God from
his humble servant, Imam Ali ibn Hussain Zainul Abideen (peace be upon
him).

If we truly utilized this hidden treasure, we could not enumerate the
wonders it would bestow upon us.

Munajaat means "talking" or "having a conversation". In this case, it is
the intimate conversations of our Imam with his Lord. Conversing with
God regularly is true spirituality, and these conversations between Imam
Sajjad (as) and God will really open our eyes. Again, there are
conversations for different spiritual states, such as being fearful,
hopeful and thankful. Conversing with Allah according to our current
spiritual state will only serve to enhance our relationship with him.
