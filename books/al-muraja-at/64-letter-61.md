Requesting Texts Narrated by Shi’a Sources
------------------------------------------

**Safar 1, 1330**

As long as the honour and dignity of the good ancestors are protected,
then there is nothing wrong with considering all the ahadith regarding
the Imam (as), the ones to which you have referred, including hadith
al­Ghadir or any other one, without the need for an interpretation.

You may also know other ahadith relevant to this subject with which the
Sunnis are not familiar; so, may I request you to narrate them so that
we may acquaint ourselves therewith? Wasslam.

Sincerely,

*S*
