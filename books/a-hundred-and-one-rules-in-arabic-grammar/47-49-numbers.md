49. Numbers
===========

Numbers that proceed nouns should take the opposite gender

of those nouns. Furthermore, they should carry the marker that is
determined by their grammatical function in the sentence. The noun
itself has to be in the genitive case because this combination will
create an Idaafa.

a. I met five students (f). **قابلتُ خَمسَ طالباتٍ.  **

b. Five students (m) came.**خَمسَةُ طلابٍ.**   **حضَرَ**
