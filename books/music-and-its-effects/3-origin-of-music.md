Origin of Music
===============

No doubt music is one of the most ancient methods of merrymaking and
enjoyment, of expressing feelings and emotions. It is called
‘international language’, because it encompasses the whole world and
does not know any geographical or political boundary.

Let us find out what is the reason for its worldwide prevalence. We have
it on the authority of Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq (a.s) that when Hadhrat Adam
(a.s) died, his infamous son Cain (Qabil) and Satan were very happy.
Both gathered at a place and invented some musical instruments to
celebrate the death of Hadhrat Adam (a.s). And in the words of Imam
(a.s), all such musical things which people now use for merrymaking have
originated from that[^1].

So, religion and anthropology both agree that music is a very ancient
thing and therefore its no wonder that it has spread widely with the
spread of the human race. But how dare a sensible ‘child of Adam’
especially if he is a Muslim "enjoy" music, which is an invention of
Satan and Cain, the rebellious and disloyal son of Adam ?

Here one may ask: But what is the harm in music? Why has it been
forbidden in Islam?

The answer is that music does have harmful effects on nervous system and
is the cause of many ailments including ulcer, diabetes and madness. It
creates imbalance in human faculties, retards spiritual development, and
lowers the ethical values.
