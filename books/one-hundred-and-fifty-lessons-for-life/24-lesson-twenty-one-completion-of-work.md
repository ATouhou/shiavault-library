Lesson Twenty One: Completion of work
=====================================

The Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إسْتِتْمامُ الْمَعْرُوفِ خَيْرٌ مِنْ إِبْتِدائهِ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Completion and continuation of a good deed is better and more important
than beginning it.

Brief Description
-----------------

We often see useful projects and actions in the milieu of our social
life which are left uncompleted. Their doers have started them under the
influence of a sudden motive, but they have lost their enthusiasm very
soon and have left them uncompleted. Islam admires faithful and diligent
individuals who accomplish the useful work which they commence.[^1]
