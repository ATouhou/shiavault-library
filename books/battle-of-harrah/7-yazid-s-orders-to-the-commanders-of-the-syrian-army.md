Yazīd's Orders to the Commanders of the Syrian Army
===================================================

Since Muslim b. 'Uqba was sick at the time of departure to Medina and
was unable to mount the horse, he was placed on a couch and carried on
slaves' shoulders.[^1] Yazīd recommended him to name Husayn b. Numayr
Sakūnī as his deputy in case any problem would arise for him.[^2] As for
the people of Medina, he advised him as follows:

“Invite the people of Medina three times. If they accept, it is better;
but if they do not, in case you triumph over them, massacre them for
three days. Whatever there might be in that city - including properties,
human beings, animals, and weapons - would be lawful for the troops. Do
not prevent the people of Syria from doing what they want to do with
their enemy. When the three days' period is over, cease the massacre and
plunder and ask people to swear allegiance to be Yazīd's slaves! When
you are done with Medina, move towards Mecca.”[^3]
