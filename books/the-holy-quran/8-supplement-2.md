Supplement 2
============

From the discussions, written according to the above- mentioned method,
the following subjects have become crystal-clear:

1. The matters concerning the names of Allah, and His attributes, like
His Life, Knowledge, Power, Hearing, Sight and Oneness etc. As for the
Person of Allah, you will find that the Qur'an believes that He needs no
description.

2. The matters concerning the divine actions, like creation, order,
will, wish, guidance, leading astray, decree, measure, compulsion,
delegation (of Power), pleasure, displeasure and other similar
actions.

3. The matters concerned with the intermediary links between Allah and
man, like the Curtain, the Tablet, the Pen, the Throne, the Chair, the
Inhabited House, the Heavens, the Earth, the Angels, the Satans, and the
Jinns etc.

4. The details about man before he came to this world.

5. The matters related to man in this life, like the history of
mankind, knowledge of his self, the foundation of society, the
prophethood and the apostleship, the revelation, the inspiration, the
book and the religion and law. The high status of the prophets, shining
through their stories, come under this heading .

6. The knowledge about man after he departs from this world, that is,
al-Barzakh.

7. The matters about human character. Under this heading come the
various stages through which the friends of Allah pass in their
spiritual journey, like submission, faith, benevolence, humility, purity
of intention and other virtues. (We have not gone into details of the
verses of the law, as more appropriately it is a subject for the books
of jurisprudence.) As a direct result of this method, we have never felt
any need to interpret a verse against its apparent meaning. As we have
said earlier, this type of interpretation is in fact
misinterpretation.

As for that "interpretation" which the Qur'an has mentioned in various
verses, it is not a type of "meaning"; it is something else. At the end
of the commentaries, we have written some traditions of the Prophet and
the Imams of Ahlul-Bayt ( a.s.), narrated by the Sunni and Shiah
narrators. But we have not included the opinions of the companions and
their disciples, because, first, there is too much confusion and
contradiction in them; and second, they are not vested with any
authority in Islam.

On going through those traditions of the Prophet and the Imams (peace
be on them all!), you will notice that this "new" method of exegesis
(adopted in this book) is in reality the oldest and the original method
which was used by the Teachers of the Qur'an (peace of Allah be on them
all!).

Also, we have written separately various topics - philosophical,
academic, historical, social and ethical- when there was a need for it.
In all such discussions, we have confined our talk to the basic
premises, without going in too much detail. We pray to Allah, High is
He, to guide us and keep our talk to the point; He is the Best Helper
and the Best Guide.
