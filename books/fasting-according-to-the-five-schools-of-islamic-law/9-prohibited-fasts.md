Prohibited Fasts
================

All the schools except the Hanafi concur that fasting on the days of
\`Id al-Fitr and \`Id al-Adha is prohibited*(haram)* :

• The Hanafis observe: Fasting on these two \`Ids is makruh to the
extent of being haram.

• The Imamis say: Fasting on the days of Tashriq is prohibited only for
those who are at Mina. The days of Tashriq are the eleventh, twelfth and
thirteenth of Dhu al-Hijjah.

• The Shafi\`is are of the opinion that fasting is not valid on the days
of Tashriq both for those performing Hajj as well as others.

• According to the Hanbalis, it is haram to fast on these days for those
not performing Hajj, not for those performing it.

• The Hanafis observe: Fasting on these days is makruh to the extent of
being haram.

• The Malikis state: It is haram to fast on the eleventh and the twelfth
of Dhu al-Hijjah for those not performing Hajj, not for those performing
it.

All the schools excepting the Hanafi concur that it is not valid for a
woman to observe a supererogatory fast without her husband's consent if
her fast interferes with the fulfillment of any of his rights. The
Hanafis observe: A woman's fasting without the permission of her husband
is makruh, not haram.
