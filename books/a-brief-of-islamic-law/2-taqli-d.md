**Istipà:**

35. Istipà, is a recommended act for men after urinating. Its object is
to ensure that no more urine is left in the urethra.

There are certain ways of performing Istipà, the best of which is that
after the passing of urine, if the anus also has become Najis it is made
Tahir first. Thereafter, from the anus up to the root of penis should be
pressed thrice, with the middle finger of the left hand. Then the thumb
is placed on the penis, and the forefinger below it pressing three times
up to the point of circumcision, then the front part of the penis should
be pressed three times.

36. The moisture which is discharged from penis during wooing and
courtship, is called Madh. It is Tahir, and so is the liquid which is
seen after ejeculation, which is called Wadh. Similarly, the liquid
which at times comes out after urination, is called wadh and it is Tahir
if urine has not reached it. If a person performs Istipà’ after
urinating, and then discharges some liquid doubting whether it is urine
or one of the above mentioned three liquids, that liquid is Tahir.

37. When enough time has lapsed since urinating, and one becomes sure
that no urine is left in urethra, and then he sees some liquid, doubting
whether it is Tahir or not, he will consider it as Tahir, even if he had
not done Istipà’. If he has Wudu, it will be valid.

38. Istipà’ is not meant for women, and if she sees any liquid and she
doubts whether it is urine, that liquid is Tahir, and it will not
invalidate Ghosl and Ghusl.

**Impure Things (Najàsàt)**

39. The following ten things are essentially Najis:

· Urine
· Faeces
· Semen
· Dead body
· Blood
· Dog
· Pig
· Kàfir
· Wine

· The sweat of an animal who persistently eats Najàsah.

**Urine and Faeces**

40. Urine and faeces of the following living beings are Najis:

· Human beings
· Animals whose meat is Halal (allowed) to eat, and whose blood gushes
out forcefully when its large vein (jugular) is slit.

The excretion of those animals who are Halal (allowed) to eat, but
their blood does not gush forth forcefully when killed, like Halal
(allowed) fish, is Tahir. Similarly, droppings of such small animals as
mosquito and flies whose meat is scarce are Tahir. Of course, the uring
of an animal whose meat is Halal (allowed) and its blood does not gush
forth when killed, should be avoided as per obligatory precaution.

41. The urine and droppings of those birds which are Halal (allowed) to
eat, is Tahir, but it is better to avoid them.

**Semen**

42. The semen of human beings, and of every animal whose blood gushes
when its large vein (jugular) is cut and its meat is Halal (allowed),
and as per obligatory precaution even those whose meat isHalal
(allowed), is Najis.

**Dead Body**

43. The dead body of a human being is Najis. Similarly the de ad body
of any animal whose blood gushes forth with force is Najis, irrespective
of whether it dies a natural death or is killed in a manner other than
that prescribed by Islam. As the blood of a fish does not gush forth,
its dead body is Tahir, even if it dies in water.

44. Those parts of a dead body which do not contain life, like wool,
hair, teeth, nails, bones and horns are Tahir.

45. If flesh, orany otherpart whieh contains life, is cut off from the
body of aliving human being, oralivinganimal whose blood gushes forth,
it will be Najis.

46. Small pieces of skin which peel off easily from the lips, or other
parts of the body, are Tahir, providing they do not contain life.

47. The liquid medicines, perfumes, ghee, soap and wax polish which are
imported, are Tahir, if one is not sure of their being Najis.

48. Fat, meat or hide or an animal, about which there is a probability
that it may have been slaughtered according to the Islamic law, are
Tahir. However, if these things are obtained from a non-Muslim, or from
a Muslim who himself obtained them from a non-Muslim, without
investigating whether the animal was slaughtered according to Islamic
law, it is Halal (allowed) to eat that meat and fat, but prayer in that
hide will be permissible. But, if these things are obtained from Muslim
market, or a Muslim, and it is not known that he got them from a
non-Muslim, or if it is konwn that he got from a non-Muslim but there is
a great probability that he has investigated about it being slaughtered
according to Shariah, then eating such meat and fat is permissible,
provided that the Muslim has done an act on it, which is done only when
the meat isHalal (allowed), like when he is selling it for eating.

**Blood**

49. The blood of a human being, and of every animal whose blood gushes
forth when its large (jugular) vein is cut, is Najis. The blood of an
animal like a fish, or an insect like mosquito, is Tahir because it does
not gush forth.

50. If an animal whose meat is lawful to eat, is slaughtered in
accordance with the method prescribed by Shari\`ah, and enough blood
flows out, the blood which is still left in its body is Tahir. However,
the blood which goes back into the body of the animal due to peath, or
because of its head having been at a higher level at the time of its
slaughtering, is Najis.
51. As a recommended precaution, one should refrain from eating an egg
which has even the smallest amount of blood in it. However, if the blood
is in the yolk (yellow portion), the albumen (white portion) will be
Tahir, as long as the skin over the yolk is not torn.

52. If the blood which comes from the gums of the teeth, vanish as it
gets mixed with the saliva, the saliva is Tahir.

53. If the blood which dries under the nail or skin, on account of
being hurt, can no longer be called blood, it is Tahir. But if it is
called blood and is presented on the surface, it will be Najis. Thus if
a hole appears in the nail or the skin, and it is difficult to remove
the blood and to make it Tahir for the purpose of Ghosl or Ghusl, one
should perform Tayammum (ablution with soil).

54. If a person cannot discern whether it is dried blood under the
skin, or that the flesh has turned that way because of being hit, it is
Tahir.

55. When a wound is healing, and pus forms around it, that substance is
Tahir if it is not known to have been mixed with blood.

**Dogs and Pigs**

56. Dogs and pigs are Najis, and even their hair, bones, paws and
nails, and every liquid substance of their body, is Najis.

**Kàfir**

57. A person w ho does not believe in Allah or his oneness, is Najis.
Similarly, ghulat who believe in any of the holy twelve Imàms as God, or
that they are incarnations of God, and khawarij and nawasib who express
enmity towards the holy Imàms, are also Najis. And similar is the case
of those who deny Prophet hood, or any of the necessary laws of Islam,
like prayer and fasting, if they result in denying the holy prophet (s).
As regards the people of the Scripture (i.e.the Jews, the Christians and
the Magian), they are considered Tahir

**Wine**

58. Wine is Najis and everything else which in toxicates a person is
not Najis.

59. All kinds of industrial alcohol used for painting doors, windows,
tables, chairs etc are Tahir.
60. If grape juice ferments by itself, or on being cooked, it is Tahir,
but it is Halal (allowed) (unlawful) to drink it. Also, as an obligatorw
precaution, boiled grope is Halal (allowed) to eat, but is not Najis.

61. If dates, currants, raisins, or their juice ferment, they are Tahir
and it isHalal (allowed) (lawful) to eat them.

62. Beer,which lightly intoxicates, and is called Fuqa, is Halal
(allowed), and as an obligatory precaution, is Najis. But barlew juice,
which does not intoxicate at all, is Tahir andHalal (allowed).

**Sweat of an Animal Who Persistently Eats Najasah**

63. The perspiration of a camel which eats human Najasah is Najis and
as an obligatory precaution, the perspiration of every animal which is
habituated to eat human Najasah, is Najis.

64. The perspiration of a person who enters the state of Janàbah (major
ritual impurity) by an unlawful act is Tahir, and praying with it is in
order.

**Ways of Proving Najasah**

65. There are three ways of proving the Najasah of anything:

· One is certain, or satisfied that something is Najis.

· If a reliable person who possesses, contro lsor ma nages a thing,
says that it is Najis and he or she is not accused of lying.

· If two just men testify that a certain thing is Najis, provided that
their testimony deals with the reason for Najaasah, for example they say
the thing has met a blood or urine.

If one just man testifies this, the obligatory precaution is to avoid
it.

**How a Tahir thing Becomes Najis**

66. If a Tahir thing touches a najis thing and either or both of them
are so wet that the wetness of one reaches the other, the Tahir thing
will become Najis. But it will not become Najis with numerous
consecutive transmission. For example, if the right hand of a person
becomes Najis with urine, and then,while still wet, it touches his left
hand, the left hand will also become Najis. Now, if the left hand after
having dried up, touches a wet clloth, that cloth will also become
Najis, but, if that cloth touches another wet thing, it cannot be said
to be Najis. In any case, if the wetness is so little, that it does not
affect the other thing, then the Tahir thing will not become Najis, even
if it had contacted a Najis-ul-Ayn.

67. When a syrup or oil is in a fluid state, in a manner that if some
quantity of it is removed, it does not leave an empty trace, the entire
quantity will become Najis immediately when even their slightest part
becomes Najis. But if it has solidified, so that when some part of it is
removed, a trace of emptiness is seen, only that part which has come in
contact with Najasah will be Najis, even if the empty trace gets filled
up later. So, if the droppings of a rat fall on it, only that part on
which the droppings have fallen will become Najis, and the rest will
remain Tahir.

**Rules Regarding Najàsàt**

68. To make the script and pages of holy Quran Najis, and violate its
sanctity, is undoubtedly Halal (allowed), and if it becomes Najis, it
should be made Tahir immediately with water. In fact, as an obligatory
precaution, it is Halal (allowed) to make it najis even if no violation
of sanctity is intended, and it is obligatory to make it Tahir by
rinsing it.

69. It is Halal (allowed) to eat or drink or make others eat or drink
something which has become Najis. However, one may give such a thing to
a child, or an insane person. And if a child or an insane person eats or
drinks Najis thing on his own accord, or makes food Najis with his Najis
hands before consuming it, it is not necessary to stop him from doing
so.

70. If a person sees someone eat drink something Najis, or pray with a
Najis dress, it is not necessary to admonish him.

**Mutahhirat (Purifying Agents)**

71. There are twelve things which make Najis objects Tahir:

(i) Water
(ii) Earth
(iii) The Sun
(iv) Trancformation (Istihalah)
(v) Change (Inqilab)
(vi) Transfer (Intiqal)
(vii) Islam
(viii) Subjection (Tabaiyyah)
(ix) Removal of original Najasah
(x) Confining (Istipà) of animal which feeds on Najasah
(xi) Disappearance of a Muslim
(xii) Draining of the usual quantity of blood from the slaughtered body
of an animal.

**I.Water**

72. The interior of a Najis vessel, or utensil, even if it has been
made Najis with wine, must be washed three times if less than Kurr water
is used, and as per obligatory percaution,the same will apply if Kurr or
running water is used. If a dog drinks water or any other liquid from a
utensil, the utensil should be first scrubbed with Tahir earth,and after
washing off the dust, it should be washed twice with running, Kurr or
under Kurr water. similarly, if the dog licks a utensil, it should be
scrubbed with dust before washing. And if the saliva of a dog falls into
the utensil, or somewhere of its body meets the utensil, as per
obligatory precaution, it should be scrubbed with dust and then washed
with water three times.

73. If a utensil is licked by a pig, or if it drinks any liquid from
it, or in which a rat has died, it should be washed seven times with
running water, or Kurr or lesser water. It will not be necessary to
scour it with dust.

156. A Najis utensil can be made Tahir with under\_Kurr water in two
ways:

(i) The utensil is filled up with water and emptied three times.

(ii) some quantity of water and poured in it, and then the utensil is
shaken, so that the water reaches all Najis parts. This should be done
three times and then the water is spilled.

74. If a Najis thing is immersed once in Kurr or running water, is such
a way that water reacher all its Najis parts, it becomes Tahir. And in
the case of a carpet or dress, it is not necessary to squeeze or wring
or press it. And when body or dress is Najis because of urine, it must
be washed twice even in Kurr water.

75. When a thing which has become Najis with urine, is to be made Tahir
with under\_Kurr water, it should be poured once, and as water flows off
eliminating all the traces of urine,the thing will become Tahir. But if
dress or body has become Najis because of urine, it must be washed twice
to be made Tahir. when a cloth or a carpet and similar things are made
Tahir with water which is less than Kurr, it must be wrung, or squeezed,
till the water remaining in it runs out.

76. If anything becomes Najis with the urine of a suckling child, who
has not yet started taking solid food, the thing will be Tahir if water
is poured over it once, reaching all parts which had been Najis.

163. If anything becomes Najis with Najasah other than urine, it
becomes Tahir by first removing the Najasah and then pouring under-Kurr
water once allowing it to flow off. But, if it is a dress etc, it should
be squeezed so that the remaining water should flow off.

77. If the exterior of soap becomes Najis, it can be made Tahir, but if
its interior becomes Najis, it cannot become Tahir, and if soap or not,
its interior will be considered Tahir.

78. A Najis thing does not become Tahir unless the najis\_ul\_Ayn is
removed from it,but there is not harm if the colour, or smell of the
Najasah remains in it. So, if blood is removed from a cloth, and the
cloth is rinsed with water, it will become Tahir even if the colour of
blood remains on it.

79. Meat or fat which becomes Najis, can be made Tahir with water like
all other things. same is the case if the body or dress or utensil has a
little grease on it, which does not revent water from reaching it.

80. Tap water which is connected with Kurr water is considered to be
Kurr.

81. If a person washed a thing with water, and becomes sure that it has
become Tahir, but doubts later whether or not he had removed the
Najis\_ul\_Ayn from it, he should wash it again, and ensure that the
Najis\_ul\_Ayn has been removed.

82. If a ground which absorbs water (e.g. land on the surface of which
there is fine sand) becomes Najis, it can be made Tahir even with under
Kurr water.

83. If the floor which is made of stones, or picks or other hard
ground, in which water is not absorbed, becomes Najis, it can be made
Tahir with under Kurr water, but, it is necessary that so much water is
poured on it that it begins to flow. And if that Water is not drained
out, and it collects there, it should be drawn out by a vessel or soaked
by a cloth.

**II.Earth**

84. The earth makes the sole of one’s feet and shoes Tahir, provided
that the following four conditions are fulfilled:

(i) The earth should be Tahir.
(ii) The earth should be dry, as a precaution.
(iii) As an obligatory precaution, the Najasah should have stuck from
the earth.

(iv) If najis-ul- Any, like blood or urine, or something which has
become Najis, like najis clay, is stuck on the sole of a foot, or a
shoe, it will be Tahir only if it is cleared by walking on earth, or by
rubbing the foot or the shoe against it. therefore, if the Najis-ul-Any
vanishes by itself, and not by walking or rubbing on the ground, the
foot or the sole will not be Tahir by earth, as an obligatory
precaution. And the earth should be dust or sand, or consisting of
stones or laid with picks ; which means walking on carpet, mats, green
grass will not make the sole of feet or shoes Tahir.

85. It is a matter of Ishkal that walking over a tarred road. or a
wooden floor will make the Najis sole of feet and shoes Tahir. ( In
other words, as an obligatory precaution, tarred road or wooden floor
does not make Najis sole of feet or shoes Tahir.)

86. When the Najis sole of one's foot or shoe becomes Tahir by walking
on earth, the parts adjacent to it, which are usually blotched with mud,
become Tahir.

87. If a person moves on his hands and knees, and his hands or knees
become Najis, it is a matter of Ishkal (it is improbable) that they
become Tahir by such movement. Similarly, the end of a stick, the bottom
of a prosthetic leg, the shoe of quadruped and the wheels of a car or a
cart etc. would not become Tahir.

**III.The Sun**

88. The sun makes the earth, building,and the walls Tahir, provided the
following five conditions are fulfilled:

(i) The Najis thing should be sufficiently wet, and if it is dry, it
should be made wet so that the sun dries it up.

(ii) Any Najis-ul-Ayn should not be remained on it.

(iii) Nothing should intervene between the Najis thing and the sun.
Therefore, if the rays fall on the Najis thing from behind a curtain, or
a cloud etc, and makes it dry, the thing will not become Tahir. But,
there is no harm if the cloud is so thin that it does not serve as an
impediment between the Najis thing and the sun.

(iv) Only the sun should make the Najis thing dry. So, if a Najis thing
is jointly dried by the wind and the sun, it will not become Tahir.
However, it would not matter if the wind blows so lightly that it can be
said that the thing has dried by the sun.
(v) The sun should dry up the whole Najis part of the building all at
once. if the sun dries the surface of the Najis earth, or building,
first, and later on dries the inner part, only the surface will become
Tahir, and the inner portion will remain Najis.

89. If the sun shines on Najis earth, and one doubts later whether the
earth was wet or not at that time, or whether the wetness dried up
because of the sunshine or not, the earth will remain najis. Similarly,
if one toubts whether Najis-ul- Ayn had been removed from the earth, or
whether there was any impediment preventing direct sunshine, the earth
will remain Najis.

**IV. Transformation (Istia\*àlah)**

90. If a Najis thing undergoes such a change, that it assumes the
category of a Tahir thing it becomes Tahir ; for example, if a Najis
wood burns and is reduced to ashes,or a dog falls in a salt-marsh and
transforms into salt, it becomes Tahir. But a thing does not become
Tahir if its essence or category does not change ; like, if wheat is
ground into flour, or is used for baking pead, it does not become
Tahir
