In the Desert
=============

Whoever goes to the desert at night will see the sky full of stars. His
heart will be afraid of Allah.

Imam Ali [a] went to the desert at night to say his prayers. He took a
friend of his to that desert to teach him a lesson about Islam.

Sometimes, Imam Ali [a] took Maytham to the desert. He told him about
future matters. The Imam had learnt future matters from our Master
Muhammad [s].

Maytham listened to Imam Ali's words. The Imam said his prayers. Maytham
said them behind him. He listened with awe to the Imam's prayers.
