The Letter Dhaal (Dh)
=====================

1. Dhabba (Warding Off) The Enemies From The Believers During The Occultation And Reappearance Of His Eminence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As for the period of occultation of His Eminence, it is achieved through
the prayers of His Eminence. And as for the period when the Holy Imam
(as) is present, we have already discussed it under the topic of the
*Jihad* and battles of His Eminence, against the enemies. And also by
the elimination and destruction of the infidels through his sword and
the disgrace of the enemies at his hands will be brought about if Allah
wills.

2. Disgrace Of The Enemies At The Hands Of His Eminence After The Reappearance
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In *Kafi* it is narrated from His Eminence, Abu Ja’far Baqir (as) that
he said:

“When the Qaim will arise he will present faith to every *Nasibi* (one
who hates the Ahle Bayt). Thus if he accepts it with all sincerity, no
problem; but if not, he would strike off his neck. Or he would have to
pay the *Jizyah* just as these days the *Dhimmis* pay *Jizyah*. And they
will tie the wallet to the waist and chase them from the cities to big
cities.”[^1]

I say: What we have mentioned under the Letter “A” supports this matter.

In *Kafi* it is narrated from His Eminence, Abu Ja’far Baqir (as) that
he said:

“There is a kingdom for the truth and a kingdom for falsehood and each
of them are humiliated and disgraced during the rule of other.”[^2]

In *Biharul Anwar* it is narrated from His Eminence, Abu Ja’far Baqir
(as) that he said regarding the verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
خَاشِعَةً أَبْصَارُهُمْ تَرْهَقُهُمْ ذِلَّةٌ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ الْيَوْمُ
الَّذِي كَانُوا يُوعَدُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“Their eyes cast down; disgrace shall overtake them; that is the day
which they were threatened with.” (Qur’an, Surah Maarij 70:44)***

“That is: the day of the advent of the Qaim.”[^3]

In *Tafseer* of Ali Ibne Ibrahim Qummi it is reported from His Eminence,
Abi Abdullah Sadiq (as) that he said regarding the verse:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَنْ ذِكْرِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنْكًا
وَنَحْشُرُهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَعْمَىٰ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And whoever turns away from My reminder, his shall be a straitened
life.” (Qur’an, Surah Taha 20:124)***

“This condition, by Allah is for the *Nasibis* (enemies of Ahle Bayt).”
Muawiyah bin Ammar said: May I be sacrificed on you, I have witnessed
them leading a long life of prosperity and comfort till their death. His
Eminence said:

“By Allah, there is a terrible condition for them during the *Raja’t*
(return to life during the time of reappearance of Imam Mahdi) such that
they will eat waste matter.”[^4]
