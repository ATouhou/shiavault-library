Lesson Fifty One: Signs of an Oppressor
=======================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لِلظّالِمِ ثلاثُ عَلامات: يَظْلِمُ مَنَ فَوْقَهُ بِالْمَعْصِيَةِ وَ
مَنْ دُوْنَهُ بِالْغَلَبَةِ، وَ يُظاهِرُ الْقَوْمَ الظَّلَمَةِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The oppressor has three signs: oppresses those who are higher than him
through opposition and disobedience, and oppresses those who are
inferior to him through violence and predominance, and cooperates with
other oppressors.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

When the ugly urge to oppress becomes ingrained and dominates one’s
mind, it shows up in different ways depending on the situation. If he
cannot oppress overtly a strong opponent, the oppression takes subtle
forms like disobedience and dereliction of duties. Against the weak, the
oppressor resorts to open aggression, force, violence and injustice .
Another sign of an oppressor is that he selects his friends and
companions from among the unjust.
