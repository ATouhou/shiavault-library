*(I ask You) by Your Power, which towers over all things.*

In the preceding pages, you read about some limited instances of the
great world. Allah’s inevitable Rule is over the world and its
inhabitants. He dominates all things, and all creatures are doomed to
His Powerful Reign.

Anyone who has a rightful and deserving regime in this world, it is but
as a gift from Allah. Once He wills, He can take the power from one
servant and grant it to another.

The rulers should consider their power as a ray of Allah’s Dominance and
Rule and should not rule unfairly and unlawfully, for if they do so,
they will be oppressors. As it is stated in Qur’anic verses and is
proved throughout history, Allah’s revenge, which controls all things,
would seize them. They cannot resist Allah’s Will, and will remain in
doomed chastisement humbly and contemptibly.

It is Allah’s Rule that ordered the water descending from the sky and
springing from the earth to become into storm and eliminate the
disbelievers in Noah’s age. It was His Rule that sent the winds to
eradicate the powerful ‘Ad tribe, just as dry grass is removed from the
earth, and brought their life to an end in just a moment. It was His
Rule that ordered the River Nile to send a wave and obliterate the
oppressive Pharaoh and his people.
