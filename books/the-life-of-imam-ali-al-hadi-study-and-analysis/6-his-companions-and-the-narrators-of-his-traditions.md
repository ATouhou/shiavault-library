His Companions and the Narrators of his Traditions
==================================================

The vast culture and knowledge of Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) in all sciences
such as tafsir (commentary of the Qur’an), jurisprudence, Islamic arts,
ethics, and other fields made him the end that scholars and seekers of
knowledge set off towards.

The companions of Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) represented the true mission of
Islam. They saved the mission of Islam from lose. They associated with
the infallible Imams of the Ahlul Bayt (a.s.) who were the flowing
spring of the essence of Islam. They narrated and recorded their (the
Imams’) traditions in their four hundred records (usuls) that were
collected later on in the four books to which the Shi’a jurisprudents
referred and are still referring to in deriving legal verdicts.

These companions had done the Islamic world a great favor by writing
down the knowledge and literature of the infallible Imams (a.s.);
otherwise, that great heritage would be lost and consequently the human
culture and intellect would lose much.

The thing that makes one pride on the jihad of those narrators is that
they associated with the infallible Imams (a.s.) and recorded their
traditions in a time that was most critical and full of offense and
oppression.

The Umayyad and Abbasid governments went too far in oppressing the
Alawids and their followers and in preventing the public from
associating with them (the Alawids). Those governments, with no mercy or
leniency, chased everyone who tried to spread or talk about the virtues
of the Alawids or narrate their traditions and arrested him to be killed
or to remain in the darkness of prisons forever.

Therefore, narrators refrained from mentioning the names of the
infallible Imams from whom they narrated traditions. They referred to
them by surnames one time and by titles other time. They did not declare
their real names.

Anyhow, we mention here the companions of Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) and the
narrators of his traditions with brief accounts on them because this, as
we think, shall complete the study on the Imam that it discovers some
important sides of his personality.

said that he was reliable.[^1]

-------------------------------

Al-Barqi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions.[^2]

3. Ibrahim bin Idris

-------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions.[^5]
Al-Barqi said he was from Imam al-Hadi and Imam al-Jawad’s
companions.[^6] Al-Kashshi mentioned him as one of the narrators who
narrated from Imam Abul Hasan (a.s.).[^7]

5. Ibrahim bin Shayba
---------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions.[^8]
Once, he wrote a letter to Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) complaining to him
against the deviants from religion who distorted the Islamic intellect.
We shall discuss this matter when we talk about the age of the Imam
later on.

6. Ibrahim bin Abdah an-Naysaburi
---------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi and Imam al-Askari’s
companions.[^9] Al-Kashshi said that Imam al-Hasan al-Askari (a.s.) sent
a letter to Isaaq bin Isma’il in which he greeted Ibrahim bin Abdah and
appointed him as his agent to receive the legal dues.[^10]

Once, Imam al-Askari (a.s.) deputed him to Abdullah bin Hamdwayh
al-Bayhaqi and sent a letter with him saying in it, “I have sent Ibrahim
bin Abdah so that the (other) districts and the people of your district
pay my dues on you to him and made him my trust and agent before my
followers there.

Let them fear Allah and pay the dues and they have no excuse in not
doing that or delaying it. May Allah not distress them for disobeying
His guardians and may He have mercy on them and on you through my
mercifulness to them, and Allah is Ample-giving, generous.”[^11]

7. Ibrahim bin Uqbah
--------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions,[^12]
and so did al-Barqi.[^13] He narrated traditions from Imam Abu Ja’far
al-Jawad (a.s.) and Imam Abul Hasan al-Hadi (a.s.). Sahl bin Ziyad and
other narrators narrated from him.[^14]

8. Ibrahim bin Muhammad bin Faris an-Naysaburi
----------------------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi and Imam al-Hasan
al-Askari’s companions.[^15]

9. Ibrahim bin Muhammad al-Hamadani
-----------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam ar-Ridha, Imam al-Jawad, and
Imam al-Hadi’s companions. Al-Kashshi said he was the agent of Imam
al-Hadi (a.s.). He performed the hajj forty times.[^16] He was the agent
of Imam al-Jawad (a.s.) who wrote to him, “Your account has been
received.

May Allah accept from you and be pleased with them and make them with us
in this life and in the afterlife. So-and-so dinars and so-and-so
clothes were sent to you. May Allah bless them for you and bless every
gift He has given to you.

I have written to an-Nadhr ordering him to refrain from troubling and
objecting to you and informing him of your position to me. And I have
written to Ayyub ordering him of the same too. I have written a book to
my followers in Hamadan ordering them to obey you and follow your orders
and that I have no agent (there) except you.” [^17]

This letter shows that Ibrahim bin Muhammad was so trusted and of a high
position near the Imam (a.s.).

10. Ibrahim bin Mahziyar
------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Jawad and Imam al-Hadi’s
companions.[^18] An-Najashi said he had written a book called
al-Bisharat.[^19] Al-Kashshi mentioned a tradition narrated by Muhammad
bin Ibrahim bin Mahziyar that he said, “When my father (Ibrahim) was
about to die, he gave me some money and gave me a certain sign. No one
knew about this sign except Allah the Almighty.

He said to me, ‘Whoever show you this sign, you have to give him this
money.’ I went to Baghdad and stopped at an inn. On the following day,
someone came and knocked the door. I asked the servant to see who he
was.

The servant said, ‘An old man at the door.’ I said, ‘Let him come in.’
The old man came in, took a seat and said, ‘I am al-Umari. Give me the
money that is with you which is so-and-so.’ He showed me the sign and I
gave him the money.[^20] This tradition shows that Ibrahim was the agent
of the Imam in receiving the legal dues and definitely he was fair and
reliable in order to be the Imam’s agent.

exaggeration.

27. Ayyub bin Noah bin Duraj
----------------------------

He was trustworthy and reliable. An-Najashi said, ‘He was an agent of
Abul Hasan (al-Hadi) and Abu Muhammad (al-Askari) (peace be upon them).
He had a high position near them. He was trustworthy, very pious, and a

“al-Mut’ah-temporary marriage”. It was said that he was excessive at the
end of his life.’[^56]

39. Abu ‘Ali al-Hasan bin Rashid
--------------------------------

He was a reliable man from Baghdad. Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one
of Imam al-Hadi’s companions.[^57] Sheikh al-Mufid said he was one of
the famous jurisprudents and chiefs from whom people took the verdicts
of halal and haram and who were uncriticized and unblameable.[^58] Imam
al-Hadi (a.s.) appointed him as his agent and sent him many letters.
Here are some of them:

1. Al-Kashshi mentioned that Muhammad bin Eesa al-Yaqtini said, “Imam
al-Hadi (a.s.) wrote a letter to ‘Ali bin Bilal in 232AH saying in it,
‘I praise Allah and thank Him for his might and mercy and pray Him to
have blessing and mercy on Muhammad the Prophet and on his progeny. I
have appointed Abu ‘Ali in the position of al-Husayn bin Abd Rabbih and
entrusted him with that for the knowledge he has that no one is
preferred to him. I know you are the chief of your district and so I
wanted to honor you by writing this book on that to you.

You have to obey him and deliver to him all the dues that are with you.
You have to inform my manumitted slaves and recommend them of that, for
this will support and suffice him and save us efforts and please us.
Doing this, you will have the reward of Allah and Allah gives whoever He
likes. He is the Giver, Who rewards with His mercy and you are in the
trust of Allah. I have written this letter with my handwriting and I
praise Allah too much.”[^59]

This letter shows the reliability, trustworthiness, and virtue of
al-Hasan bin Rashid where Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) ordered his followers to
obey, follow, and pay the legal dues to him.

2. Al-Kashshi mentioned that Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Eesa said, ‘I copied
the book that was with ibn Rashid to the mawali who lived in Baghdad,
Mada’in, and the villages around. This is the text of the letter:

‘I praise Allah for the health and soundness I am in, and pray Him to
have blessing, all mercy, and kindness on His Prophet and his progeny. I
have appointed Abu ‘Ali bin Rashid in place of ‘Ali bin al-Husayn bin
Abd Rabbih who was my agent before, and now he (Abu ‘Ali bin Rashid) has
the position of his predecessor. I have entrusted him with what I had
entrusted my previous agents with to receive my rights from you. I have
accepted him to you and preferred him to the others in that, and he is
well-qualified for this job.

May Allah have mercy on you, pay the dues to him and to me and do not
make an excuse on yourselves. Hurry to obey Allah, make your monies
lawful, spare your bloods, help one another in goodness and piety, and
fear Allah that you may find mercy, and hold fast by the covenant of
Allah all together and do not die unless you are Muslims. Obeying him is
as obeying me, and disobeying him is as disobeying me.

Keep to the right path that Allah may reward you and give you more from
His favor, for Allah is Ample-giving, generous, and He is Gracious and
Merciful to His people. May we and you be in the trust and preservation
of Allah. I have written it with my handwriting, and too much praise be
to Allah.’[^60]

3. Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) sent a letter to Ayyub bin Noah saying,  
 “O Ayyub, I order you to stop disputation between you and Abu ‘Ali, and
that each of you should keep to what he has been entrusted with and
ordered to manage the affairs of his district. If you follow all that
which I have ordered you of, you will no longer need to refer to me.

O Abu ‘Ali, I order you of the same as I have ordered Ayyub. Do not
accept anything from anyone from the people of Baghdad and the other
villages. Order anyone coming to you from other than your district to
carry the dues to the very agent of his own district. O Abu ‘Ali, I
order you as I have ordered Ayyub. Let each of you do as I have ordered
him!’[^61]

Definitely, Abu ‘Ali bin Rashid had a respectable position near Imam
al-Hadi (a.s.), and certainly he did not obtained that position except
through his piety and religiousness. When bin Rashid died, Imam al-Hadi
(a.s.) prayed Allah to have mercy on him, to forgive, and be pleased
with him.

40. Al-Hasan bin Dharif
-----------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions.[^62]
An-Najashi said, ‘Al-Hasan bin Dharif bin Nasif was a reliable man from
Kufa. He and his father lived in Baghdad. It is said that he has a book
on rarities. Many narrators narrated from him.’[^63]

41. Al-Hasan bin ‘Ali bin Umar bin ‘Ali bin al-Husayn bin ‘Ali bin Abu Talib
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

He was called an-Nasir lil-Haqq. He was from Imam al-Hadi’s
companions.[^64] The author of Sharh al-Masa’il an-Nasiriyyat says, ‘Abu
Muhammad an-Nasir al-Hasan bin ‘Ali was virtuous for his vast knowledge
and asceticism. His jurisprudence was brighter than the bright sun. It
was he who spread Islam in ad-Daylam and made its people be guided by
him after deviation. His splendid biography is more than to be
accounted, and more obvious than to be hidden.’[^65]

42. Al-Hasan bin ‘Ali al-Washsha’
---------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions.[^66]
An-Najashi said, ‘He was the son of the daughter of Elyas as-Sayrafi
al-Khazzaz. Al-Hasan narrated from his grandfather Elyas that he said
when he was about to die, ‘Witness on me, and this moment is not of
lying, that I heard Abu Abdullah (as-Sadiq) (peace be upon him) saying:
By Allah, Fire will not touch one, who loves Allah and His messenger and
believes in the Imams, after his death.”

Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Eesa said, ‘Once, I went to Kufa seeking Hadith.
I met there al-Hasan bin ‘Ali al-Washsha’ and asked him to show me the
books of al-Ala’ bin Razin al-Qalla and Abban bin Uthman al-Ahmar. He
gave me the two books and I asked him to permit me to copy them. He said
to me, ‘O man, why are you in a hurry? Go and copy them.’ I said, ‘I
fear accidents.’

He said, ‘If I knew that this tradition would be requested so much, I
would write much more. I met in this mosque (the mosque of Kufa) nine
hundred sheikhs that each of them said: Ja’far bin Muhammad (Imam
as-Sadiq) said to me…This man was a notable scholar of the sect (the
Shi’a) and had written some books such as “the Reward of the Hajj”,
“al-Manasik”, and a book of rarities.’[^67]

43. Al-Hasan bin ‘Ali bin Abu Uthman as-Sajjadah
------------------------------------------------

He was excessive. Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s
companions.[^68] From his excessiveness was that Nasr bin as-Sabah said,
‘One day, al-Hasan bin ‘Ali bin Abu Uthman as-Sajjadah said to me, ‘What
do you say about Muhammad bin Abu Zaynab and Muhammad bin Abdullah bin
Abdul Muttalib (the Prophet) (peace be upon him and upon his progeny)?
Which of them is better?’ I said to him, ‘You say!’ He said, ‘Muhammad
bin Abu Zaynab (is better).

Do you not see that Allah the Almighty has blamed Muhammad bin Abdullah
(the Prophet) (peace be upon him and upon his progeny) on some occasions
in the Qur'an, but He has not blamed Muhammad bin Abu Zaynab? Allah has
said to Muhammad bin Abdullah,

***And if We had not made thee wholly firm thou mightest almost have
inclined unto them a little***,[^69]

and

***If thou ascribe a partner to Allah, thy work will fail and thou
indeed wilt be among the losers***, [^70]

and in other verses, and He has not blamed Muhammad bin Abu Zaynab for
anything of that.’ Abu Amr said, ‘On as-Sajjadah be the curse of Allah,
of cursors, of the angels, and of people altogether. He was from the
Aliya’ites who criticized the messenger of Allah (SwT) and who had no
share in Islam.’[^71] This tradition shows the bad beliefs of this man.

44. Al-Hasan bin Muhammad al-Qummi
----------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions.[^72]
Al-Kashshi said, ‘Abu Muhammad al-Fadhl bin Shathan mentioned in one of
his books: “From the famous liars is ibn Baba al-Qummi. Sa’d said that
al-Ubaydi said to him, ‘Once, (Imam) al-Askari wrote to me saying: I am
free before Allah from al-Fihri and al-Hasan bin Muhammad bin Baba
al-Qummi, and you also be free from them. I warn you and all my
followers from them. I curse them.

The curse of Allah be on them. They extort the monies of people in the
name of us. They are mischievous and harmful. May Allah harm them and
plunge them into mischief. Ibn Baba pretends that I have sent him as a
prophet and that he is a “bab”.[^73]

The curse of Allah be on him. Satan has mocked at him and deceived him.
Allah curses whoever accepts that from him. O Muhammad, if you are able
to split his head with a rock, you do. He has harmed me. May Allah harm
him in this life and in the afterl ife.’[^74] Ibn Baba was deviant from
the truth and from religion and he harmed the Imam with the heresies he
originated.

scholars, and author of some books.’[^81]

63. Ar-Rayyan bin as-Salt
-------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam ar-Ridha and Imam al-Hadi’s
companions and said he was reliable.[^99]Al-Kashshi mentioned that
Ma’mar bin Khallad said, ‘Ar-Rayyan bin as-Salt, when al-Fadhl bin Sahl
wanted to send him to one of the districts of KhurHasan, said to me, ‘I
want you to ask permission for me to come in to Abul Hasan (peace be on
him) to greet and farewell him. I like him to give me from his clothes
and some dirhams that have been coined with his name.’

When I went to him (to Imam al-Hadi), he immediately said to me, ‘O
Ma’mar, Where is Rayyan? Does he like to come to us so that I give him
from my clothes and from my dirhams?’ I said, ‘Glory be to Allah! By
Allah, he just asked me to ask you for that.’ He said, ‘O Ma’mar, the
faithful are successful. Ask him to come!’ I asked him to come in and he
did. He greeted Imam al-Hadi (a.s.), who gave him one of his garments.
When he came out, I found thirty dirhams in his hand.’[^100] This
tradition shows that he was faithful and trustworthy.

said he was reliable.[^105] An-Najashi said, ‘He was weak in traditions
and unreliable. Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Eesa accused him of excessiveness
and lying, and he exiled him from Qum where he lived to ar-Riy.

He wrote to Imam Abu Muhammad al-Askari through Muhammad bin Abdul Hamid
al-Attar. He had written a book called at-Tawhid (monotheism) that was
narrated by Abul Hasan al-Abbas bin Ahmad bin al-Fadhl bin Muhammad
al-Hashimy as-Salihi from his father from Abu Sa’eed al-Adami, and he
also had a book on rarities.’[^106]

Ibnul Ghadha’iri said about him, ‘He was very weak in narrations and of
bad beliefs. Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Eesa al-Ash’ari exiled him from Qum,
announced that he was free from him, and forbade people from listening
to him or narrating from him. He narrated mursal[^107] traditions and
depended on unknown narrators.’[^108]

78. Sharif Abdul Adheem al-Hasani
---------------------------------

He was from the Prophet’s progeny. He was knowledgeable, pious, and
religious. Here we talk in brief about him.

### His lineage

His lineage belongs to Imam Abu Muhammad al-Hasan bin ‘Ali bin Abu Talib
(a.s.), the master of the inhabitant of the Paradise and beloved of the
Prophet (S). He was the son of Abdullah bin ‘Ali bin al-Hasan bin Zayd
bin al-Hasan bin ‘Ali bin Abu Talib (a.s.).[^120] Definitely, there was
no lineage in the world higher or more honorable than this lineage with
which Allah had honored the Arabs and the Muslims.

### His reliability and knowledge

He was reliable, fair, very religious, virtuous jurisprudent. Abu Turab
ar-Rouyani said, ‘I heard Abu Hammad ar-Razi saying: Once, I went to
‘Ali bin Muhammad (al-Hadi) (a.s.) in Surra Man Ra’a and asked about
some things of halal and haram and he answered them for me. When I said
goodbye, he said to me, ‘O Hammad, if there is something dubious to you
in the matters of religion in your district, ask Abdul Adheem al-Hasani
about it and give him my regards.’ This tradition show that Abdul Adheem
was of good knowledge and jurisprudence.

### His meeting with Imam al-Hadi

He had the honor of meeting with Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) and showing him his
beliefs. He said to Imam al-Hadi (a.s.), ‘O son of the messenger of
Allah, I want to show you my religion (beliefs). If it pleases you, I
will fix on it.’

Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) smiled at him and said, ‘O Abul Qassim, speak out!’

Abdul Adheem said, ‘I say: there is nothing whatever like Allah the
Almighty. He is free from the two limits; the limit of ta’til (making
Allah a bare unity) and the limit of tashbih (the comparing of Allah to
the creatures). He is neither a mass, nor a shape, nor a show, nor a
substance, but He is the Embodier of masses, the Shaper of shapes, the
Creator of shows and substances, the Lord, the Owner, the Maker, and the
Former of all things.

Muhammad, His slave and messenger, is the last of prophets. There is no
prophet after him until the Day of Resurrection, and his religion is the
last of religions that there is no religion after it until the Day of
Resurrection. And I say: the Imam, caliph, and guardian after him (after
the Prophet) is Amir’ul- Mu’minin ‘Ali bin Abu Talib (a.s.), and then
al-Hasan, and then al-Husayn, and then ‘Ali bin al-Husayn, and then
Muhammad bin ‘Ali, and then Ja’far bin Muhammad, and then Musa bin
Ja’far, and then ‘Ali bin Musa, and then Muhammad bin ‘Ali, and then you
my master.’

Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) turned to him and said, ‘And after me is my son
al-Hasan. What shall people do with the successor (Imam al-Mahdi) after
him?’  
 Abdul Adheem said, ‘How is that my master?’

Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) said, ‘Because he shall not be seen, and it shall be
not permissible to mention him by his name, until he will reappear to
fill the world with justice and fairness after it is filled with
injustice and oppression.’

Abdul Adheem said, ‘I acknowledge that and say: their guardian is the
guardian of Allah, their enemy is the enemy of Allah, obeying them is
the obedience of Allah, and disobeying them is the disobedience of
Allah…and I say: the Prophet’s ascension (to the Heavens) is true, the
questioning in the grave is true, the Paradise is true, the Hell is
true, the Right Way (sirat)[^121] is true, the Scale is true, the Day of
Resurrection will come undoubtedly, and Allah will resurrect all those
in graves.

I say: the obligations after the guardianship (to the Imams of the Ahlul
Bayt) are prayer, fasting, zakat, hajj, jihad, enjoining the right, and
forbidding the wrong.’  
 Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) said, ‘O Abul Qassim, by Allah this is the religion
of Allah which He has determined for His people. Keep to it, may Allah
fix you on the truth in this life and in the afterlife.’[^122]

### His flight to ar-Riy

When the Abbasid government exaggerated in chasing and oppressing the
Alawids, Abdul Adheem fled to ar-Riy to be safe from the evils of the
Abbasids. He lived in the house of a notable man from the Shi’a.
Historians said that there he devoted himself to worship. He fasted in
the day and spent the night worshipping and supplicating his Lord like
his fathers who spent their night worshipping and supplicating.

During his residing in ar-Riy he went in disguise to visit the tomb of
one of Imam Musa bin Ja’far al-Kadhim’s sons [^123] who was, as we
think, Sayyid Ahmad known as Shah Jiragh. The Shi’a, who lived in
ar-Riy, knew about the coming of Abdul Adheem and so they visited him
secretly [^124] for fear of the government.

### His death

Sayyid Abdul Adheem lived in ar-Riy for some time fearfully and his self
was full of sorrow and pain for his cousins who met different kinds of
injustice and oppression from the Abbasids who bore enmity and grudge
against the Ahlul Bayt (a.s.). They (the Abbasids) denied them and
denied all their rights and they poured on them all kinds of misfortunes
and distresses.

Sharif Abdul Adheem became seriously ill and suffered severe pains, the
bitterest of which was his remoteness from his relatives and country.
Death came near to him but his tongue was still mentioning and praising
Allah. He left this life in loneliness where no one from his family was
with him.

With his death a bright page from the pages of the Islamic jihad was
folded and that flame, which lit the way for people towards their honor
and dignity, was put out.

The people of ar-Riy of all classes hastened to escort the honored
corpse of the Alawid master. The funerals were held splendidly and the
sacred body was carried to its last and eternal abode. They built him a
great shrine that was and is still visited by hundreds of visitors every
day.

79. Abu Amr Uthman bin Sa’eed al-Umari as-Samman
------------------------------------------------

He was trustworthy and pious. He served Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) since he was
eleven years old.[^125] He had a high position near the Imam (a.s.).
Ahmad bin Isaaq al-Qummi said, ‘One day, I went to Abul Hasan ‘Ali bin
Muhammad (Imam al-Hadi) (blessings be on him) and said to him: O my
master, some times I am here and some times I am not. I cannot come to
you at every time. Whose sayings do we accept and whose orders do we
follow?’

He said, ‘This is Abu Amr the trustworthy, the faithful. Whatever he
says to you is from me and whatever he informs you of is in behalf of
me.’

When Abul Hasan (a.s.) died, I referred to his son Abu Muhammad al-Hasan
al-Askari (a.s.) and asked him one day as I had asked his father before.
He said to me, ‘This is Abu Amr the trustworthy, the faithful. He is the
trust of the formers and my trust in life and death. Whatever he says to
you is from me and whatever he informs you of is in behalf of me.’[^126]

This tradition shows that he had a high position and was trusted by the
infallible Imams (a.s.) besides that it shows his virtue and knowledge
and that he was an authority of fatwas and religious verdicts.

80. Urwa bin Yahya ad-Dahqan
----------------------------

Al-Barqi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions,[^127] so did
Sheikh at-Tusi but he said that he was cursed and perfidious.[^128]
Al-Kashshi mentioned that Muhammad bin Musa al-Hamadani said that Urwa
bin Yahya al-Baghdadi known as ad-Dahqan, the curse of Allah be on him,
fabricated lies against Abul Hasan ‘Ali bin Muhammad al-Hadi (a.s.) and
Abu Muhammad bin ‘Ali al-Askari (a.s.) after him and took their monies
for himself. He fabricated lies against Abu Muhammad until he cursed him
and ordered his followers to curse and pray Allah against him.[^129]

81. ‘Ali bin Ibrahim al-Hamadani
--------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions.[^130]
He narrated from Abdullah bin Hammad al-Ansari and his son Muhammad
narrated from him.[^131]

82. ‘Ali bin Ibrahim bin Hashim al-Qummi
----------------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him[^132] as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions.
He was one of the prominent personalities of knowledge in his age and he
had written many books.

83. Abul Hasan ‘Ali bin Abu Qurrah
----------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions.[^133]

84. ‘Ali bin Bilal al-Baghdadi
------------------------------

He narrated from Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) and had written a book.[^134]
Al-Kashshi said, ‘I found a book with the handwriting of Jabra’il bin
Ahmad that Muhammad bin Eesa al-Yaqtini said, ‘Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) wrote
to ‘Ali bin Bilal in 232Ah: “In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the
Merciful. I praise Allah and thank Him for his might and mercy and pray
Him to have blessing and mercy on Muhammad the Prophet and on his
progeny. I have appointed Abu ‘Ali in the position of al-Husayn bin Abd
Rabbih and entrusted him with that for the knowledge he has that no one
is preferred to him.

I know you are the chief of your district and so I wanted to honor you
by writing this book on that to you. You have to obey him and deliver to
him all the dues that are with you and you have to inform my manumitted
slaves and recommend them of that for this will support and suffice him
and save us efforts and please us. Doing this, you will have the reward
of Allah and Allah gives whoever He likes. He is the Giver, Who rewards
with His mercy and you are in the trust of Allah. I have written this
letter with my handwriting and I praise Allah too much.”[^135]

Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) wrote this book to ‘Ali bin Bilal for his
reliability and fairness and for his great love to the Ahlul Bayt
(a.s.).

‘Ali bin Bilal narrated from Muhammad bin Isma’il bin Bazee’, and
Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Yahya narrated from him a tradition on the virtue
of the ziyara of the believers and how it is done.[^136]

85. ‘Ali bin Ja’far al-Hamadani
-------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions and
said he was his agent and was reliable.[^137] An-Najashi said, ‘He had
some questions to Abul Hasan al-Askari (a.s.).’[^138] Sheikh at-Tusi
considered him as one of the praised deputies (of Imam al-Mahdi) and
said, ‘He was a good, virtuous man from the agents of Abul Hasan (Imam
al-Hadi) and Abu Muhammad (Imam al-Askari) (peace be on them).[^139]
Ahmad bin ‘Ali ar-Razi narrated that ‘Ali bin Mukhallad al-Ayadi said,
‘Abu Ja’far al-Umari said to me that once Abu Tahir bin Bilal went to
perform the hajj and he saw ‘Ali bin Ja’far spend too much money.

When he went back, he wrote to Abu Muhammad (Imam al-Askari) (a.s.)
about that and Abu Muhammad (a.s.) replied to him: ‘We have ordered to
give him one hundred thousand dinars and then another one hundred
thousand dinars but he refused to take them so that we would keep them
for people…He went to Abul Hasan (a.s.) and he ordered to give him
thirty thousand dinars.’[^140]

He was preferred by Imam al-Hadi (a.s.). Once, there was a dispute
between him and Faris. Ibrahim bin Muhammad wrote to the Imam (a.s.)
telling him about that and asking him to show him which of them he
should follow. Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) replied to him saying, “It should not
be asked about one like this man and he should never be doubted.

The position of ‘Ali bin Ja’far is so great to us. May Allah please us
with him. He is far above to be compared with others. Go to ‘Ali bin
Ja’far to satisfy your needs, and fear Faris and do not let him
interfere in your affairs. Let you and those who follow you from the
people of your country do that. I have been informed of what he (Faris)
misrepresented to people. Do not pay attention to him
insha’Allah!’[^141]

One day, there was a dispute between ‘Ali bin Ja’far and ibn al-Qazwini.
Ibrahim bin Muhammad al-Hamadani wrote a letter to Imam al-Hadi (a.s.)
telling him about that and asking him to show him which of them he
should follow. Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) replied to him saying,

“It should not be asked about one like this man, and there is no doubt
in him. Allah has glorified the position of the patient (‘Ali bin
Ja’far) where al-Qazwini is compared to him! Go to him to satisfy your
requests and questions and let those who follow you go to him to satisfy
their needs and answer their questions and to avoid al-Qazwini and not
let him interfere in their affairs for I have been informed of what he
fabricated among people. Do not pay him any attention inshalah!’[^142]

In a previous chapter we have mentioned the prayer of Imam al-Hadi
(a.s.) for ‘Ali bin Ja’far when he was in prison and that the prayer was
responded to and ‘Ali was freed from prison.

86. ‘Ali bin al-Hasan
---------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions.[^143]

87. ‘Ali bin al-Hasan bin Fadhdhal
----------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions.[^144]
An-Najashi said, ‘He was the best jurisprudent of our companions in Kufa
and one of the notables there. He was trustworthy and the most aware of
Hadith among them. Our companions listened to and obeyed him. Many
traditions were heard from him. No fault was found in him and he was
accused of nothing. He seldom narrated from a weak narrator.

He was Fatahite[^145] and did not narrate from his father any tradition.
When I was eighteen years, I discussed with him on his books, but at
that time I did not understand traditions and did not permit myself to
narrate them before him. He narrated from his two brothers who narrated
from their father.

He had written many books such as the book of “Wudu’”, “Haydh and Nafas;
menstruation and puerperium”, “Salat; prayer”, “Zakat and Khums”,
“Fasting”, “Manasik (rituals of) al-Hajj”, “Divorce”, “Nikah; marriage”
and others.’[^146]

Al-Kashshi said, ‘Abu Amr said: I asked Abu an-Nadhr Muhammad bin
Mas’oud about all those narrators and he said, ‘As for ‘Ali bin al-Hasan
bin ‘Ali bin Fadhdhal, I did not see among those whom I had met in Iraq
and KhurHasan one more knowledgeable or better than ‘Ali bin al-Hasan
(who was) in Kufa.

There was no book about the Imams (a.s.) unless he had a copy of it. He
was the best of memorizers, but he was a Fatahite believing in Abdullah
bin Ja’far (as the Imam) and then after him Abul Hasan Musa (a.s.). He
was reliable.’[^147]

88. ‘Ali bin al-Hasan bin Abd Rabbih

eighty.” He sent him the shroud some days before his death.’[^155]

and so did al-Barqi. He was one of the narrators who narrated the
tradition of the announcing of the Imamate of Imam Abu Muhammad
al-Askari (a.s.) by his father after him.[^165]

100. ‘Ali bin Muhammad bin Ziyad as-Saymari
-------------------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions.[^166]
The author of Mu'jam Rijal al-Hadith saw that ‘Ali bin Ziyad as-Saymari
mentioned before and this ‘Ali bin Muhammad as-Saymari were but the same
man and not two.[^167]

101. ‘Ali bin Muhammad bin ash-Shuja’ an-Naysaburi

jurisprudence.’

Ahmad bin Muhammad narrated from him.[^174]

105. ‘Ali bin Mahziyar al-Ahwazi ad-Dawraqi
-------------------------------------------

He was from the prominent ulama’ and one of the famous disciples of Imam
al-Hadi (a.s.). Here, we talk in brief about him:

### His worship

‘Ali bin Mahziyar was unequaled in his piety and obedience. Narrators
said that from his worshipping was that when the sun rose, he prostrated
himself to Allah and he did not raise his head from prostration until he
prayed Allah for one thousand of his brothers as he prayed for himself.
On his forehead there was like the knee of a camel because of his much
prostration for Allah.[^175]

### Imam al-Jawad praises him

Imam al-Jawad (a.s.) praised ‘Ali bin Mahziyar on some occasions. Once,
he wrote him a letter saying,  
 ‘O ‘Ali, I have tested you and tried you in loyalty, obedience,
service, reverence and performance of your duties and if I say that I
have not seen anyone like you, I might be truthful. May Allah reward you
with the Gardens of Paradise. Neither your position nor your services in
the hot and cold and in the day and night have been unknown to me. I
pray Allah, when He will gather the creatures on the Day of Punishment,
to have enviable mercy on you. He is the Hearer of prayer.’[^176]

### His works

He had written a good collection of books showing his abundant
knowledge. From among these books are the following: Wudu’, Prayer,
Zakat, Fasting, Hajj, Divorce, Punishments, Blood Money, at-Tafsir, The
Virtues, Setting Slaves Free and Management, Gains, Defects,
Supplication, Courtesy and Chivalry, al-Mazar (shrine), Refuting the
excessive, Recommendations, Inheritances, Khums, Witnesses, the Virtues
of the Believers, Heroism, Reservation (Taqiyyah), Hunting and
Slaughtering, Asceticism, Drinks, Vows and Oaths and Penances, Letters
(huroof), al-Qa’im (al-Mahdi), Good Tidings, Prophets, Rarities, the
Letters of ‘Ali bin Asbat, and other books. Most of these books are on
jurisprudential subjects which show that he was one of the great
jurisprudents in Islam.

### His narrations

‘Ali bin Mahziyar narrated about 437 traditions from Imam al-Jawad
(a.s.), Imam al-Hadi (a.s.), and others.[^177] He was from the pillars
of the Shiite culture and was nonesuch among the scholars and ulama’ of
his age.

106. ‘Ali bin Yahya ad-Dahqan
-----------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions and
said he was accused of excessiveness.[^178]

107. Isa’ bin Ahmad
-------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions,[^179]
and narrated from him many traditions, from which was this one: ‘Abul
Hasan ‘Ali bin Muhammad al-Askari (al-Hadi) told me from his father from
his fathers that (Imam) ‘Ali (a.s.) said, ‘The messenger of Allah
(blessing and peace be upon him) said (to ‘Ali): let him, who likes to
meet Allah safe and pure, and the supreme horror not to grieve him,
follow you and your sons al-Hasan, al-Husayn, ‘Ali bin al-Husayn,
Muhammad bin ‘Ali, Ja’far bin Muhammad, Musa bin Ja’far, ‘Ali bin Musa,
Muhammad, ‘Ali, al-Hasan, and then al-Mahdi who is the last of
them.’[^180]

108. Faris bin Hatim al-Qazwini
-------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions (or
just a narrator of his traditions) and added that he was cursed,
excessive.[^181] Al-Kashshi mentioned that Nasr bin as-Sabah said, ‘Imam
al-Hadi (a.s.) cursed al-Hasan bin Muhammad known as ibn Baba, Muhammad
bin Nusayr an-Namiri, and Faris bin Hatim al-Qazwini.’[^182]

Many traditions were related to Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) on cursing this man
and warning the Shi’a from associating with him because he was a source
of deviation and error. Here are some of those traditions:

1. Urwah wrote to Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) about Faris and he said, ‘Deny
what he says and disgrace him. May Allah exclude and disgrace him. He is
a liar in all that he claims. But keep yourselves away from arguing with
him or consulting with him. Do not give him way for evil. May Allah save
us from his burden and the burden of his like.’[^183]

2. Ibrahim bin Dawud al-Ya’qubi wrote to Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) about him
and Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) replied, ‘Pay him no attention, and when he
comes to you, dishonor him!’[^184]  
 We shall mention his deviant opinions when we shall study the age of
the Imam in a coming chapter.  
 Anyhow, Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) ordered his followers to kill this deviant,
misguiding man when saying, ‘Who will relieve me by killing him and I
assure Paradise for him by the will of Allah?’[^185]

109. Al-Fath bin Yazid al-Jirjani
---------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions,[^186]
and so did al-Barqi.[^187] An-Najashi said that he was the author of
“the Questions” or might be “the Answers of the Questions” –as we think-
that Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) was asked about.

110. Al-Fadhl bin Shathan an-Nayshaburi
---------------------------------------

Sheikh at-Tusi mentioned him as one of Imam al-Hadi’s companions.[^188]
He was from the great ulama’ and the most prominent men of the Islamic
intellect in his time. He studied and dealt with different sciences and
arts and wrote books on them. Here we shall mention, in brief, some
points on him:

### Imam al-Hasan praises him

Imam al-Hasan al-Askari (a.s.) praised al-Fadhl bin Shathan. When once,
one of al-Fadhl’s books was shown to Imam al-Askari (a.s.), he read some
of it, prayed Allah to have mercy on al-Fadhl, and said, ‘I envy the
people of KhurHasan the being of al-Fadhl bin Shathan among them.’ Once
again, he read another book of al-Fadhl, prayed Allah three times to
have mercy on al-Fadhl, and said about the book, ‘It is true that it
should be acted according to it.’[^189]

### Confuting the opponents

Al-Fadhl took upon himself to defend his beliefs and refute the
spuriosities raised against his cult. He said, ‘I am a successor of
those who passed away. I met Muhammad bin Abu Umayr, Safwan bin Yahya
and others and took knowledge from them since fifty years ago.

Hisham bin al-Hakam passed away, may Allah have mercy on him, and Younus
bin Abdur-Rahman was his successor. He refuted the dissenters. Then
Younus bin Abdur-Rahman passed away and left no successors except
as-Sakkak who refuted the dissenters until he left to the better world.
I am the successor after them, may Allah have mercy on them.’[^190]

He was the successor of those great scholars who struggled and defended
their high principles that the infallible Imams of the Ahlul Bayt (a.s.)
had adopted.

### His works

This great scholar wrote on different sciences such as jurisprudence,
tafsir, theology, philosophy, linguistics, logic, and other fields of
knowledge. The books he had written were more than one hundred and
eighty.[^191] Some of them were mentioned by Sheikh at-Tusi,[^192]
an-Najashi,[^193] ibn an-Nadim,[^194] and others.

him.[^199]

Al-Kashshi said, ‘I found in the book of Abdullah ash-Shathani that he
had written with his handwriting: “I heard al-Fadhl bin Hashim saying,
‘Al-Mahmudi mentioned to me that he had performed the hajj many times. I
asked him about their number but he did not tell me.

He said, ‘I have been endowed with much good (money), praise be to
Allah.’  
 I said to him, ‘Do you perform the hajj for yourself or for others?
[^205]’  
 He said, ‘After the obligatory hajj of Islam, I perform the hajj for
the messenger of Allah (SwT) and his progeny, and for the guardians of
Allah, the believing men, and believing women as far as Allah has
permitted me.’

I said to him, ‘What do you say in your hajj?’  
 He said, ‘I say: O Allah, I began for Your messenger Muhammad (blessing
be on him and on his progeny) and I made my reward from You and him for
Your pure guardians (peace be upon them) and donated my reward from them
for your faithful slaves who believe in Your Book and the Sunna of Your
Prophet (blessing be on him and on his progeny…’[^206]

This shows his goodwill and benevolence, and that the education of the
pure Imams (a.s.) to their companions has produced such perfect persons.

very weak and of bad beliefs…He had written “as-Sunan wel Aadab wa
Makarim al-Akhlaq”, and “al-Ma’rifah”.’[^215]

Al-Kashshi mentioned from him his saying, ‘I wrote to Abu Muhammad (Imam
al-Askari) complaining of poverty and then I said to myself: has Abu
Abdullah (Imam as-Sadiq) (a.s.) not said, ‘Poverty with us (the Ahlul
Bayt) is better than wealth with our enemy, and being killed with us is
better than living with our enemy.’

The reply to my letter came saying, ‘Allah the Almighty tries our
followers, when their sins increase, by poverty, and He may forgive many
(of sins), and it is as your self said to you: poverty with us is better
than wealth with our enemy.

We are a shelter for whoever resorts to us and a light for whoever seeks
light, and preservation for whoever resorts to us. Whoever loves us will
be with us in the highest position, and whoever deviates from us will be
in Fire.’ Abu Abdullah (as-Sadiq) said, ‘You acknowledge that your enemy
will be in Fire and do not acknowledge that your guardian will be in
Paradise! Nothing prevents you from that but weakness.’[^216]

He died when he was one hundred and twenty years. It was said that he
narrated from eighty men of the companions of Imam Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq
(a.s.).[^217]

125. Muhammad bin al-Hasan bin Abu al-Khattab az-Zayyat
-------------------------------------------------------

(virtues of) Abul Khattab”, “al-Malahim; battles or heroisms”,

There were firm communications and many correspondences between him and
Imam al-Hadi (a.s.). Here are some of the letters that were between
them:

1. Al-Kashshi mentioned that Muhammad bin al-Faraj said, “I wrote to
Abul Hasan (al-Hadi) (a.s.) asking him about Abu ‘Ali bin Rashid, Eesa
bin Ja’far bin Aasim, and ibn Band, and he replied to me saying, ‘You
have mentioned bin Rashid, may Allah have mercy on him. He lived happy
and died as a martyr.’ And he prayed Allah for ibn Band and bin
Aasim.”[^244]

2. Al-Kulayni mentioned that ‘Ali bin Muhammad an-Nawfali said,
“Muhammad bin al-Faraj said to me, ‘Abul Hasan (al-Hadi) wrote to him,
‘O Muhammad, manage your affairs and be careful!” My affairs were
managed and I was careful and I did not know what for he wrote to me so
until an agent from the government came, tied me, and carried me from
Egypt after confiscating all what I possessed.

I were in prison for eight years and then a book came to me from him
(from Imam al-Hadi) in prison saying, ‘O Muhammad, do not reside in the
Western District!’ I read the book and said to myself: he writes to me
so, though I am in prison! It is wonderful!! After a little time I was
set free.’

Then Muhammad bin al-Faraj wrote to him ( to Imam al-Hadi) asking about
his properties and he replied that they would be given back to him. When
Muhammad went to al-Askar, he wrote to him about giving his properties
back to him but he died before that.”[^245]

This letter shows that the Imam (a.s.) trusted and assisted Muhammad.
When Muhammad became ill, Imam al-Hadi (a.s.) sent him a garment. He put
the garment under his head and when he died, he was enshrouded with it.

(a.s.) and Imam al-Hadi (a.s.). They cared much for him. He narrated
traditions from Imam al-Jawad (a.s.) and had some questions with
him.[^269]

Ibn as-Sikkit was expert in linguistics, literature, Poetry, and grammar
of Arabic and had written many books such as “Tahthib al-Alfadh” and
“Islah al-Mantiq”.

Ibn Khillikan mentioned that some scholar said, ‘No book on linguistics
has ever passed across the bridge of Baghdad like the book of “Islah
al-Mantiq”. There is no doubt that it is from the useful, interesting
books including many sides of language. We do not know a book like it in
this concern. Many scholars were interested in the book. Al-Wazir
al-Maghribi summarized it. Al-Khatib at-Tabrizi edited it.

Ibn Khillikan mentioned that Abul Abbas al-Mubarrid said, ‘I have not
seen a book for the people of Baghdad better than the book of ibn
as-Sikkit in logic.’ Tha’lab said, ‘Our companions have agreed on that
there is no one, after ibn al-I’rabi, more aware in linguistics than ibn
as-Sikkit.’[^270] Al-Mutawakkil, the Abbasid caliph, killed him because
