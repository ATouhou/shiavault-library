Concerning The Promise (al-wa`d) And The Threat (al-wa'id)
==========================================================

Says the Shaykh Abu Ja'far: Our belief concerning the Promise
*(al-wa'd)* and the Threat *(al-wa'id)* [^1] is that he whom Allah
promises a reward for his good actions will certainly receive it. But he
whom Allah has threatened with a punishment may have an alternative. If
He punishes him, it is His justice; but if He forgives, it is His
generosity.[^2]

***“And thy Lord is not unjust towards His slaves” (Qur'an 41:46).***

And He says, Mighty and Glorious is He:

***“Lo! Allah forgiveth not that a partner should be ascribed unto Him.
And He forgiveth (all) save that to whom He will” (Qur'an 4:116).***

And Allah knows best.

[^1]: In the Tawhid there is a whole chapter on the subject, pp. 3257 to
3306. Imam ar-Rida refutes the arguments of the Mu'taziliti that grave
sins will not be forgiven by Allah, 3267-8. Even adulterers, thieves and
wine-drinkers will be saved, provided they are not guilty of shirk, 329
(last three lines). Cp. also FC, no. 84.

MC, 267, art. 25; BHA, no. 233.
