2- Ghadir in Quran
==================

Ten years after the migration, the Messenger of Allah ordered to his
close followers to call all the people in different places to join him
in his last pilgrimage. On this pilgrimage he taught them how to perform
the Hajj ceremony in a correct form.

This was the first time that the Muslims, with this magnitude, gathered
in one place in the presence of their leader, the Messenger of Allah. On
his way to Mecca, more than seventy thousand people followed Prophet
(p.b.u.h). Hazrat Ali (p.b.u.h.) who was in Yemen was asked to complete
his work and join the prophet in Mecca.

The prophet reached Mecca on Sunday, the 4th of zilhajj 10 A.H with
more than one hundred thousands of Muslims. Soon after his arrival, Ali,
who hastened back from Yemen, ahead of his men, joined the prophet.
Revelation of Verse 5:67

On the 18th of Zil-Hajjah, after completing his last pilgrimage
(Hajjatul- Wida), Prophet was leaving Mecca toward Medina, where he and
the crowd of people reached to a place called Ghadir Khum (which is
close to today's Juhfah). It was a place where people from different
provinces should say Good bye to each other and take different routes
for their home. In this place, the following verse was revealed:

"O Apostle! Deliver what has been revealed to you/rom your God; and if
you don't do it, you have not delivered His message (at all); and Allah
will protect you/rom the people on " (Quran 5:67).

Some of Sunni references confirm that the revelation of the above verse
of Quran was right before the speech of Prophet in Ghadir Khum:

(1) Tafsir Kabir, by Fakhr -e-Razi, under commentary of verse 5:67,
vol: 12, pp 49-50, narrated on the authorities of Ibn Abbas, al-Bara Ibn
Azib, and Mohammad Ibn Ali.

(2) Asbab al-Nuzool, by Wahidi, p50, narrated on the authorities of
Atiyyah and Abu Sa'id Khudri.

(3) Nuzul al-Quran, by Hafiz Abu Nu'aym narrated on the authorities Abu
Sa'id Khudri and Abu Rafi)

The last sentence in the above verse indicates that the Prophet was
mindful of the reaction of his people in delivering that message, but,
Allah informs him to not worry, since He will protect His Messenger from
people.

**The Speech**

Upon receiving the verse, the Prophet stopped on that place (the pond
of Khum) which was extremely hot. Then he asked all people who have been
ahead in the way, to come back. He also waited until all pilgrims who
were behind, arrived and gathered. He ordered Salman (RA) to use rocks
and camel toolings to make a pulpit (minbar), so that he could make his
announcement. It was around noon time, and due to the extreme heat in
that valley, people were wrapping their robes around their feet and
legs, and were sitting around the pulpit, on the hot rocks.

On this day the Messenger of Allah spent approximately five hours in
this place; three hours of which he was on the pulpit. He recited nearly
one hundred verses from The Glorious Quran, and for seventy three times
reminded and warned people of their deeds and future. Then he gave them
a long speech which has been widely narrated by the Sunni traditions.

In part of the speech the Messenger of Allah referred to a verse of the
holy Quran, and said: "Do not I have more right over the believers than
what they have over themselves?" People cried and answered: "Yes, 0'
Messenger of God." Then Prophet held up the hand of Ali and said:
"Whoever I am his leader (Mawla), Ali is his leader (Mawla). 0' God,
love those who love him, and be enemy to those who are enemy to him."

Some of the Sunni references:

(1) Sahih Tirmidhi, vol: 2, p.298, vol: 5, p.63
(2) Sunan Ibn Maja, vol: 1, pp 12, 43
(3) Khasa'is, by Nisa'i, pp 4, 21
Revelation of Verse 5:3

Soon after the Prophet finished his speech, the following verse of Holy
was revealed:

"Today I have perfected your religion, and completed my bounty upon
you, and I was satisfied that Islam be your religion." (Quran 5:3) Some
of Sunni references which mentioned the revelation of the above verse of
Quran in Ghadir Khum after the speech of the Prophet are:

(1) AI-Durr al-Manthur, by Hafiz Jalaluddin Suyuti, vol: 3, p19 .
(2) Tarikh, by Khatib al-Baghdadi, vol: 8, pp 290,596
(3) Manaqeb, by Ibn Maghazali, p 19

The above verse clearly indicates that Islam without clearing up matter
of leadership after Prophet was not complete, and completion of religion
was due to announcement of Prophet's immediate successor.

**Allegiance of People with Imam Ali (a.s) in Ghadir Celebration**

After announcing the leadership of Ali (a.s), Prophet descended from
the platform, wiped the sweat from his forehead, took a deep breath,
stood still for a moment, and commanded the Muslims to , "Make
allegiance to my brother and successor; congratulate him on his Divine
appointment. He is Imam and Amir-ulMumineen"

Omar Ibn Khatab was the first to congratulate Ali (p.b.u.h.) and to
acknowledge him as Master of all Believers'.

Saying: "Bakhin bakhin laka ibne Abi Talib Asbahta Mawlayee Wa Mawla
Kulla Momineen wa Mominaatin"

"Greetings be to you 0 son of Abu' Talib! You have dawned as my Leader
and the Leader of all faithful men and women. "

After the men, all the women came to congratulate Ali. At the
conclusion of this appointment ceremony, the Holy Prophet asked the
congregation, 'Have I not truly and faithfully delivered to you the
Message?"

And they answered, "Yes, verily Yes." Then the Prophet said, "Go now,
and those who have been present here today should repeat, and convey to
those who are absent all that they have seen and heard."

**The Number of People in Ghadir Khum**

It was Allah's will that a huge population associated with this
tradition via the tongues of narrators and over the times, so that there
is a standing proof for the guiding Imam. Allah ordered His Prophet to
notify people at a time of crowded populous, so that all become the
narrators of the tradition, while they exceeded one hundred thousand
people.

Narrated by Zaid Ibn Arqam, Abu al- Tufail said: "1 heard it from the
Messenger of Allah, and there was no one (there) unless he saw the
prophet with his eyes and heard him with his ears."

Sunni reference:

(I) al-Khasa'is, by Nisa'i, p21;
It is also narrated that:

“The Messenger of Allah called at the loudest of his voice.” Sunni
reference: Manaqib al-Kharizmi, by al-Kharizmi, p94. "There were with
the Messenger, the companions, Arabs, residents around Mecca and Medina
one hundred and twenty thousand (120,000) and they are those who were
present in the Farewell Pilgrimage and heard this speech." Sunni
reference: Manaqib, by Ibn al-Jawzi Revelation of Verse 70:1-3

Some Sunni commentators further claim that the first three verse of the
chapter of Ma'arij (70:1-3) was revealed when a dispute arose after
Prophet Speech. It is recorded that on the day of Ghadir the Messenger
of Allah summoned the people toward Ali and said: "Ali is the MA WLA of
whom I am MA WLA." The news spread quickly all over urban and rural
areas.

When Harith Ibn Nu'man alFahri (or Nadhr Ibn Harith according to
another tradition) came to know of it, he came to the Messenger of Allah
and said to him: "You commanded us to testify that there is no deity but
Allah and that you are the Messenger of Allah. We obeyed you. You
ordered us to perform the prayers five times a day and we obeyed. You
ordered us to observe fasts during the month of Ramadhan and we obeyed.
Then you commanded us to offer pilgrimage to Mecca and we obeyed. But
you are not satisfied with all this and you raised your cousin, by your
hand, and appointed him upon us as our master by saying" Ali is the MA
WLA of whom I am MA WLA.' Is this imposition from Allah or from You?"
The Prophet said: "By Allah who is the only deity! This is from Allah,
the Mighty and the Glorious. "

Upon hearing this, Harith turned back and proceeded towards his camel
saying: "O Allah! If what Muhammad said is correct then fling on me a
stone from the sky, and subject me to severe pain and torture." He had
not reached his camel when Allah, who is above all defects, flung at him
a stone which struck him on his head, penetrated his body and passed out
through his lower body and left him dead. It was on this occasion that
Allah, the exalted, caused to descend the following verses:

"A questioner questioned about the punishment to fall. For the
disbelievers there is nothing to avert it, from Allah the God of the
Ascent." (Quran 70:1-3) Sunni references:
