The Knowledge of the Book
=========================

Quran mentions the second type of knowledge, explained above, which has
been released to the prophets and the Imams. This is the knowledge of
what has been foreordained and the knowledge of the rules governing the
universe. This type of knowledge is known as "the knowledge of the
Book". Quran testifies that some prophets and non-prophets had this type
of knowledge by which they could perform many extraordinary things with
the permission of Allah. We read in Quran that:

So We did show Abraham the power and the laws of the heavens and the
earth that he might (with understanding) have certitude. (Quran 6:75)

Also earlier, we quoted a verse of Quran related to Prophet Jesus who
said: "I will also INFORM you of what things you eat and what you
treasure up in your houses." (Quran 3:49; see also 5:110). References
can also be made in this respect to the power of the interpretation of
the tales given to Prophet Joseph (AS) (see Quran 12:6,15,21,37), to the
language of the birds given to Prophet David (AS) and Solomon (Sulayman)
(AS) (see Quran 21:79). We also read:

We gave knowledge to David and Solomon, and they both said: "Praise be
to Allah Who has favored us above many of His servants who believe!" And
Solomon was David's heir. He said: "O People! we have been taught the
speech of Birds and we have been given (some knowledge) from all things.
This is indeed manifest favor." (Quran 27:15-16)

Having "the Knowledge of the Book", one can do many extraordinary
things with the permission of Allah. For example Quran mentions that at
the time of Prophet Solomon (Sulayman), a person in the name of Asaf,
who was the Minister of Solomon and had only a very small part of "the
Knowledge of the Book", was able to bring the throne of Queen Bilqis
from another place of the world within the twinkling of an eye:

"The One with whom was just a part of the Knowledge of the Book said:
'I shall bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!' Then when
(Solomon) saw (the throne) set in his presence, he said: 'This is by the
grace of my Lord! to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful!'"
(Quran 27:40).

The source of this Divine Knowledge is God. He gave part of it to
Prophet Adam (2:31), Jesus (5:110/113)... and some people who were not
prophets like Taloot (2:247), and Asaf (see the above verse). According
to Quran, "The knowledge of the Book" is for those who are immersed in
Knowledge (3:7, 4:162), who are given authority by Allah (4:83), who are
assigned by Allah as referee (16:43, 21:7), who are the stars of
Guidance (6:97).

According to some traditions, the Knowledge of The Book is a part of
the Greatest Name of Allah. The Greatest Name of Allah consists of
seventy three units. These are not letters, but they are rather the
knowledge of governing the universe. In one of the traditions in Usul
al-Kafi, Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (AS) explained this issue as well as the
mystery of the action of Asaf, the Minister of Solomon:

Abu Ja'far (AS) said: "Verily, the Greatest Name of Allah consists of
seventy three units (Harf). Asaf possessed only one unit of it, and when
he spoke it (i.e., used it) the ground between him and the throne of
Bilqis (the Queen of Sheba/Saba) folded/subsided so that he could take
the throne with his hands, and then the ground opened out and returned
to what it was originally in less than the twinkling of an eye. We
(Ahlul-Bayt) have seventy two units of the Greatest Name, and one unit
remained with Allah which is kept exclusively in His knowledge of Unseen
(Ilm al-Ghayb); and there is no efficacy or power except by Allah, the
High, the Great." (Usul al-Kafi, Kitab al-Hujjah, Tradition \#613)

As stated in Verse 27:40 of Quran, the one who possessed a small part
of "the Knowledge of the Book", was able to bring the throne of King
Bilqis from another place of the world within the twinkling of an eye.
So those who have the whole "Knowledge of the Book" should be able to do
more! The whole knowledge of the Book was with Prophet Muhammad and his
twelve successors. Allah, Exalted, said in Quran:

"(O' Prophet) say: Enough for witness between me and you is Allah and
he who possesses the Knowledge of the Book." (Quran 13:43)

\>From the verse, it is clear that in the phrase "he who possesses the
Knowledge of the Book", Quran is specifically referring to a person
other than Allah and Prophet Muhammad. Of course, the source of this
knowledge is Allah and He possesses it and He also granted it to Prophet
Muhammad (PBUH&HF) in full.

However, the choice words in the above verse shows that "he who
possesses the Knowledge of the Book" referred specifically in the above
verse, is a person (or persons) other than Allah and His Prophet
(PBUH&HF). It refers to Imam Ali (AS) and the Imams after him (see below
for details).

Also notice that in the above verse, Allah does NOT say "a part of the
knowledge of the Book" while Allah used the phrase "a part of" for the
case of minister of Solomon.

Some Sunnis have mentioned that the above verse refers to Abdullah Ibn
Sallam, the Jewish Rabbi who converted to Islam. some other Sunnis said
that it refers to all scholars of the Jews and the Christians who found
the attributes of the incoming Prophet in their ancient scriptures.

The above interpretation does not seem to be correct. "The knowledge of
the Book" as Quran mentions in one more place, is not as simple as
recognition of the attributes of the incoming Prophet in the scripture.
"The knowledge of the Book" includes the knowledge of governing rules in
the Universe. As Quran stated, Asaf had only a very small part of "the
Knowledge of the Book", and was able to do that extraordinary thing.

Thus this type of power has no connection with just knowing the name of
an incoming prophet from a book. Furthermore, if the Sunni
interpretation is correct, then it means whenever Muslims have a
question, they should refer to Christians and Jews, because they have
the whole knowledge of the Book while Muslims do not!

Some may argue that if the above verse is referring to Imam Ali and the
rest of the twelve Imams, then what sort of evidence will this be for
the unbelievers who would not accept the words of Muslims by saying the
above verse to them?

The answer is that the verse starts with the phrase: "And the Kuffar
(unbelievers) say: You are not a messenger. Say: Sufficient as witness
is..." As such, the verse is about Kuffar (unbelievers). They don't
believe in Allah either. Therefore, the same question may rise again: If
the Kuffar do not believe in Allah, then what sort of evidence will be
for them to say "Allah is the witness"?

The above verse is, in fact, just a threat by the Prophet (PBUH&HF) to
unbelievers, that that will be accounted on the day of judgment for
their blasphemy, and he (the Prophet) has enough two witness for that:
One is, Allah, the Creator, and the other one is Imam Ali, the Prince of
Believers. In general, it refers to all the twelve Imams. But at that
time of the Prophet he was just Imam Ali (AS).

Witness to the fact that "he who possesses the Knowledge of the Book"
in verse 13:43 refers to Imam Ali (AS) and no other companions of the
Prophet, is the numerous traditions reported by both Shia and Sunni. It
is confirmed in the authentic Sunni books that Imam Ali was the MOST
knowledgeable man in the Muslim community after the Prophet (PBUH&HF).
Those who testified this fact include: The Prophet (PBUH&HF), Imam Ali
himself, Abu Bakr, Umar, Aisha, and many other companions.

The Holy Prophet (PBUH&HF) informed his followers of the very existence
of a man who was the treasurer of Knowledge of the Holy Prophet
(PBUH&HF), and he had declared to them that if they want to reach the
Knowledge of the Holy Prophet, they should take that Knowledge from the
treasurer:

The Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HF) said: "I am the City of Knowledge, and
Ali is its Gate. So whoever intends to enter the City and the Wisdom, he
should enter from its Gate."

(30) Hafidh Salah al-Din al-Ulai, after copying the weakening arguments
by al-Dhahabi, has remarked "There are in this only mean attempts to

(31) Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Siddeeq al-Hasani al-Maghribi, from Cairo,
has
compiled a magnificent book named "Fat'h al-Mulk al-Ali bi Sihah
Hadith-e-Bab-e-Madinat al-Ilm" to prove the genuinness of the very above
tradition. This book was printed in the year 1354 AH in Matba'
al-Islamiyyah, Egypt.
(32) Also reported by Ibn Adi on the authority of Ibn Umar, and by al-
Bazzar on the authority of Jabir Ibn Abdillah al-Ansari ... and more
...

In the Arabic form of this Hadith, the word "The Knowledge" comes as
"al- Ilm" which has the article "al" which makes the word universal.
This means that in the city of knowledge of the Prophet (PBUH&HF), all
kind of the knowledge (which could possibly be attained by human being)
existed.

Remark: The above tradition also supports the infallibility of Imam Ali
(beside what is conveyed by Quran 33:33 on the issue of infallibility of
Ahlul-Bayt). The reason behind the non-intentional mistakes is lack of
knowledge, i.e., not to know what is right to do at the time. Therefore,
if Imam Ali (AS) contained all the knowledge of the Prophet (PBUH&HF),
it reasons that if the Prophet was infallible, so is Imam Ali (AS).

In addition to that, al-Tirmidhi also recorded that:

The Messenger of Allah said: "I am the House of Wisdom and Ali is it's
door."

Similarly, Barida narrated:

best in patience in them, and the first Muslim among them." ^^^^

Abu Bakr said: "May Allah never put me in a situation where I can not
have access to Abul Hasan (i.e., Ali) to solve a problem." Similarly,
Sa'id al- Musayyib said: "Umar Ibn al-Khattab used to beg God to
preserve him from a perplexing case which the father of al-Hasan was not
present to decide." Furthermore Umar said: "If there was not Ali, Umar
would have perished."

opened for me one thousand other chapters."

could happen up to the Day of Judgment, I will tell you about it. Ask
me, for, by Allah, you will not be able to ask me a question about
anything without my informing you. Ask me about the Book of Allah, for
by Allah, there is no verse about which I do not know whether it was
sent down at night or during the day, or whether it was revealed on a
plain or in a mountain."

The conclusion is that "he who possesses the Knowledge of the Book" in
verse 13:43 refers to Imam Ali (AS) and no other companions. And if "a
part of Knowledge of the Book", provided a supernatural power for Asaf,
then it is clear that those who have the whole knowledge of the Book,
have more ability of this type by leave of Allah.

Also according to the above tradition written in Sihah Sittah, in which
the Prophet (PBUH&HF) said "I am the City of Knowledge, and Ali is its
Gate. So whoever intends to enter the City and the Wisdom, he should
enter from its Gate", it is clear that the only source of knowledge
after Prophet Muhammad (PBUH&HF) was Imam Ali (AS), and those who seek
other sources do not gain the genuine Sunnah of the Prophet because
nobody can enter this City from a direction other than its door.


**Concluding Remarks**

It should be emphasized that The Twelver Shia Scholars believe that
neither the Prophet nor the Imams possess the Knowledge of Ghayb with
the special meaning used in Quran, since this type of knowledge is
something which belongs to Allah only. However, as Quran mentions "news
of Ghayb" have been transmitted to the Prophet Muhammad, and from that
channel, it has been transmitted to the Imams of Ahlul-Bayt. What they
fully possess is the Knowledge of the Book described above.

It should also be noted that the prophets and Imams share with the rest
of humanity the means for obtaining knowledge which Allah has given: the
senses, the intellect, etc. They also possess special powers and means
which other people do not have.

In carrying out the commands of Allah in which people have also
responsibility, and likewise in ordinary behavior, the prophets and
Imams only make use of the first way of knowing, that is the commonly
available means.

The second means (extraordinary means) is only used by them in duties
and works which are connected with their position of prophethood and
Imamat.

Thus in matters such as knowing the beginning of the month, passing
judgment, finding out if something is unclean or pure, etc., they make
use of ordinary means such as sighting of the moon, and so forth, which
anyone else employs. The extraordinary means of knowledge can not be the
basis for their action, and what they volitionally do must be determined
by the means available to everyone. Thus, such knowledge has spiritual
aspect as being the Representative of Allah (Khalifatullah), and the
reason for it must be sought on this level, and it is not for the
purpose of influencing and controlling the events on the level of
ordinary understanding.

And Allah knows best.

**Side Comments**

A contributor mentioned that there exists another version of the
tradition of "The City of Knowledge" where the Prophet states: "I am the
city of knowledge and Ali is its gate, and Abu Bakr is its foundation,
Umar its walls and Uthman its roof."

To answer this, I would like to first mention this weak tradition is
not reported in any of the six sound collections of the Sunnis, where as
the correct version of the tradition provided in our article is, in
fact, in the Sihah Sittah of the Sunnis.

Adding the words to the genuine traditions of the Prophet, was another
trick which the falsifiers of tradition narrators resorted to during the
time of the Umayad. When they found that a tradition was so widespread
amongst the people that there was no way to deny or refute it, they
decided to add a paragraph or words, or to change some phrases so as to
dampen the impact of the tradition or to make it lose its intended
meaning.

This trick is not hidden to the objective researchers who refute these
additions which, most of the time, indicate the lack of intelligence of
the falsifiers and their lack of wisdom in contrast to the light of the
Prophetic traditions. Even some well known Sunni scholars were aware of
such forgeries and have rated many of such traditions as forged or weak
due to the discrepancy in the Isnad as well as the contents.

For instance, in the above forged tradition, we can observe the saying
"Abu Bakr is it's foundation" means the knowledge of the Prophet
(PBUH&HF) is derived from the knowledge of Abu Bakr and this is
disbelief (Kufr). Likewise, the statement "Umar is its walls" means Umar
prevents people from entering the city, i.e., prevents them from getting
to the knowledge. Also the saying "Uthman is it's roof" is undoubtedly
absurd since there is no city which has a roof!!!

All praise is due to the Lord of the Worlds, who has given us
intelligence through which we will be able to differentiate between the
truth and falsehood, and He has made clear to us the Right Path and then
tests us by many things so that they can bear witness on the day of
judgment.
