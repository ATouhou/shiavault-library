Requesting an Explanation to our Rejection of ‘Ayesha's Hadith
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Safar 13, 1330**

You are not one who deceives, cheats, or pretends, nor are you one who
falsely charges someone. You are above being charged or accused as being
as such. I, praise be to Allah, neither criticize nor disprove, nor do I
look for someone's faults nor shortcomings; truth is my pursuit. I
cannot help asking you why you turn away from her [‘Ayesha's] hadith,
and your documented answer to this question is unavoidable.

Convey your message, and have no worry,

Let thy eyes be cooled, and be merry.

The argument I press in this regard is embedded in the meaning of this
verse of the Holy Qur'an:

***"Those who have concealed what We have revealed of clear signs and
guidance after We had made them clear to mankind in the Book: these have
been cursed by Allah and by those who curse (2:159)"...,***

Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*S*
