zuhal
-----

The planet Saturn or its sphere ( falak, q.v.); see also al-kawakib
al-sayyarah.

zaman
-----

Time. It is dependent on movement and yet different from it. Whereas
movement shows diversity in direction, time proceeds always and only in
one direction. Time is known only in relation of before and after like a
movement in a straight line and at a uniform rate. It, thus, can be
expressed only in a series of continuous quantities (al-kamm
al-muttasil, q.v.). Bodies are in time, not in their essence, but
because they are in movement and movement is in time. Time belongs to
the category of the created beings, but it is nowhere except in itself.
So far as this world of ours is concerned it is measured and made known
by the movements of the heavenly bodies. See also dahr and sarmad.

zuhrah
------

The planet Venus or its sphere ( falak, q.v.); see also al-kawakib
al-sayyarah.

zauj al-zauj
------------

"Pair of pair": a number, say 64, which is continuously divisible by two
till the dividend is one.

Zainun
------

Zeno of Citium (c. 340-265 B.C.), the founder of Stoicism; distinguished
generally in the Muslim works on history of philosophy from Zeno of Elea
by calling the latter as Zainun al-Akbar (q.v.); see also Ashab
al-Mazallah and Rawaqiyah.

Zainun al-Akbar
---------------

Zeno of Elea (c. 490-430 B.C.), disciple of Parmenides (Barminidus,
q.v.). He is famous for his paradoxes on motion and plurality, which he
advanced to defend the block-reality monism of his master. They,
however, raised good deal of controversy and, thus, contributed to
increase logical and mathematical rigour throughout the ages.
