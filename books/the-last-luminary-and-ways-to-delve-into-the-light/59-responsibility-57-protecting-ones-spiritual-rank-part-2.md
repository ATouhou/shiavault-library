Responsibility 57: Protecting Ones’ Spiritual Rank Part 2
=========================================================

The true believers must supplicate to Allah that He makes them firm and
resolute on the wilayah of the Imam and that they can move spiritually
closer to the Imam. They must also make du’a that the blessing and
approval of the Imam (over his true followers) is not removed from a
person and that one does not lose this great spiritual rank once he has
attained it!

For example, if a person is blessed to be among the companions, helpers
and Shi’a of the Imam (either during the period of the occultation or
during his advent), then this blessing which has been bestowed upon him
should be protected and there should be no change in his status (of
closeness to the Imam) nor should he do anything to have someone else
put in his place. In actuality, this is the same thing which we recite
in the following du’a:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَ لاَ تَسْتَبْدِلْ بِنَا غَيْرَنَا فَإِنَّ اسْتِبْدَالَكَ بِنَا
غَيْرَنَا عَلَيْكَ يَسِيرٌ وَ هُوَ عَلَيْنَا كَبِيرٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“And do not place someone else in our place since surely Your
replacement of us with others is something easy for You to perform,
however this is something grave (and difficult) for us (to bear).”[^1]
