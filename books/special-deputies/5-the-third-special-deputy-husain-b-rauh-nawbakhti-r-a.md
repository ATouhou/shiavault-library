Genealogy

Historians have recorded that after Abu Suhail Ismail b. Ali, Husain b.
Rauh b. Abi Bahr was the most famous personality in the Nawbakhti
family. The cause and reason of his fame and recognition was attributed
to his religious position. He is counted amongst the four special
deputies of Imam Qa’im (a.s.).[^1]

Shaikh at-Tusi (r.a.) in his book Rejaal has not made any mention of
Husain b. Rauh (r.a.). Early Islamic scholars seem to have taken a cue
from Shaikh and have not shed light on the life of Husain b Rauh (r.a.).
Scholars of the present era have only mentioned his name. However, in
his book Al Ghaibat, Shaikh at-Tusi (r.a.) has narrated many traditions
regarding him, highlighting the various aspects of his life.

Ibn Shahr al-Aashob (r.a.) has included Husain b Rauh (r.a.) amongst the
close companions of Imam Hasan al-Askari (a.s.)[^2]
