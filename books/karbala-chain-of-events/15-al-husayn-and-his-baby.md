Al-Husayn and His Baby
======================

By the afternoon 70 brave persons had sacrificed their lives in Karbala
to save Islam. All had fought under nerve racking conditions, severe
thirst, dehydration, exhaustion, and agonizing feeling of what would
happen to the family of the Prophet (S) afterwards. Husayn endured all
that and more, for he saw all his beloved ones brutally cut to pieces,
including children. Remaining the only one, Imam Husayn was to face the
enemy head on.

Precisely at that moment Imam Husayn heard his baby crying incessantly,
agonizing because of the thirst.**Imam Husayn's** love for his family
was unbound, especially for a suffering baby. He held the six months old
baby, his youngest son (â€˜Ali Asghar) in his arms, and appealed to the
enemy fighters for some water for the baby.

Imam wanted to awaken their conscience and stir their human feelings but
the stone-hearted enemy, instead of giving water, zoomed an arrow toward
the agonizing baby and killed him instantly. Imam Husayn was shocked. He
felt an unbearable wave of pain. The sight of the limp baby in his arms
was agonizingly painful. He filled his palm with the blood of the baby,
and threw it upwards toward the sky, complaining to Allah (swt),

"O' Allah, O' my Lord! My consolation is the fact that Thou in Thine
Majesty are witnessing what I am going through."
