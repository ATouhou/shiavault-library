The Moments of Her demise:
==========================

As she lay dying, it is supposed that Fatima (peace be upon her)
remembered all her past and analyzed the file of her life once again at
the night of her death:

-She remembered her childhood, sitting near her father, dusting her
father’s head and face, and crying for her father’s loneliness.

-She remembered witnessing her mother’s demise while Fatima (peace be
upon her) was so young and going pale with the sorrow of her death.

-She remembered marrying Ali while he was poor and trying not to neglect
his right even a moment. She was Ali’s confident everywhere and even
discerned the rope round his neck.

-She remembered witnessing the diversion of the society after her
father’s demise, contradictory to the Prophet’s purpose, caused by the
transgression and injustice of the Caliphs.

-She remembered the Prophet’s recommendation about her, but after a
short time, the audacious enemy was impudent to her, usurped her right,
made her arm black, and aborted her foetus.
