42: Gifting The Thawab Of Prayers To Imam (aj)
==============================================

This is also included among the duties of Shias during Ghaibat. The
proof is the tradition related by Sayyid Ibne Tawoos (r.a.) from Abu
Muhammad Saimri that it is narrated from the holy Imam (aj): “One who
gifts the Thawab of his prayers to the Messenger of Allah (S), Amirul
Momineen and the Imams after him, Allah shall increase the reward of
this prayer to such an extent that one becomes breathless while counting
it.

And before his soul is separated from his body he is told, ‘O Man! Your
gift has reached me! Since this is the day of recompense, may your heart
gladden and eyes brighten through the recompense that Allah has fixed
for you and which you have reached. Congratulation for it.’” The
narrator says that he asked Imam (aj) how they should gift the prayer
and what they should recite to gift its Thawab. Imam (as) told him,
“Make an intention (niyaat) that the Thawab of this prayer is for the
Messenger of Allah (S)….”[^1]

The author of this book, Muhammad Taqi Musawi (r.a.) says: It is clear
from the concerning traditional reports that it is recommended to gift
the reward of recommended as well as obligatory prayers to the Messenger
of Allah (S) and the Holy Imams (as).
