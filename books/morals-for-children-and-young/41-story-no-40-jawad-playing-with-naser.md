Story no. 40: Jawad playing with Naser
======================================

Jawad and Naser were neighbours and sometimes played in the streets
also.  
 While playing, Jawad said “ I swear on my mother’s life.  
 Naser said “ It seems as if you love your mother very much!”.  
 Jawad replied “ Of course I do, because the Holy Prophet (saw) has said
“Paradise lies under the feet of the mother”.
