Qaf 50 (compare it also with Chapter 51 called Winnowing [Winds] and The
Chargers 100. It consists of 50 Meccan verses. although v.48 dates from
Madina.

bad for rejectors on that day! " and begins with a series of oaths. The
whole expresses a poetic mood which is extremely difficult to capture in
translation. Compare this manner with the one in The Chargers 100.
