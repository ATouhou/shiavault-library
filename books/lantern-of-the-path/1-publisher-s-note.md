Publisher’s Note
================

Though there can be no doubt as to the truth and authenticity of the
teachings contained in this book, it should be mentioned that there is
some controversy whether the book was penned by the Imam (‘a) himself.
Both Allamah al-Majlisi and Allamah Hurr al-Amili felt that the book’s
division into ninety-nine chapters and its emphasis on inner meaning is
a style more suited to Gnostic or Sufi scholars. Other scholars, however
affirm that this was the work of the Imam (‘a) himself, among them
al-Sayyid Ali Ibn at-Tawus, Shaykh al-Kaf’ami, and ash-Shahid Ath-Thani.

In absence of unanimity, we can only say that “The Lantern of the Path”
is generally attributed to Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (‘a).
