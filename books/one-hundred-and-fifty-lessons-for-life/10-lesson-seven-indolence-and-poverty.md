Lesson Seven: Indolence and Poverty
===================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
"إنَّ الأشْياءَ لَمّا ازْدَوَجَتْ إزْدَوَجَ الْكَسَلُ و الْعَجْزُ
فَنَتَجا بَيْنَهُمَا الْفَقْرَ"
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

The day in which everything married with one another, “indolence” and
“weakness” mingled with each other, and their child was called “poverty
and indigence”.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

Everything is earned through effort and endeavors and this is the
reality that Islam has taught us.

Indolence, debility, weakness and escaping from hard work and difficult
challenges are never compatible with the spirit of belief. They will
produce nothing but poverty in all aspects, including economic, moral
and spiritual poverty. The striving believers on the other hand shall be
self-sufficient and contented in all respects.
