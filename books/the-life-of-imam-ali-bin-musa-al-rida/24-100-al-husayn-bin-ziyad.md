'No,' he replied, 'except the one who is silent and does not speak.' 'I
have come to know that you are not an Imām,' al-Husayn declared. 'From
whom have you come to know (that)?' asked the Imām. 'You have no son,'
replied al-Husayn, 'it (the Imāmate) belongs to the children. 'By

still having doubt in myself until I confined myself to these twenty
(traditions).[[4]](#_ftn1030)"

year." So he (the Imām), peace be on him, said: "O Allah, bless Mohammed
and the Household of Mohammed, and provide him with a house, a wife, a
son, a retainer and performing the hajj more than fifty years."

Hammād said: "When he (the Imām) mentioned fifty years, I came to know
that I would not perform the hajj more than fifty years." He added: "I
performed the hajj forty-eight years. This is my house with which I have
been provided. That is my wife behind the curtain, and she can hear my
words. This is my son and this is my retainer. I have been provided with
all of that." After this speech, he performed the hajj two years and
completed fifty years. After the fifty (years), he went out to perform
the hajj. He accompanied Abū al-'Abbās al-Nawfali al-Qasir. When he
reached the place of the ritual consecration, he entered the valley to
wash himself. However, the flood carried him away and he drowned before

--------------------------------

'Ali b. Abū Hamza al-Batāiyini, Ziyād b. Marwān al-Qandi, and 'Uthmān b.
'Īsā al-Rawāsi made him incline to the Wāqifiya. That was when they
craved for the lawful rights with which they were entrusted. They gave
something of them to Hamza b. Buzaygh, Ibn Makāri, and Karrām
al-Khath'ami.[[4]](#_ftn1034)

did Hamza b. Buzaygh, the wretched one, do?" I (i.e. Ibrāhim b. Yahyā )
replied: "He has just come." So he, peace be on him, declared: "He
(Hamza b. Buzaygh) claims that my father is still living. Today he is a
doubter and tomorrow he will die unbeliever.[[1]](#_ftn1035)"

118. Haydar Bin Ayyūb

al-Nazā'ir* and *Kitāb al-Nāsikh wa al-Mansūkh* (the Book of the

-----------------------

b. Ishāq b. 'Abd Allah b. Ja'far b. Abū Tālib, Abū Hishām al-Ja'fari. He

went in to Abū Ja'far, peace be on him, and there were three pieces of
paper without titles. I was unable to distinguish them, so l became
grieved. He (i.e. Abū Ja'far) took one of them and said: 'This piece of
paper belongs to so-and-so.' I became amazed (at him). Then he looked at
me and smiled (at me). I said (to him): 'May I be your ransom, I am fond
of eating clay. Pray to Allah for me.' He kept silent, and then he said
to me: 'After three days starting (from this

128. Di'bil al-Khazā'i
----------------------

He is the poet of Islam. He sacrificed his life for Allah, opposed the
leaders of oppression and tyranny, supported the Imāms of guidance and
truth, and struggled bravely in their way. Hence, he was subject to the
displeasure of the 'Abbāsid kings and their vengeance. Their organs and
their detectives chased him, but he was steadfast paying no attention to
terrors and misfortunes. Di'bil was the tongue of the front which
opposed the corrupt 'Abbāsid government, which took exclusive possession
of the blessings of the land and spent them generously on prostitution
and impudence, and left the people to lead a life of poverty and
deprivation. As a result, he satirized those kings and moved the
discontent of the general populace against them.

We will briefly mention the life of Di'bil and give an outline of his
inspired personality.

### His Scientific Position

In addition to the literary talents with which he was endowed and which
made him one of the leading generation of his time, Di'bil was a
scholar. He narrated on the authority of Imām al-Ridā, peace be on him,
and Abū Ja'far Mohammed al-Jawād, peace be on them[[1]](#_ftn1048), who
were two of the sources of Imāmi Jurisprudence. He also narrated on the
authority of a group of the eminent figures of his time. The following
are some of them:

1. Al-Hāfiz Shu'ba b. al-Hajjāj who died in 160 A. H. Through this
authority traditions are narrated on his authority in the books of the
two parties (i. e. the Sunnis and the Shi'ites), as it is in Shaykh
al-Tūsi's Amāli, p. 240, and Ibn 'Asākir's Tārikh, vol. 5, p. 228.

2. Al-Hāfiz Sufyān al-Thawri who died in the year 161 A. H. Ibn
'Asākir's Tārikh, vol. 5, p. 228.

3. The Imām of the Mālikiya, Mālik b. Anas who died in the year 179 A.
H.

4. Abū Sa'id, Sālim b. Nūh al-Basri who died after the year 200 A. H.

5. Abū 'Abd Allah Mohammed b. 'Amrū al-Wāqidi who died in the year 207
A. H.

6. Al-Ma'mūn, the 'Abbāsid Caliph, who died in the year 218 A. H.

7. Abū al-Fadl 'Abd Allah b. Sa'd al-Zuhri al-Baghdādi who died in the
year 260 A. H.

8. Mohammed b. Salāma. He (Di'bil) narrated on his (Mohammed b.
Salāma's) authority the famous sermon called *al-Shaqshaqiya* by the
Commander of the faithful, peace be on him, in the manner of the Shaykh
of the  (Shi'ite)  Sect in his (book) al-Amāli.

9. Sa'id b. Sufyān al-Aslami al-Madani, Shaykh al-Tūsi's Amāli, p. 227.

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[1]](#_F1048) Mu'jam Rijāl al-Hadith, vol. 7, p. 148.  
  

  

  

10. Mohammed b. Ismā'il.

11. Mujāshi' b. 'Umar.

12. Mūsā b. Sahl al-Rāsibi.

A group of the famous narrators also reported on the authority of
Di'bil. The following are some of them:

1. Abū al-Hasan 'Ali, the brother of Di'bil.

2. Mūsā b. Hammād al-Yazidi.

3. Abū al-Salt al-Harawi who died 236 A. H.

4. Hārūn b. 'Abd Allah al-Mahlabi.

5. 'Ali b. al-Hakam.

6. 'Abd Allah b. Sa'id al-Ashqari.

7. Mūsā b. 'Īsā al-Marwazi.

8. Ibn al-Nādi Ahmed b. Abū Dāwud who died 272 A. H.

9. Mohammed b. Mūsā al-Burayri.[[1]](#_ftn1049)

This point reveals that he had a scientific position, and that his
knowledge was not confined to literature and poetry; rather it included
tradition and jurisprudence.

### His Works

Di'bil wrote some books which show his scientific abilities. They are as
follows:

1. *Kitāb Tabaqāt al-Shu'arā'* (the Book of the Classes of Poets):

It is one of the valuable books and among the reliable fundamentals in
literature and biographies. The eminent authors such as Ibn 'Asākir,
al-Khatib al-Baghdādi, Ibn Khulakān, al-Yāfi'i, and others narrated on
his authority. The following are some chapters of the book:

A. The Stories of the Poets of Basrah.

B. The Stories of the Poets of al-Hijāz.

C. The Stories of the Poets of Baghdad.

The book contains other chapters. It is one of the references.

2*. Kitāb al-Wāhida fi Manāqib al-'Arab wa Mathālibihā* (the Book of the
One on the good and bad Qualities of the Arabs).[[2]](#_ftn1050)

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[1]](#_F1049) Al-Ghadir, vol. 2, p. 273. 'Abd al-Sāhib al-Dujayli,
Diwān Di'bil, pp. 22-24.  
 [[2]](#_F1050) Ibid., pp. 371-372.  
  

  

  

3. Poetry Divan

The Divan was collected by al-Sawli and it contains three hundred pages,
as Ibn al-Nadim mentioned.[[1]](#_ftn1051) It is not  available in the
cases of the Arab manuscripts. It is most likely that it has been lost
just as the rest of the other manuscripts which the Arab and Islamic
world has lost.

The late Professor 'Abd al-Sāhib al-Dujayli did his best for several
years in order to collect Di'bil's poetry and to manifest it to the
world of publications under the title of *Diwān Di'bil Bin 'Ali
al-Khazā'i*. The Divan was printed in Holy Najaf in the year 1382. It
contains a full introduction in which the late professor has
demonstrated the life and works of Di'bil. Through this task he has
offered a service to thought and literature.

### His Poetry

As for the poetry of Di'bil, it is one of the sources of Arab
literature, for, in many of its stanzas, he has sincerely described the
political and social life of his time and the various kinds of
oppression and tyranny the people received from the 'Abbāsid rulers,
whose reign was similar to that of the Umayyads; rather it was worse
than that of the Umayyads.

### His Praising and Lamenting for the 'Alawides

Di'bil gave his literature and thought to the 'Alawides, who summoned
(mankind) to social justice and sincerely struggled in order to declare
Human rights and to save the poor and the deprived from the crimes of
the Umayyad and 'Abbāsid reign. The following are some examples of what
he said concerning his praising and lamenting for them:

His praising the Commander of the faithful:

Verily he is pure, chaste, purified, and quick toward good

things and blessings.

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[1]](#_F1051) Al-Fihrast, p. 229.  
  

  

  

Youth and middle-aged, the best middle-aged and young

man, the most excellent of them in lending a helping hand

during distress.

The most brave of them in heart, the most truthful of them

in brotherhood, and the greatest of them in glory and

kinship.

He is the brother of the Chosen One; rather his son-in-law

and his testamentary trustee from among the people and

the cover for defects.

(His position to him) is as Hārūn had with Mūsā in spite

of the people low, ignoble, and with spilt skins.

He (the Prophet) said: Whomsoever I am his master, then

this ('Ali) is his master after my death.

He is my brother, my testamentary trustee, my cousin, my

inheritor, and the one who pays my debts from among my

promises.[[1]](#_ftn1052)

There is no affectation in this poetry; rather it is harmonious with
reality and is very truthful, for it gives an account of some qualities
of the Commander of the faithful, peace be on him, of which are: He is
pure, purified, the most generous of the people, and the most courageous
of them in heart, for he entered the terrors of the battles. He is the
lion who destroyed the forces of polytheism and unbelief. Moreover, he
is the closest of all people to Allah's Messenger, may Allah bless him
and his family, for he is his brother, his son-in-law, and his
testamentary trustee. His position to him is as Hārūn had with Mūsā, and
he (the Prophet) said concerning him on the Day of Ghadir Khum:
"Whomsoever I am his master, then this ('Ali) is his master after my
death."

Now, let us listen to another part of his (Di'bil's) poetry:

The Qur'ān speaks of the excellence of the Household of

Mohammed, and the authority of their 'Ali cannot be

denied.

The authority of the chosen one and best of the people is

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

after the Prophet, the truthful one, the affectionate.

When the needy came to him, he ('Ali)  willingly

stretched out his arm and hand.

So the needy took from him a ring which was the gift of

the generous one, the munificent one and son of the

munificent.

So the Most Merciful (Allah) has singled him out in His

Revelation. He who has gained (qualities) like his glory,

then let him number them.

Surely your *walis* (friends) are Allah, His Messenger, and

the  believers. So he who desires (to deny them), then let

him deny (them).

Tomorrow Allah will be his opponent concerning it

(authority), and Allah does not break His promise.[[1]](#_ftn1053)

This poetry is very clear, for it gives an account of one of the merits
of Imām 'Ali, the Commander of the faithful, peace be on him. This
virtue is that a poor man went to the Mosque of the Messenger in Medina
(Yathrib). The poor man asked the Muslims to help him, but none of them
gave him anything. Meanwhile Imām 'Ali, the Commander of the faithful,
peace be on him, was praying. He beckoned to the poor man and gave him
his only ring. When the Imām had finished his payer, the revelation came
down to Allah's Messenger, may Allah bless him and his family, in order
to decorate him with the dearest medal of the heaven through this holy
verse: *Only Allah is your Friend (wali) and His apostle and those who
believe, those who keep up prayers and pay the poor-rate while they
bow*.[[2]](#_ftn1054) The meaning of this verse is clear, for it has
confined the general authority to Allah, the Exalted, the greatest
Prophet, and Imām 'Ali, the Commander of the faithful, peace be on him,
who paid the poor-rate while he was bowing.

This verse is one of the definite proofs of the Imāmate of Imām 'Ali,
the Commander of the faithful, peace be on him. Imām 'Ali is  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[1]](#_F1053) Ibid., p. 101.  
 [[2]](#_F1054) Qur'ān, 5, 55.  
  

  

  

more entitled and appropriate to undertake the caliphate over the
Muslims than those other than him. That is because Allah, the exalted,
associated His authority with that of His Messenger and of the Commander
of the faithful, peace be on him.

Now, let us listen to other lines which Di'bil composed concerning Imām
'Ali, peace be on him:

May Allah bless the pledge of allegiance to Ahmed

(Mohammed) and his testamentary trustee. I mean the

Imām, our envied friend.

I mean him who supported the Prophet Mohammed before

the people, when he was young and a grown-up.

I mean him who removed the distresses and was not

cowardly at the battles.

I mean the monotheist before every monotheist, who

worshipped neither idol nor rock.

It was he who spent the night on Mohammed's bed,

that he might protect him from schemes of the schemers.

He was advanced during the heat of the battles; neither old

nor young can deny that.[[1]](#_ftn1055)

In these lines Di'bil demonstrates the support of Imām 'Ali to the
Messenger, may Allah bless him and his family. That is because the Imām
was the first to protect the word of monotheism. Through his efforts and
struggle the religion of Islam was established. He removed the
distresses from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family, during
the most critical situations. At the Battles of Badr, Uhd, al-Khandaq
(the Trench), he was the unique hero who struck off the heads of the
polytheists, defeated their armies, and raised the banner of monotheism.

Then Di'bil demonstrates Imām 'Ali's spending the night on the bed of
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family, and his protecting him
with his own soul. The Imām voluntarily sacrificed his own life for
Islam. So how great his favors toward this religion are! This is an
example of what Di'bil composed on praising Imām 'Ali, the Commander of
the faithful, peace be on him.

### His Lamenting for al-Husayn

The Muslims were terrified by the tragedy of Karbalā' at which the
sacredness of the Messenger, may Allah bless him and his family, was
violated because of the murder of his children and progeny. That was
when the armies of the Umayyads savagely destroyed the family of the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family, and, through killing them,
committed the most horrible crime (in the history of mankind). This
terrible tragedy shook human conscience, hence Di'bil, who was  an
'Alawide in thought, mourned for Imām al-Husayn, peace be on him. He
lamented for him in a group of wonderful poems of which are the
following lines:

Have you shed tears, spent the night suffering from

intense sighs, wept over the ruins of the family of

Mohammed, and your chest has become narrow out of

regrets?

Oh! Truly weep for them; make flow for them tears shed

out of the misfortune.

Do not forget that they were befallen by the greatest

misfortune on the Day of the Plains *(tufūf)*.

May Allah water the graves on the plain of Kerbalā', the

quarters of rain clouds.

And may He bless the soul and body of al-Husayn, who

was thrown in the deserts between the two rivers, was

killed without any guilt, called (the people) to support him

when alone and single: Where, where are my protectors?

Shall I forget, while this river overflows, the one thirsty,

killed, and wronged without being oppressive?

So say to the son of Sa'd, may Allah drive away his

happiness: You will face the torture of the Fire and curses.

Throughout the time, as long as the east wind blows, in the late
afternoon and in the early morning, I will invoke

(Allah) against the people who all have gone astray and

lost the statement of Allah's Messenger through vague

errors.

  

  

  

They displayed the head of al-Husayn on a spear and

drove (his) womenfolk bareheaded and sad.

They died thirsty and emigrants, and they left the schools

of Allah's Revelation effaced.

It was difficult for the chosen One (the Prophet) to see his

grandson remain thrown on earth and without burial

The spearhead raised the head of his beloved one, and it

was driven on the bayonets to Shām (Syria) by night.

He whose mother chewed Hamza's liver hit it with a rod.

These misfortunes made the eye of every monotheist flow

blood, so the heart has stricken them with tears.[[1]](#_ftn1056)

These lines represent the sorrow and grief of (Di'bil) al-Khazā'i for
the heavy misfortune which befell the grandson of the Messenger and his
sweet basil. That is because the aggressors killed him in response to
the desires of their Umayyad masters, and left his holy body thrown on
the plateau of Karbalā'. They did not bury him. Rather they cut off his
head, and displayed it throughout towns and cities in order to avenge
themselves on Imām al-Husayn and to show their great happiness through
murdering him. Now, let us listen to another part of Di'bil's lamenting
for Imām al-Husayn, peace be on him:

The head of the daughter of Mohammed and his

testamentary trustee, O men, was displayed on a spear.

The Muslims saw it and hear (of it), but they showed

neither impatience nor mercy toward it.

You have woken eyelids while you were sleep for them,

and you have put to sleep an eye which had not slept but

through you.

Your view made blind every eye that could see, and the

news of your death deafened every hear that could hear.

Every garden wished that it could be a bed for you and a

place for your grave.[[2]](#_ftn1057)

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[1]](#_F1056) Ibid., 107.  
 [[2]](#_F1057) Ibid., pp. 99-100.  
  

  

  

Di'bil criticized the Muslims for their losing their enthusiasm, their
submission to abasement and disgrace, cranked their necks with yielding
to the government of Yazid (b. Mu'āwiya) which disdained their values
and fates, and raised the head of the grandson of their Prophet on the
heads of their spears and displayed it through the cities and towns. All
the Muslims heard and saw that but none of them showed his vengeance and
displeasure toward Yazid. However, I (i.e. the author) think that this
situation resulted from violence and terrorism which were practiced
against the community. In other words the authority punished the people
because of doubt and accusation. Of course, this attitude spread fear
and terror among the Muslims. These are some of Di'bil's elegies for
(Imām al-Husayn), the master of martyrs, peace be on him.

### His Satire

Di'bil was indignant with the 'Abbāsid kings of his time and satirized
them severely. He was not moved by sentiments and desires which had no
relationship with the truth. He (satirized) those kings because they
turned away from the truth, and employed the wealth of the community for
their pleasures, for example, they spent a lot of money on the singers
and the corrupt people, brought to their palaces what Allah had
forbidden such as wine and various kinds of amusement, while the
community led a life of poverty and deprivation. Now, let us listen to
part of his satire:

####  His Satire upon al-Rashid

When Imām al-Ridā, peace be on him, died, al-Ma'mūn hurried to bury him
beside his father (Hārūn al-Rashid). He was asked about that and he
replied: "That Allah may forgive Hārūn (al-Rashid) through his
neighboring Imām al-Ridā." When Di'bil heard of that, he ridiculed it
and said:

Two graves are at Tūs: (The grave) of the best of all

people and the grave of the most wicked of them; this is

among the moral lessons.

The nearness to the pure one does not benefit the unclean

  

  

  

one; nor does the nearness to the unclean one harm the

pure one.

How far! Everyone is hostage to that which his own hands

earn, so take or leave whatever you desire.

Which satire upon Hārūn (al-Rashid) is bitterer than this? Di'bil
sometimes described him as the most wicked of all  people and sometimes
as abominable, and that his nearness to the resting place of the Imām
would not benefit him, for every person would be treated according to
what his hands did, and there would be no advantage of other than that.

#### His Satire upon Ibrāhim

When al-Ma'mūn appointed Imām al-Ridā, peace be on him, as his heir
apparent, the 'Abbāsids became angry and pledged allegiance to Ibrāhim,
the leader of the singers, so Di'bil satirized him, saying:

Ibn Shakkla cried in Iraq and (among) its people, so those

blind and foolish hurried to him.

If Ibrāhim (Ibn Shakkla) undertakes it (the caliphate),

then, after him, Makhāriq and Zalzal will be appropriate

for it.

How do, and that does not occur, the dissolute inherit the

caliphate one by one?[[1]](#_ftn1058)

This is the bitterest kind of satire, for if the caliphate was
appropriate for Ibrāhim, then it would be appropriate for singers other
than him such as Makhāriq, Zalzal, and Māriq. In this manner the state
would belong to the singers, but it was impossible for it to reach this
low level and the dissolute to undertake it one by one. It is strange
that the soldiers gathered around Ibrāhim's palace and asked him for
their salaries, but he had no money left with him. A witty man addressed
the soldiers, saying: "Ibrāhim will go out. He will sing each group a
song. Theses are your salaries!" As for Di'bil, he heard of that and
said:

O soldiers, do not be hopeless; take your salaries

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[1]](#_F1058) Ibid., p. 174.  
  

  

  

and do not be displeased.

He will sing you a song which the

beardless and the bearded enjoy.

Ma'bad's songs, for your leaders, neither enter the bag nor

ass = t50\>tie it.

In this manner the Caliph, whose book is the lute,

provides his soldiers with the means of subsistence.

Have you seen this mockery at the leader of the singers who provided his
soldiers with singing?

#### His Satire upon al-Mu'tasim

As for Di'bil's satire upon al-Mu'tasim, it is bitter and severe, for
al-Mu'tasim was tyrannical and oppressive, had neither compassion nor
mercy. Di'bil is truthful when he satirizes him with these poetry lines:

A sad lover weeps for the dispersion of the religion, and

his eyes overflow with tears (for it).

An Imām has undertaken (the caliphate) while he has

neither guidance nor religion nor intellect.

None has brought news that the like of him will someday

rule or the Arabs follow him.

However, it is just as the past ancestors said when the

misfortune became great:

The 'Abbāsid kings are seven in the books, and the books

have not told us about the eighth of them.

Likewise, the People of the Cave were seven noble ones in

the Cave when they are numbered, and their eighth was a

dog.

Surely, I regard their dog as higher than you in

exaltedness, because you have sins while it had no sin.

When you have had an authority over us

because of our misery, you look like an old woman who

wears a crown, a necklace and a gown.

The authority of the people has become lost when Wasif

  

  

  

and Ashnās[[1]](#_ftn1059) have seized it, and the distress has become

great.[[2]](#_ftn1060)

These lines represent affliction and unhappiness of the Muslims during
the caliphate of al-Mu'tasim, who had no noble trait which would qualify
him for the office of Islamic caliphate, which was the shadow of Allah
on earth. During his reign, Di'bil remained hidden and chased by terror
and fear, for al-Mu'tasim order his police to arrest him, but they did
not find him. When al-Mu'tasim died, Di'bil satirized him with these
lines:

When they had hidden him in the most evil grave for the

most evil one and gone away, I said: Go to the Fire

because your quality belongs to none except to Satans.

You have not disappeared until you pledged allegiance to

him who damaged the Muslims and the religion.[[3]](#_ftn1061)

His Satire upon al-Wāthiq
-------------------------

When al-Wāthiq became caliph, Di'bil wrote the following lines in
satirizing him. He gave the lines to the chamberlain and said to him:
"Say to al-Wāthiq: 'Di'bil has praised you with these lines.'" These
lines are as follows:

Praise belongs to Allah! There is no steadfastness nor

endurance nor comfort when lovers repose.

A caliph has died but none has mourned for him; yet

another has undertaken (the caliphate) but none is

delighted with him.

So this (i.e. the former caliph) passed and evil omen

passed to follow him; this (the latter) has risen, so woe

and unhappiness have also risen.

When al-Wāthiq opened (the letter) and read the poetry lines, he burst
into anger. He ordered Di'bil to be arrested, but he did not find him
until he (al-Wāthiq) perished.[[4]](#_ftn1062)

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[1]](#_F1059) Wasif and Ashnās were two Turkish young men.  
 [[2]](#_F1060) Di'bil, Divan, pp. 129-130  
 [[3]](#_F1061) Ibid., p. 209.  
 [[4]](#_F1062) Ibid.  
  

  

  

This is an example of his satire, which represents his enthusiasm toward
the truth, his helping the oppressed and persecuted of his time.

Di'bil was one of those leaders who opposed the 'Abbāsid government of
his time. It is an act of crime against thought that Di'bil is described
as one with evil tongue and that none of the caliphs was safe from his
tongue.[[1]](#_ftn1063) This statement is cheap and far from reality.
Di'bil adored the members of the House *(ahl al-Bayt)*, peace be on
them, whom the 'Abbāsid government persecuted. This government spared no
effort to wrong them and their followers. Accordingly, Di'bil was very
eager, due to his faith, to support and defend them, and to defame their
opponents. This is not a defect; rather it is pride and honor for him.

### Di'bil joins the Garden

Throughout his life, Di'bil was a struggler and combatant. He ridiculed
the kings  of his time who made lawful what Allah had made unlawful. He
lashed them with the bitterest kind of satire. As a result the authority
followed him and intended to execute him, but he hid himself and began
going from one country to another, followed by terror and fear. It is he
who says in his immortal (poem) called al-Tā'iya:

I am terrified in the world and the efforts of its days,

and I hope for security after my death.

Di'bil bravely announced his readiness for death, saying: "I have
carried my wood (i.e. gibbet) on my shoulder for fifty years. I have
looked for him who will crucify me on it, but I have not found him who
will do that."

The death of Di'bil was at the hand of one of the wicked of his time,
who was called Mālik b. Tawq al-Taghlubi. Malik sought him, but he
escaped to Basrah whose governor was Ishāq b. al-'Abbās al-'Abbāsi.
Ishāq was informed of Di'bil's satire upon him and he ordered him to be
arrested. Di'bil was brought before him and he ordered the leather rug
and the sword to be brought in order to behead  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[1]](#_F1063) Abū al-Farajj al-Asfahāni, al-Aghāni, vol. 18, p. 29.  
  

  

  

him. However, Di'bil denied the poem through which he satirized him. He
said that one of his opponents had composed the poem and ascribed it to
him in order to shed his blood. He begged Ishāq and he pardoned him from
killing. But Ishāq ordered the sticks and whips to be brought and he
began lashing Di'bil savagely. Then he released him and he fled to
al-Ahwāz.[[1]](#_ftn1064)

Malik b. Tawq hurried and dispatched a prudent, bold person and gave him
poison. He ordered him to assassinate Di'bil. He gave him ten thousand
dirhams in recompense for this crime. The man quickly headed for
al-Ahwāz. He spared no effort to find Di'bil. As a result he found him
in one of the villages of al-Sūs. He assassinated him after the night
prayer. He hit him on the upper part of his foot with a poisoned crutch.
Di'bil's body became poisoned, and he died in the following morning. He
was buried in the above-mentioned village. It was said that he was
carried to al-Sūs and was buried wherein.[[2]](#_ftn1065) In this manner
the life of this mujāhid, who fought with oppression, expired. His
friend, the great poet, Abū Tammām al-Tā'i lamented for him in these
poetry lines:

The graves of Habib and Di'bil have increased my love and kindled my
love sickness when they died.

My brothers, the heaven is still thin and covers you with rain cloud.

One grave is near al-Ahwāz, it takes the mourner a long time to reach
it, and the other is near al-Mousl.[[3]](#_ftn1066)

May Allah have mercy on Di'bil, for he was one of the prominent Muslim
figures. He died a martyr for the noble principles and the ideals which
he adopted in all stages of his life.

He was the uncle of al-Mu'tasim, the 'Abbāsid. He is trustworthy. He
lived in Qum and reported on the authority of  its people. He collected
the questions about which al-Sabāh al-Hindi asked Imām al-Ridā, peace be
on him.[[1]](#_ftn1068) He narrated on the authority of Imām al-Ridā,
peace be on him, and Ibrāhim b. Hāshim reported on his
authority.[[2]](#_ftn1069)

131. Al-Rayyān Bin al-Salt Al-Ash'ari al-Qummi
----------------------------------------------

His *kunya*is Abū 'Ali. He narrated on the authority of Imām al-Ridā,
peace be on him. He is trustworthy and very truthful. He has a book in
which he has collected the statement of al-Ridā, peace be on him, on the
difference between *al-āl wa al-Umma* (the Household and the
community).[[3]](#_ftn1070) Mu'ammar b. Khallād narrated: "Al-Rayyān b.
al-Salt said to me at the time when al-Fadl b. Sahl sent him to one of
the districts of Khurasān: 'I want you to ask Abū al-Hasan 'Ali
(al-Ridā), peace be on him,  for permission for me in order to greet him
and say farewell to him, and I want him to give me one of his garments
and some of the dirhams bearing his name.'" He (al-Rayyān b. al-Salt)
said: "I went in to him and he said to Mu'ammar: 'Does he (al-Rayyān b.
al-Salt) want to come in to me and want me to give him one of my
garments and some of my dirhams?'" He (Mu'ammar) said: "I (i.e.
Mu'ammar) said: 'Glory belongs to Allah! By Allah, he did not ask me
except to ask that from you for him." He (al-Ridā) said: "Mu'ammar, the
believer is successful. Let him come in." He (Mu'ammar) said: "I
permitted him and he went in to him and greeted him. He (al-Ridā) called
for one of his garments and it was brought to him. When he (al-Rayyān)
went out, I asked him: 'What did he give you?' Suddenly, there was
thirty dirhams in his hand.[[4]](#_ftn1071)"

132. Zakariya Bin Ādam
----------------------

b. 'Abd Allah b. Sa'd al-Ash'ari al-Qummi. He is trustworthy and great
with great position. He was of great importance with Imām al-Ridā, peace
be on him. He has a book.[[1]](#_ftn1072) Al-Kashi narrated that he
heard from one of our companions on the authority of Abū Tālib 'Abd
Allah b. al-Salt al-Qummi, who said: "I (i.e. Abū Tālib) went in to Abū
Ja'far, the Second, peace be on him, at the end of his span of life and
heard him say: 'May Allah reward well on my behalf Safwān b. Yahyā,
Mohammed b. Sinān, and Zakariya b. Ādam, for they are loyal to me.'"

Mohammed b. Hamza reported on the authority of Zakariya b. Ādam, who
said: "I (i.e. Zakariya b. Ādam) said to al-Ridā, peace be on him: 'I
want to leave my household, for the foolish are many among them.' He
(al-Ridā) said: 'Don't do (that), for affliction is repelled from your
household through you just as affliction is repelled from the people of
Baghdad through Abū al-Hasan al-Kāzim, peace be on him.[[2]](#_ftn1073)

What indicates his great ability and his exalted position is that which
narrated by 'Ali b. al-Musayyab, who said: [My house is distant and I
cannot come to you every time, so from whom shall I take the principal
features *(ma'ālim)* of my religion? He, peace be on him, replied:]
"(Take them) from Zakariya b. Ādam al-Qummi, who is entrusted (by me)
with religion and the world." 'Ali b. al-Musayyab said: "When I
departed, I went to Zakariya b. Ādam and asked him about my (religious)
needs."

Mohammed b. Ishāq and al-Hasan b. Mohammed narrated: "Three months after
the death of Zakariya b. Ādam, we went out in order to make the
pilgrimage. On part of the road, we received his (al-Ridā's) letter,
peace be on him. In it has been mentioned: 'I have mentioned the decree
of Allah toward the late man (i.e. Zakariya b. Ādam), may Allah have
mercy on him on the day when he was born,  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

the day when he died, and the day when he will be raised from the dead.
Throughout the days of his lifetime, he lived knowing the truth,
believing in it, patient and having a fore-thought for the truth,
performing what Allah and His Messenger loved. He, may Allah have mercy
on him, passed away while he did not break (the oath of allegiance) nor
did he changed it. May Allah reward him just as He rewards His Prophet
and give him his best wishes. You mentioned the entrusted man, but you
do not know our view regarding him, and we have knowledge of him more
that what you have described he meant al-Hasan b. Mohammed b.
'Umrān.[[1]](#_ftn1074) '" This account reveals the exalted position of
Zakariya b. Ādam with the Imām, peace be on him. 

133. Zakariya Abū Yahyā
-----------------------

He was nicknamed *Kawkab al-Dam* (the Star of Blood). In the Chapter on
the *Kunā*, Shaykh al-Tūsi numbered him as one of the companions of Imām
al-Ridā, peace be on him.[[2]](#_ftn1075) Abū Yahyā al-Mousili said:
"Zakariya Abū Yahyā was one of the good Shaykhs.[[3]](#_ftn1076)" Ibn
al-Ghadā'iri regarded him as a weak (traditionalist).

134. Zakariyā Bin Idris
-----------------------

b. 'Abd Allah b. Sa'd al-Ash'ari al-Qummi. His *kunya* is Abū Jarir. He
narrated on the authority of Imām Abū 'Abd Allah, peace be on him, and
(Imām) Abū al-Hasan al-Ridā, peace be on him. He has a
book.[[4]](#_ftn1077) Zakariya reported, saying: "After the death of my
father Jarir, I went in to al-Ridā, peace be on him. He asked Allah to
have mercy on him, and then he asked me about him from the evening to
dawn. Then he rose and performed the dawn prayer.[[5]](#_ftn1078)"
