Story no. 61:Rau’fa and hygiene of hands and mouth.
===================================================

Whenever Miss Saleema called her daughter, Rau’fa down for lunch, dinner
or breakfast, Rau’fa first washed her hands with a soap and after
finishing every meal, brushed her teeth.  
 One day, Miss Saleema said to her “Rau’fa, It makes me happy to see you
washing your hands before meals and brushing your teeth after them.
Where did you learn this from?”  
 Rau’fa replied “Our teacher requested us to wash hands before meals and
to brush our teeth after meals.  
 She also said that this is one of the orders in Islam.

Bravo to those teachers who make children aware of the recommended
schedule in Islam.
