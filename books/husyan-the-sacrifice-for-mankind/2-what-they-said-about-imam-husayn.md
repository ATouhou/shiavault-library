What They Said About Imam Husayn
================================

**Charles Dickens**

"If Husayn fought to quench his worldly desires, then I do not
understand why his sisters, wives and children accompanied him. It
stands to reason therefore that he sacrificed purely for Islam."

**Thomas Carlyle**

"The best lesson which we get from the tragedy of Karbala is that
Husayn and his companions were the rigid believers of God. They
illustrated that numerical superiority does not count when it comes to
truth and falsehood.
The victory of Husayn despite his minority marvels me!"

**Dr. K. Sheldrake**

"Husayn marched with his little company not to glory, not to power or
wealth, but to a supreme sacrifice and every member of that gallant
band,male and female, knew that the foes were implacable, were not only
ready to fight but to kill. Denied even water for the children, they
remained parched under a burning sun, amid scorching sands yet no one
faltered for a moment and bravely faced the greatest odds without
flinching."

**Brown**

in his “A Literary History of Persia” writes:

“As a reminder, the blood-stained field of Karbala' where the grandson
of the Apostle of God fell at length, tortured by thirst and surrounded
by the bodies of his murdered kinsmen, has been at any time since then
sufficient to evoke, even in the most lukewarm and heedless, the deepest
emotion, the most frantic grief and the exaltation of spirit before
which pain,danger, and death shrink to unconsidered trifles. Yearly, on
the tenth day of Muharram, the tragedy is rehearsed in Persia, in India,
in Turkey, in Egypt, wherever a Shiite community or colony exists; ...
As I write it all comes back; the wailing chant, the sobbing multitudes,
the white raiment red with blood from self-inflicted wounds, the
intoxication of grief and sympathy.”
