Hajj of Nazr (an offering; to make a spiritual vow)
===================================================

Article 17
----------

Whenever a sane and adult person performs Nazr (make a spiritual vow)
purposely and by free will for performing Hajj, then Hajj is obligatory
for that person. But the Nazr of a wife, if it has a contradiction with
her rights, is not permitted without the permission of her husband, and
if it has no such contradiction then it is in order.

Article 18
----------

Whenever a person does Nazr for performing Hajj and does not specify a
time for that, then this person can delay. However if he/she had
specified the time, then it is obligatory for him/her to perform Hajj in
that specific time and if the person does not perform that purposely
he/she should pay its compensation and perform it in another time as a
precaution.

Article 19
----------

Whenever a person does Nazr for performing Hajj on the condition of
achieving a goal and this person dies before achieving that goal, then
Ghazaa (performing an act in a time other than its proper time for
compensation) of Nazr is not necessary. But if he/she dies after
achieving that goal then his/her heirs should perform Ghazaa of that
Nazr in behalf of that dead person, or take a proxy for him, and as a
precaution it is better to subtract the amount of money for this act
from the main inheritance, with the satisfaction of all heir if they are
all adults.
