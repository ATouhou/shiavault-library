Letter 43
=========

Context Denotes "the Loved one," or the Like.
---------------------------------------------

**Muharram 4, 1330**

May Allah bless your father! You have, indeed, dispelled my doubts and
thus overcome my suspicion, so much so that truth has become manifest.
Nothing remains to say other than the fact that the context of the said
verse denotes the prohibition of taking the infidels for *walis*.

The verses which precede and succeed it testify to this fact, and this
supports the claim that the connotation of the word "wali" in this verse
is the supporter, loved one, friend, or the like; so, what would your
answer be? Kindly state it, Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*S*
