The Religion of the Ancestors of the Prophets & Imams
=====================================================

It must be believed that the fore-fathers of our Holy Prophet and our
Imams have always been Muslims. Not only that but most of them have been
deputies. The reports about Abu Talib's Islam which have come down to us
from the members of the Holy Prophet's House are indisputable and exact.
His life account is also a proof of His Islam.
