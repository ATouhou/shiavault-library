Preface
=======

The present article is the first of two articles written by the author
to show the misrepresentation of certain historical facts and to refute
groundless accusations against the Shiah and in particular the role of
the great philosopher, theologian, astronomer and mathematician Khwajah
Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. The present article, which appeared in the Persian
journal Kayhan-e Andisheh (No. 22), is a study of the allegations
regarding the role of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi in the fall of Baghdad and
the downfall of the Abbasid dynasty at the hands of the Mongol
conqueror, Hulagu Khan.

The second article is concerned with the role of the Shi'i minister of
the Caliph, Ibn Alqami, and allegations regarding the Shi'ah of Iraq in
respect of their role in the fall of the Abbasid caliphate.

It is hoped that such objective studies will help put an end to
inter-sectarian prejudices and contribute to Muslim unity by showing how
baseless allegations and indifference to historical facts had led to
create an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and hostility amongst Muslims
that provided an opportunity to the enemies of Islam and Muslims to
divide Muslims for their own advantage.
