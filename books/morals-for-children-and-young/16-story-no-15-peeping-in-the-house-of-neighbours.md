Story no. 15: Peeping in the house of neighbours
================================================

Nasir was a boy of eleven years. He opened the window of his room and
started looking in their neighbour’s house. Meanwhile, his mother
entered the room and caught his hand rather angrily.  
 Looking at him, she said “My son, don’t you know that staring into
neighbour’s house is a sin?”  
 Nasir who had never known this before replied “No mother, but thank you
for your advice. I will not look into our neighbour’s house again”.

Yes, looking into the house of neighbours without their permission is
not allowed, and what could be more better to pay attention to our
children and not let them look into others houses without their
permission.
