Conclusion
==========

In order to present a kind of theodicy, Muslim philosophers attempt to
provide some solutions for a couple versions of the problem of evil.

The main and the most serious version for them is the problem of "Evil
and Divine Providence".

In order to solve this problem, they first argue in several ways for a
"negative theory" about the nature of evils; that (essential) evil is
nothing but nonexistence and privation. In this step, they meet the
challenge of the "apprehension evil'. Then they come to recognize the
distinction between essential and accidental evils. Considering the
minor (accidental) evil and its necessary partnership with the major
good, they finally argue that this kind of evil enter into Divine decree
only accidentally.

Muslim philosophers also use the advantage of the "negative theory" to
meet a subordinate problem of creation-dualism. According to this
theory, the problem finds an easy reply; since evil is of a
non-existential nature, it does not need to be created or caused at all.
The other minor problem is based on the claim of inconsistency between
Divine wisdom and the reality of apparently futile evils. Muslim
philosophers meet this problem briefly as far as they seek to discover
some universal reasonable purposes and benefits for certain kinds of
evils.
