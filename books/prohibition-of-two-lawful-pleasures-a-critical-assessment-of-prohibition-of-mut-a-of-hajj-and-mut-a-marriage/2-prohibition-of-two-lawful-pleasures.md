Prohibition of Two lawful pleasures
===================================

Umar bin Khattab:
-----------------

Two pleasures were lawful and current during the time of the Holy
Prophet (s). I prohibit those both of them and punish those who commit
them. They are mut'a (pleasure) of hajj and mut'a (temporary)
marriage.[^1]
