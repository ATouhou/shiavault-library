Qunut of Salat al-Witr (in Concise Method)
==========================================

1. Recite the following 70 times:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَسْتَغْفِرُ اللٌّهَ رَبِّي وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيْهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“I seek repentance from Allah, my Lord and to Him I turn back.”*

2. Followed by reciting the following seven times:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَسْتَغْفِرُ اللٌّهَ الَّذِي لاٌ إِلٌهَ إِلاٌّ هُوَ الْحَيُّ
الْقَيُّومُ وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيهِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“I seek repentance from Allah the One whom there is no god except Him,
the Living and Self-Subsisting and to Him I turn back.”*[^1]

3. One of the most important acts in the Qunut of the Salat al-Witr is
supplication for forty believers (men or women) amongst one’s family,
friends, those who have asked to be prayed for, the deceased and the
Shi*\`*a of Amir Al-Mo’minin *\`*Ali ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him).
Whosoever does this will be assured that his supplications are
answered.[^2]

4. One should then say the following three hundred times:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
اَلْعَفْوُ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“I ask for forgiveness.”*

5. Following this, the following should be said once:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
رَبَّ اغْفِرْلِي وَارْحَمْنِي وَتُبْ عَلَيِّ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ التَّوٌابُ
الرَّحِيمِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

*“Lord, please forgive me and have mercy upon me and turn back towards
me. Verily You are the Oft-Turning back, Most Merciful”*[^3]

Please do not forget all of the believers throughout the world in your
Salat al-Layl, especially those downtrodden and oppressed Muslims of
Palestine, Iraq, Kashmir, Chechnya, Bosnia, and all over the globe –
this humble servant of Allah (Glory and Greatness be to Him) as well.

May Allah (Glory and Greatness be to Him) hasten the advent of the 12th
Imam (may Allah hasten his return) to fill this world with justice and
equality.
