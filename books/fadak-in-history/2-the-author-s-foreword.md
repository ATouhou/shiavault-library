the Author’s Foreword
=====================

Dear reader:

 This is a work that I seized the opportunity of one of our holidays in
our splendid university-the University of Holy Najaf-to apply myself to
study one of the Islamic history problems. It was the problem of Fadak
and the historical dispute that took place between Fatima az-Zahra’
(peace be on her) and the first caliph (may Allah be pleased with him).
Many themes and conclusions formed in my mind. I wrote them down on
separate pieces of paper. When I finished studying the documents and the
narrations of the case besides its environments, I found that what was
written on those pieces of paper was fit as draft for a sufficient study
for the case. I began to refine it and organize it into chapters, which
became as a small book. I decided to keep it as a memorandum to refer to
when I would need it. It remained with me for many years as a point of
my intellectual life and as reminder of the date, in which I started to
write it down, until the virtuous Sheikh Muhammad Kadhim al-Kutubi, the
son of Sheikh Sadiq al-Kutubi, asked me to give it to him to print. I
submitted to his wish appreciating his favors on the Arabic and Islamic
library. Here it is now before you.
