Bahlool Goes to the Public Hot Bath
===================================

One day Bahlool went to the public bathhouse, but its servants acted
carelessly and didn't massage him with the sponge. In that regard, when
coming out, Bahlool gave the bath's owner all 10 dinars he had. When the
servants saw his generosity, they got embarrassed as to why they showed
him such carelessness.

The next week Bahlool again went to the hot bath. This time all the
servants gave him a bath with extreme respect and honor, and showed
open-heartedness, but besides all this hard work and effort, Bahlool
gave only one dinar when he came out.

The bath's workers angrily asked, “Last week your unnecessary tip and
what is the reason for today's behavior?”

Bahlool replied, “I paid for today's bath last week when I came and
gave; I am paying for that bath today so that you people will behave
respectfully with your customers.”
