A Glance At The Title Of Saifullah
==================================

Ibn Abbas relates that Holy Prophet (S) said: “Ali Ibn Abi Talib is the
unsheathed sword of Allah[^1] for the enemies of Allah.”[^2] This title
is also exclusive for Ali (a.s.), but the truth is that this cannot be
applied to anyone. It is only for the one who is the victor of Badr,
Uhud, Khandaq, Hunayn and Khaybar.
