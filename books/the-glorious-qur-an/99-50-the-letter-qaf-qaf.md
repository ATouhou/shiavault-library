50: (the Letter) Qaf (qaf)
==========================

This chapter was revealed after {Winds] Sent Forth 77 and before This
Countryside 90. It consists of 45 middle Meccan verses arranged in three
sections, except for V. 38 (III) which dates from the period in Madina.
Some persons recommend that this chapter be recited on Fridays.

Here we begin a fresh group of seven chapters which date from the Meccan
period. This one deals with man's lack of responsibility, God's care for
him (II), and what will happen on Doomsday (II). It ends with
recommendations concerning the times for prayer (III). The illustrations
offered are apocalyptic and intended

to shock disbelievers into thinking about the advantages presented by
Islam.
