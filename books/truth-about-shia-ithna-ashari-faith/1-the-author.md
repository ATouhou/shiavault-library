The Author
==========

The author is a seeker of the truth who tried hard to reach it very
bitterly till Allah guided him to the Straight Path:

***“And [as to] those who strive in Our (cause)! We will certainly guide
them to Our paths” (Qur’an, 29:69)***.

He was born in the Dayr al-Ghusun village on the West Bank [of the
Jordan River] in Occupied Palestine. Having finished his high school, he
made the trip to Jordan where he earned a diploma in engineering
vocations. Then he traveled to the Phillippines where he earned his B.A.
in Civil Engineering then his Masters in Construction Management. He is
about to earn his Ph.D. in Governmental Administration as soon as he
finishes his research about Islamic Public Administration.
