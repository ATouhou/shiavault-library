Maytham al-Tammar
=================

Maytham al-Tammar was a good man. He was one of Imam Ali's companions.
From the Imam's knowledge, he learnt a lot.

Maytham al-Tammar was in the same prison with Mukhtar . One-day Mukhtar
said to him:

*Ubaidullah bin Ziyad, the unjust man, has killed the grandson of
Allah's Apostle. Now he will kill us!*

Maytham al-Tammar said:

*My dear Ali has said to me:*

*They will tie you to a date palm trunk.*

*Then they will kill you.*

*They will release Mukhtar from prison. He will kill the unjust tyrant.
He will kick his face with his leg.*
