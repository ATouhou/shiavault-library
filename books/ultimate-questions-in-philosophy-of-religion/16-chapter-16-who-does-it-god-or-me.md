Chapter 16: Who does it? God Or Me!
===================================

Monotheism in the Work of Allah
-------------------------------

The third aspect of monotheism is monotheism in the work of God. Unity
of the work of God means to recognize that the world with all its
systems, ways, causes and effects is the work of Allah alone and is
originated from His will. Nothing in the world is self-existing
including any action or work. There is no movement, effect or force, but
does lead to Him the Almighty. If fire burns, if water grows the
vegetable, its all because God has empowered them through certain laws
in the nature. Hence, they are all in constant need of Allah in their
existence as well as their functionality.

**Q.** Does this mean when the fire burns it is not really the fire
which burns, its rather God? Doesn't this lead to the denotation of the
law of cause and effect?

How can one believe in unity of God in action and at the same time
believe in the law of cause and effect?

When prophet Ibrahim as Quran is quoting says:

***“And when I am ill, it is He who heals me.”*** [^1]

Is it Allah who heals or it is the medicine?

[^1]: Refer to ayah 26:80
