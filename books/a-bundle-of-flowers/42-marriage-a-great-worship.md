Marriage, a Great Worship
=========================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "A two rak'at prayer that a married person
establishes is worthier than when a bachelor keeps up prayers at nights
and fasts during the days.

Man La Yahduruhul Faqih, vol. 3, p. 384

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "The sleep of a married person is better with
Allah than an unmarried one who fasts during the day and keeps vigil at
night, establishing prayers."

Bihar ul Anwar, vol. 103, p. 221

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "(Mostly) the doers of good of my Ummah are
the married ones, while the vicious of them are unmarried."

Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 103, p. 221

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "Once a man came to my father. He (‘a) asked
him whether he had a wife and he answered he had not. Then, my father
said that he would not like to possess the world and what it includes
but sleep one night without having a wife. Then he (‘a) added that the
two rak'at prayer established by a married man is worthier than that an
unmarried man keeps vigil at night praying and fasts during the day.
After that, he (‘a) gave him seven golden coins (Dinar) and told him to
marry with that."
