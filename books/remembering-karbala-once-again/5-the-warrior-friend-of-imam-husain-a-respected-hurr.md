The Warrior Friend of Imam Husain (‘a) Respected Hurr
=====================================================

("Run mein jab Shah Id taraf se Hurr‑a Deendaar Aaya")

When Hurr left the camp of the Noble Prince

And came to battle His enemies thence

A murmur rippled through Yazid's camp

"Here comes a friend of Hyder's clan"

"A strange light lights up his path

As though angels in his company he hath"

Hearing this, the son of Saad cried

"Rain arrows and spears with a measured tide"

The army geared for a massive attack

And the lone soldier held his spear by his side

Seeing Hurr tremble with rage and might

The murderers scurried like rats in the night

Abbas applauded Hurr's battle skills

And Akbar admired, standing still

Qasim cried often "Bravo dear Hurr"

And the Noble Prince himself would smile

Listening to the applause from his Master's camp

Hurr would smile and bow at every chance

Alas as he bowed, the army slacked

And assailed the soldier from behind his back

And thousands surrounded the lonely Hurr

As he braced, the massive army attacked

Close by his heart he felt a spear

And he sensed that Death was very near

The arrows poured at his lurching chest

He doubled over seeking some rest

Watching Hurr's state, Alder cried

"May I go my Master to save our guest?"

"The devoted servant of Zahra and Ali

Now falls to the ground without a plea"

The Noble Prince seeing Hurr's plight

wept with sorrow at the sight

And replied to Akbar "Not you my son"

" I will be the one to go by his side"

"To whom can I express the sorrow I bear?

He is my guest and I must take his care"

Saying this Shabeer then mounted His horse

In a glimpse the battlefield He crossed

There Hurr fell on the scorching sand

And the Prince found him breathing his last

He held His guest and wept in pain

And watched Hurr rub his heels in the sand

He wiped Hurr's brow and held him close

And watched in misery as the blood flowed

And cried "Your wounds have broken my back"

"Yet another friend I've lost in my woes"

"You fell to the ground but didn't call for help

Come open your eyes my brother, my friend"

Hut opened his bruised and bloodied eyes

Saw the glorious face of the Prince in sight

Saw his head cradled in the Prince's lap

And smiled at his fortune and in delight

The Prince then asked "What do you sees"

Hurr replied "The heavens have opened to me'

“I see angels descend from the skies for me

Even in Death's face, a love I can see

Here comes Hyder Oh my good fortune!

I see Shabbar with him, boundless is my glee!"

"I see Muhammad’s Daughter bareheaded in grief

And Muhammad Himself comes to me receive"

Then Hurr's face contorted in pain

He looked at Husain and whispered His name

And the Prince cried "So you depart my friend"

Hurr's soul departed and his body went limp

Even in death his glance toward Husain

A smile on his lips, forgotten the pain.
