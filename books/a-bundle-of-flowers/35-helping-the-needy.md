Helping the Needy
=================

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Ask (questions from) the learned, speak with
the wise, and associate with the poor."

Tuhaf-ul-'Uqul, p. 34

Imam Amir-ul-Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) said: "The cause of the cessation of
(one's) wealth is leaving the needy heedless."

Ghurar-ul-Hikam, vol. 4, p. 190

Imam Amir-ul-Mu'mineen ‘Ali (‘a) said: "The Holy Prophet (S) narrated
from Allah, the Exalted, on the night of ascent, Who said: 'O' Ahmad, My
love is the loving of the poor. Bring the poor nearer to yourself and
situate them close to yourself in order that I approach you..."

Al-Hayat, vol. 2, p. 51

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "Whoever satiates a hungry believer so that the
one is satisfied fully, neither a human being among people nor a
near-stationed angel nor a divine Messenger knows how great his reward
is in the Hereafter except Allah, the Lord of the Worlds." Then, he
added: "Feeding a hungry Muslim is from among the means of forgiveness."
After that he recited the word of Allah, Almighty and Glorious: "Or the
feeding on a day of hunger, of an orphan near of kin, or to the indigent
(down) in the dust." (Sura Balad, No. 90, verses 14 to 16).
