Ghadir Khum (part 1 of 3)
=========================

In this year, Thursday, May 18, 1995 coincides with the 18th of Dhul-
Hajjah, the anniversary of the event of Ghadir Khum where the Messenger
of Allah delivered his LAST sermon. The greatest parallel/frequent
(Mutawatir) tradition in the History of Islam is related to this sermon
of the Prophet (PBUH&HF).

Please see Part 3 for a complete list of 110 companions of Prophet who
narrated this tradition, as well as classified lists of the Sunni
traditionists/historians/commentators of Quran who confirmed this
tradition to be authentic and frequent, and their corresponding books
where the tradition can be found. Also in Part 2 we discuss the meanings
of WALI, MAWLA, and WILAYAH.

**The Farewell Pilgrimage**

Ten years after the migration, the Messenger of Allah ordered to his
close followers to call all the people in different places to join him
in his last pilgrimage. On this pilgrimage he taught them how to perform
the pilgrimage in a correct and unified form.

This was first time that the Muslims with this magnitude gathered in
one place in the presence of their leader, the Messenger of Allah. On
his way to Mecca, more than seventy thousand people followed Prophet
(PBUH&HF). On the fourth day of Dhul-Hajjah more than one hundred
thousand Muslims had entered Mecca.

**Revelation of Verse 5:67**

On the 18th of Dhul-Hajjah, after completing his last pilgrimage
(Hajjatul- Widaa), Prophet was leaving Mecca toward Medina, where he and
the crowd of people reached to a place called Ghadir Khum (which is
close to today's Juhfah). It was a place where people from different
provinces should say Good bye to each other and take different routes
for their home. In this place, the following verse was revealed:

"O Apostle! Deliver what has been sent down to you from your Lord; and
if you don't do it, you have not delivered His message (at all); and
Allah will protect you from the people ..." (Quran 5:67).

Some of Sunni references confirming that the revelation of the above
verse of Quran was right before the speech of Prophet in Ghadir Khum:

(1) Tafsir al-Kabir, by Fakhr al-Razi, under commentary of verse 5:67,
v12, pp 49-50, narrated on the authorities of Ibn Abbas, al-Bara Ibn
Azib, and Muhammad Ibn Ali.
(2) Asbab al-Nuzool, by al-Wahidi, p50, narrated on the authorities of
Atiyyah and Abu Sa'id al Khudri.
(3) Nuzul al-Quran, by al-Hafiz Abu Nu'aym narrated on the authorities
Abu Sa'id Khudri and Abu Rafi.
(4) al-Fusool al Muhimmah, by Ibn Sabbagh al-Maliki al-Makki, p24
(5) Durr al-Manthur, by al-Hafiz al-Suyuti, under commentary of verse
5:67
(6) Fathul Qadir, by al-Shawkani, under commentary of verse 5:67
(7) Fathul Bayan, by Hasan Khan, under commentary of verse 5:67
(8) Shaykh Muhi al-Din al-Nawawi, under commentary of verse 5:67
(9) al-Sirah al-Halabiyah, by Noor al-Din al-Halabi, v3, p301
(10) Umdatul Qari fi Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari, by al-Ayni
(11) Tafsir al-Nisaboori, v6, p194
(12) and many more such as Ibn Mardawayh, etc...

The last sentence in the above verse indicates that the Prophet
(PBUH&HF) was mindful of the reaction of his people in delivering that
message but Allah informs him not to worry, for He will protect His
Messenger from people.

**The Speech**

Upon receiving the verse, the Prophet (PBUH&HF) stopped on that place
(the pond of Khum) which was extremely hot. Then he sent for all people
who have been ahead in the way, to come back and waited until all
pilgrims who fell behind, arrived and gathered. He ordered Salman (RA)
to use rocks and camel toolings to make a pulpit (minbar) so he could
make his announcement.

It was around noon time in the first of the Fall, and due to the
extreme heat in that valley, people were wrapping their robes around
their feet and legs, and were sitting around the pulpit, on the hot
rocks.

On this day the Messenger of Allah spent approximately five ours in
this place; three hours of which he was on the pulpit. He recited nearly
one hundred verses from The Glorious Quran, and for seventy three times
reminded and warned people of their deeds and future. Then he gave them
a long speech. The following is a part of his speech which has been
widely narrated by the Sunni traditionists:

The Messenger of Allah declared: "It seems the time approached when I
shall be called away (by Allah) and I shall answer that call. I am
leaving for you two precious things and if you adhere both of them, you
will never go astray after me. They are the Book of Allah and my
progeny, that is my Ahlul-Bayt. The two shall never separate from each
other until they come to me by the Pool (of Paradise)."

Then the Messenger of Allah continued: "Do I not have more right over
the believers than what they have over themselves?" People cried and
answered: "Yes, O' Messenger of God." Then Prophet (PBUH) held up the
hand of Ali and said: "Whoever I am his leader (Mawla), Ali is his
leader (Mawla). O' God, love those who love him, and be hostile to those
who are hostile to him."

**Revelation of Verse 5:3**

Immediately after the Prophet (PBUH&HF) finished his speech, the
following verse of Holy Quran was revealed:

"Today I have perfected your religion and completed my bounty upon you,
and I was satisfied that Islam be your religion." (Quran 5:3)

Some of Sunni references which mentioned the revelation of the above
verse of Quran in Ghadir Khum after the speech of the Prophet:

(1) al-Durr al-Manthur, by al-Hafiz Jalaluddin al-Suyuti, v3, p19
(2) Tarikh, by Khatib al-Baghdadi, v8, pp 290,596 from Abu Hurayra
(3) Manaqaib, by Ibn Maghazali, p19
(4) History of Damascus, Ibn Asakir, v2, p75
(5) al-Itqan, by al-Suyuti, v1, p13
(6) Manaqib, by Khawarazmi al-Hanfi, p80
(7) al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah, by Ibn Kathir, v3, p213
(8) Yanabi' al-Mawaddah, by al-Qudoozi al-Hanafi, p115
(9) Nuzul al-Quran, by al-Hafiz Abu Nu'aym narrated on the authority
Abu Sa'id Khudri.

... and more.

The above verse clearly indicates that Islam without clearing up matter
of leadership after Prophet was not complete, and completion of religion
was due to announcement of Prophet's immediate successor.
