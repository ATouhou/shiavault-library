The Sermon at a Glance
======================

As it has been mentioned in the discussion concerning the transmission
of this sermon (as seen below), Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) delivered this sermon
after The Battle of the Camel (Al-Jamal) which took place in Baŝrah
(Iraq) in the year 656 ce/35 ah and the subsequent defeat of the army of
‘A’ysha b. Abi Bakr.

In this sermon, he reproaches women, and of course the meaning of him
‘reproaching women’ are only those types of women who had launched (such
calculated) attacks - those who were responsible for instigating The
Battle of the Camel. Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) referred to such women as having a
“deficiency” and it was because of this shortcoming that they engaged in
such detrimental activities. Therefore, he reprimanded them and warned
the believers to steer clear of their inductions.
