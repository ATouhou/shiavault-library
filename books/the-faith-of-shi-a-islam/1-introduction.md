Introduction

**1. Doctrine of the Necessity for Seeking Knowledge
**
We believe that Allah has endowed us with the faculty of the intellect
('aql), and that He has ordered us to ponder over His Creation, noting
with care the signs of His Power and His Glory throughout the entire
universe as well as within ourselves. It is stated in the Qur'an:

We shall show them Our signs on the horizons and in themselves,
till it is clear to them that it is the Truth. (41;53)

Allah has shown His disapproval of those who blindly follow the ways of
those who were before them:

They say "No, but we will follow such things as we found our father
doing."
What! And if their fathers had no understanding of anything. (2;170)

and he has shown his dislike for those who follow nothing but their own
personal whims:

They follow naught but an opinion. (6;117)

Indeed, our intellect forces us to reflect upon Creation so as to know
the Creator of the universe, just as it makes it necessary for us to
examine the claims of someone to prophethood and to consider the truth
of his miracles. It is not correct to accept the ideas of someone
without criticism, even if that person has the gift of great knowledge
or holds an esteemed position.

The reason that the Qur'an has urged us to reflect upon Creation and to
study the natural world and acquire knowledge is so that it may confirm
in us mankind's instinctual freedom of thought upon which all sages are
in agreement, in order that the power of human understanding and
thinking may be so enlightened that it may fulfil the function for which
it was created.

Thus it is wrong for a man to neglect the fundamentals of his faith and
to put his confidence in what his instructors or other persons have said
to him. On the contrary, it is necessary for him, on account of his
natural intelligence as confirmed in the Qur'an, to search for, examine
and come to a clear understanding of the fundamentals of his religion
(usul ad-din), the most important of which (in Islam) are the Oneness of
God (tawhid), Prophecy (nubuwwah), the Imamate (imamah) and the
Resurrection (ma'ad). One who follows the dictates of his forebears or
any other person in these matters has, in truth, committed an error and
has wandered from the straight path, and there can be no excuse for such
an action.

In short, there are two points:

(a) that it is necessary to examine and understand the fundamentals of
our beliefs and not to follow what anyone else might say,
(b) that this is a requirement that stems from reason, and not one that
we must accept from the religion (i.e. such knowledge is not only to be
gained from religious texts, even if, as we have seen, it is confirmed
there, but it is also to be obtained through the exercise of the
intellect). The meaning of a requirement that stems from reason' is that
reason enjoins us to acquire such knowledge and to examine these matters
for ourselves.

**2. Doctrine of the Necessity for Imitation (taqlid)
**
in the Various Branches of the Religion (furu' ad- din)

By the branches of the religion we mean those religious laws which
govern our actions (shari'ah), but concerning which not everyone is
required to exercise juristic reasoning (ijtihad). However, it is the
duty of everyone to take one of the three following ways in regard to
them:

(a) he should exert himself in study until he becomes a mujtahid,
(b) he should exercise juristic precaution (ihtiyat) if he is able
to,
(c) he should follow one who is a recognised mujtahid, who must be a
man of wisdom and justice, "who keeps himself from sin, not following
the dictates of his own desires, but obeying the commands of Allah."

It follows that one who is neither a mujtahid, nor exercises ihtiyat,
nor follows a mujtahid, does all the actions of his din in vain, and
that neither his prayer nor his fasting will be accepted by Allah, even
though he has carried out his duties in these matters for the whole of
his life; unless he begins to follow a mujtahid, in which case, those of
his actions prior to his following the mujtahid which were done for the
sake of Allah will be accepted.

**3. Doctrine of the Necessity for Juristic Reasoning
**
We believe that ijtihad in matters of religion is a sufficient
necessity (wajib al-kifa'i) for all Muslims in the absence of the Imam,
that is to say that should one of them become proficient in ijtihad and
become a mujtahid it is enough for them to follow the mujtahid in all
the branches of the religion.

All Muslims must strive to gain knowledge and to ascend to the position
of mujtahid or, if that is not possible, they must give all their
encouragement to one of their number to attain this position. If no-one
living holds the position of mujtahid, it is not permissible to follow a
dead mujtahid.

Ijtihad is the examination of the sources of the shari'ah to reach
knowledge of the commandments (al-ahkamm al-far'iyyyah) which the
Prophet brought with him. and which .do not change or alter with changes
in time or situation. according to the hadith:

What Muhammad (S.A.) made halal will be halal till the Day of
Judgement, and what he made haram will be haram till the Day of
Judgement.

These sources for the shari'ah are the Qur'an, the sunnah (of the
Prophet and the Imams), consensus (ijma') and reasoning ('aql), as have
been mentioned in the texts of usul al-fiqh. Attaining the position of
mujtahid requires many years of study and acquiring knowledge, and this
is not obtained except by one who tries his utmost.

**4. Doctrine Concerning the Position of mujtahid
**
We believe that a fully qualified mujtahid is a representative of the
Imam, in the case of the latter's absence. Thus he is an authority over
Muslims and he performs the functions of the Imam as regards judgement
and administration among the people. Because of this, Imam Ja'far as
Sadiq said:

To deny the authority of a mujtahid is to deny the authority of the
Imam, and to deny tile authority of the Imam is to make an objection to
the authority of Allah. and this is tantamount to polytheism (shirk).

Therefore the qualified mujtahid is not only one who issues fatwas, but
he also has general authority over Muslims who must consult him if they
require judgement, this being obtainable only from him. It is
correspondingly wrong for anyone to give judgement except him or one who
is appointed by him, as no-one can pass sentence without his permission.
Also, all that which belongs to the Imam should be given to the
mujtahid.

Such authority has been bestowed upon the qualified mujtahid by the
Imam so that he may represent him in his absence; hence he is known as
the representative of the Imam (na' ib al-imam).
