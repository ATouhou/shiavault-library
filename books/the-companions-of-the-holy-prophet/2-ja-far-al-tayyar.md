Ja'far Al-tayyar
================

**The Beginning
**
Abu Talib, Shaikh al-Bat-ha, missed his nephew our Master Muhammad [s].
So, he went to look for him. He was not alone. His son Ja'far aged
twenty was with him. Shaikh al-Bat-ha and his son went to the hills near
Makkah. They found him there.

Our Master Muhammad [s] was praying humbly. Ali, the young man of
Islam, was praying on his right. They were not afraid of anyone but
Allah. They were praying for Allah, the Creator of the skies and the
earth, the Creator of creatures.

While they were praying, their number was a pitiful sight. Abu Talib
turned to his son and said: Join your cousin's wing

Namely, stand on his left hand, for Ali has stood on his right hand.
The bird can't fly but with two wings. This means that Abu Talib, the
Prophet's uncle, did not want our Master Muhammad [s] to stay with one
wing. Since then, Ja'far's name has appeared in the bright history of
Islam.

Ja'far bin Abu Talib was born about 25 years after the Year of the
Elephant. He was 10 years older than his brother Ali. He was about 20
years younger than our Master Muhammad [s].

Ja'far bin Abu Talib looked like our Master Muhammad [s]. He lived with
his cousin al-Abbas. Abu Talib had a big family. Our Master Muhammad [s]
wanted to relieve his worries. So, he took Ali to his house. Al-Abbas
took Ja'far to his house.

The light of Islam illuminated the sky of Makkah. Our Master Muhammad
[s] invited the bewildered to the New Light. He invited the defeated and
the oppressed to the religion of salvation and freedom. He invited the
drowning in the darkness of ignorance to the light of Islam.

But the Quraishi tyrants did not listen to the voice of Islam and the
Call of the Sky. So, they began fighting our Master Muhammad [s] and
those who believed in him. They wreaked their wrath upon the weak
Muslims. They whipped Bilal al-Habashy, Summayya, Yasir, and other
Muslims. They whipped them for no sin but because they said: Our Lord is
Allah.

**The Immigration to Habasha
**
One night the Muslims met Allah's Apostle. He was sad to hear that the
Muslims were suffering from torture So, he said to them: There's a just
King in Habasha. Immigrate to his country. Stay there till Allah drives
away your worries.

The idea of immigration shone in the believers' hearts as the sun shone
to fill the earth with light and warmth.

At midnight, a small group crept into the land of Habasha (Ethiopia),
via the Red Sea. The Muslim immigrants stayed there.

In the meantime, the Quraish increased their torture against the
Muslims who stayed in Makkah. So, they were in a fix.

At that critical time, our Master Muhammad [s] ordered his cousin
Ja'far to lead a bigger group of Muslims to Habasha.

The number of the new group was over 80 Muslims. Ja'far began leading
the immigrating caravan towards the coasts of the sea.

The sea was calm. The wind was gentle. The immigrants reached the
coasts of the sea. Allah, the Almighty, wanted a ship to pass by them.
The ship was going from Jeddah to Habasha. Ja'far asked her Captain to
take them there. The Captain accepted.

The ship set out plowing the sea. The Muslims thanked Allah, who turned
their fear into safety to worship Him only.

Ja'far himself was visiting the immigrants, especially the children.
His wife Asmaa bint Umayys was visiting the women.

Days and nights passed. The ship anchored at the coasts of Habasha. The
Muslims reached the land where our Master Muhammad [s] had ordered them
to immigrate.

The Muslims were always praying to Allah freely. No one prevented them
from that. During their prayers, they were always asking Allah to grant
our Master Muhammad [s] and his Muslim brothers victory over the unjust
Quraishi tyrants.

But the news that reached them was sorrowful. Yasir and Summayyah
became martyrs under torture, They were in pain to hear about the
torture that was happening to their brothers. But they firmly increased
their belief.

**In Makkah
**
Abu Jahal, who had a spite against our Master Muhammad [s], was always
planning to destroy Allah's religion. He wanted to put out the candle of
Islam so that people would live in darkness and ignorance.

But Allah's religion spread as the scent of roses did. It made
happiness enter hearts as spring did.

One day, the Quraishi leaders held a meeting in Darul Nadwa. They were
thinking about a way to extinguish the light of Islam. Umayyah said:
I'll make Bilal a lesson for slaves so that they'll not think about
entering Muhammad's religion.

Abu Jahal said: We'll go on banning Bani Hashim till they die of hunger
or they give us Muhammad to kill him.

Abu Sufyan said: But what shall we do for those who escape from Makkah
and go to Habasha?

Abu Jahal said: We'll bring them back.

How?

We'll send our friend al-Najashy lots of gifts. So, he'll accept our
request.

Who will go?

We'll send a clever man to negotiate with al-Najashy.

After several weeks, they decided to send a delegation to bring back
the runaway persons.

In al-Najashy's Presence

In the morning, Amru bin al-Ass and Amarah bin al-Waleed headed for the
sea holding gifts to al-Najashy, the King of Habasha.

The delegates crossed the sea with a ship. They reached the land of
Habasha. They came to the King's palace.

Amru bin al-Ass said to the guards of the palace: We're the Quraishi
delegates holding gifts to the King.

Al-Najashy greeted the delegates and accepted the gifts of the Quraish.
The priests received their gifts, too. The King asked them about the
purpose of their visit.

The delegates said: Some foolish persons have taken refuge in the land
of Habasha. They've abandoned their fathers' and grandfathers' religion.
They haven't accepted the King's religion. Rather; they've brought a new
religion. Neither you nor we have known it. We, the Quraishi noblemen,
have come to bring them back and to educate them.

The King of Habasha was just and wise man. So, he said: How can I hand
you the people who have chosen my country and asked me for help? But
I'll ask them some questions. If their thoughts are corrupt; if they are
deviated, I'd hand them to you. Otherwise, I'd leave them to live in my
country.

Al-Najashy sent for the immigrants. They came. Ja'far bin Abu Talib was
in advance. They came into the palace and stood in front of the King.

The Habashian people bowed when they met the King. So the Habashian and
the delegates bowed to the King. The Muslims did not bow; their heads
remained high raised.

Al-Najashy asked the Muslims: Why don't you bow to me?

Ja'far answered: We don't bow to anyone but Allah.

The King said: What do you mean?

Ja'far answered: Your Majesty; the King, Allah has sent us an Apostle.
The Apostle has ordered us not to bow to anyone but Allah. He has also
ordered us to pray and to pay zakat.

Amru bin al-Ass said evilly: They're breaking the King's religion!

Al-Najashy asked him to keep silent; and asked Ja'far to go on. Ja'far
politely said:

Your Majesty, the King, we were ignorant people. We worshipped the
idols. We ate dead animals. We did bad actions and abandoned our
relatives. We mistreated our neighbors. The strong oppressed the weak.
So Allah has sent us an Apostle. We know his ancestors and his
truthfulness. We know that he is pure and trustworthy So, he has invited
us to worship the Only Allah. He has ordered us to avoid what we and our
fathers had worshipped. He has ordered us to be truthful and to give the
trusts to their owners. He has ordered us to visit our relatives, to be
good neighbors, to stop bad actions and shedding blood. He has prevented
us from atrocities, falsehood taking the orphan's money and speaking
evil of the married women. He has ordered us to worship Allah only and
not to be polytheists. He has ordered us to pray, to give alms, and to
fast.

Your majesty; the king, we've believed him and followed what he has
brought from Allah. So, we've worshipped Allah only- we're not
polytheists.

But our people have aggressed against us. They've tortured us. They've
prevented us from our religion to worship the idols again.

After they had persecuted us, we came to your country. We've preferred
you to others. We want to live in your country. Thus, your majesty, the
king, we ask you to treat us justly.

Al-Najashy said politely: Have you anything of what your Prophet has
brought?

Ja'far politely said: Yes.

Al-Najashy said: Read me something.

Ja'far began reading some verses of the Chapter of Maryam:

And mention Maryam in the Book when she drew aside from her family to
an eastern place. So, she took a veil (to screen herself) from them;
then We sent to her Our Spirit, and there appeared to her a well-made
man. She said: Surely I fly for refuge from you to the Beneficent God,
if you are one guarding (against evil). He said: I am only a messenger
of your Lord: That I will give you a pure boy. She said: When shall I
have a boy and no mortal has yet touched me, nor have I been unchaste?
He said: Even so; your lord says: It is easy to me: and that We may make
him a sign to men and a mercy from us; and it is a matter which has been
decreed. So, she conceived him; then withdrew herself with a remote
place and the throes (of childbirth) compelled her to take herself to
the trunk of a palm tree. She said: Oh, would that I had died before
this, and had been a thing quite forgotten! Then (the child called out
to her from beneath her): Grieve not, surely your lord has made a stream
to flow beneath you. And shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree,
it will drop on you fresh ripe dates. So, eat and drink and refresh the
eye. Then if you see any mortal, say: Surely I have vowed a fast to the
Beneficent God, so I shall not speak to any man today and she came to
her people with him, carrying him (with her). They said: 0 Maryam!
Surely you have done a strange thing. O Sister of Haroon! Your father
was not a bad man, nor was your mother an unchaste woman.

Al-Najashy wept. His tears flowed on his cheeks. The priests and the
monks wept humbly, too. Ja'far's voice was flowing humbly:

But she pointed to him. They said: How should we speak to one who was a
child in the cradle? He said: Surely I am Allah's servant; he has given
me the Book and made me a prophet, and has made me blessed wherever I
may be, and he has enjoined on me prayer and poor-rate so long as I live
and dutiful to my mother; and he has not made me insolent, unblessed and
peace be on me on the day I was born, and on the day I die, and on the
day I am raised to life .

Al-Najashy stood up for Allah's Words and said humbly: Certainly this
and what 'Isa had brought come out of one niche.

He turned to the Quraishi delegates and said angrily: I won't hand them
to you and I'll defend them.

Then he ordered his soldiers to dismiss the delegation and to return
the gifts to them. He said: They are bribes. I don't want to be
bribed.

He turned to Ja'far and his Muslim group and said: You're welcome; Your
Prophet is welcome. I admit that he is the Apostle whom 'Isa bin Maryam
had given good news about. Live wherever you like in my country.

Al-Najashy wanted to know something about the manners of Islam. He
asked Ja'far: How do you greet each other?

Our greeting is to say Assalamu Alaikum.

**Another Plot
**
On the following day Amru bin al-Ass and Amarah decided to go to the
King's Palace. On their way, Amru bin al-Ass said to Amarah: This time,
I,ll get my revenge on Ja'far. I'll tell the kings that the Muslims have
another idea about 'Isa.

Again the delegates came to al-Najashy and said: Your majesty; the
king, the Muslims say that 'Isa is a slave.

Al-Najashy kept silent for a while then he said to the guard:Go to
Ja'far to hear his point of view

Ja'far came and greeted the King and said: Assalamu Alaikum.

The King asked him: What's your point of view about 'Isa?

Ja'far answered calmly: We say as Allah and His Apostle have said about
him.

The King asked him: What's your Prophet said?

Ja'far answered calmly: He's Allah's slave, His Apostle, His Spirit,
His Word that He has given to the chaste, virgin Maryam.

Al-Najashy kept silent for a while, then he drew a line on the ground
with his stick. So, he said: Go to your friends. You're safe in my
country.

Again the delegates' plot came to nothing. The delegates hopelessly
came back to Makkah. Since that meeting, the Muslims had been happy in
the land of the just King.

Our Master Muhammad [s] and the Muslims rejoiced at Ja'far's victory
and his stay in Habasha.

**The Good Stay
**
Days, months, and years passed.

Ja'far and the Muslims heard news. When they heard good news, they
became happy. When they heard bad news, they became sad.

They became happy when the ban the Quraish imposed on Banu Hashim was
over.

They became sad when they heard about the death of Abu Talib, the
protector of the Prophet [s] and Khadijah's death, our Master Muhammad's
wife, who stood by him and spent her wealth for Islam.

The Muslims in Habasha heard about our Master Muhammad's migration to
Madina and the establishment of the first Islamic State, where the flag
of monotheism was hoisted. They were filled with happiness.

The news of the decisive Battle of Badr, and the victory of Islam over
polytheism and idols arrived to them. They heard about the news of the
Battle of Uhud. They were sad to hear about the Prophet's wounds in the
battle.

They were happy to hear the news of the Muslims' victories over the
polytheists and the Jews. Their happiness was great when they heard
about the Prophet's letters to the Kings all over the world.

The Prophet [s] sent letters to Hercules, the Emperor of Rome, Kossra,
the King of Iran, and al-Mokawkas, the Pharaoh of Egypt.

A letter to al-Najashy

Amru bin Umayyah al-Dhimry our Master Muhammad's delegate, arrived in
Habasha carrying the letter of the Prophet of Islam.

The letter read:

From Muhammad, Allah's Apostle

To al-Najashy the King of Habasha

You are safe.

I thank Allah. There is no god but Him, the King, the Holy, the Peace,
the Believer; the Almighty.

I bear witness that 'Isa is Allah's Spirit, and His word He has given
to Maryam, the Virgin, the good, and the chaste. Allah created him with
His power as He created Adam before.

I am inviting you to worship Allah only, to obey Him, to follow me, and
to believe in what has come to me. I am Allah's Apostle. I am inviting
you and your soldiers to worship Allah, the Almighty. I have told and
advised you. So, accept my advice.

And peace upon him who follows guidance.

Ja'far accompanied our Master Muhammad's delegate on his going to
al-Najashy's palace. First they greeted the King of Habasha. Then he
received the Prophet's letter respectfully.

Al-Najashy read the letter. He came down the throne and sat on the
ground to show his humbleness and respect for Allah's Apostle, our
Master Muhammad [s].

Al-Najashy put the letter on his eye to show his great respect. Then he
ordered his guards to get him an ivory box to put the letter in. He
said:

Habasha will be prosperous as long as its people keeps this letter.

The Prophet's delegate gave the King another letter. The letter asked
the King to allow the immigrants headed by Ja'far bin Abu Talib to come
back to their country.

The Muslims were very happy to hear about their repatriation to their
homeland. In the meantime, they thanked al-Najashy for his good
hospitality.

Al-Najashy ordered his guards to prepare some ships to bring back the
immigrants to the land of al-Hejaz. He sent his representative with
them.

The representative was carrying gifts and a letter of greetings to our
Master Muhammad [s].

The sails of the ships were raised to start journey, the Muslims set
off. They rejoiced at Allah's victory.

The Conquest of Khaibar

In al-Madina al-Munawwara, the army of Islam was getting ready to
advance towards the strongholds of the Jewish Khaibar.

The Jews of Khaibar were always plotting to put out the light of Islam.
They were always encouraging the Arab tribes to invade Madina to destroy
the new Muslim State.

So, our Master Muhammad [s] decided to uproot the danger of the Jews so
that people would live in peace. The Muslim forces reached the road that
joined the tribes of Ghatfan and the strongholds of Khaibar to surprise
the enemy there.

The number of the Muslim Army amounted to one thousand and four-hundred
fighters. Two hundred horse riders were with them. The Muslim women took
part in the battle, too.

The Muslims advanced towards the strongholds. At dawn, they surprised
the Jews and besieged them completely.

Some Companions launched strong attacks against the Jews. But they were
in vain because the Jews faced them with a lot of arrows. The Jews were
sneering at our Master Muhammad [s] and his soldiers.

So, the Prophet [s] said: Tomorrow; I'll give the banner to a man. The
man loves Allah and his Apostle; Allah and His Apostle love him.

In the morning, some companions wished that the banner would be for
them. But our Master Muhammad [s] asked Ali, Ja'far's brother.

Ali shook the banner strongly and advanced towards the strongholds of
the Jews. When Ali killed Marhab, the hero of the Jews, they felt fear.
Quickly, the Muslims occupied the strongholds of Khaibar, one by one.

Our Master Muhammad [s] and the Muslims were filled with happiness. So,
they thanked Allah for the victory over their enemies.

In the meantime, the immigrants of Habasha headed by Ja'far bin Abu
Talib arrived. Our Master Muhammad's happiness doubled. So, he said with
a bright smile on his face:

I don't know which event is more cheerful - Ja'far's coming or the
Conquest of Khaibar!

Our Master Muhammad [s] embraced his cousin Ja'far and kissed his
forehead and said:

Certainly Ja'far and his friends have two immigrations - an immigration
to Habasha and an immigration to al-Madina al-Munawwara.

**The Battle of Mautah
**
Our Master Muhammad [s] had sent a messenger to the ruler of Busra, a
town in Sham. But the messenger was captured and executed in the land of
Mautah. This action was against the humanitarian morals.

The Prophet [s] felt sadness. So, he ordered the Muslims to get ready
to make an attack to punish the killers.

In the month of Jamadil-Ula, the second year after the blessed
immigration, three thousand fighters went to take part in the battle.
The Prophet's advice was lightening their way:

I advise you to fear Allah. Invade in the Name of Allah. So, fight
Allah's enemy and your enemy. You'll find lonely men in the cells. So,
don't fight them. Don't kill a woman or a child. Don't cut down a tree.
Don't demolish a building.

Our Master Muhammad [s] appointed Zaid bin Haritha leader to the Muslim
Army. The Prophet said:

If Zaid was martyred, the leader would be Ja'far bin Abu Talib. If
Ja'far was martyred, the leader would be Abdulah bin Rawaha.

The news of the Muslims' attack reached the Romans. So, they
established an army. The army was composed of the Romans and the allied
Arab tribes. The number of their forces was two hundred thousand
soldiers. The armies gathered at the land of al-Balqaa.

The first clash took place between the two armies at the Village of
Masharif near al-Balqaa. The mastery of the Romans appeared in the
battle because they had a big army. Hercules, the Emperor of Rome, gave
the general leadership to his brother Tyodor.

The Muslim Army, though few in number, chose the land of Mautah to be
the theater for the war operations because the elevations of the land
were suitable for the Muslims to protect themselves against the Roman
Colossal Army.

Zaid bin Haritha got ready for the start of the battle. He strongly
shook the banner of the Muslim Army and rushed towards the core of the
enemy. His rushing made the Muslim forces start the battle with
enthusiasm.

Strong fights took place. Spears tore Zaid's body. So, he fell on to
the ground dyeing it red. Before the banner dropped from Zaid's hand,
Ja'far bin Abu Talib had rushed and caught it strongly. He began
fighting severely. His voice became loud in the middle of the noise of
the fights. He announced the good news about victory or martyrdom which
each believer hoped.

Ja'far bin Abu Talib jumped off his horse to show his insistence on
fighting. He was the first to do that in the history of Islam. He was
like the mountain. He was facing the enemies hits. His firmness
astonished them.

So, the enemies intensified their attacks against him. A sword hit his
right hand. So, it flew in the wind.

Ja'far took the banner of Islam with his left hand and began fighting.
Another sword hit his hand and cut it off. Ja'far pressed the banner to
his bosom with his upper arm so that the fight would go on.

During those terrible moments, Ja'far was hit again. He fell over the
ground and became a martyr.

Abdullah bin Rawaha, the third leader, rushed towards the banner to
wave again in the sky of the battle.

The new leader fought bravely to stop the attacks of the Romans who
were moving like waves.

Abdullah fell over the ground and became a martyr. So, Thabit bin
al-Arqam took the banner and asked the Muslims to elect a new leader.

The Muslims elected Khalid bin al-Waleed.

Very quickly, the new leader decided to withdraw his forces. So, he did
some tactic operations to cheat the enemy.

When it got dark, the Muslim Army withdrew with peace and disappeared
in the core of the desert.

In the morning, the Romans were surprised to hear about the Muslims'
withdrawal. They were afraid to go further into the desert.

At the same time, the brave Muslims, though few in number, dismayed
them.

So, the Romans preferred coming back to stay.

**In Madina
**
Jibreel came down from the sky to tell our Master Muhammad [s] about
the news of the battle. So, Allah's Apostle went up the pulpit and
addressed the Muslims:

Zaid took the banner. He fought till he was killed and became a martyr.
Then Ja'far took it and fought till he was killed and became a martyr.
Then Abdullah took it and fought till he was killed and became a
martyr.

Finally, our Master Muhammad [s] began condoling Asmaa, the great
Martyr's wife.

The Holy Prophet [s] came into Ja'far's house. He found his children
sitting. His wife had just finished doing her hair.

The Prophet [s] kissed Ja'far's children and held them on his lap. He
shed tears. Asmaa felt that something had happened to her husband. So,
she asked the Prophet [s]:

Allah's Apostle, have you heard anything about Ja'far and his
companions?

Yes, they've been martyred!

The Prophet [s] left the house. He asked his daughter Fatima al-Zahra
to fix some food for them, for a disaster had befallen them.

**The Owner of the two wings
**
When the soldiers of Islam came back to their homeland, they began
telling their families about Ja'far's heroic actions and those who were
martyred.

One of them said: We've seen 90 wounds in Ja'far's body.

Another said: I've seen him when his right hand had been cut off.

The third said: I've seen him when his left hand had been cut off. He
had fallen over the ground and his wounds bled.

Our Master Muhammad [s] said: Jibreel has told me that Allah has
granted Ja'far two wings to fly with in the Paradise.

That night, Ja'far's children lay on their beds. They were looking at
the sky full of stars. In the meantime, they imagined that their father
was flying with his wings like angels.
