 social personalities of Iran. His grandfather was the late  
 Ayatullah Hajj Sayyid 'Abdu 'l-Husayn Lari who fought for  
 freedom in the Constitutional Revolution. In the course of his  
 lengthy struggles against the tyrannical government of the  
 time he attempted to establish an Islamic government and  
 succeeded in doing so for a short time in Larestan.

Sayyid Mujtaba Musawi Lari was born in 1314/1935 in the  
 city of Lar where he completed his primary education and  
 his preliminary Islamic studies. In 1332/1953 he departed for

Eyes. The book includes a comparative discussion of Western  
 and Islamic civilization and in it the author seeks to prove by  
 way of a comprehensive reasoned and exact comparison the  
 superiority of the comprehensive and multi-dimensional  
 civilization of Islam to that of the West. This book has recently  
 been reprinted for the seventh time. In 1349/1970 it was  
 translated into English by a British Orientalist F. G. Goulding  
 and it aroused much attention in Europe. Articles concerning  
 the book appeared in several Western periodicals and the BBC  
 arranged an interview with the translator iii which the reasons  
 for translating the book and the reception accorded it in  
 England were discussed. The English version of the book has  
 up to now been punted three times in England eight times in  
 Iran and twice in America.

About three years after the publication of the English  
 translation Rudolf Singler a German university professor  
 translated it into German and the version lie produced proved  
 influential in Germany. One of the leaders of the Social  
 Democratic Party informed the translator in a letter that the  
 book had left a profound impression upon him causing him to  
 change his views of Islam and that lie would recommend the  
 book to his friends. The German translation has now been  
 reprinted three times.

The English and German versions of the book were  
 reprinted by the Ministry of Islamic Guidance for wide  
 distribution abroad through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  
 and the Islamic Students' Associations abroad.

At the same time that the first printing of the German  
 translation was published an Indian Muslim scholar by the  
 name of Mawlana Rawshan 'Ali translated it into Urdu for  
 distribution in India and Pakistan. This Urdu translation has  
 now been reprinted five times.

 Arabic and French languages.

 Lar with the purposes of propagating Islam teaching Islam to  
 rural youth and helping the needy. This organization  
 remained active until 1346/1967. Its main accomplishments were  
 the dispatch of students of the religious sciences to the  
 countryside to teach Islam to children and young people;  
 providing thousands of school children with clothing books  
 and writing equipment; building a number of mosques  
 schools and clinics in towns and villages; and the provision of  
 miscellaneous services.

Sayyid Mujtaba Musawi Lari pursued his interest in  
 Islamic ethics writing new articles on the subject. In 1353/1974

 Human Development. The book has now been reprinted six  
 times and the English translation is underway.

 Islamic organization in that country. He then went to England  
 and France and after returning to Iran began writing a series of  
 articles on Islamic ideology for the magazine Soroush. These  
 articles were later collected in a four-volume book on the  
 fundamental beliefs of Islam (tawhid divine justice  
 prophethood imamate and resurrection) under the title The  
 Foundations of Islamic Doctrine.

 English translation of the forth volume of this work forms the  
 present book. Urdu and Hindi translations are also underway;
