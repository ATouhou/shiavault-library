===================

Article 156
-----------

It is an obligatory precaution that a Muhrim does not kill insects like
mosquitoes, flies, cootiea etc, even if they are on his/her body or
clothes or not, and does not kill any moving creature, unless they cause
him/her annoyance or if they are malefic and dangerous like snake,
scorpion etc. An obligatory precaution is that the Muhrim does not fling
the aforesaid insects from the body, and if he/she has done it
involuntarily, then he/she should give some food to a poor person.
