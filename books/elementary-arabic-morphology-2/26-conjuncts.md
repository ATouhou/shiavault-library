198. A conjunct is a noun whose meaning is not complete unless there is
a sentence after it with a pronoun that relates to it. For example:
**جاءَ** **الخادم** **الذي** **کلَّمتُکَ** **عنه** (The servant who you
talked about came).

199. The sentence after a conjunct is called a relative sentence.

200. The pronoun in the relative sentence is called a returning pronoun.
There are two kinds of returning pronouns: clear, for example **جاء**
**الذي** **سافر** **أبوه** (the person whose father is traveling came)
and hidden, for example **جاء** **الذي** **أرسلتُ** (the person who I
sent for came).

201. There are two types of conjuncts: specific and common.

202. A specific conjunct is a word used specifically for single, dual,
and plural masculine and feminine words.

203. The specific conjuncts are:

• Masculine:

    1. **الّذی** (single)

    2. **اللّذانِ** **اللّذَینِ** (dual)

    3. **اللّذِینَ** (plural)

• Feminine:

    1. **الّتی** (single)

    2. **اللّتانِ** **اللّّتَینِ** (dual)

    3. **اللّواتی** **اللاتی** **اللائی** (plural)

204. Conjuncts are always indeclinable. The dual forms are made
indeclinable on an *alif* if it is in the nominative state, for example
**اللّذانِ** and on a *yā'* if it is in the accusative or genitive
states, for example **اللّذَینِ**.

205. A common conjunct is a noun that is used for all the different
tenses of conjuncts.

206. There are three common conjuncts:

• **مَن** which is used for rational beings. For example: **أُکرِّمُ**
**مَن** **یَزُورُني** (I respect whoever visits me)

• **ما** which is used for non-rational beings. For example: **کُل**
**ما** **تَشتهیهِ** **نَفسُکَ** (Eat whatever your heart desires)

• **أيّ** which is used for both rational and non-rational beings. For
example: **أُحِبُّ** **أيَّ** **التلامذةِ** **یدرسُ** (I love whichever
student who studies)
