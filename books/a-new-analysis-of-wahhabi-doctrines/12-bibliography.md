The emergence of the Wahhabi sect in the 12th century AH became the
source of many religious and political disputes and disagreements in the
Muslim world, and up to now, it has consumed a considerable portion of
the potential and energy of Muslim societies especially from the time it
had been backed by the political power of Ibn Sa'ud and British
imperialism.

The founder of this sect, Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, came from Najd in
the Arabian Peninsula. Under the influence of figures such as Ibn
Taymiyyah, he used to express personal understandings of Islam contrary
to the path of the 'ulama'.

A comparative analysis of the ideas of Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, on
one hand, and Sunni and Shi\`ah beliefs, on the other, could reveal many
of the religious innovations, deviations and speculative interpretations
existing in this nascent sect. The book, *A New Analysis of Wahhabi
Doctrines*, attempts to do so, and it has been written by utilizing
references published by Wahhabi institutions in the Hijaz.
