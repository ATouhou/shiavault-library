knowledge of it is only with God." (Al-Ahzab, 63)

And the Gospel includes the following verse in the same regard: "...
But about the exact date and hour no one knows, not even the angels in
heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be on guard; keep wide awake
and pray; for you do not know the time." (Mark 13:30-33)

**The Blowing of the Trumpet**

The Quranic verses in this regard are the following two verses: "The
Day when the Trumpet shall be blown, and ye shall come forth in (huge)
groups." (An-Naba, 18)

they (all) hasten." (Yasin, 51)

The Gospel attributed to John has the following verse in this regard:
"... for the time is coming when all who are in the graves will hear His
voice and will come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of
life, and those who have practiced evil to the resurrection of
condemnation." (John 5: 27-29)

The First Episle of Paul to the Corinthians includes a verse with the
same meaning as follows:

"... in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet call.
For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable ...
." (15:52)

The following verse from the Second General Epistle of Peter is in this
regard: "But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. Then with a
tremendous roar the heavens will pass away, the elements will be
dissolved with fire, and the earth and the works in it will be burned
up." (3:10-11)

**Separating Good and Evil in the Day of Judgement**

The sample Quranic verse in this regard is as follows:" And the day
when arriveth the Hour (of Judgment), on that day shall (they) be
separated from one another. And as to those who believed and did good
deeds, they shall be in the garden, made happy. And as to those who
disbelieved and belied Our signs and the meeting of the hereafter, these
shall be brought over to the chastisement." (Ar-Room, 14-16)

The following verse from the Gospel has the same meaning: " When the
Son of Man comes in His Glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will
be seated on the throne of His Glory, and all nations will be gathered
before Him. And He will separate them from one another as a shepherd
parts the sheep from the goats." (Matt. 25:31-33)

**The People of Right Hand and The People of Left Hand**

The Holy Quran includes the following verse in this regard: "And the
People of Right hand Oh! What (a happy state shall) the people of the
Right hand (be in)! Amid thornless lote-trees, And banana-trees (with
fruits) piled one above another, And shade spread out... And the People
of the Left hand, Ah! What (a wretched state shall) the people of the
Left hand (be in)! In scorching wind and scalding water, And in the
shadow of a black smoke." (Al-Waqiah, 27-43)

The following verses are from the Gospel in the same regard: "And He
will separate them from one another as a shepherd parts the sheep from
the goats; and He will place the sheep at His right and the goats at His
left. ‘The king will then say to those at His right, ‘Come, My father’s
blessed ones, inherit the kingdom that has been prepared for you from
the foundation of the world;... Then will He say to those at His left,
‘Begone from Me, accursed ones, to the everlasting fire prepared for the
devil and his angels." (Matt. 25:32-41)

**The Day of Judgement as the Day of Reckoning and Reward**

The following two verses from the Quran are in this rehard: "Man shall
e informed on that day of whatsoever he put before and whatsoever he put
behind!" (Al-Qiyamat, 13)

" On that day shall come out people (from their graves) in (scattered)
groups, to be shown their own deeds. Then he who hath done an
atom-weight of good shall see it. And he who hath done an atom-weight of
evil shall see it." (Al-Zilzal, 6-8)

The Gospel includes a verse in this regard too, exactly with the same
meaning.

**The Length of the Day of Judgement**

thee to hasten on the chastisement and never doth God fail His promise;
And verily, there is a day with thy lord as a thousand years, of what ye

The Second General Epistle of Peter has the same meaning verse as
follows:

" At present, however, the heavens and the earth are by the same word
stored up for burning, and reserved for the Day of Judgement and the
destruction of godless people. But do not overlook this one fact, dear
friends, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a
thousand years as one day." (3:7-8)
