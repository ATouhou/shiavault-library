Bahlool Sells Paradise
======================

One day Bahlool was sitting at the corner of the river, and since he was
useless, he was making some flower beds like the children were. Haroun
Rashid's wife Zubaydah happened to cross by. When she came near Bahlool,
she asked, “ Bahlool! What are you doing?”

Bahlool answered, “Making Paradise.”

“Do you sell the gardens you have?”

“Yes, I sell them.”

“For how many dinars?”

“For 100 dinars.”

Since Zubaydah wanted to help Bahlool in any way she could, she
immediately ordered her servant to give Bahlool 100 dinars, which he
did.

Bahlool said, “You don't want a receipt?”

“Write it and bring it.” Saying this, Zubaydah went her way.

Bahlool distributed that money among the poor.

In a dream that night, Zubaydah saw a big garden, the like of which she
had never seen when awake. All of its houses and palaces were seven
stories high and made of colored jewels and decorated with great style.
The rivers were flowing and beside them flowers were blooming. Very
beautiful trees were planted, servants (boys and girls) were all present
and ready to be of service. Zubaydah was given the receipt, written in
gold ink, and was told that this is the Garden that she had bought from
Bahlool.

When she awoke, Zubaydah was very happy and told Haroun about her dream.
As soon as it was morning, Haroun sent someone to bring Bahlool.

When Bahlool came, Haroun said, “I want you to take 100 dinars from me
and sell me one of your gardens, like the one you gave Zubaydah.”

Bahlool gave a loud laugh and said, “Zubaydah bought it without seeing
(the reward), but you heard and so want to buy it, but regretfully, I
won't sell it to you.”
