Explanation of the Routes Leading To Ghadir Khum
================================================

At present, there are two ways leading to the Ghadir valley:

1- The Johfeh route:

It begins from the side of Rabegh airport till the start of Johfeh
village, thereafter 5 kilometres towards the north in the sandy region
till Qasr Olya. Henceforth 2 kilometres towards the right side of the
roadway by crossing sandy hills and thereafter, a short desert to the
right side of which lies the route to the Ghadir valley.

The distance between Ghadir and Meeqaat (gathering point of pilgrims)
at Johfah from the west is 8 kilometres.

2- The Rabegh route:

It starts from the crossroad of Mecca, Medina and Rabegh, some 10
kilometres on the left side of the roadway in the direction of Mecca.
Thereafter, on the right side is a secondary road leading to Ghadir,
which is 26 Kilometres from South-East Rabegh.

With the reappearance of the owner of Ghadir i.e. Hazrat Mahdi
(p.b.u.h.), we hope that the beautiful and spiritual territory of Ghadir
once again regains its life, and a splendid mosque would be built,
between the reservoir and spring; with the tracing of the location of
the holy Prophet's pulpit and tent; so that people around the world
could visit this place and picture for themselves the great event of
Ghadir.
