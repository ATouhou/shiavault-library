Story no. 4: Preparation of children for Prayer
===============================================

Zahra was around 8 years old.  
 When her mother said “Zahra come, have your breakfast, she came with
tearful eyes.  
 Her father asked “Zahra why are you crying?”.  
 She said “Last night I requested mom to wake me up for the Fajr namaz,
but she didn’t.”  
 Her mother said “Zahra dear, praying namaz has not become obligatory on
you yet.”  
 Zahra said “I know, but in any condition I must prepare for namaz.”

Yes, one of the laws of Islam is that children should be made aware of
the reading of namaz and Quran from the age of seven so that they are
prepared for it.
