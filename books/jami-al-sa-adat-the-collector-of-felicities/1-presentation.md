============

One of the most important of the Islamic sciences is ethics. All along
the brilliant history of Islam, great Islamic scholars have specialized
in this field and have produced important and valuable books dealing
with this subject.

One of the best and the most comprehensive of these books is the
*Jami\`* *al-Sa'adat* ("The Collector of Felicities"), written by the
great Islamic scholar, mystic, and moral philosopher, Muhammad Mahdi ibn
Abi Dharr al-Naraqi, who himself was a living embodiment of Islamic
ethical and moral virtues.

The book was written in Arabic and published in three volumes. Al-Naraqi
was one of the most brilliant thinkers of the late 12th/18th and early
13th/lath century. Besides *Jami\`* *al-Sa'adat*, al-Naraqi was also the
author of a number of other important books.

In order to revive Islamic ethics in a world drowning in a whirlpool of
materialism and which seem to have all but forgotten the eternal
spiritual human values, we thought the effort worthwhile to condense
this valuable work into few short articles for the benefit of those who
may not have access to the contents of the original Arabic text.
