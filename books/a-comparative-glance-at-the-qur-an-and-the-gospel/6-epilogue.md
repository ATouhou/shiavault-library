" Hast thou not (O' Our Apostle Muhammad!) seen those (the Jews) who
have been given a portion of the Book." (Al-e-Imran, 23)

The study that we had so far on the New Testament especially the
Gospels and their relation with the Holy Quran improved the above
Quranic verse which specifies that the people of the Book have just a
part of the main revealed book and not all of it, and, it shows that The
Torah and the Gospel have been altered.

On the other hand, the verse indicates that all of their contents are
not wrong because as we read before, some beliefs available in the New
Testament have a specific similarity with the Holy Quran. " The words,
‘those who are given a portion of the book’, refer to the people of the
Book. This changed phrasing points to a well-known historical fact:

The Jews and the Christians do not have in their hands the complete
books; what they have got is only some portions of the revealed
Scriptures. They have altered, changed and edited the books so
extensively that the major part of the original has been lost for ever.
The last sentence too alludes to this fact: ‘and what they have forged
deceives them in the matter of their religion.’ The verse, in short,
says-and Allah knows better-that the Jews and the Christians turn back
from the judgment of the Book of Allah, being deceived by their own
claim, and misled by what they have themselves forged; they demonstrate,
by their behaviour, that they do not need the Book of Allah.
