Salafiyyah Interpretation of Ayah 194 of Surah al-A'raf
=======================================================

The fifth reason that the Salafiyyah such as Ibn Taymiyyah, Muhammad Ibn
'Abd al-Wahhab and Muhammad Rashid Rida have cited as non-permissibility
of*tawassul* to the Prophet (S.A.W.A.) after his death, is the
following*Ayah* of the Holy Qur'an:

***"Surely, those whom you call other than Allah are subservient (to
Allah) like unto your own selves..." (7:194)***

Critique
--------

All exegetes of the Holy Qur'an have unanimously stated that this*Ayah*
refers to the idol-worshippers who associate man-made objects with God
in creation and in administering the affairs of the world. In
contrast,*tawassul* is made by those who never regard the Prophets as
partners of ALLAH (SWT) in creation and in running world affairs, and
neither do they worship the Last Prophet (S.A.W.A.), since every day
several times they bear testimony that Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.A.) is
the servant and Messenger of ALLAH (SWT) (ash-hadu anna Mohammedan
'abduhu wa rasuluh). As the Holy Qur'an says,

Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.A.) has been sent as mercy to the entire
creation***(21:107)*** and is a means of acceptance of supplications, so
it is natural for us to request him to supplicate and intercede
(*shafa'at* ) with ALLAH (SWT) for us.
