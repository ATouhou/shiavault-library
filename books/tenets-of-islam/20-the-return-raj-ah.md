The Return (Raj'ah)
===================

During the time of the Mahdi (May Allah hasten his blessed advent) our
Holy Prophet and our infallible Imams (Peace be on them) will return to
this world along with a body of men belonging to the past and the
subsequent nations, with a view to demonstrate their power and establish
their rights. This is what has been expressly mentioned by a number of
continuous reports and Qur'anic verses. Allah says:

The day on which We will assemble a group from every people.

Therefore it is obligatory to believe in the doctrine of 'Return'
(raj'ah).[^1]

[^1]: Surah an-Naml, 27:83
