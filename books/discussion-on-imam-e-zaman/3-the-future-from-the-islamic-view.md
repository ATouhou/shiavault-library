The Future From the Islamic View
================================

The Quranic View:

We have stated before that Islam, like all other religions, portrays an
optimistic picture of the future. This portrayal has been done in the
manner most beautiful in the Holy Quran. Therefore, right in the
beginning of creation, it is stated that the first creature on earth
would be Allah’s Caliph; it was the wish of Allah to appoint His caliph
on the earth.
.« و إذ قال رب.ك لِلملائكَه إنّي جاعلٌ في الأرض خليفه »

“And when your Lord said to the angels, ‘Surely I am going to appoint a
Caliph in the earth.”6

At this juncture, the angels expressed their amazement and Allah
replied to their query, which is known to one and all. One of my
teachers, a highly respectable and knowledgeable person,7 explains this
incident in a very interesting manner. He says that on that day, the
angels saw the bridge of Tajrish (in Iran) and the promenades of Paris
and said, « !؟ أجعل فيها من يفسد فيها »“Will you appoint somebody who
will create mischief in it?” and then they saw the first and second
World Wars and said, « !؟ ويسفك الدماء »“and shed blood?” But Allah the
Almighty saw Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.) and said,

<p dir="rtl">
« إني أعلم ما لا تعلمون »
</p>

“Surely I know what you do not know.” According to the Holy Quran, the
aim of creation of mankind on the earth is based on the very appointment
of Allah’s Caliph. Thus, in the beginning of creation, Allah says,
“Surely I am going to appoint a Caliph in the earth.” After his advent
on the earth, Allah has provided a model for him so that all may strive
to emulate him.

For further understanding of this concept, let me cite an example.
Suppose that a person builds a school and expresses his desire to
educate students to become engineers, doctors, specialists, etc in it.
After the passage of some time, when one student passes out of this
institution, the builder of these schools brings him forward and says,
‘For him only have we built this institution? All our efforts were
directed towards this very individual.’

6 Baqarah: 30 7 Ayatullah Shaykh Husain Waheedi Khurasani in one of his
speeches in Masjid-e-Arak of Tehran.

Some of the traditions that explain the virtues of the Holy Prophet
(s.a.) and his pure progeny (a.s.) carry a similar meaning. For
instance, Allah the Almighty says to the Holy Prophet (s.a.) :

<p dir="rtl">
.« لَولاك ما خَلقت. الأفلاك »
</p>

“If you were not there, I would not have created the universe.”8 Allah
the Almighty created Hazrat Adam (a.s.), the father of humanity, as a
role model from all aspects and ordered the others to emulate him and
strive to be like him. But as time passed, and other human beings tread
on the face of the earth, they failed to emulate their role model, as
was expected of them for the fulfillment of the divine promise, and much
to the disappointment of the righteous. Yet, Allah the Benevolent, by
sending the other Prophets (peace be on them) to them, indicates that
the appointment of His Caliph on the earth is not rendered null and
void. Rather, He would send more such people on the earth, who would not
only be like His first Caliph, but more perfect.

Some are of the opinion that such verses are only for the gradual
finalization of Allah’s Promise. Hence, in the Holy Quran, first He
says,

<p dir="rtl">
.« إني جاعل في الأرض خليفه »
</p>

“Surely I am going to appoint a Caliph in the earth” and thereafter the
Prophets (peace be on them) reminded the people. And when the series of
Prophethood reached to Hazrat Dawood (a.s.) and Hazrat Sulayman (a.s.),
Allah says,

<p dir="rtl">
.« و. لَقد كَتبنا في الزّبورِ من بعدِ الذّكر أنُّ الأرض ي.رِثُها
عِبادي. الص.الحونُ »
</p>

“Surely I have written in the Psalms after the Old Testament that
surely the earth, My righteous servants shall inherit it.”9

To understand the above verses in their right context and comprehend
their relevance, let me cite an example. You loosen the nuts and bolts
of this taperecorder, dismantle it completely, mix it with some
additional screws that do not belong to it and tell somebody to assemble
it once again in the desired order. Now, if somebody like me, who is
totally ignorant about its technicalities, takes it in his hand, he will
never manage to sort out its nuts and bolts with the additional screws
or assemble it. But if it is given to somebody who is an expert in this
field, immediately, he will get on with the task of separating its nuts
and 8 Behaarul Anwaar, vol. 15, p. 28


bolts with the additional screws and within no time, he will assemble
it and hand it over back to you.

Similarly, the Quranic verses concerning Imamat and Qaemiyyat are as
scattered as the parts of the tape recorder in the above example. As we
are unacquainted with Allah’s Book, we do not know as to which verse
talks about Imam-e- Zaman (a.t.f.s.). But if we hand over these verses
to the one who is well familiar with them, he will bring one verse from
the beginning, another from the middle and yet another one from the end.
He will place about twenty to thirty verses next to each other in such a
manner that they will not be applicable for anybody except the Promised
Mahdi (a.t.f.s.).

From such verses, we can select a few. For instance, .« إني جاعل في
الأرض خليفه » Surely I am going to appoint a Caliph in the earth” being
one of them. If you ask what this verse means, it will be answered, ‘It
means that there must be a divine caliph in the earth.’

The second verse is that very one which has been discussed above and
which states that divine promise is definite. For, Allah the Almighty
assures, .« و. لَقد كَتبنا في الزّبورِ مِن بعد الذّكرِ أنُّ الأرض
ي.رثُها عِبادي. الص.الحون » “And indeed We have written in the Psalms
after the Old Testament (in the various exegesis, the word zikr implies
both the Old Testament as well as remembrance-its literal meaning) that
the earth, it shall be inherited by My righteous servants.”

So how much of the earth will they inherit? Is it about three hundred
or four hundred meters of a land? No, definitely not. It is not talking
about just a piece of land but about the whole earth. The definitive
article used in the word ‘the earth’ is used to connote the whole in
Arabic. Thus, the righteous servants of Allah will inherit the entire
earth.

In yet another verse, Allah the Almighty prophesies, .« إنُّ الأرض للّه
يورثُها م.ن ي.شاء. مِن عباده و العاقبه للم.تّقين ... » “…Surely the
earth is for Allah, He causes it to be inherited by anyone of His
servants, as He pleases and the hereafter is for the pious ones.”10 Here
too the servants have been categorized as the righteous and pious
servants. The last part of the verse is a pledge where Allah says that
this is My promise to you.

10 A’raaf: 128

It is better to clarify this point over here that some times we speak
in general that I will do this work. But at other times, we say it in
the form of a vow. We practice this in our daily lives. For instance,
one of our friends usually comes to us and says that ‘I intend to invite
you’; but this is a general statement. But when? Where? Will he not
regret? Thus, it is still not a promise. One day he comes and says,
‘Sir, please note and remember that I intend to invite you.’ Fine, we
remember but still he has not taken any commitment from us. But one fine
day he comes and takes a promise from us. That is, he says, ‘I want to
officially invite you all on such and such day, at such and such time,
and in so and so place for dinner.’ These are the three stages of glad
tidings.

Of course, it should be known that there are two kinds of prophecies,
one is a promise (wa’d) and another is a threat (waeed). It is certainly
better if a threat is not carried out. But if a promise is not
fulfilled, it is wrong and evil. In the case of Allah, He has threatened
a lot, ‘I will throw you in hell, I will punish you…’ but later, He
forgives. On account of His being a Forgiver, maybe He does not carry
out His threat. But if He does not fulfill His promise, then it is
indeed wrong and evil.

Now, when this is clear, Allah the Almighty, promises,

<p dir="rtl">
.« وعد الله الذين آمنوا منكم و عملوا الص.الحات »
</p>

“Allah has promised those of you who believe and perform good deeds.”11
In the beginning, He said,

<p dir="rtl">
.« إني جاعل في الأرض خليفه »
</p>

‘Surely I am going to appoint a Caliph in the earth’

But now He says,

<p dir="rtl">
وعد الله الّذين آمنوا منكم و عملوا الص.الحات ليستخلفنهم في الأرض كما
استخلف الّذين من » .« قبلهم
</p>

“Allah has promised those of you who believe and perform good deeds
that He will certainly appoint them as heirs in the earth as He has
appointed as heirs those before them (one type of such caliphs were
Prophets Dawood and Sulayman (a.s.))

<p dir="rtl">
.« و لي.مكنن لهم دينهم الّذي ارتضي لهم »
</p>

And certainly He will establish for them their religion which He has
chosen for them.”

Where in the Holy Quran has this chosen religion been mentioned? It is
mentioned in the following verse,

.« اليوم اكملت لكم دينكم و اتممت عليكم نعمتي و رضيت لكم الاسلام دينا »
11 Noor: 55

“Today, I have perfected for you your religion, completed My bounties
upon you and chosen for you Islam as a religion.”12

So in this verse, it has been explained in clear terms as to which are
the religion chosen by Allah for His servants.

Thereafter, He says, “And He will surely convert their fear into
security”.

What does fear and security imply in this verse? Fear is a general term
e.g. fears of hunger, fear of insecurity, fear of world war, fear of an
atomic war, etc. All these are fears and hence Allah promises that He
will convert their fear into security. In other words, We will change
the atmosphere of fear and insecurity into one of security and
comfort.

The verse continues, “(as) they worship only Me, do not associate
anything with Me. Then whoever disbelieves after that, and then indeed
these are the transgressors.”

Therefore, all the above are promises of Allah. Now let us see, whether
these statements are definite promises of Allah, tantamount to His
Intention, or they are just general statements made by Him. In this
regard, there is another verse that pledges,

<p dir="rtl">
و. نُريد أَن نَم.نُّ علي الّذين استُضعِفوا في الأرضِ و نَجع.لَه.م أئم.ه
و نجعلهم الوارثين . و نُمكّنُ لهم » .« في الأرض و نُري فِرعون و هامانُ و
ج.نود. ه.ما مِنه.م ما كانوا ي.حذرون
</p>

“And We intend to oblige those who have been rendered weak in the earth
and that We make them the Imams and We make them the heirs. And We will
establish them in the earth and We will show Firaon, Hamaan and their
armies what they were dreading from them.”13

It should be known that the word “mustaz’af” does not mean weak.
Rather, its true connotation would be those who have become weak
willingly and

voluntarily or have been rendered weak. For, it is possible that those
who have preferred to remain weak willingly could be strong and
powerful. (They have preferred being the oppressed one rather than the
oppressor.)
