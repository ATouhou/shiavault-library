**The Mu‘rabāt (declinable words) are two groups: a group that is
declined with Ḥarakāt[^27] (vowels)[^28] and a group that is declined
with Ḥurūf (letters)[^29] .**

**That which is declined with Ḥarakāt is of four types:**

the Ism Mufrad

the Jam‘ Taksīr

the Jam‘ Mu’annath Sālim, and

the Fi‘l Muḍāri‘ that does not have anything suffixed to it.

All of them are declined with a Ḍammah for Raf‘, a Fatḥah for Naṣb, a
Kasrah for Khafḍ and a Sukūn for Jazm.

Three things are excluded from this (norm/general rule):

the Jam‘ Mu’annath Sālim which is declined with a Kasrah for Naṣb
(instead of the normal Fatḥah)

the al-Ism allađī lā yanṣarifu which is declined with a Fatḥah for Khafḍ
(instead of the normal Kasrah)

the Fi‘l Muḍāri‘ Mu‘tall al-Ākhir which is declined with the Ḥađf
al-Ākhir for Jazm (instead of the normal Sukūn).

That which is declined with Ḥurūf is of four types:

the Tathniyah

the Jam‘ Muđakkar Sālim

the Asmā’ Khamsah[^30]

the Af‘āl Khamsah[^31] , and they are:

<p dir="rtl">
يفعلان، تفعلان، يفعلون، تفعلون، تفعلين
</p>

As for the Tathniyah it is Marfū‘ with the Alif, Manṣūb and Makhfūḍ with
the Yā’[^32] .

As for the Jam‘ Muđakkar Salim it is Marfu‘ with the Waw, Manṣub and
Makhfuḍ with the Yā’[^33] .

As for the Asmā’ Khamsah it is Marfū‘ with the Wāw, Manṣūb with the Alif
and Makhfūḍ with the Yā’.

As for the Af‘āl Khamsah it is Marfū‘ with the Nūn, Manṣūb and Majzūm
with the Ḥađf thereof.
