M - Muhammad Ibn Al-Hanafiyyah
==============================

His father was Imam Ali (as) and Al-Hanafiyyah is his mother's last
name. She was Khawla bint Ja’far Ibn Qays Ibn Salma Ibn Tha'lebeh, and
her son Muhammad was among the bravest. In the war of Al-Jamal he held
the flag of Imam Ali's army. He witnessed the battle of Nahrawan. When
Imam Husayn refused to accept Yazeed as the new ruler of the Muslims,
Muhammad Ibn Al-Hanafiyyah was among the people who disagreed with Imam
Husayn's going to Kabala.

Imam Husayn wrote his will and gave it to Muhammad. After the Imam's
martyrdom in Karbala, Muhammad was lonely like everyone who did not go
with Imam Husayn and in 66 AH, Al Mukhtar Ibn ‘Ubayd Allah accepted him
as an Imam and took control of Iraq by his name. He died in 81 Hijrah in
the days of Abd Al-Malik Ibn Marwan.
