Responsibility 97: Sending Prayers and Salutations upon the Imam
================================================================

Another responsibility is to send prayers and salutations upon Imam
al-Mahdi (ajtf).

In order to fulfill this responsibility, a true believer may for
example, say something like the following line:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلـىٰ مَوْلاَنَا صَاحِبِ الزَّمَانِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

“O’Allah! Send your blessings upon our Master, the Master of the Time.”

In the books of Du’a, many different greetings[^1] have been mentioned
in regards to Imam al-’Asr (ajtf) and the other Infallibles (as) and we
must only use these greetings when saluting him since these have been
taught to us by the Ahlul Bayt (as) and thus, what better greeting can
there be than these?

Sending salutations upon the Imam (ajtf) is a form of Du’a a complete
and comprehensive supplication. In this form of a petition and request
from the true believer (the salutations to the Imam), we see the desire
for the Imam to be protected and the prayer for the protection of his
helpers and friends all forms of grief and anguish to be removed from
the Imam’s heart, prayer for his advent to be hastened the desire that
he is granted a victory and many other subtle points.

In reality, the greetings and salutations which we send to the Imam are
actually us praying and seeking His mercy in all areas related to the
Imam, whether these are the affairs of this world or the next life.

Thus, we affirm that the key to the rectification of all issues is in
the hands of Allah alone.

right after Ziyarat Jami’a under the heading of: “Greetings upon the
Righteous Proofs of Allah”
