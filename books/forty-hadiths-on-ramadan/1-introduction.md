============

The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) has said: "Those
people from amongst my ummah, who memorize forty Hadiths (traditions)
pertaining to those issues of religion, which they are in need of, Allah
shall resurrect them on the Day of Judgment as jurisprudents and
scholars."*(Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 2, pg. 156; Al-Ikhtasaas, pg.2)*
