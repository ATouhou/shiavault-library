Islam and Science
=================

Integral to finding a solution to the environmental crisis is a study of
modern science’s role in it. Modern science, with its great capabilities
for both construction and destruction, has been the means by which
people today have drastically increased their negative impact on Earth.
However, through specific scientific initiatives such as environmental
engineering, modern science can also serve as a contributive means to
solving this crisis. Therefore, specific aspects of the history of
science must be studied in order to properly understand science’s role
in the environmental crisis as both a cause of the problem and a
potential ameliorator of it.

It is also important to undergo such a study under the lenses of
universal sacred traditions. The separation of science from sacred
tradition, and thus also the loss of the sacred sciences, is indeed a
contributing factor to the human abuse of nature today. Given the
Islamic reverence for nature and the rich history between Islam and
science, a study of both science and nature under an Islamic lens can
prove constructive to an understanding of the subject at hand. Such a
study can give its conductors insight to the faulty axioms within modern
science, as well as provide a perception of modern day humanity’s latent
ability to regain harmony with nature.
