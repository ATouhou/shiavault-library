Lesson One Hundred Forty Seven: First Prerequisite For Any Work
===============================================================

Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) said to Kumayl:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ما مِنْ حَرَكَة اِلاّ وَ اَنْتَ مُحْتاجٌ فِيها اِلى مَعْرِفَة
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

There is no movement or work that does not need insight, familiarity and
knowledge for its performance.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

If we reflect on the wide scope of the words ‘no movement’used above, we
will understand how all-encompassing the religion of Islam is. It is not
merely a series of worship rituals and invocations or a set of beliefs
without practical applications. Rather it provides a complete code of
life for all personal and social concerns and endeavors, and its
starting point is intelligence and knowledge of realities. It considers
all movement and effort as fruitless or at best ineffective if it lacks
adequate knowledge and correct guidance.
