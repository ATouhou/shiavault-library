==============================================

Behrouz had great interest in cycling.  
 One day he playing with his cycle when suddenly the front wheel got
caught in a stone and the cycle became out of control.  
 Behrouz came on the ground.  
 Because of pain, Behrouz was not able to get up.  
 Some of the children saw him and laughed.  
 Suddenly, Jalal saw this scene and got Behrouz aid and helped him to
get up. He said to the children  
 “The one who laughs at someone when he is in pain, it is possible that
there will be one day when he will be similarly laughed at when he will
be in pain.”
