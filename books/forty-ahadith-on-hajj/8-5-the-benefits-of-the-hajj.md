عَنِ الرِّضَا (ع) قَالَ: مَا رَأََيْتُ ‏َشَيْئاً أَسْرَعَ غِنًّى وَ
لاَ أَنْفى لِلْفَقْرِ مِنْ إِدْمَانُ الْحَجِّ.

It has been narrated from al-Ridha [Imam ‘Ali Ibn Musa] (peace be upon
him) that he said, “I have not seen a single thing which makes a person
free from want (financially secure) quicker, nor which is more effective
in removing poverty, than continuously performing the Hajj (year after
year).”
