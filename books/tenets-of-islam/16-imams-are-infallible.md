Imams are Infallible
====================

All the Imams are necessarily infallible and cleansed of all sins, petty
or grave, committed intentionally or unintentionally, pertaining to
sayings or doings, for if they committed sins, they would lose their
position in the hearts of the people who would not have confidence in
them. In such a condition how would they guide the straying and the
misleading? There is a consensus of opinion that no one is infallible
except the 12 Imams. Thus their leadership is an established fact.
