Section 5: Invitation to the followers of the Book to Unity of Allah as a common basis of Faith
===============================================================================================

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 65
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ لِمَ تُحَآجُّونَ فِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَمَا
أُنزِلَتِ التَّورَاةُ وَالإنجِيلُ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِهِ أَفَلاَ
تَعْقِلُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**65.** ***"O' People of the Book! Why do you dispute about Abraham when
the Torah was not sent down, neither the Evangel, but after him? Have
you then no sense? "***

Both Jewish people and Christian people considered Abraham exclusively
theirs. These kinds of statements were so current that the Qur'an says:

***"Abraham was neither (as) Jew nor (as) Christian... "***[^1]

Hence this verse, to refer to the absurdity of their claim, addresses
them both and says how do you know Abraham (as) the follower of the
Torah and the Evangel while he lived before those two Books. Surely, the
Book which was not revealed had not any follower. So, do you not
contemplate at least thus far that your speech be adapted to the
history?

***"O' People of the Book! Why do you dispute about Abraham when the
Torah was not sent down, neither the Evangel, but after him?***

***Have you then no sense? "***

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 66
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
هَاأَنتُمْ هَؤُلاء حَاجَجْتُمْ فِيمَا لَكُم بِهِ عِلمٌ فَلِمَ
تُحَآجُّونَ فِيمَا لَيْسَ لَكُم بِهِ عِلْمٌ وَاللّهُ يَعْلَمُ
وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**66.** ***"Ha, you are those who disputed about that of which you had
knowledge; why then do you dispute about that of which you have no
knowledge? Surely Allah knows, and you know not."***

This verse is both a reminder and a warning to the People of the Book.
It tells them that they raised objections and asked some inappropriate
questions upon what they knew. For instance at that time, they observed
the natural life of Jesus (as) with their own eyes, and saw -his
material needs: his need to food, his need to clothing, and his need to
residence, yet they disputed about him.

Some of them called him (as) a liar and some others considered him Son
of God! Or, they disputed about Muhammad (S) whose tokens were clearly
cited in the Torah and Evangel and they were known to them.[^2]

When you can not find a definite point and dispute upon what you know,
why do you refer to a phenomenon that you have not knowledge about it
and, for example, you seek for the religion of Abraham (as)?

***"Ha, you are those who disputed about that of which you had
knowledge; why then do you dispute about that of which you have no
knowledge? ..."***

This is because *Allah* knows everything but you do not. (Then you
should learn it from the concerned ones, viz. from the Prophet (S) and
his book.)

***"... Surely Allah knows, and you know not."***

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 67
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا كَانَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ يَهُودِيًّا وَلاَ نَصْرَانِيًّا وَلَكِن كَانَ
حَنِيفًا مُّسْلِمًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**67.** ***"Abraham was neither (as) Jew nor (as) Christian but he was
an upright Muslim, and he was not (one) of polytheists."***

The Arabic term /hanafa/ means: 'tending to the Truth', while its
opposite Arabic term is /janafa/ which means: ' deviation or swerving to
falsehood?

The term / hanif / is applied for a person who is on the path of Truth.
But this very word was one of the perverted words which the idolators
used to employ about themselves. Therefore, the pagans were also called
/hunafa/ which is the plural form of this word.

With the occurrence of the term /musliman/ *'a muslim*' in this verse
and beside the term /hanafan/, the Qur'an has purified both Abraham,
from the dirt of polytheism, and this holy word from the misusers.

**"*****Abraham was neither*** ***(as)*** ***Jew nor*** ***(as)***
***Christian but he was an upright Muslim, and he was not (one) of
polytheists."***

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 68
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ أَوْلَى النَّاسِ بِإِبْرَاهِيمَ لَلَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُ وَهَـذَا
النَّبِيُّ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَاللّهُ وَلِيُّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**68.** ***"Verily the nearest people to Abraham are those who follow
him and this Prophet and those who believe, and Allah is the Guardian of
the believers."***

It is realized from this verse that the theological relationships are
higher and fixer than the family relationships. Those who have the same
belief, the same line, and the same goal, are closer to each other than
those who are apparently relatives but are aloof from each other from
the point of idea and belief.

An evidence for this meaning is found in the tradition of Imam Sadiq
(as) who in a statement told 'Umar-ibn-Yazid:

*"By Allah! You are from among the family of Muhammad* (S)*",* and then
he (as) recited the above verse. [^3]

Again, the holy Prophet (S) said about Salman:

*"Salman is from us, Ahlul-Bayt."*[^4]

### Explanations

1. The essential relationship between people and their leader is a
theological relationship. It is not a tribal or linguiform, or regional
or racial relationship.

2. The standard of being nigh to the Prophets, in general, is the
obedience that one proves of them.

3. The Prophet of Islam (S) and Muslims are alongside the same line with
Abraham (as) and they have the same purpose and the same aim.

4. There is a tradition from Amir-ul-Mu'mineen (as) cited in
Majma'-ul-Bayan which says:

*"Verily the lover of Muhammad is the person who obeys Allah although
the one is far from him* (S) *from the point of relationship. And,
verily, the enemy of Muhammad is the person who disobeys Allah, although
the one is a near relative of him."* [^5]

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 69
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَدَّت طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ لَوْ يُضِلُّونَكُمْ وَمَا
يُضِلُّونَ إِلاَّ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**69.** ***A group among the people of the Book desire to make you go
astray, while they make not astray but themselves, and they are not
aware.***

The Arabic term /ta'ifah/ is derived from /tawaf/ and is applied for a
group or a community who, in order to be safe from the danger of savage
animals and robbers, decamp tribally both in summer and in winter to
continue their lives,

The feature of cultural attack and ideological plots are dealt with in
this verse and the following three verses. In this verse, it informs of
ideological grudges. In the next verse the Quran informs of obstinacy
and infidelity.

The seventy first verse of the current Surah speaks about the style of
neglecting aright, overlooking justice, and intentional concealment.
Verse seventy second informs of a technical cultural attack arising from
inner denial and objecting the existence of weakness and instability
among some groups of people.

### Explanations

1- Knowing the enemy and his wants is necessary for being safe from the
probable harms.

2- Those who try to pervert others may commit the sin of deceit,
hypocrisy, rancour accusation, and plot.

***"... While they make not astray but themselves, and they are not
aware."***

3- One of the aims of the enemies of Islam is planning for the creation
of moral and ideological deviation amongst Muslims.

4- In Judgements, do not forget justice and equity.

***"A group among the people of the Book desire to make you go astray
..."***

5. The danger of ideological and cultural attacks are the most important
dangers which need an earnest awareness.

6. Do not trust in the hypocritical expressions of the opponents. They
heartily desire your aberration.

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 70
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ اللّهِ وَأَنتُمْ
تَشْهَدُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**70.** ***"O' People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in the Signs of
Allah while you bear witness (to their truth)? "***

This verse, maybe, hints to the glad news that the people of the Book
had studied in the Torah and the Evangel about Hadrat Muhammad (S).

They did know the Prophet of Islam (S) as they knew their own children.
But, they denied all those divine tokens in order to keep their social
situation and protect their material interests. So, the Qur'an says:

***"O' People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in the Signs of Allah
while you bear witness (to their truth)? "***

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 71
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَلْبِسُونَ الْحَقَّ بِالْبَاطِلِ

  </p>
</blockquote>

**71.** ***"O' People of the Book! Why do you confound the Truth with
falsehood and hide the Truth while you know (it)?"***

Many of the distorters, under the name of Islamicists, orientalists,
historians, and tourists, interfered in books, places, times, and human
beings and distorted them.

They worked on encyclopaedias with the title of researchers and
illustrated such a feature for Islam that when the seekers of Islam
study them feel the circumstance so inconvenient that they do not even
think of believing in it either.

***"O' People of the Book! Why do you confound the Truth with falsehood
and hide the Truth while you know (it)? "***

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 72
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَقَالَت طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ آمِنُواْ بِالَّذِيَ

آخِرَهُ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**72.** ***"And a group of the People of the Book said: 'Believe in what
has been sent down to those who believe, at the opening of the day, and
disbelieve at the end of it, perhaps (by this device) they return (from
Islam)."***

In the explanation of the occasion of revelation of this verse, it is
said as follows.

Once at the time of the Prophet (S), twelve scholars from Jewish people,
in order to create a state of agitation and doubtfulness among the
Muslim believers, decided to come to meet Prophet Muhammad (S) in the
morning and express their belief in Islam, but on the same day in the
evening they would turn their backs to Islam and say that they met
Muhammad (S) but he was not the same as the Torah and Evangel had
explained.

By this skilful plan, they wanted to show off the common people that if
Islam were a good creed and the former religions confirmed it; the
scholars of the People of the Book would not desist from it.

Applying this manner, they could create both doubtfulness among Muslims
and prevent other Jews to embrace Islam. But, by revealing this verse,
the Lord made their plan manifest to all, saying:

***"And a group of the People of the Book said: 'Believe in what has
been sent down to those who believe, at the opening of the day, and
disbelieve at the end of it, perhaps (by this device) they return (from
Islam)."***

### Explanations

1. It is possible that sometimes some individuals penetrate into the
lines of Muslims and stab from behind, so we ought to be aware.

2. Muslims must not be simple-minded and credulous.

3. We must set our faith so firm that the return of several individuals
does not affect our hearts.

4. In the foreign policy, the motive of holding communication, or
ceasing it, is often to bring some special conditions both inside and
outside the country.

5. It usually happens that, in sensitive stages, *Allah* divulges the
secrets and plans of His enemies.

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 73
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلاَ تُؤْمِنُواْ إِلاَّ لِمَن تَبِعَ دِينَكُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ الْهُدَى
هُدَى اللّهِ أَن يُؤْتَى أَحَدٌ مِّثْلَ مَا أُوتِيتُمْ أَوْ
يُحَآجُّوكُمْ عِندَ رَبِّكُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ الْفَضْلَ بِيَدِ اللّهِ
يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَاء وَاللّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**73.** ***"And do not believe save in one who follows your religion.
say: "Verily the (true) guidance is Allah's guidance -that a person may
be given the like of what you have been given; or they would dispute
with you in the presence of your Lord '. Say: 'Verily grace is in the
hand of Allah. He endows it with whom He pleases, and Allah is
All-Embracing, All-Knowing'. "***

The People of the Book had some recommendations to enjoin each other.
Their first recommendation was:

***"And do not believe save in one who follows your religion..."***

The Divine revelation tells the Prophet (S) that in answer to them:

***"... say: "Verily the true guidance is Allah's guidance..."***

That is, the true guidance is not confined to your religion, therefore,
your prejudice is in vain.  
 Their second recommendation was that: never believe:

***"... that a person may be given the like of what you have been
given..."***

Hence, the prophet hood must be in the Children of Israel, not amongst
Arab-

***"... or they would dispute with you in the presence of your Lord '...
"***

So, you have the best logic and never believe that it be with others.
Then, the Lord addresses the Prophet (S) thus:

***"Say: 'Verily grace is in the hand of Allah, He endows it with whom
He pleases..."***

And it is not confined to any race or a particular sect.

***"... and Allah is All-Embracing, All-knowing'."***

### Explanations

1. In their plots, the enemies of Islam recommend to concealment. They
also have no trust to anyone other than themselves.

2. The grace of Allah is not restricted to a particular group.

3. Prejudice is forbidden.

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 74
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَاء وَاللّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

***74.*** ***"He specially chooses for His mercy whom He pleases; and
Allah is the Lord of mighty grace."***

To consider that *Allah* endows His grace and mercy to no sect like that
which He gave to the Jewish sect, is not more than a mere imagination.
*Allah* knows well to whom He gives the charge of prophet hood. He
chooses the most efficient person among his servants and bestows His
special grace upon him, because *Allah's* Grace is vast and His Wisdom
is the elector.

***"He specializes for His mercy whom He pleases, and Allah is the Lord
of Mighty Grace."***

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 75
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">

**75.** ***"And among the People of the Book is he who, if you entrust
him with a heap of wealth, he will return it to you; and among them is
he who, if you entrust him with a dinar, he will not return it to you
unless you keep standing firmly upon him (demanding it). This is because
they say: 'There is not any responsibility upon us for the gentile, and
they tell a lie against Allah while they know (it)."***

The moral values usually resist. Honesty is always good and treachery,
to anyone, is always disgraceful.

***"And among the People of the Book is he who, if you entrust him with
a heap of wealth, he will return it to you;***

The justification of sin is graver than the sin itself.

***"...and among them is he who, if you entrust him with a dinar, he
will not return it to you unless you keep standing firmly upon him
(demanding it). This is because they say: 'There is not any
responsibility upon us for the gentile ..."***

They devoured the wealth of people unlawfully and said *Allah* was
content with it.

***"... and they tell a lie against Allah while they know (it)."***

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 76
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بَلَى مَنْ أَوْفَى بِعَهْدِهِ وَاتَّقَى فَإِنَّ اللّهَ يُحِبُّ

</blockquote>

**76.** ***"Yes, whoever fulfils his promise and guards (against
evil) -then, verily Allah loves the pious ones."***

The command in this verse is: to stand firm and be steadfast before
wrong ideas.  
 By the way, to keep one's word and fulfil the promise with virtue is
the main cause to call the love of *Allah,* not only being the People of
the Book with a bare pretension.

***"Yes, whoever fulfils his promise and guards (against evil) -then,
verily Allah loves the pious ones."***

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 77
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَشْتَرُونَ بِعَهْدِ اللّهِ وَأَيْمَانِهِمْ ثَمَنًا
قَلِيلاً أُوْلَـئِكَ لاَ خَلاَقَ لَهُمْ فِي الآخِرَةِ وَلاَ

</blockquote>

**77.** ***"Verily those who sea Allah's covenant, and their oaths, for
a little price, these! there will be no share for them in the Hereafter,
and Allah will not speak to them, nor will He look towards them on the
Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them grow (by purifying of sin),
and they will have a painful chastisement."***

*Allah* threatens, of course, those who breach their promise to
following five kinds of divine wrath and deprivation from the grace of
*Allah.*

1. The lack of any merit in the Hereafter.

2. The deprivation from the speech of *Allah.*

3. The deprivation from the grace of *Allah.*

4. The deprivation of purity from sin.

5. To be involved in the painful punishment of *Allah.*

***"Verily those who sea Allah's covenant, and their oaths, for a little

Allah will not speak to them, nor will He look towards them on the Day
of Resurrection, nor will He make them grow (by purifying of sin), and
they will have a painful chastisement. "***

In the Islamic literature, it is narrated that the Messenger of *Allah*
*(S)* has said:

*"The person who does not observe trustworthiness, is faithless; and the
person who does not fulfil his promise, has no religion."* [^6]

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 78
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَإِنَّ مِنْهُمْ لَفَرِيقًا يَلْوُونَ أَلْسِنَتَهُم بِالْكِتَابِ
لِتَحْسَبُوهُ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَمَا هُوَ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَيَقُولُونَ
هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ اللّهِ وَمَا هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ اللّهِ وَيَقُولُونَ عَلَى

  </p>
</blockquote>

**78.** ***"And verily among them is a group who twist their tongues
with the Book that you may suppose it to be from the Book, but it is not
from the Book; and they say: 'It is from Allah', while it is not from
Allah; and they speak falsehood against Allah and they know (it)."***

### Occasion of Revelation

This verse was also revealed about a group of the Jewish scholars who
used to write with their own hands some things against what was found in
the Torah about the characteristics of the Messenger of Islam (S) and
said that it was from the Lord. They perverted the facts of the Torah
with their speech.

In this verse, again, the words are about some other wrong actions of a
group of scholars of the People of the Book. It says:

***"And verily among them is a group who twist their tongues with the
Book that you may suppose it to be from the Book, but it is not from the
Book;***

They did not suffice to that action either, but they explicitly said
that it was from the side of the Lord:

***" ...and they say: 'It is from Allah', while it is not from Allah...
"***

Then, the Qur'an emphasizes that this action was not done because of
their mistake, but they knowingly told a lie about *Allah*

***"... and they speak falsehood against Allah and they know (it)."***

By the way, from this verse and its previous verses, the great danger of
the deluded scholars for a community and a nation is made clear.

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 79
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُؤْتِيَهُ اللّهُ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحُكْمَ
وَالنُّبُوَّةَ ثُمَّ يَقُولَ لِلنَّاسِ كُونُواْ عِبَادًا لِّي مِن
دُونِ اللّهِ وَلَـكِن كُونُواْ رَبَّانِيِّينَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ
تُعَلِّمُونَ الْكِتَابَ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**79.** ***" It is not for a human being that Allah should give him the
Book, the judgement and prophet hood, then he should say to people: 'Be
my servants rather than Allah's'; but rather, (he would say): 'Be godly
because of your constant teaching the Book and your constant studying
(it yourselves)."***

### Occasion of Revelation

Upon the occasion of the revelation of this verse and the following one,
it is cited that once a person came to the Prophet of Islam (S) and said
that people greeted him (S) as they did unto others, while they thought
that kind of ordinary greeting was not enough for them to respect him.

The man asked the Prophet (S) to allow people honour him (S) somehow
privileged, and, for example, prostrate before him.

The Prophet (S) said that prostration was not authorized before anybody
other than *Allah.* So, they would respect their prophet only as a human
being, but they ought to know his due and follow him.

This verse continues stating to nullify and improve the vain thoughts of
a group of the People of the Book. It specially reminds the Christians
that never Jesus (as) claimed divinity. It also clearly responds the
request of those who wanted to repeat those kinds of claims about the
Prophet of Islam (S). It says:

***"It is not for a human being that Allah should give him the Book, the
judgement and prophet hood, then he should say to people: 'Be my
servants rather than Allah's'..."***

Neither the Prophet of Islam (S) nor either of other prophets is
rightful to say such a statement. Therefore, the qualities of this kind
attributed to prophets were totally made and finished by some unaware
persons who had been far from the prophets ' trainings.

Then, it adds:

***"... but rather, (he would say): 'Be godly because of your constant
teaching the Book and your constant studying (it yourselves)."***

Yes, the Messengers of *Allah* never exceeded the limits of servitude
and worship and they were always humble before *Allah* more than that
others were.

It is understood from the aforementioned sentence that the aims of
prophets were not only to educate individuals but also to train some
godly, virtuous and learned scholars among the societies who could
enlighten their environments with their knowledge.

Surah 'Ali-Imran, Verse 80
--------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلاَ يَأْمُرَكُمْ أَن تَتَّخِذُواْ الْمَلاَئِكَةَ وَالنِّبِيِّيْنَ
أَرْبَابًا أَيَأْمُرُكُم بِالْكُفْرِ بَعْدَ إِذْ أَنتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ
  </p>
</blockquote>

**80.** ***"And neither would he enjoin you that you should take the
angels and the prophets for lords. What! Would he enjoin you with
infidelity after you have been Muslims? "***

This verse is a complementary meaning to what was said in the previous
verse. It indicates that prophets did not invite people to their
worship, nor invited them to worship angels nor other prophets. It says:

***"And neither would he enjoin you that you should take the angels and
the prophets for lords..."***

This sentence, on one side, is a reply to the Arab pagans who considered
the angels as the daughters of God and believed a kind of divinity for
them, while they introduced themselves among the followers of the
religion of Abraham.

On the other side, it is a respond to Sabians who counted themselves the
followers of John, but promoted the rank of the angels to the extent of
worship.

It is also an answer to the Jews and the Christians who introduced Ezra
and Jesus the son of God.

And, at the end of the verse, the Qur'an says:

***"... What! Would he enjoin you with infidelity after you have been
Muslims?"***

That is, how is it possible that there comes a prophet and begins
inviting people to Faith and monotheism, but afterward he leads them to
the path of polytheism?

By the way, the verse implies the immaculate ness of prophets and that
they did not swerve from the path towards the obedience of *Allah.*
