Lesson Seventy Four: Correct Program For World And Hereafter
============================================================

Imam Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِعْمَلْ لِدُنْياكَ كَأَنَّكَ تَعِيشُ أَبَداً وَ إِعْمَلْ لاِخِرَتِكَ
كَأَنَّك تَمُوتُ غَدَاً
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Work for the world as if you would be alive forever, and work for the
hereafter as if you would die tomorrow! [^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

This tradition clarifies the attitude of Islam towards the matters
concerned with material and spiritual life. A positive and responsible
Muslim should observe discipline in the matters concerned with material
life as if he would abide there forever. This clearly rejects the idea
that one has to shun this world to be a true ascetic.

At the same time he should be extremely concerned about the state of his
readiness for the life after death. So much so that he should be
convinced that if he were to die tomorrow, he would not be found wanting
or deficient in any aspect. In other words, he should keep himself ready
for death at any moment by ensuring that he has purified himself with
the water of real repentance for his misdeeds and has settled his dues
and made arrangements such that he leaves the world without any loose
ends in matters of his obligations and rights of others.
