Nominative Cases of a Verb
==========================

15. When is a verb put into the nominative case?  
 A verb is put into the nominative case if it is not preceded by a
subjunctive or jussive preposition. For example: **یَنزِلُ**
**المَطَرُ** (The rain is falling.)

16. Are vowel signs present at the end of a weak verb?  
 If the last letter of weak verb is an *alif*, the *dummah* is erased
in the nominative case and the *fathah* is erased in the subjunctive
case. But, if the last letter of the weak verb is either a *wāw* or a
*yā'*, the *dummah* is erased in the nominative case because of the
difficulty of pronouncing it.
