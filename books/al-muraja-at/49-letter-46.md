Letter 46
=========

**Muharram 6, 1330**

The three righteous caliphs, may Allah be pleased with them, are,
indeed, the subject of the study and debate; to use such caliphate,
however, to rebut our arguments is totally rejected.

I Believing in the Ancestors does not Require Interpretation
------------------------------------------------------------

1) To believe in those caliphs, as well as in those who swore allegiance
to them, does not require interpreting the arguments. In justifying
their caliphate, you yourselves resort to interpretation, as we will
clarify if necessary.

II Interpretation is Impossible
-------------------------------

2) Interpreting the texts which we have stated to you is impossible; so
is the case with what we have *not* stated yet, such as the Ghadir's
hadith and that of the Will, particularly when backed by irrefutable
traditions which support one another, the latter being sufficient by
themselves to require reference to manifest texts. Whoever acquaints
himself with the latter will find them irrefutable testimonials and
unequivocable verdicts, Wassalam.

Sincerely,

*Sh*
