Farewell to the Month of Ramadan
--------------------------------

The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) prayed: O' God!
Ordain not this month of Ramadan to be the last one for my fasts. But
should you ordain it to be so, then make me blessed and leave me not
deprived (of Your mercy).*Badaabi Az Quran, pg. 398*
