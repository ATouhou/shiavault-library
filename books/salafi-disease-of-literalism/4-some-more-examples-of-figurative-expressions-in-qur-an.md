Some More Examples of Figurative Expressions in Qur'an
======================================================

from our article Can the dead hear?

Allah uses the attribute of Karim for himself. [Yusufali 27:40]......
truly my Lord is Free of all Needs, Supreme in Honour !" Yet Allah in
this same Qur'an also says about his Rasool [saww]: [Yusufali 69:40]
That this is verily the word of an honoured messenger;

Indeed Karim (honoured), when attributed to Allah then it is in it's
literal meaning, and when attributed to Rasool Allah [saww] then it is
in it's figurative/ allegorical meaning. Or do you believe that Allah is
himself committing shirk by attributing his characteristic to others
than him? Qawi is an attribute of Allah, yet the Qur'an testifies that
Rasool Allah [saww] is also Qawi. Allah says about himself in Qur'an:

[Yusufali 22:74] .......... for Allah is He Who is strong and able to
Carry out His Will. And at the same time Qur'an says about Rasool Allah
[saww]:

[Yusufali 81:20] Endued with Power, with rank before the Lord of the
Throne, Is Allah committing here shirk by attributing his Characteristic
to Rasool Allah [saww]? In fact, there are several times that Allah is
be-stowing a mark of honour on his Prophets [as] by attributing some of
his Characteristics for them in Qur'an. For example:

Alim (Knowing): An attribute of Allah, yet Ismail [as] is also
remembered as Alim. Halim (Forbearing): An attribute of Allah, yet
Ibrahim and Ismail [as] are remembered as Halim Shakur (Thankful): An
attribute of Allah, yet Nuh [as] is also remembered as Shakur.

Barr (Devoted): An attribute of Allah, yet Isa and Yahya [as] are
remembered as Barr and many more...

**Conclusion:**

The same Attributes of Allah have been used By Allah for His servants
too. But it doesn't mean that these servants of Allah have become
Shareholders of these Attributes with Allah. They are not the owner, but
only given a part of it by Allah out of his bounty and mercy. The Salafi
cannot simply deny these established proofs from Quran and Sunnah by
using their Conjecture (Qiyyas) only.

When we say Allah is Karim, then it is in Absolute/Real sense. And when
we say that Rasool Allah [saww] is Karim then it is not in Absolute and
Real sense, but we have to do Taweel (Elucidation) that this expression
has been used here in figurative/ allegorical sense.

And if the Salafi are still not ready to accept that there is Majaaz in
Quran which needs Taweel, then they surely make all the Muslims Mushrik,
along with Allah and his beloved Rasool [saww].

Difference between Special and Common Attributes of Allah (swt) In
order to understand what is Tawheed and what is Shirk, it is very
important to understand the difference between Special and Common
Attributes of Allah (swt).

Special attributes are those, which Allah (swt) has only reserved for
Himself. For example "Worship" is reserved for Allah only (for Signs of
Allah i.e. Sha'ir Allah, there is only reverence, but no worship).
Making Shariah is only a work of Allah and no one can make even a small
law at his own. Whole of Surah Ikhlas is full of these special
attributes of Allah (swt):

<p dir="rtl">
بِس'مِ اللهِ الرَّح'منِ الرَّحِيمِ قُل' هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ
</p>

[Yusufali 112:1] Say: He is Allah, the One and Only;

<p dir="rtl">
اللَّهُ الصَّمَدُ
</p>

[Yusufali 112:2] Allah, the Eternal, Absolute;

<p dir="rtl">
لَم' يَلِد' وَلَم' يُولَد'
</p>

[Yusufali 112:3] He begetteth not, nor is He begotten;

<p dir="rtl">
وَلَم' يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ
</p>

[Yusufali 112:4] And there is none like unto Him.

But it is not worshipping Rasool Allah (saww) to say that he is karim

And it is not worshipping Rasool Allah (saww) to say that he enrich us
through his grace (Fadhl)

And it is not worshipping Rasool Allah (saww) to say that he is our
Wali

And it is not worshipping Rasool Allah (saww) to say that he benefit us
through his intercession

And it is not worshipping Rasool Allah (saww) to say that he helps us
by the permission of Allah (swt)..If Salafi don't differentiate between
these Special and Common type of attributes, then surely they are going
to make all of us Mushrikeen along with Allah and his beloved Rasool
(saww).

**Salafiyya vs. Jahmiyya**

The highly praised Alim of Salafi "Abu Muntasir" writes in his famous
booklet "Understanding the Evils of Innovations": "The Jahmiyya were a
group of people, who denied the attributes of Allah using logic and
argumentation, because they thought that would make Allaah similar to a
man!"

But when we look at the behaviour of present day Salafi, it seems that:
"The present day Salafiyya are a group of people, who deny the
attributes of Rasool Allah [saww], because they think that would make
Rasool Allah [saww] similar to Allah!"

And Allah knows the best.
