Objective Compliments and Cognates
==================================

33. What is an objective compliment?  
 An objective compliment is a noun that receives the action of a verb,
but does not change the structure of the verb. For example: **بَرَی**
**التلمیذُ** **قلَماً** (The student sharpened a pencil.) In this
sentence, pencil is the objective compliment because it received the
verb to sharpen and does not affect the structure of the verb. Of
course, if an objective compliment affects the structure of the verb it
is a predicate and must be put in the nominative case.

34. What is a congnate?  
 A congnate is a noun that is mentioned after the verb:  
 • for emphasis: **قَتَلَ** **الحارسُ** **اللّصّ** **قتلاً** (The
watchman murdered the thief a murder.)

• for explanation: **ﺇصبِر** **صبراً** **جمیلاً** (Be patient, a
beautiful patience.)

• for numeration: **دَقّتِ** **الساعةُ** **دَقّتَینِ** (The watch ticked
two ticks.)
