25. Visiting the Graves of Parents 
===================================

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَالَ رَسُولُ اللٌّهُ (ص): مَنْ زَارَ قَبْرَ وَالِدَيهِ أَوْ
أَحَدِهِمَا فِي كُلِّ جُمْعَةٍ مَرَّةً غَفَرَ اللٌّهُ لَهُ وَ كَتَبَ
لَهُ بَارًّا.
  </p>
</blockquote>

It has been narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and
his family) said: “Whoever visits the graves of his parents or one of
them every Friday, Allah shall forgive his sins and shall regard him to
be of those who had been kind to his parents.”
