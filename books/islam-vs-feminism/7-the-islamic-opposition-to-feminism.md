The Islamic Opposition to Feminism
==================================

Although Islam and feminism are not completely without common ground,
the values and principles of Islam and feminism are generally contrary.
Both condemn the oppression of women. Both insist that women may own
their own property and dispose of it as they wish. In theology, both
reject the symbol of 'Father' for God. However, the feminist view that
patriarchy is equivalent to the oppression of women is not compatible
with Islam. The feminist idea that traditional gender roles are to be
eliminated is opposed by the Islamic idea that the primary role of woman
(after that of servant of God) is that of wife and mother.
Theologically, while feminists view the divine as 'Mother and Father\*
or as goddess, Islam considers the parent metaphor inappropriate for
divinity and categorically denies the existence of gods and goddesses.
