Lesson Seventy Five: Effect Of Sin
==================================

Imam As-Sadiq (a.s.) said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَنْ يَمُوتُ بالذُّنُوبِ أَكْثَرُ مِمَّنْ يَمُوتُ بِالآجالِ وَ مَنْ
يَعِيشُ بِالإِحْسانِ أَكْثَرُ مِمَّنْ يَعِيشُ بِالأَعْمارِ
  </p>
</blockquote>

Translation
-----------

Those who die as a result of sin are more than those who die due to
natural death, and those who have a long life as a result of beneficence
are more than those who have a long life due to natural life.[^1]

Brief Description
-----------------

It is proved today that the cause of most physical diseases lies in
spiritual and emotional factors, and one of the most important causes of
mental diseases is the heavy pressures imposed on man’s soul by his
conscience.

A sinner is judged in the court of conscience and suffers painful
spiritual punishments and its reaction is manifested in the body and
soul in the form of diseases and even death. On the contrary, the
beneficent people are encouraged by their conscience and this spiritual
encouragement empowers them and makes them cheerful and increases their
life span. Hence, sin shortens life, and beneficence prolongs it.
