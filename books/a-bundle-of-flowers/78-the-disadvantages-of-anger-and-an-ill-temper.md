============================================

Imam Ridha (‘a) narrated from his father (‘a) from Imam Amir ul
Mu'mineen (‘a) who said that a man once asked the Prophet (S) to teach
him an action to prevent a barrier between him and Paradise.

The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Do not get angry; do not ask people for
things; wish for people whatever you wish for yourself."

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "He who restrains his anger, Allah will cover
his blemishes."

Imam as-Sadiq (‘a) said: "Anger is a destroyer for the heart of a sage;
and he who does not have his anger under his control does not have his
wisdom under his control, either."

Al-Kafi, vol. 2, p. 303
